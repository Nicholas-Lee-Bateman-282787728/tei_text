            County Seats and County Seat Wars in Indiana
            By ERNEST V. SHOCKLEY, PH.D.
            The location of county seats, or "county towns," as they were
                    often called in the early history of the State, has been a fruitful source of
                    trouble. Factions have arisen in these contests which not only disturbed
                    counties but have even figured in State politics. Fortunate indeed is the county
                    which has never had to go through the struggles incident to the removal of a
                    county seat. The Legislature of 1913 witnessed such a struggle in 
                        Jennings county
                     between 
                        Vemon
                     and 
                        North Vernon
                    . 
                        Fountain
                    , 
                        Jackson
                    , 
                        Spencer
                    , 
                        Brown
                     and 
                        Ripley
                     counties are still agitating changes of their county seats.
            The first county seats were located by commissioners selected by the Legislature,
                    and named in the act organizing the county. Subsequent changes were made by
                    legislative acts directly, or by a vote of the people of the county authorized
                    by the Legislature. The first county seats were often at the home of some county
                    official, and in many counties it was a year or more after the county was
                    organized before a town was selected for a county seat and a still longer time
                    before a courthouse was erected. The county commissioners frequently designated
                    the cabin of some settler as the official courthouse until a suitable building
                    could be erected, and in one particular case, 
                        Jasper county
                    , the county seat was at the log cabin of George Spitler for two
                    years, 1838-40.
            The oldest county seat in the State is 
                        Vincennes
                    . It was an old town when the Declaration of Independence was
                    signed. In fact, there is much dispute as to when the town actually was
                    established.  When 
                        Knox county
                     was organized on June 30, 1790 by Winthrop Sargent, the Secretary
                    of the Northwest Territory, 
                        Vincennes
                     became its county seat and it has so remained ever since.1 When Indiana Territory was organized, May 7, 1800, it became the capital of the new Territory, and retained this
                    honor until the capital was removed to Corydon in 1813.
            The second county organized within the present limits of Indiana was Clark. It
                    was organized by a proclamation of Governor William Henry Harrison on February
                    3, 1801, with Springville as its county seat.2 On June 9,
                    1802, Governor Harrison issued a proclamation "fixing the seat of
                    Justice of the county of Clark at the Town of 
                        Jeffersonville
                     in the said county * *
                        * after the first day of August next."3 The territorial Legislature changed it to Charles-town by
                    the act of December 14, 1810, and it remained there until September 23, 1873,
                    when it was permanently located at 
                        Jeffersonville
                    .4 The old courthouse at 
                        Charlestown
                     is still standing and in a good, state of preservation.
            
               
                        Dearborn county
                     was organized by executive proclamation on March 7, 1803 with its
                    seat of justice at 
                        Lawrenceburgh
                    , the courthouse being one half of a double log-cabin belonging to
                    Dr. Jabez Percival, one of the associate judges.5 Rising Sun
                    was ambitious to be the county seat, and wanted to have a new county formed, of
                    which it should be the county seat, if it could not wrest the honor from
                    Lawrenceburgh. This struggle betwen the two towns was finally the cause, of
                    Lawrenceburgh losing the county seat for a few years. On September 26, 1836,
                    Wilmington became the seat of justice, and it was not until April 4, 1844, that
                    it was moved back to Lawrenceburgh in accordance with the act of January 3,
                        1844.6 Out of the fight, 
                        Ohio county
                     was born January 4, 1844, with Rising Sun for its county seat. The
                    Lawrenceburgh courthouse was gutted by fire on the morning of March 6, 1826, and
                    all the records were lost.7 The second courthouse used the
                    same foundation and walls.8

                     This continued in use (with the exception of
                    the eight years that the county seat was at 
                        Wilmington
                    ) until 1870, when it was torn down to make way for the present
                    building.
            The next three counties which were organized–Harrison (1808),
                    Jefferson (1810), and 
                        Franklin
                     (1811)–have never changed their county seats hut retain
                    them at 
                        Corydon
                    , 
                        Madison
                    , and 
                        Brookville
                    , respectively. It is interesting to note that the courthouse at 
                        Corydon
                     was used as the State House from 1813 to 1824. In one of the
                    proposed bills of the 1913 Legislature it was provided that $100,000
                    be paid for this old courthouse, and that it be made a State memorial building.
            
               
                        Wayne county
                     was organized February 1, 1811, with Salisbury as its county seat.
                    By the legislative act of December 21, 1816, it was changed to 
                        Centerville
                    .9 The act was to be effective on and after June
                    1, 1817, and the last meeting of the county commissioners was held at 
                        Salisbury
                     in August, 1817. While the change from 
                        Salisbury
                     to 
                        Centerville
                     caused no little dissension, it is not to be compared to the
                    fifty-year struggle which followed between 
                        Centerville
                     and 
                        Richmond
                    . For more than half a century the location of the 
                        Wayne county
                     seat was not only a question of local politics, but it even played
                    an important part in State politics as well.10 The election
                    of county officials, circuit judges, members of the Legislature, and even
                    governors, was affected by their preference for one town or the other. The
                    struggle was the longest and most bitter county seat fight in the history of the
                    State. The Richmond advocates succeeded in getting several acts passed by the
                    Legislature which furnished them a basis on which to fight for removal. While
                    there were other counties interested in some of these acts, it was 
                        Wayne county
                     which led the fight for their passage. These acts, six in number,
                    are dated as follows: March 2, 1855; December 22, 1858; March 7, 1861; June 4,
                    1861; December 18, 1865 and February 24, 1869. The last Act provided that
                    whenever fifty-five per cent, of the voters of the county petitioned the county
                    commissioners to relocate the county seat, provided suitable grounds, and
                    guaranteed the erection of the proper buildings that the commissioners must
                    relocate the county seat. On June 3, 1872, a petition was drawn up and signed by
                    4937 voters to be presented to the board of commissioners.

                     William A. Peele filed a remonstrance on June
                    5, against such action, setting forth his reasons, and asking for a continuance
                    of the case. A majority of the board refused to continue the case, A. S. Wiggins
                    and William Brooks opposing and O. T. Jones favoring the action of Mr. Peele. On
                    June 11, by the same majority the board decided that, as out of 6,842 legal
                    voters of the county, fifty-five per cent, had asked for the relocation of the
                    county seat, it should be removed to 
                        Richmond
                    . The board thereupon ordered that new county buildings should be
                    erected at 
                        Richmond
                     if the citizens favoring that site, should, within three months
                    after estimates were made, pay into the county treasury a sum equal to the value
                    of the real property belonging to the county of 
                        Centerville
                    . The petitioners immediately accepted the offer of the board.
                    Governor Baker, on October 30, appointed Asabel Stone, William Wallace, and
                    Simon Stansifer to appraise the real estate and improvements belonging to the
                    county in 
                        Centerville
                    . They fixed the appraisement at $80,000, and on November
                    6, 1872, George W. Barnes on behalf of the petitioners for the relocation of the
                    county seat deposited with the board of commissioners the full amount of
                    $80,000 in 
                        Richmond city
                     bonds as security for the appraised value of the 
                        Centerville
                     property. The board promptly accepted the deposit, although Mr.
                    Jones objected. The auditor was then ordered to advertise for bids for the
                    building of a new courthouse and jail. George Hoover was the architect and
                    Thomas W. Roberts got the contract for both buildings with the low bid of
                    $22,700. By August 4, 1873, the buildings were completed and the
                    commissioners ordered that all books, papers, furniture and occupants of the
                    county jail should be removed to 
                        Richmond
                    . August 15, 1873 was the saddest day in the whole history of 
                        Centerville
                    , for on that day the removal was made. Men, women and children wept
                    bitter tears as the last wagon left the town of 
                        Centerville
                     on that eventful evening. They saw their rival of more than half a
                    century finally secure in possession of the coveted county seat. Thus ended the
                    most noted county seat fight of the State; a fight which resulted in bitter
                    feeling which has not entirely disappeared to this day.

                     counties were organized April 1, 1813, the same year the capital of
                    the Territory was moved to Corydon.11 The county seat of
                    Gibson has always been at

                     named in honor of Judge William Prince, who
                    represented the First congressional district in Congress in 1823-25. 
                        Evansville
                     was the first seat of justice of 
                        Warrick county
                    , although it was far from the center of the county. At this time 
                        Warrick
                     embraced practically all of the present counties of 
                        Posey
                    , 
                  Vanderburgh, Spencer
                and 
                        Perry
                    , and a part of 
                        Crawford
                    . No doubt Colonel Hugh McGary's gift of one hundred acres
                    on July 15, 1814 had considerable influence in the selection of 
                        Evansville
                     as the county seat.12 Within three months from
                    the time 
                        Evansville
                     was made the county seat of 
                        Warrick
                    , 
                        Posey county
                     was organized with practically its present limits. This left 
                        Evansville
                     in the extreme southwestern corner of 
                        Warrick
                    , with the result that the Territorial Legislature, September 1,
                    1814, moved the county seat of 
                        Warrick
                     from 
                        Evansville
                     to a site on the Ohio river subsequently
                    called Darlington. Until the courthouse was erected, court was held at private
                    dwellings. On December 4, 1815, the new courthouse at 
                        Darlington
                     was completed at a total cost to the county of $290. The
                    organization of 
                        Vanderburgh
                     and 
                        Spencer
                     counties on February 1, 1818, out of 
                        Warrick
                     left the latter county with nearly its present boundaries.
                    Darlington was in the southeastern corner of 
                        Warrick
                     after 
                        Vanderburgh
                     and 
                        Spencer
                     were cut off from either side of it. The Legislature was called
                    upon to name commissioners to select a more central site. The locating
                    commissioners were named in the act of January 7, 1818, and on March 19, 1818,
                    they decided upon the site now occupied by Boonville, the present county
                        seat.13 The town was called 
                        Boonsville
                     in honor of Ratliff Boon, but the. name has since been changed to 
                        Boonville
                    . 
                        Warrick county
                     has had at least one courthouse fire according to the best
                    accounts. This occurred September 3, 1833. There is also an account of a fire in
                    1818 but it has not been verified.

                        Switzerland
                     counties were organized in 1814, and their county seats, 
                        Salem
                     and 
                        Vevay
                     respectively, have remained unchanged for a hundred years. 
                        Salem
                     has never had its position assailed, but 
                        Vevay
                     has been compelled to defend its honors twice. The Legislature
                    passed acts on two different occasions, which called for an election on the
                    question of relocating the county seat. The first act was passed on January 16,
                        184914 and the second on March

                    the first election has not been ascertained but it is certain that 
                        Vevay
                     did not lose the county seat. The town of Florence was the chief
                    contender in 1853, but it stood little chance of beating 
                        Vevay
                    . The vote was as follows: 
                        Vevay
                    , 903; Florence, 703; Center Square, 179; Log Lick, 8; Mt. Stirling,
                    34; Center of County, 3.16
            
            Posey and Perry were the other two counties organized in 1814, both assuming the
                    full rank of counties on December 1 of that year.16 Posey
                    had three county seat changes within the first ten years of its history, and
                    built a new courthouse at each place. The first location was at 
                        Blackford
                     in the northeastern corner of Marrs township, the town being named
                    after Judge Isaac Blackford, a famous lawyer in Indiana for more than forty
                    years. Here was erected in 1815 one of those log courthouses, typical of the
                    times. The specifications for this building have been taken from the 
                        Posey county
                     records and are given here in full since this description will fit
                    a large number of early Indiana courthouses. "It was to be 26 feet long
                    and 20 feet wide, to be built of logs of a handsome size, hewed down inside and
                    outside, one story and a half high, with one door fronting the street and one
                    window right opposite the door, with six panes of glass, 8x10 inches each. The
                    lower floor to be well laid with plank of puncheon, the upper floor to be laid
                    with plank, with a convenient staircase from the lower. The house to be well
                    covered with clapboard roof, with ribs and weight poles well peeled. One
                    chimney, to be handsomely built of sticks and mortar. The house to be well
                    chinked and daubed, and, also, to be well underpinned. All the timber of the
                    said house to be of some good lasting quality. Also one window, to be cut in the
                    gable end of the upper story finished as the window below; each one to1 be furnished with convenient shutters. All the other parts
                    of the said building to be finished and done in a workmanlike
                        manner."17 This courthouse cost
                    $116.
            
               
                        Blackford
                     was too far from the center of population to be satisfactory, and
                    within a year there was an agitation to remove it to a site closer to Harmonic
                    George Rappe and his colony settled in 
                        Posey county
                     in 1814, the summer the seat of justice was located at

                    . They numbered over a thousand and constituted by far the majority
                    of the residents of the county. The Legislature passed an act, January 1, 1817,
                    providing for commissioners to relocate the county seat.18
                    When they met on the third Monday of February to consider the various sites
                    offered, Frederick Rappe of Harmonie came forward with a proposition to build a
                    courthouse at 
                        Springfield
                     if the Board of Commissioners would but accept it. Rappe wanted the
                    courthouse nearer Harmonie, and since the greater portion of the people lived at 
                        Harmonie
                    , the commissioners decided on May 12 to accept his offer. But 
                        Springfield
                     was an inland town and, apparently, would never become prosperous
                    like the river towns. 
                        Mount Vernon
                     was a rising village, and possessed the overwhelming advantage of
                    being located on the Ohio river. In the early twenties it
                    started an agitation to get the county seat, and with the assistance of an act
                    of the Legislature, February 12, 1825, they succeeded in getting the desired
                        change.19 Today 
                        Springfield
                     is nearly deserted, while fields of waving grain cover what was
                    once the village of 
                        Blackford
                    .
            Perry was the fourth county organized in 1814, and the thirteenth and last county
                    created before the Territory of Indiana applied to Congress for an enabling act.
                    In November of the same year, the commissioners specified in the act creating
                    the county, chose a site on the Ohio river for the new
                    county seat and gave it the classical name of 
                        Troy
                    . In July, 1817, the first session of court met in the new
                    courthouse at 
                        Troy
                    . But 
                        Troy
                    , like her ancient namesake, was destined to fall, and her overthrow
                    was provided for in the act of January 10, 1818, an act providing for the
                    relocation of the county seat of Perry.20
                    
                        Spencer county
                     was created January 10, 1818, and undoubtedly this had something to
                    do with the proposed relocation. The commissioners to relocate the county seat
                    met on the first Monday of March, 1818, and after inspection and deliberation
                    selected the town of Washington for the new county seat. The last session of
                    court at 
                        Troy
                     was held in October, 1818, and it' adjourned to meet at 
                        Washington
                     the following February. By that time Washington had changed its
                    name to 
                        Franklin
                    , but neither of these Revolutionary heroes seemed to satisfy the
                    citizens. Classical

                     antiquity was again called upon, and the new
                    seat of justice appeared on the court records in September, 1819, as 
                        Rome
                    . The name was unfortunate. Just as in ancient times 
                        Rome
                     outlived 
                        Troy
                    , so did the modern 
                        Rome
                     of 
                        Perry county
                     outlive the 
                        Troy
                     of the same county. The day came when the modern 
                        Rome
                     had to fall. Several miles down the 
                        Ohio
                     was the rising town of 
                        Cannelton
                    . In the early fifties the citizens of the latter town began to plan
                    to get the county seat. The legislative act of March 2, 1855 gave the county
                    commissioners the conditional power of moving county seats; before that time,
                    under the 1816 Constitution, a special enactment was necessary, the actual
                    selection being left to a commission of five members created by the
                        legislature.21 A preliminary skirmish was opened in
                    March, 1856, but nothing definite was accomplished. The question was held in
                    abeyance until after the legislative act of December 22, 1858, which act put
                    more power in the way of changing county seats into the hands of the county
                        commissioners.22 Backed by the acts of 1855 and 1858,
                    the citizens advocating the removal of the county seat from 
                        Rome
                     to 
                        Cannelton
                    , again appeared with a petition before the county commissioners. A
                    public spirited coal company of 
                        Cannelton
                     offered to erect a court house if the commissioners would make the
                    change. Satisfactory terms were also made with the citizens of 
                        Rome
                     by the 
                        Cannelton
                     adherents. The offer of a new courthouse was too good to be passed
                    by lightly, and the commissioners finally decided to make the change. The order
                    announcing the removal was entered on their records, March 8, 1859. By December
                    7, 1859, all the county buildings were ready and on that day the removal of all
                    papers, books, and furniture was ordered under the general supervision of W. P.
                    Beacon. But 
                        Cannelton
                     was not always to rest in peace. About two miles down the
                        Ohio river was the thriving Swiss town of 
                        Tell City
                    , and in the nineties there occurred a very curious situation in
                    these two rival towns. 
                        Tell City
                     wanted the county seat, and wanted it so badly that the town
                    actually built a fine public building and offered it to the county for a
                    courthouse if the county seat should be moved to 
                        Tell City
                    . The citizens of 
                        Cannelton
                     were not to be outdone in patriotic devotion to their county, so
                    they likewise built a new courthouse and presented it to the county in order to
                    forestall any action which might lead to the

                     removal of the seat of justice from their
                    town. 
                        Tell City
                     now uses its building for the city hall, and the probability is
                    that it will never be used for the purpose for which a public spirited body of
                    citizens designed it.
            Two counties, 
                        Orange
                     and Jackson, were organized in 1816. Paoli has been the county seat
                    of 
                        Orange
                     from the beginning and, so far as the writer knows, no other town
                    of the county has ever contended for county seat honors. The first county seat
                    of 
                        Jackson county
                     was established at 
                        Vallonia
                     in June, 1816, and the first courts were held in the shade by the
                    old fort in the village. But Vallonia retained her newly gained glory for only a
                    few months, for in November, 1816, the county commissioners decided to establish
                    the seat of justice at 
                        Brownstown
                     where it has since remained, although Seymour has for many years
                    been trying to secure the honor.
            The Legislature of 1816-17 organized four counties: 
                        Jennings
                    , 
                        Pike
                    , 
                        Daviess
                     and 
                        Sullivan
                    . The county seats of 
                        Jennings
                     and 
                        Pike
                     were established at 
                        Vernon
                     and Petersburgh, respectively, and have never been changed.
                    However, the last few years has witnessed a struggle in 
                        Jennings county
                     between 
                        Vernon
                     and 
                        North Vernon
                    , a town a mile and a half to the north, in which the latter has
                    been making strenuous efforts to secure the county seat. The 
                        North Vernon
                     advocates succeeded in getting the last Legislature to pass the act
                    of March 15, 1913, which provided for an election to determine whether the
                    county seat should be moved from 
                        Vernon
                     to 
                        North Vernon
                    .23 The change was to be made if sixty per cent,
                    of the votes were in favor of the proposed relocation.24 The
                    election was held on September 22, 1913 and 
                        Vernon
                     retained the county seat by the slender majority of sixteen, the
                    vote standing 2,217 for relocation and 1,512 against it.25
            
            The first county seat of 
                        Daviess county
                     was located in the present town of Washington, although it was
                    known by the name of Liverpool at the time the location was made. The name was
                    changed to Washington, August 18, 1817.26
            
            
               
                        Carlisle
                     was the first seat of justice of 
                        Sullivan county
                    . From there it was moved to Merom, a town on the Wabash
                        river, in 1819.

                                Vernon
                             furnished data on 
                                Jennings county

                     An effort was made to secure a more central
                    location by the act of January 29, 1830, but the Merom adherents prevented the
                        change.27 The question of removal lay dormant for ten
                    years, but by 1840 the increasing population made it necessary to seek a site
                    nearer the center of the county. On February 15, 1841, the Legislature passed an
                    act which provided for a board of five commissioners to select a new seat of
                    justice as near the center of the county as possible.28 They
                    selected the present site of Sullivan, then an unbroken wilderness, and there
                    laid out the present town. The formal transfer of county records took place in
                    1843. The 
                        Sullivan county
                     courthouse with all the records was destroyed by fire February 6,
                    1850.
            The Legislature of 1817-18 organized nine counties: 
                        Spencer
                    , 
                        Vanderburgh
                    , 
                        Vigo
                    , 
                        Dubois
                    , 
                        Crawford
                    , 
                        Lawrence
                    , 
                        Monroe
                    , 
                        Ripley
                     and. 
                        Randolph
                    . The county seats of 
                        Spencer
                    , 
                        Vanderburgh
                     and 
                        Vigo
                     were established at 
                  Rockport, Evansville
                and 
                        Terre Haute
                    , respectively, where they still remain. 
                        Evansville
                     enjoys the unique distinction of being the only town in the State
                    which has been the county seat of two counties. As has been stated, it was the
                    first county seat of 
                        Warrick county
                    . 
                        Spencer county
                     has an incipient county seat struggle on at the present time. The
                    town of Chrisney on the Southern railroad has the advantage of being near the
                    center of the county and is being seriously considered for the county seat. The
                    courthouse at 
                        Rockport
                     is in very poor condition and when the erection of a new building
                    becomes necessary, there promises to be a struggle between 
                        Rockport
                     and Chrisney.29
            
            Portersville was the first county seat of 
                        Dubois county
                    , but since it was on White river, the northern
                    boundary of the county, it could not hope to retain the honor very long.30 A more central location was desired as the county grew in
                    population, and the Legislature was called upon to solve the difficulty. The
                    first attempt to make the change was based upon the act of January 19, 1829.31 This provided for five commissioners from the surrounding
                    counties, viz: 
                        Spencer
                    , 
                        Orange
                    , 
                        Martin
                    , 
                        Pike
                     and 
                        Daviess
                    . This commission for some reason not found out, failed to
                    accomplish anything and the

                     Legislature was importuned to pass a second
                    act providing for a change. The Legislature replied by passing a second act
                    January 21, 1830, which repealed the act of the year before and named a 
                        Perry county
                     commissioner in place of the 
                        Pike county
                     member.32 A supplementary act was passed nine
                    days later, January 30, 1830, explaining some of the provisions of the act of
                    January 21.33 These commissioners were ordered to meet at 
                        Portersville
                     on the second Monday of August, 1830 and proceed to select a new
                    county seat as near the center of the county as possible. The county was divided
                    into two rival camps, the White river pioneers and the
                        Patoka river settlers. The site at 
                        Jasper
                     was finally selected because it was near water, near the center of
                    the county, and also because a mill had been erected on the Patoka
                        river. The record of the commissioners who selected the site at 
                        Jasper
                     was lost in the fire of August 17, 1839, which completely destroyed
                    the courthouse and all records. It is known that the town of 
                        Jasper
                     was laid out in September, 1830, by Hosea Smith, surveyor of 
                        Pike county
                    . An interesting story concerning the naming of the new town is told
                    by Mr. Wilson. "The commissioners were going to name the new town,
                    ‘Eleanor’ or ‘Elandor,’ in honor of
                    Mrs. Enlow, wife of Joseph Enlow, one of the donors, when that good lady said,
                    ‘No, wait, let me select a name,’ and going for her Bible,
                    she soon returned and suggested the word–and the word was ‘
                        Jasper
                    ,’–and thus the town was named."

            The county seat history of 
                        Crawford county
                     has not been satisfactorily straightened out, owing to the fact
                    that the writer has been unable to get all of the records. The dates given for
                    the various seats of justice are the best obtainable. Upon the organization of
                    the county in 1818, Mount Sterling became the county seat, and it remained so at
                    least until 1822. The Legislature passed an act on December 21, 1821, providing
                    for a change of the county seat from "Mountsterling."35 Just where it was taken or when the change was made, the
                    writer has not been able to find out. It was probably taken to Fredonia, a town
                    on the Ohio river. It is certain that it was at 
                        Fredonia
                     in 1843, for in that year the Legislature passed an

                     act, January 4, providing for its removal
                    from that place.36 Leavenworth became the next county seat
                    and remained so until 1894 when it was removed to English after a notable fight.
            The story of the Leavenworth-English struggle was written up for this article by
                    A. J. Goodman, of English, who was in the midst of the whole fray. The account
                    here given is substantially as related by him, the writer making little change
                    and retaining as much of the picturesque phraseology as possible.
            The final struggle between Leavenworth and English opened in October, 1893. At
                    that time a general council was held at English by the most enterprising
                    citizens of the northern part of the county, at which a committee composed of
                    William F. Richards, William T. Beasley and William T. Carr was chosen to give
                    Leavenworth the fight of their lives. During this year James R. Pro bought the
                    Marengo Observer, moved it to English, and changed its name to
                    the English News. He at once opened up the county seat
                    question and, of course, advocated the immediate removal of the same to English.
            The wise council at their meeting retained Judge Charles Jewett of 
                        New Albany
                    , Judge C. W. Cook and Major W. Funk of Corydon for their legal
                    lights. The committee then appointed petitioners in all the northern townships
                    of the county, and a corps of petitioners at large, consisting of active
                    wide-awake ‘men. This second set of petitioners was not limited to
                    any one district, but its work was mostly in the southern part of the county. It
                    was there that the hard fight was well met by the enemy. The men carrying the
                    petitions were as follows: R. L. and G. W. Sloan, W. W. Temple, T. B. Cummins,
                    M. J. Brown, Dr. C. D. Luckett, H. A. Brown, J. R. Crews, H. J. Brown, William
                    and John Luckett, and others. Each petition held twenty-five names, and when
                    they were filled the men carrying the petition, returned them in person and
                    swore to them before a notary public by the name of A. J. Goodman. Goodman
                    handled every petition and turned them over to J. R. Pro and W. W. Temple, who
                    after carefully inspecting them, returned them to Goodman, who then placed his
                    signature to them and filed them in his office. The petitions were circulated
                    during the month of November, 1893.

            On the first Monday of December, the citizens favoring English formed a skirmish
                    line reaching across the county from: east to west and on that day made a drive
                    for Leavenworth to meet the county commissioners, Amos Adkins, James G. Thurston
                    and A. J. Scott. On this memorable drive through the county they gathered the
                    names of one hundred and eighty petitioners, which gave the English people a
                    handsome majority. On their arrival at 
                        Leavenworth
                     at two o'clock p. m., they entered a motion to file with
                    the first petitions the names of those secured on their rush across the county.
                    Immediately the fight commenced between the lawyers.
            The remonstrators had for their lawyers, Robert J. Tracewell of Corydon, J. L.
                    Suddarth, and John H. Weathers of Leavenworth. The English adherents were
                    represented by Charles Jewett, C. W. Cook and Major W. Funk. The English crowd
                    entered the court room at two o'clock in the afternoon and at half-past
                    four the commissioners granted their petition for the relocation of the county
                    seat. The remonstrators took an appeal from this decision to the 
                        Crawford county
                     circuit court, got a change of venue to the 
                        Harrison county
                     circuit court, and from there to the 
                        Washington county
                     circuit court before Judge Davis, appellate judge. Now followed a
                    contest not to be excelled. The petitioners had a large map of the county made
                    by the county superintendent, Charles Robertson, in which he had located every
                    town, school house, church, and section in the county. The map was placed on the
                    court room floor before the witness chair during the proceedings. This proved a
                    wonderful help to the various witnesses in making their testimony, since it
                    seemed there were many citizens who were not quite sure as to what part of the
                    county they lived in. After three weeks of hard fighting, a decision was
                    rendered in favor of removing the county seat from Leavenworth to English. The
                    latter place had won every fight from the commissioners' court up until
                    the final decision had been made.
            English had now become the county seat by law, and the petitioners felt like it
                    was all settled. A committee commenced to build a courthouse, but the
                    Leavenworth crowd at once filed an injunction which stopped everything. They
                    claimed that the county was so heavily in debt that the building of a new
                    courthouse would completely exhaust the county treasury.
            On Saturday, April 24, 1894, the committee of English citizens  who had the new courthouse in charge had a meeting
                    to decide upon some definite plan of action. At this crisis A. J. Goodman proved
                    to be the man who was to solve the difficulty. He was an old soldier who had
                    served throughout the Civil War in the Fourteenth Army Corps under the command
                    of Gen. Thomas. He had gone through all the campaigns and battles from 
                        Louisville
                     to the sea and is still well drilled and skilled in battle. It took
                    such a man to face the threatening war in 
                        Crawford county
                     in the spring of 1894. At this meeting on April 24, he asked the
                    committee, through R. L. Sloan, to resign, which they did at once. Sloan then
                    moved that the whole matter be entrusted to Goodman, and this being done,
                    Goodman laid a part of his plans before the late committee and then dismissed
                    them. He asked a few of the most active men to stay and consult with him.
                    Goodman confided to the select few that he was going to descend on Leavenworth
                    on the Monday following and get the county records even if it was necessary to
                    resort to actual warfare. On the evening of Saturday, April 24, 1894, the
                    campaign was finally worked out in detail.
            All the saloons in English were ordered closed and no man was able to buy a drink
                    or bottle of intoxicating whiskey until Monday evening. Goodman figured that by
                    that time every county record would be in English where it belonged. The next
                    move was to send out messengers over the county soliciting two-horse wagons,
                    horseback riders, guns, and every man who would join the brigade which was to
                    advance upon Leavenworth. All were ordered to assemble at English on the
                    following day, Sunday, April 25, 1895, at noon. The start was set for one
                    o'clock Monday morning. On Sunday afternoon two-horse wagons, men on
                    horseback, men on foot, and all armed, began to pour into English. The wagons
                    were carefully numbered and parked and each driver given his number. The arms
                    were loaded in the front wagons. Three men, well acquainted with derrick work,
                    were assigned to wagons that had been fitted up with block and tackle for
                    loading the heavy safes. Three sledge hammers were provided and three certain
                    men chosen to handle them. They were not to be used except in case the county
                    officials would not unlock their doors. A few sticks of dynamite were provided
                    in case they might be needed, as it was generally supposed that the Leavenworth
                    contingent would make a fort out of their court house.  Three men were selected to handle the dynamite and
                    one of them was given a nickname on that account which he bears to this day.37
            
            At half-past twelve o'clock on this eventful Monday morning, Goodman
                    ordered his cavalry to mount, and proceeded to drill them for half an hour. At
                    one o'clock the command was given to start and the county seat army was
                    off for the home of the enemy fourteen miles away. At seven o'clock the
                    inhabitants of Leavenworth were given their first view of the invading
                    army–ninety-six two-horse wagons, eighty-two mounted horsemen, and
                    four hundred and seventy-eight infantry. A committee at once waited upon the
                    county officials and were told that the courthouse would be opened at eight
                    o'clock. Promptly at that time the doors were opened and the records
                    were soon loaded by specially delegated men, while the rest of the army kept
                    guard. The loading was done rapidly and quietly, Leavenworth standing aghast at
                    the proceedings, but unable to make a move. The return trip was made without
                    incident, and by five o'clock of this memorable Monday, every wagon and
                    all the army were safe back in English.
            Thus ended the most picturesque county seat fight ever staged in the State. It is
                    interesting to note that the courthouse at English is the only one in the State
                    which was erected outside the limits of the county seat town. It is about half a
                    mile south of the center of the town and was placed there for two reasons. There
                    was a law then in -force that a courthouse could not be relocated within four
                    miles of the county line and as the line between Crawford and 
                        Orange
                     counties was only about four miles from the town, this statute kept
                    the courthouse from the center of the town.38 Another reason
                    for the location outside of the town limits was that the title to the land on
                    which the town of English is built is faulty and it was evident that the new
                    courthouse must be erected on land for which a clear title could be secured. The
                    title to the present site has passed through only one person since the patent
                    was issued by the government.39
            
            Lawrence county has made but one change in county seats. Upon the organization of
                    the county, March 1, 1818, it was placed at 
                        Palestine
                    , the site being chosen on May 21, 1818, on land donated by

                             fight was furnished by Hon. John H. Weathers of 
                                New Albany

                    it to 
                        Bedford
                    .40 It seems there were some property owners at 
                        Palestine
                     who were not certain that the county seat would remain at 
                        Bedford
                    . At least they did not take advantage of the provision in the act
                    of removal which allowed the holders of lots in 
                        Palestine
                     to exchange them for lots in 
                        Bedford
                    . This kind of a provision was frequently put in early legislative
                    acts providing for county seat changes so that no hardships would fall upon
                    those who had invested in property with the understanding that the county seat
                    was to be maintained in the town. An act passed December 26, 1828, again
                    extended to the property holders of Palestine the privilege of exchanging their
                    lots for new lots at 
                        Bedford
                    .41
            
            The other three counties organized in 1818 were 
                  Ripley, Monroe
                and 
                        Randolph
                    . The 
                        Ripley county
                     courts were held at 
                        Marion
                     for the first year, the county seat not being selected until April
                    27, 1818. The place selected was the present site of 
                        Versailles
                     on land donated. by John Paul of 
                        Jefferson county
                    . The first lots were sold on September 21, 1818 and temporary
                    provisions were made for holding the courts in the spring of 1819. A courthouse
                    was not built until 1821. Within the last few years 
                        Osgood
                     has been agitating the question of removing the county seat and
                    when a new courthouse is proposed the change will have to be decided. 
                        Monroe
                     and 
                        Randolph
                     have always maintained their county seats at 
                        Bloomington
                     and Winchester, respectively.
            Three counties were organized in 1819, 
                        Fayette
                    , Owen and Floyd. Connersville has been the county seat of 
                        Fayette county
                     from its creation. Although the county seat of Floyd has always
                    been 
                        New Albany
                    , an act of the legislature, January 10, 1823, shows that there was
                    an early effort to remove it from that place.42 This act
                    provided for commissioners to meet at 
                        New Albany
                     on the first Monday of March, 1823, "to relocate and
                    establish the seat of justice for said county." Whatever action was
                    taken at this time, it is certain that 
                        New Albany
                     was not deprived of her honors.
            The first county seat of Owen was located about half a mile up the river from the
                    present town of 
                        Spencer
                     on 150 acres donated by

                     John Dunn. This place was known as 
                        Lancaster
                     but since a clear title to the site could not be secured a change
                    was soon made. By the act of Dec. 19, 1819, provision was made for a commission
                    to choose a new site. The commissioners selected the present site of 
                        Spencer
                    , the land being donated by Richard Bee m(70½ acres),
                    Isaiah Cooper (21½ acres), Philip Hart (10 acres), and John
                    Bartholomew (30) acres). The locating commissioners, John Tipton, James Ward and
                    Patrick Callan, made their report to the county commissioners on February 12,
                    1820.
            There were only two counties organized by the 1819-20 Legislature, Scott and
                    Martin. 
                        Lexington
                     was the first county seat of Scott and remained so for fifty years,
                    despite several attempts to remove it to a more central location. As early as
                    January 10, 1823,43 the Legislature passed an act providing
                    for commissioners to settle the question of relocation, but they decided in
                    favor of retaining it at 
                        Lexington
                    . It was not until February 12, 1839 that another determined effort
                    was made to secure relocation.44 The legislative act of that
                    date provided for a vote on the first Monday of August, 1839, by the lrgal
                    voters of the couny on the question of removal. Although the vote has not been
                    found, it is certain that 
                        Lexington
                     retained the county seat. But the opponents of 
                        Lexington
                     were determined to get a relocation and succeeded in getting the
                    Legislature to pass a bill the following year, February 13, 1840, providing for
                    a second election, Monday, June 8, 1840.45 Again Lexington
                    won the fight, and for more than thirty years was not molested. However, as the
                    county grew in population it was felt that a more central location should be
                    chosen. The building of a railroad through the county in 1871 made it possible
                    to locate a town on the same which would be more satisfactory in every way for
                    the county seat. To this end a new’ town was laid out, March 27,
                    1871, on the railroad, and named Scottsburg in honor of Thomas Scott, the
                    president of the 
                  Jeffersonville,
                            Madison
                and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad. The town was laid out in response to a petition presented
                    to the board of commissioners on March 10, 1871, asking for the removal of the
                    county seat to this place. The contract for the courthouse and jail

                     was let on March 6, 1873, for $13,500 and the courthouse
                    was ready for occupancy in the latter part of February, 1874.46
            
            Martin county holds the record for the greatest number of county seat changes.47 It seems that the citizens of the county were hard to
                    satisfy. When they failed to change the location of a county seat, they did the
                    next best thing, and changed the name of the town where the county seat was
                    located. No less than three times was the name of the county seat changed. The
                    first town to have the honor was Hindostan, and here the contract for a
                    $4,185 courthouse was let to Benjamin Adams on June 5, 1820. This
                    building was not yet completed when the county seat was changed. Dissatisfaction
                    with Hindostan led to the legislative act of January 24, 1828, which authorized
                    five commissioners, named in the act, to meet at 
                        Hindostan
                    , March 14, 1828, to select a new county seat.48
                    They met at the appointed time and, after due deliberation and consideration,
                    chose Mount Pleasant. This town was about two miles north of Hindostan on the
                    west side of the East Fork of White river. On July 7, 1828,
                    it was ordered that the county clerk and treasurer remove their offices to Mount
                    Pleasant immediately. The board of commissioners met for the first time at the
                    new seat of justice on September 1, 1828. But Mount Pleasant was too far from
                    the center of the county to give general satisfaction, especially, since the
                    county gained rapidly in population in the next fifteen years. The friends of
                    relocation had sufficient influence by 1844 to get the Legislature on January 13
                    of that year to pass an act providing for relocation. The locating commissioners
                    were ordered to meet at 
                        Dougherty
                    's Shoals on the first Monday of March, 1844. They were
                    restricted by the Legislature from selecting any site more than three and
                    one-half miles from the center of the county.49 On March 8,
                    they reported to the 
                        Martin county
                     board of commissioners that they had located the new seat of
                    justice at 
                        Halberts Bluffs
                    , and that land had been donated there for the county seat by
                    Clement Horsey. This third county seat was located at the present site of Shoals
                    on the west side of the river. The site was at once platted by Mason J. Sherman
                    and the plat was recorded Mlay 29, 1844 under the name of 
                        Memphis
                    . For some reason, which has not been ascertained, there was so much

                     dissatisfaction with the new site that the
                    whole town plat was sold back to the donor before the summer was over and before
                    any county buildings were erected. It is not certain that court was ever held at 
                        Memphis
                    ; it is certain that some time during the fall of 1844 the county
                    seat was removed to Harrisonville, near the site of Trinity Springs. Four towns
                    had in turn been the county seat up to this time, and yet the citizens were not
                    satisfied. Again the Legislature was called upon and for the third time passed
                    an act to relocate the 
                        Martin county
                     seat. This act of January 11, 1845 provided for an election to be
                    held the first Monday in March following to settle the question of
                        relocation.50 The result of the election has not been
                    ascertained but it is certain that it was voted to relocate. The legislative act
                    further provided that if a majority should be in favor of relocation, a second
                    election should be held on the first Monday of April, 1845, to select one
                    commissioner from each of the townships in the county to relocate the seat of
                    justice. This second election was held at the appointed time and on May 2, 1845,
                    the commissioners so elected met at 
                        Harrisonville
                    , and reported to the county commissioners that on April 30, 1845
                    they had located the county seat in section 1, township 3 north, range 4 west.
                    The new site was located "within one mile and a half of the
                    geographical center of the county," pursuant to the recommendation of
                    the legislative act. The land for the new seat of justice was donated and
                    immediately platted under the name of Hillsborough. But although the citizens
                    seemed satisfied with the new location, they soon tired of its name, and were
                    not quieted until the legislative act of February 11, 1848 changed it to Dover
                        Hill.51
            
            According to the provision of the legislative act, the county seat was
                    established at 
                        Mount Pleasant
                     while the county buildings were being built at 
                        Hillsborough
                    . The first meeting of the county board of commissioners was held in
                    the new courthouse at 
                        Hillsborough
                     on September 7, 1846. But the end was not yet. Harrisonville had
                    been seriously considered for the county seat several times, and from the best
                    evidence at hand, the seat of justice had been taken there from 
                        Memphis
                     in the fall of 1844, and had remained there until the act of
                    January 11, 1845 ordered it removed to Mount Pleasant pending the erection of
                    the county buildings at 
                        Hillsborough
                    . The Harrisonville

                     advocates had sufficient influence to get
                    the Legislature to pass an act on February 13, 1851 providing for a referendum
                    on the subject.52 The act was not passed without the
                        Dover Hill adherents making a strenuous opposition, the
                    act stating the "remonstrances of sundry other citizens of said county
                    have been presented to the General Assembly remonstrating against the removal of
                    the said county seat." The act left the power of calling the election
                    to the board of commissioners and the record shows that they refused to call the
                    election. For fifteen years the county seat question lay dormant, but the fact
                    that Dover Hill was three miles from a railroad, finally
                    brought its downfall as a county seat. The 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     Railroad was built through the county from east to west in 1856,
                    and as the citizens saw the great advantage of having their county seat on the
                    railroad, an agitation was started to make the sixth change. The legislative
                    acts of March 2, 1855 and December 22, 1858 had left the power of making county
                    seat changes largely in the hands of the county commissioners. These acts
                    provided for a change upon the petition of two-thirds of the citizens of the
                    county. On September 7, 1866, a petition was presented to the commissioners
                    praying for the removal of the county seat from 
                        Dover
                     to 
                        Memphis
                    . 
                        Memphis
                     had been selected as the county seat in 1844, only to lose the
                    honor the same year. Now, however, the new railroad ran through the place, and
                    this fact together with its central location on the East Fork of White
                        river, made it the most desirable site in the county. There must
                    have been some shrewd wire pulling about this time, for a year later, on
                    September 23, 1867, the board of commissioners ordered the county seat
                    moved–not to 
                        Memphis
                    –but to the town of Loogootee, then the largest town by
                    far in the county. It was on the railroad but only two and a half miles from the
                    western line of the county. Evidently a vigorous protest was registered by the
                    rest of the county for the order to move was rescinded before any work had been
                    done toward making the change. Now follows a bitter four-cornered fight, during
                    which at one time an order was issued locating the county seat at 
                        Harrisonville
                    . No action was taken, however, and finally, as a compromise
                    measure, on December 11, 1869, the county seat was located on the west side of
                        White river at 
                        Memphis
                    . Some one suggested changing the name of the town when it was
                    rechartered and the eighth county seat of 
                        Martin county

                     opened for business on July 4, 1871 at the
                    newly christened town of West Shoals. On April 27, 1876 the
                    court house was destroyed by fire, and pending the erection of a new building,
                    the offices were moved across the river to Shoals. A few years ago the
                    boundaries of West Shoals were dissolved and the boundaries of Shoals extended
                    to take in that territory, thus placing the county seat at 
                        Shoals
                    .
            The legislative session of 1820-21, organized four counties: 
                        Union
                    , 
                        Greene
                    , 
                        Parke
                     and 
                        Bartholomew
                    . 
                        Brownsville
                    , located in the northwestern part of the county, was the first
                    county seat of Union, but within a year agitation was started to change it to
                    Liberty in the center of the county. The legislative act of December 21, 1822,
                    furnished the means to relocate the seat of justice.53 The
                    usual five locating commissioners were to meet on the first Monday of March,
                    1823, to consider a new site for the county seat. They finally selected Liberty
                    to bear the honor, and after an exciting struggle the change was made in 1823.
            The five locating commissioners to select the first county seat of 
                        Greene
                    , met on March 10, 1821, and reported to the county commissioners
                    that they had located the future seat of justice on sections 9 and 10, township
                    7 north, range 5 west, and called the new town 
                        Burlington
                    . The land for the county seat was donated by Thomas Bradford,
                    Frederick Shepherd and Zebulon Hague. A courthouse was built at a cost of
                    $250. By 1824 it became evident that 
                        Burlington
                     could not be furnished with water at a reasonable expense, and the
                    attention of the people was called to the question of moving the county seat.
                    Various suggestions were made and the people were called upon to donate a
                    suitable site. Fairplay, a small village on White river
                    about three miles north of the present city of 
                        Bloomfield
                    , put forth its claims very strongly. However, it apparently had no
                    citizens willing to donate sufficient land to influence the commissioners. One
                    Peter C. Van Slyke, a wealthy land owner, in and around the present site of 
                        Bloomfield
                    , made such a liberal donation that his offer was accepted. The
                    ground was immediately surveyed, and the first sale of lots was set for April
                    22, 1824. A log courthouse was built in the summer of 1824, "a hewed
                    log house, 26 by 20 feet, one story and a half high, with one door and one
                    window, with twelve lights in it (8 by 10), in the lower 
                  
                     53
                            Laws of Indiana, 1821-22, p. 10.
               
                     story, with a good poplar plank floor. House
                    to be covered with shingles." The board of justices met at 
                        Burlington
                     for the last time in September 1824 and immediately adjourned to
                    meet in the new courthouse in 
                        Bloomfield
                    . 
                        Burlington
                     gradually dwindled away, until at the present time there is not a
                    vestige of this former seat of justice. 
                        Greene county
                     is fortunate, however, in having two other towns of large
                    population, Worthington and Linton. There has been considerable county seat talk
                    at both places but the recent completion of a fine courthouse at 
                        Bloomfield
                     has stopped all agitation along that line. The citizens of Linton
                    have even gone so far as to advocate the organization of a new county of which
                    Linton should, of course be the county seat. The county would be cut off from 
                        Greene
                     and Sullivan. It hardly seems likely that this will ever be brought
                    about. At the time the present courthouse was built, Worthington put up a
                    strenuous fight and for a time things looked serious, but the storm blew over
                    without any change of the county seat.
            Although the permanent county seat of Parke was located at 
                        Rockville
                     in 1824, considerable difficulty was encountered before this was
                    accomplished. In the act of January 9, 1821 organizing the county, provision was
                    made as usual for commissioners to select the county seat. They were not to meet
                    to make their choice until more than a year later, the third Monday of February,
                    1822. Before that time, in fact before the opening of the Legislature in
                    December, 1821, one of the commissioners, George Ewing of 
                        Knox
                    , left the State, and this necessitated another legislative act to
                    fill this vacancy. The act of December 7, 1821 named Josephus
                    Collett, of 
                        Vigo county
                    , to take Ewings' place.54 This
                    commission was to meet on the second Monday of November, 1822, to select a site
                    for the county seat. Why the selection was not made until a year or more later
                    has not been found out. The first land sales at 
                        Rockville
                     were held in June, 1824. No county buildings were erected until
                    1826, when a log courthouse was erected which served the double purpose of a
                    temple of justice and a house of worship. The difficulty in getting definite
                    data on 
                        Parke county
                     is partly due to the fact that the clerk's office with all
                    its records was burned sometime during 1822. There is evidence that the seat of
                    justice was located temporarily at 
                        Roseville
                     first and at 
                        Armiesburg
                     later between 1821 and 1824.

            The fourth county organized in 1821 was 
                        Bartholomew
                     and the central location of the first county seat selected has
                    never made it necessary to have any change. John Tipton, later 
                        United States
                     Senator from Indiana, figures in an interesting way in the founding
                    of the county seat at 
                        Columbus
                    . 
                        Tipton
                     donated thirty acres for the site and the commissioners, grateful
                    for the generous donation, named the new county seat 
                        Tiptona
                     in honor of 
                        Tipton
                    . This was done on February 15, 1821, but for some reason the
                    commissioners at their next meeting, March 20, rescinded their order of the
                    previous month, and called the new town 
                        Columbus
                    . This was done, according to the most reliable report, on account
                    of 
                        Tipton
                    's political views.
            The Legislature of 1821-22 formed seven new counties out of the New Purchase: 
                        Morgan
                    , 
                        Decatur
                    , 
                        Shelby
                    , 
                        Rush
                    , 
                        Marion
                    , 
                        Putnam
                    , and 
                        Henry
                    . All of these retained their county seats which were selected for
                    them at the organization of the county. Martinsville, the county seat of 
                        Morgan county
                    , was named in honor of James Martin, the senior member of the board
                    of commissioners, selected by the State to choose the site of the seat of
                    justice. Greens-burg, 
                        Decatur county
                    , was named by Mrs. Thomas Hendricks in honor of her old home in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    .55 When the question of naming the new county
                    seat was brought up, Mrs. Hendricks told the commissioners of her desire to have
                    it called 
                        Greensburg
                    . It was proposed to leave the question to a vote of the seventeen
                    young men who came from Pennsylvania to this locality, with Thomas Hendricks.
                    This settled the question, for Mrs. Hendricks had four charming
                    daughters,–and the young men were unmarried.
            
               
                        Greencastle
                    , the county seat of 
                        Putnam county
                    , was so named at the suggestion of Ephriam Dukes, one of the donors
                    of the land on which the new county seat was established, 
                        Greencastle
                    , Pennsylvania, being his native town. The county seats of
                            
                  Shelby, Marion
               , Rush, and Henry have always been at
                            
                  Shelbyville, Indianapolis, Rushville
                and 
                        New Castle
                    , respectively.
            The first courthouse in 
                        Marion county
                     was built on the present site at 
                        Indianapolis
                     with a view of utilizing it as a statehouse until a suitable
                    capital building could be erected. It continued to serve the double purpose of
                    courthouse and statehouse until 1835, when the 
                  
                     55

                                    Bartholomew county
                                
                     , 1888.
               
                     capitol building was completed. It was often
                    used as a public hall and for many years it was frequently used as a house of
                    worship. The first courthouse, built in 1824, was used until 1870, when it was
                    torn down to make way for the present building.
            Four new counties were added by the next Legislature: 
                  Montgomery, Hamilton
               , Johnson and 
                        Madison
                    . The county seats of the first three are retained at the places
                    where they were first established, viz.: 
                  Crawfordsville, Noblesville
                and 
                        Franklin
                    . Two 
                        Johnson county
                     courthouses have burned, the first May 18, 1849, and the second
                    December 12, 1874. Fortunately most of the county records were saved from both
                        fires.56
            
            
               
                        Madison county
                     had a hard time getting its county seat located permanently.
                    Pendleton, the first county seat, was selected in 1823, but it was too far from
                    the center of the country to be satisfactory. Although the permanent county seat
                    was located at 
                        Anderson
                    , it was once located at a town called 
                        Bedford
                     according to the act of January 4, 1827.57 This
                    act gave Ansel Richmond, the county recorder and clerk, the right to keep his
                    office at the house of Nathaniel Richmond until "lots shall have been
                    sold in the town of 
                        Bedford
                    , the seat of justice of said county." This site was
                    evidently chosen as a result of an act of January 13, 1826, but evidence on this
                    point has not been found.58 It seems certain that 
                        Anderson
                    -town was chosen before anything was done at 
                        Bedford
                    . The rapid growth of Andersontown, a town much nearer the center of
                    the county, caused the citizens of the county to apply to the Legislature for an
                    act to relocate the county seat. The change from Pendleton or 
                        Bedford
                     to Andersontown was made as the result of the act of January 4,
                    1827. The new site appears to have been chosen in 1828. A courthouse was not
                    built at 
                        Andersontown
                     until the latter part of 1831. The name of the county seat was
                    changed from Andersontown to Anderson by the legislative act of February 16,
                    1848, as a result of a petition presented to the Legislature by Robert N.

                     counties, organized by the 1823-24 Legislature, have never gone
                    through county seat troubles and their county seats have always been at 
                        Newport
                    , 
                        Fort Wayne

                        Danville
                    , respectively. The courthouse at 
                        Newport
                     has been destroyed by fire on two different occasions, January 24,
                    1844, and January 5, 1866, but no records were destroyed in either fire.
            
               
                        Clay county
                    , organized the succeeding year, has had two county seats and one
                    very disastrous courthouse fire. Bowling Green was-selected in 1825 as the first
                    seat of justice and held the honor for fifty years. At least four towns were
                    laid out in 
                        Clay county
                     for the purpose of making a bid for the county seat. These towns
                    and the dates of their efforts along this line are as follows: Aquilla (1838), 
                        Jonesboro
                     (1838), Bellaire (1852), and Ashboro (1858). Two efforts by
                    legislative acts were made to secure a relocation of the county seat before the
                    seventies. The act of February 13, 1843, provided for an election on the first
                    Monday of August, 1843, to decide the question, but Bowling Green came out
                        victorious.81 On November 30, 1851, the courthouse and
                    all records burned at 
                        Bowling Green
                     and a fight was launched at once to choose a new location for the
                    county seat, Bellaire being the chief contender. By February 23, 1853, the
                    advocates of relocation got an act through the Legislature providing locating
                    commissioners to select a new seat of justice.62 But for the
                    second time Bowling Green came out ahead and at once put up a "fine,
                    substantial courthouse" which cost the county $10,000. In
                    1872 the county seat was ordered removed to 
                        Brazil
                     as a result of a petition on the part of those favoring that town.
                    It was several years before suitable buildings were erected and the formal
                    transfer of records did not take place until January 26, 1877.
            
               
                        Tippecanoe
                     and 
                        Fountain
                     counties were organized in 1826. 
                        Lafayette
                     has been the county seat of 
                        Tippecanoe
                     from the day of organization and no town in the county has ever
                    threatened her supremacy. 
                        Fountain county
                     has not been so fortunate.63 The locating
                    commissioners were to meet on the first Monday in May,

                             furnished the data on 
                                Fountain county
                            .
               
                     1826, to choose the county seat site. They
                    undoubtedly did not meet until later, since their report was not made until July
                    25, 1826. The county commissioners on this day ordered "that the seat
                    of justice of 
                        Fountain county
                     be known and designated by the name of 
                        Covington
                    ." The first courthouse was a frame structure costing
                    $335. Since 
                        Covington
                     was on the Wabash river, which forms the
                    boundary, there was much agitation started in the latter part of the twenties to
                    move the seat to a more central location. This feeling culminated in the
                    legislative act of January 29, 1831, which provided for locating commissioners
                    to investigate the question of relocation.64 Three men,
                    Thomas Brown, Peter Hughes, and Peter Rush, were appointed to value the town
                    lots in 
                        Covington
                    , and make an estimate of how much less value said property would be
                    by the removal of the county seat. In May, 1831, they reported to the county
                    board that their estimate was $9,721. The commissioners appointed by
                    the State reported, to the county commissioners on June 8, 1831, that
                    "they unanimously agreed that the town of 
                        Covington
                     be and remain the permanent seat of justice of said
                    county." A very interesting account of the incidents leading up to the
                    act of January 29, 1831, is given by Mr. Livengood in his letter to the writer.
                    The petitioners favoring relocation in 1829 could not get a sufficient number of
                    living signers so they took the names of the deceased males from the grave
                    stones of the different cemeteries in the county in order to get the required
                    number. The citizens of 
                        Covington
                     got news of this and tried to offset the work of the opposition by
                    adding to their legal list, a long list of soldiers, both living and dead, of
                    the Revolutionary war, Indian wars, and the War of 1812. Both of these padded
                    petitions went to the Legislature of 1830-31, where it was found that the
                    petitions together contained twice as many names as there were residents of the
                    county, men, women, and children. Upon this startling discovery, the Legislature
                    decided to investigate the situation. Hence the act of January 31, 1831, which
                    has been discussed. The next concerted effort to secure relocation in 
                        Fountain county
                     occurred in 1851. On February 14 of that year the Legislature
                    passed a bill which provided for an election on the first Monday of April
                        following.65 Two towns we're to be voted upon, 
                        Covington
                     and Chambersburg. The vote has not

                     been found, but 
                        Covington
                     succeeded in retaining the county seat. In 1870 and 1871
                    Veedersburg tried to get a bill through the Legislature to secure the seat of
                    justice. Since that time Veedersburg has had its eyes on the county seat, and in
                    the 1913 Legislature it had a bill introduced to provide for an election on the
                    question, but the bill was killed in the committee. The bill will be introduced
                    in 1915 again, and, so the Veedersburg people say, they are going to stay in the
                    fight until they get the county seat. Therefore, it seems that all of 
                        Fountain county
                     history is not yet made. A new courthouse was completed in January,
                    1860, and on the evening of the first day of court it burned down leaving only
                    portions of the walls.
            The year 1827 saw 
                        Warren
                     and 
                        Delaware
                     counties added to the rapidly growing State. The first seat of
                    justice of 
                        Warren
                     was located at 
                        Warrentown
                    , two miles up the Wabash river from the
                    present county seat. For some unknown reason, this site proved unsatisfactory,
                    and the Legislature, January 22, 1829, passed an act for the relocation of the
                    county seat.66 The locating commissioners met at 
                        Warrentown
                     on the second Monday of the following June, and in consequence of a
                    liberal donation of land by William Harrison on the present site of 
                        Williamsport
                    , selected that place for the new county seat. 
                        Williamsport
                     has gone through one spirited county seat fight. In 1870 
                        West Lebanon
                     made a determined effort to secure the county seat but the battle
                    was decided against it. The courthouse at 
                        Williamsport
                     burned to the ground on Sunday, January-20, 1907. All the records
                    but those of the commissioners were saved. The county seat of 
                        Delaware county
                     was named after the old Indian chief who lived in that county. It
                    was at first called Munseytown, Muncietown, or 
                        Muncie
                     Town. The legislative act of January 13, 1845, changed the name to 
                        Muncie
                    .67
            
            
               
                        Hancock
                     and 
                        Carroll
                     counties made their appearance in 1828. 
                        Greenfield
                     has been the county seat of 
                        Hancock
                     from the day of its organization. The first county seat of 
                        Carroll county
                     was christened Carrollton on May 15, 1828, but nine days later it
                    was changed to Delphi.68
            
            Cass was the only county organized in 1829. The county seat was fixed at 
                        Logansport

                    , three of the five commissioners named by the legislative act of
                    December 18, 1828.
            Four new counties started their independent careers in 1830: 
                        Clinton
                    , 
                        St. Joseph
                    , 
                        Elkhart
                    , and 
                        Boone
                    . The town of 
                        Jefferson
                    , four miles west of the then future town of 
                        Frankfort
                    , was the temporary county seat of 
                        Clinton
                     from the date of its organization, May 3, 1830, until the proper
                    buildings were erected at 
                        Frankfort
                    . The site of 
                        Frankfort
                     was selected by the State commissioners and the county agent was
                    ordered on May 19, 1830, to have the land surveyed and laid off in lots. The
                    first term of court at 
                        Frankfort
                     convened in April, 1831, in the new log courthouse. 
                        St. Joseph county
                     was organized August 27, 1830, with the county
                    seat located on a farm owned by William Brookfield, a few miles southwest of 
                        South Bend
                     in German township. However, it is known that the first board of
                    justices met at the house of Alexis Coquillard in 
                        South Bend
                     and the courts were also held in his house. In fact, justice for
                    the county was dispensed from his house for several years. Howard in his History of 
                            St. Joseph county
                        
                gives the following account of the muddled county seat
                        situation.89 "Theoretically, however, the
                    county seat was for a time on the farm of William Brookfield, in a town laid out
                    by him at the portage of the 
                        St. Joseph
                    . This town was called 
                        St. Joseph
                    . Though named as the first county seat, it was in fact never more
                    than a town on paper. The location of the county seat at 
                        St. Joseph
                     on May 24, 1830, was made by the commissioners under section three
                    of the act for the formation of 
                        St. Joseph
                     and 
                        Elkhart
                     counties. This action of the commissioners never gave satisfaction
                    to the people of the county. A petition asking for the appointment of other
                    commissioners to relocate the county seat was circulated amongst the settlers,
                    received over one hundred and twenty-five signatures, and was laid before the
                    Legislature that convened at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , December 6, 1830. That body, in an act approved February 1, 1831,
                    granted the prayer of the petitioners."70 The act
                    named five commissioners to relocate the county seat. They made their report to
                    the county commissioners on September 7, 1831, their report
                    being dated May 12, 1831. They selected South

                     Bend, but it was two years before a
                    courthouse was ready for use, and six years before it was finally completed.
            
               
                        Elkhart county
                     also experienced some difficulty in getting its county seat
                    permanently located. The commissioners named in the organizing act of January
                    29, 1830, fixed the new county seat about five miles northwest of the present
                    town of 
                        Goshen
                    , at a town known as Dunlap. The ceding of a half tier of townships
                    on the west side of the county to 
                        St. Joseph county
                     made it necessary to choose a more central location. With the
                    assistance of the legislative act of February 10, 1831, the present site of 
                        Goshen
                     was selected.71 The site was at once surveyed
                    and platted and the first sale of lots took place on June 20, 1831. The first
                    courts in 
                        Boone county
                     were held in 
                        Jamestown
                     at the home of John Galvin, and according to evidence at hand this
                    continued to be the county seat until the removal to 
                        Lebanon
                    . The site was not satisfactory and the Legislature passed the act
                    of January 26, 1832, providing for commissioners to relocate the county seat.72 This commission was ordered to choose a site within two
                    miles of the center of the county. Until the proper buildings were erected at
                    the future county seat the courts were to hold their sessions at the home of
                    John Galvin in 
                        Jamestown
                     and at "such other places in said county, as said courts
                    may think proper." Since the first courthouse at 
                        Lebanon
                     was completed in 1833, it is presumed that the formal transfer was
                    made that year. Evidently the courthouse at 
                        Lebanon
                     was not kept in repair, for an act of the Legislature, January 31,
                    1842, says that the condition of the building was such that the courts were held
                    at a private home from the May term, 1839, to the May term, 1841.73
            
            Grant county was ushered in on April 1, 1831, although the first meeting of the
                    county commissoners was not held until September, 1831. 
                        Marion
                     was selected as the county seat during the summer of 1831 and the
                    first lots were sold on the second Monday of November, 1831. The first
                    courthouse was not erected until three years later.
            The year 1832 saw two new counties start their careers: 
                        Lagrange
                     and Laporte. The first county seat of 
                        Lagrange
                     was located at the site of an old Indian village with the
                    euphonious name 
                  
                     71

                     of Mongoquinong. This was given the name of
                    Lima and remained the county seat for more than ten years. However, the gradual
                    influx of population rendered it necessary to choose a more central location.
                    This was done with the help of the legislative act of February 13, 1840.74 The commissioners named by this act selected"
                    the town of 
                        Lagrange
                    , which had been platted June 18, 1836. The new courthouse was
                    completed December 5, 1843, and the transfer of the records occurred early in
                    the following year. 
                        Laporte county
                     and 
                        Lagrange county
                     started their independent existence on the same day, April 1, 1832.
                    The county seat of Laporte has always been Laporte, although 
                        Michigan City
                     has tried several times to deprive it of its county seat honors.
            The Legislature of 1833-34 organized 
                        Huntington
                    , 
                        Miami
                    , and 
                        White
                     counties. 
                        Huntington county
                     has never experienced any county seat strife, the first choice, the
                    town of 
                        Huntington
                    , has never had a rival for its place. The first county seat of
                    Miami was at 
                        Miamisport
                    , a town laid out in 1828, in the hope that it would be selected for
                    the county seat. It was on the same section of land that is now occupied by
                    Peru, a section originally set aside as a reservation for John B. Richardville,
                    the noted Miami Indian chief. Richardville sold the east half to Wjlliam N. Hood
                    and the western half to Joseph Holman and the two men then laid out Miamisport.
                    Hood and Holman failed to agree and in consequence Hood outbid Holman and
                    secured the location of the county seat east of Miamisport, where Peru now
                    stands. The growth of Peru was such that long since it has taken Miamisport
                    within its limits. It was ordered vacated in June, 1841. The first courthouse, a
                    brick building forty feet square, was burned down March 16, 1843, destroying all
                    the county records but those of the county commissioners. The Legislature helped
                    to straighten out the situation with the act of December 26, 1843.75
            
            White county was to be organized April 1, 1834, but the first county
                    commissioners did not meet until July 19, 1834. The commissioners selected by
                    the Legislature to choose the future county seat made their first report
                    September 5, 1834. They chose the present site of 
                        Monticello
                     and left evidence of their political faith in the name which they
                    gave to the new seat of justice.

                        Wabash county
                     was the seventieth and only county organized in 1835. The
                    commissioners named in the legislative act to locate the county seat met May 18,
                    1835. The next day they selected the site of the present town of 
                        Wabash
                     and the day following they made their report to the county
                    commissioners. The first courthouse was a brick structure forty feet square,
                    costing $3,000. It was finished in 1839 and continued in use until
                    June 17, 1871, when it was destroyed by fire.76
            
            The Legislature of 1835-36 organized eight counties: 
                        Porter
                    , 
                        Adams
                    , 
                        Jay
                    , 
                        Noble
                    , 
                        Fulton
                    , 
                        Marshall
                    , 
                        Brown
                    , and 
                        Kosciusko
                    . The county seat of 
                        Porter
                     has always been at 
                        Valparaiso
                    , although the first plat, dated July 7, 1836, bears the name of
                    Portersville. The locating commissioners made their selection of Portersville on
                    June 7, 1836, and filed a written report to that effect with the county
                    commissioners on June 9.77 They considered three others
                    sites before finally settling upon Portersville. One of these was at 
                        Prattville
                    , another at Flint Lake, and the third about a
                    mile and a half northwest of the present site of 
                        Valparaiso
                    . The name of the county seat was changed to 
                        Valparaiso
                     within the first year and it seems to have been done by the local
                    authorities, since no legislative act has been found authorizing the change. 
                        Adams county
                     has always been satisfied with 
                        Decatur
                    , its first county seat. The site was offered to the locating
                    commissioners by Samuel Johnson, who offered as an inducement to have the seat
                    of justice located on his land, the sum of $3,100, four church lots,
                    half an acre for a public square, one acre for a seminary and two acres for a
                    cemetery. He further agreed to pay the expenses of the locating commissioners,
                    and furnish a house to hold court in until suitable buildings could be erected.
                    This was too tempting an offer to be refused and the commissioners promptly
                    accepted the offer "and proceeded to the aforesaid town site, and
                    marked a white oak tree with blazes on four sides, on each of which they
                    individually inscribed their names."78 Jay county
                    has never had any county seat conflicts since the first year of its existence.
                    In 1835 and 1836 there was rivalry between Camden and the site of the present
                    town of 
                        Portland
                    , Camden being the more important place at that time. The locating
                    commissioners looked with favor on

                     Camden but it was too far from the center of
                    the county to receive serious consideration. The commissioners met on the first
                    Monday in June, 1836, and soon decided upon the site at 
                        Portland
                    . A special meeting of the county board of commissioners on December
                    5, 1836, gave the new county seat the name of 
                        Portland
                    . A fine log courthouse was erected in the summer of 1837 for the
                    sum of $123.25. 
                        Noble county
                     has had its full share of trouble in the matter of county seats.79 This has been due to the swampy character of the county
                    and the slow migration of settlers. The locating commissioners named in the
                    organization act of February 6, 1836, made their report on May 3, 1836. They
                    chose a site in 
                        Sparta
                     township on the old 
                        Fort Wayne
                     and 
                        Goshen
                     trail in section 24, township 34 north, range 8 east. The town was
                    given the classical name of Sparta (now called Kimmell), but it was not destined
                    to retain its honors very long. No public buildings were ever erected there. Its
                    location in the western part of the county and the desire for a more central
                    location led the citizens to petition the legislature for an act authorizing the
                    removal of the county seat to a more central location. The Legislature granted
                    their petition and passed an act February 4, 1837, naming five commissioners to
                    relocate the seat of justice.80 They met on July 3, 1837, at
                    the house of Patrick C. Miller at Wolf Lake, and proceeded
                    to examine the different sites offered. Several new towns had been laid out and
                    all were anxious to secured the coveted honor. Sparta, of course, wanted to be
                    again considered; Van Buren, in 
                        York
                     township, was an aspirant; Wolf Lake, the first town laid out in
                    the county, was another; and 
                        Augusta
                     and 
                        Port Mitchell
                     also had followers. Each offered inducements to secure the coveted
                    location. After looking them all over, the commissioners finally selected
                    Augusta, two miles west of the present town of Albion. This location seemed to
                    give general satisfaction because of its central location, and a courthouse and
                    jail were immediately built there. Until the buildings should be erected at the
                    new location, the Legislature ordered all courts to be held at Wolf
                        Lake. There is but little doubt that the county seat would have
                    remained at 
                        Augusta
                     had not the courthouse been destroyed by fire on March 25, 1843.
                    The records of the auditor, clerk, and treasurer were burned and this has
                    rendered it very difficult to write an

                     authentic history of the beginnings of the
                    county. At this juncture 
                        Port Mitchell
                     made a determined effort to secure a legislative act authorizing a
                    relocation of the county seat. The Legislature was acquiescent and the bill was
                    passed January 13, 1844, providing for a commission to relocate the troublesome
                    seat of justice.81
                    
                        Port Mitchell
                     must have had some very influential citizens since they succeeded
                    in convincing the locating commissioners that they had the best site. The first
                    Monday in March, 1844, was a day of rejoicing in 
                        Port Mitchell
                    , for on that day the commissioners selected their town as the
                    future county seat. Visions of their coming greatness floated before them. Brick
                    buildings arose, a courthouse was erected, and the town boomed with industry.
                    But their joy was short lived. Just two years later, January 10, 1846, the
                    Legislature was induced to pass a bill providing for a vote on the relocation of
                    the county seat.82 The act provided for an election on the
                    first Monday of April, 1846, at which the voters should write on their ballots
                    the name of the place where they wished the county seat to be located. Then a
                    second election was to be held on the first Monday of June, at which the names
                    of the three receiving the highest number of votes in the April election were to
                    be voted on. A third and deciding vote was to be taken on the first Monday of
                    August, at which the two places receiving the highest number of votes in the
                    June election were to be voted on. 
                        Noble county
                     probably never had a more exciting summer than that of 1846.
                    Speeches were made, special songs were composed, and even parades 'were
                    added to the campaign. At the April election votes were cast for 
                        Port Mitchell
                    , 
                        Augusta
                    , Center, 
                        Rochester
                    , 
                        Ligonier
                    , 
                        Springfield
                    , 
                        Lisbon
                    , North-port and Wolf
                    Lake. The three highest were 
                        Port Mitchell
                    , 
                        Augusta
                     and Center. At the June election Center led the field and 
                        Port Mitchell
                     beat 
                        Augusta
                     by two votes. The whole county now lined up behind one or the other
                    of the two towns. Augusta, indignant at what it called unfair tactics on the
                    part of 
                        Port Mitchell
                     in the previous election, threw its strength to Center, with the
                    result that Center won the county seat. The name of the new county seat was
                    changed from Center to Albion within the first year of its official career. On
                    September 16, 1847, the formal transfer of records and offices was made to
                    Albion. Here the county seat has remained, although several

                     efforts have been made to remove it and, so
                    some people in the county say, one courthouse has been sacrificed in the
                    struggle. The courthouse at 
                        Albion
                     was burned down January 24, 1859, and the circumstances surrounding
                    the catastrophe seemed to indicate that it was the work of incendiaries.83 A new courthouse was ordered immediately and was ready
                    for occupancy in 1861. The construction of the 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     railroad through Albion in 1874 has probably settled the question
                    of any further changes.
            
               
                        Fulton county
                     was organized in the spring of 1836. 
                        Fulton
                     has never had any trouble over county seats. The locating
                    commissioners met on the second Monday of June. 1836, and, after examining
                    several places, determined to establish the county seat at 
                        Rochester
                    . There was some effort to secure the location at the crossing of
                    the 
                        Michigan
                     road and the Tippecanoe river. Marshall and 
                        Brown
                     counties both started their career on April 1, 1836. 
                        Plymouth
                     has been the county seat of Marshall from the beginning. 
                        Brown county
                    's seat of justice was first called Jacksonbung, but for
                    some reason was changed to 
                        Nashville
                     during the first year of its career. The original log jail, built
                    in 1837, is still in use, and is the last log jail in the State doing service.
                    While this article is being prepared the newspapers are noting an agitation to
                    move the county seat from 
                        Nashville
                     to Helmsburg, which is the only railroad town in the county.84 The business men of Helmsburg have been advocating the
                    change for some time, and will undoubtedly be prepared with a bill to present to
                    the next session of the Legislature.
            
               
                        Warsaw
                     was chosen as the first county seat of 
                        Kosciusko county
                    , although the courts were held at 
                        Leesburg
                     in 1836, and the latter place for several years was the most
                    populous of the two. 
                        Leesburg
                     was the only other place considered when the commissioners made
                    their selection in 1836.
            Four new counties were created by the Legislature of 1836-37: 
                        Lake
                    , 
                        Steuben
                    , 
                        DeKalb
                    , and 
                        Wells
                    . Lake had more trouble in getting its county seat established than
                    the three other counties combined. Although the locating commissioners were
                    named in the act of January 18, 1837,85 which organized the
                    county, nothing had been done until February 17, 1838.86 On

                     Legislature passed an act establishing a
                    temporary courthouse at the residence of Milo Robinson. The act says,
                    "Whereas, nearly all the lands within the limits of the county of Lake
                    are yet the property of the General Government," it is
                    "impossible at present to make a permanent location of a seat of
                    justice." For this reason the residence of Robinson was
                    "recognized and established the courthouse and the seat of justice of
                    said county." On the same day the Legislature passed another bill
                    selecting two new men on the locating board of commissioners to take the places
                    of two named in the act organizing the county. One man had died and the other
                    refused to serve. This reorganized board, however, did nothing toward locating
                    the county seat, and the next Legislature passed an act, February 14, 1839,
                    creating a new set of commissioners with discretionary authority to locate the
                    seat of justice.87 They were to meet at Robinson's
                    courthouse on the first Monday of May. 1839, and proceed to examine all proposed
                    sites. There were three locations offered. The first site, "
                        Lake County
                     Court House," usually written as "Lake C.
                    H.," Cedar Lake and Liverpool. Liverpool was the successful bidder, but
                    the site was not satisfactory to a majority of the citizens. For the third time
                    the Legislature was appealed to. and the third set of locating commissioners was
                    named in the act of February 13, 1840.88 The commissioners
                    rode into the county in June, looked over the ground, canvassed the claims and
                    offers of the various sites and finally settled on the site of the original
                    courthouse of Robinson, "
                        Lake County
                     Court House." This name was admitted to be a little too
                    cumbersome and it was suggested that the county agent, George Earle, and the two
                    proprietors, Judge Clark and Solon Robinson, get together and select a new name.
                    They agreed on 
                        Crown Point
                     and the county seat has ever since borne that name.89
            
            
               
                        Steuben county
                     had all of its county seat trouble before the first site was
                    selected. The locating commissioners named in the act of January 18, 1837, were
                    ordered to meet "at or near the center of said county on the third
                    Monday of January, 1838," at the house of Cornelius Gilmore.90 Two sites were offered for their consideration, the
                    present site of 
                        Angola
                     and Steubenville. The Steubenville

                     advocates, led by Isaac Glover and Abner
                    Winsor, offered to donate $16,200, but their site was too far from
                    the center of the county to receive serious consideration. The Steubenville of
                    1837 was not the same town as the town of that name at the present time. The
                    first Steubenville was north of Pleasant Lake in range 13, township 36, near the
                    line between sections 10 and 15. 
                        Angola
                    's claims were presented by Cornelius Gilmore and Thomas
                    Gale, and their offer to give a site for the courthouse and erect the building,
                    was accepted. The central location has proved entirely satisfactory and no other
                    town in the county has ever been considered as the seat of justice.
            Dekalb and Wells counties were started on their independent career on May 1,
                    1837, and their first county seats, 
                        Auburn
                     and Blufifton, respectively, have never been changed. A disastrous
                    fire in 
                        Auburn
                     on Saturday, February 8, 1913, destroyed the W. H. Mc-Intyre three
                    story brick building in which part of the county records were temporarily
                    placed. Pending the erection of a new courthouse the various county officials
                    had their offices scattered around the square and all the records of the clerk
                    were lost in this fire. Wells, however, required the Legislature to pass a
                    second act providing for a set of locating commissioners. The first board,
                    selected by the act of February 2, 1837, neglected to act, and a new board was
                    named in the act of January 20, 1838.91 The new board met in
                    March of that year and selected the present site of Blufifton. There were two
                    sites offered, Bluffton and a town called Murray, later known as 
                        New Lancaster
                    . Murray offered the best inducements, but the Bluffton adherents
                    carried the day by adding a cash gift of $270 to the land offer.
                    This, in case of the acceptance of the bid, would furnish a fund for the payment
                    of the commissioners: whereas, if no cash was forthcoming, they must content
                    themselves wtih county orders, then below par. They probably needed the money,
                    and this cash offer undoubtedly turned the scale in favor of Bluffton.
            
               
                        Jasper
                     and 
                        Whitley
                     counties were added to the rapidly growing State by the Legislature
                    of 1837-38. 
                        Jasper
                     has had its county seats scattered over more territory than any
                    county in the State. It started as a separate county March 15, 1838, and
                    included not only its present territory but the present county of Newton, and
                    most of Benton as well. The first county seat was located at 
                        Parish Grove
                    , thirty miles south of the present seat of justice, and five miles

                     southwest of Fowler, the county seat of 
                        Benton county
                    . This was chosen because it was near the center of the population
                    and for the additional reason that it was one of the few high and dry spots in
                    the county. Here the county commissioners held their first session in 1838. At
                    this meeting they considered the question of changing the site of the temporary
                    county seat to the cabin of George W. Spitler in what is now Iroquois township, 
                        Newton county
                    , if the residents of Pine township (now Parish Grove township, 
                        Benton county
                    ), were in favor of the change. A petition was ordered circulated in
                    order to get the opinion of the Pine township citizens, and the result showed
                    sixteen in favor and eight against the proposed removal. The change was largely
                    brought about because Spitler had been elected county clerk and he refused to
                    serve unless the place of business was brought nearer to his residence. The
                    county commissioners held their March, 1839, meeting at the home of Spitler, the
                    new temporary -county seat. This temporary arrangement was upset by the
                    legislative act of January 29, 1839, which named commissioners from 
                        White
                    , 
                        Fountain
                    , 
                        Warren
                    , and 
                        Tippecanoe
                     counties to meet in 
                        Jasper county
                     on the first Monday of June, 1839, to examine the counties of 
                        Jasper
                     and Newton to see whether they should be consolidated.92 If they considered it the best thing for the two counties
                    they were to select a county seat for the enlarged county. Furthermore the new
                    county was to be called 
                        Jasper
                     and the county seat Newton. The State commissioners met in June,
                    1839, and decided that the best interests of the two counties demanded
                    consolidation. They selected the present site of 
                        Rensselaer
                     for the county seat although it was called Newton in accordance
                    with the legislative act providing for its location. The original plat of the
                    newly chosen county seat was filed June 12, 1839. The early history of the
                    county is hard to straighten out owing to two destructive fires in the
                    courthouse. The first occurred in 1843 and destroyed practically all the
                    records. The second happened in 1864, and was generally supposed to have been
                    the work of an incendiary who was interested in the destruction of the records.
                    The whole interior and roof of the building was burned and all the papers and
                    records of the county were destroyed except a few which could be saved from the
                        outside.93

                        Whitley county
                     dates its independent career from April 1, 1838. In June of the
                    same year the first county seat was fixed by the State commissioners on section
                    19, township 31 north, range 9 east, upon the land owned by L. S. Bayless at the
                    time. As a consideration Bayless was to pay the county $500 in money,
                    furnish a set of record books, which would cost about $100, and pay
                    all the expenses of location. This site did not give satisfaction and a petition
                    was sent to the next Legislature asking for a new location. The Legislature
                    granted their prayer and in the act of February 18, 1839, named five
                    commissioners to relocate the county seat.94 Only two of
                    them appeared at the appointed time in June and an adjournment was taken until
                    October 19, 1839. On that date they all met and after carefully considering all
                    sites offered, decided to locate the county seat on fractional section 11,
                    township 31 north, range 9 east, on land owned by Elihu Chauncey of 
                        Philadelphia
                    . He was to donate 222½ acres and build a saw mill on the
                    land. There was not a white family living within one mile and a half of the site
                    at the time, but' its central location had been the determining factor
                    in making the choice. The new town was first called 
                        Columbia
                     and later changed to 
                        Columbia city
                    .
            
               
                        Blackford
                     and 
                        Pulaski
                     counties made their appearance in the spring of 1839. 
                        Blackford
                     was cut off from 
                        Jay county
                    , the latter county willingly relinquishing the territory because,
                    as one old settler of Jay county said, "It was nothing but a big swamp
                    anyhow." This may account for the trouble the new county experienced in
                    getting its county seat located. In fact it took two separate acts of the
                    Legislature to get the county itself on the map. The first act of February 15,
                    1838, intended that it should be ready to open for business on the first Monday
                    of April, 1838.95 Commissioners were named to locate the
                    county seat, but nothing seems to have been done, for the next year the
                    Legislature started the county agitation again with the act of January 29,
                        1839.96 A new set of commissioners was named to locate
                    the county seat, and they were ordered to do so on the second Monday of the next
                    month. When this second commission reported, and what site they selected, has
                    not been found out, but it must have been unsatisfactory, for the following

                     year the Legislature, on February 24, 1840,
                    appointed the third set of State commissioners to locate the county seat.97 However, it was provided in the act that it should not
                    take effect "unless a majority of the legal voters of 
                        Blackford county
                    , on the first Monday in August next, shall vote for a relocation of
                    the said county seat of 
                        Blackford county
                    ." It is very evident that the friends of relocation lost
                    out because the following year the Legislature was importuned for the fourth
                    time to pass an act providing for the location of a county seat. The fourth set
                    of commissioners was appointed by the act of February 4, 1841, but it does not
                    appear to have changed the former location.98 It seems
                    certain that the second set of locating commissioners selected the present site
                    of 
                        Hartford City
                    . The town was at first called Hartford, and later changed to 
                        Hartford City
                     at the suggestion of F. L. Shelton.90
            
            
               
                        Pulaski county
                     has always been satisfied with the first county seat selected by
                    the State commissioners. They met on May 6, 1839, and after considering various
                    locations accepted the offer of John Pearson, William Polk, Jesse Jackson, John
                    Brown, John B. Niles and others, and located the county seat at 
                        Winamac
                    . on the Tippecanoe river. The town was named
                    in honor of Winamac, a noted chief of the Pottawattomies, who lived at this
                    place.
            The year of 1840 ushered in 
                        Benton county
                    , its birthday falling on February 18 of that year.100 The act organizing the county, February 18, 1840, did not for some
                    reason name commissioners to locate a county seat. The courts were ordered to
                    meet at the house of Basil Justus. His home was a short distance south of the
                    present town of 
                        Oxford
                    , and here the courts were held for the first three years. The
                    county was gradually settled up and on January 31, 1843, the Legislature named
                    commissioners to locate a county seat.101 The act ordered
                    them to meet on the third Monday of May, 1843, at the house of Basil Justus.
                    They chose a site on section 18, township 34 north, range 7 west, on land
                    donated by Henry W. Ellsworth and David Watkinson. In September, 1843, the
                    county commissioners ordered a courthouse erected at the new

                    already another town of that name in the State, the board of commissioners at
                    the October session of 1843 "ordered that the seat of justice in 
                        Benton county
                     be called 
                        Oxford
                    ."102 The entry in the order book
                    shows, however, that in entering this order, the name had first been written
                    Hartford, and that at a subsequent time, and with ink of a different color from
                    that in which the first order was made, the name Hartford had been marked out,
                    and the name 
                        Oxford
                     inserted. Just when this change was made has not been ascertained.
                    Thirty years were to elapse before the bitter 
                        Oxford
                    -Fowler county seat fight formally opened. Fowler had been laid out
                    in 1871 for the ostensible purpose of making a bid for the county seat. It was,
                    of course, a mistake to put the first county seat as far south as 
                        Oxford
                    , the town being three miles from the southern boundary of the
                    county. At the time it was chosen nearly the whole population was in the
                    southern part of the county, but by 1873 the county was well settled, and there
                    was a demand for a more central location. The immediate cause of the opening of
                    hostilities was the condemnation of the courthouse at 
                        Oxford
                    . An expert architect reported on March 20, 1873, that the building
                    was beyond repair, and at once the Fowler people planned a campaign to secure
                    the county seat. They saw that if a new courthouse should be built at 
                        Oxford
                     that they would have to wait for many years before another
                    opportunity presented itself. Accordingly, they opened a vigorous fight which
                    was marked by injunctions, law suits, mandamuses, and petitions and counter
                    petitions. The commissioners first ordered the new courthouse built at 
                        Oxford
                     but when the smoke of battle cleared away, it was seen quietly
                    resting in the town of Fowler. The formal transfer appears to have been made on
                    July 10, 1874. Thus ended a fight which left a bitter feeling between the two
                    rival towns which has not yet died down.103

                        Richardville
                     counties were organized in 1844, which brought the total number of
                    counties up to ninety. 
                        Ohio county
                     owes its existence to a county seat fight. The origin of 
                        Ohio county
                     has been noticed in the discussion of the county seat fight in 
                        Dearborn county
                    . There is no doubt but that 
                        Ohio county
                     was the

                     result of the three cornered struggle
                    between Lawrenceburgh, Wilmington and Rising Sun for the county seat of 
                        Dearborn county
                    . Rising Sun, of course, became the county seat of the new county
                    upon its organization.
            
               
                        Tipton
                     and 
                        Richardville
                     counties, organized largely out of the old Miami Reserve, were
                    formally organized on May 1, 1844. The first named county conferred a double
                    honor on John Tipton, having both itself and its county seat named after him. 
                        Tipton
                     has been the county seat from the first and has had but one
                    incident in its whole career to cause it any trouble. This occurred in January,
                    1858, when the old log courthouse, the first one built, was totally destroyed by
                    fire. It is supposed that the desire of the citizens for a new building fully
                    accounts for the conflagration.
            Richardville county was nearly all within the old Miami Reserve, and this fact,
                    together with a deference not usually shown, led the Legislature to name the new
                    county in honor of Richardville, a Miami chief, and successor of
                    Little' Turtle. This fine sentiment toward the Indian soon disappeared,
                    and the Legislature was called upon to rename the county. On December 28, 1846,
                    the Legislature passed its first and only act changing the name of a county in
                        Indiana.104 The county was rechristened Howard, in honor
                    of Tilghman A. Howard, a noted Indiana statesman of that time.
            Starke was next to the last county organized in the State. It was cut off from 
                        Marshall county
                     and started its independent career on January IS, 1850.105 The locating commissioners established the county seat
                    on April 1, 1850, at the present site of 
                        Knox
                    . There was no town there at the time, but the site was chosen
                    because of its central location.
            The ninety-second and last county in Indiana made its formal debut December 9,
                    1859. It had been organized in 1839 but the next year it was consolidated with 
                        Jasper
                     and continued as a part of that county for the next twenty years.
                    There was a struggle of three years to get the county started.106 In 1857 it became known that there was an effort being made to form a
                    new county out of 
                        Jasper
                     with a county seat on the Kankakee river. The
                    citizens of 
                        Jasper county
                     living west of range 7 at once called a meeting
                    at

                            1912, p. 56 seq.
               
                    
                    
                        Morocco
                     and resolved to petition the commissioners of 
                        Jasper county
                     to set off a new county to be known as Beaver. Afterward, but at
                    the same meeting, the name was changed to Newton. The petition as presented at
                    the September meeting of the commissioners carried the name of nearly every
                    voter of the western half of 
                        Jasper
                    . The citizens of the other half of 
                        Jasper
                     protested against the division of the county and two days later the
                    petition was dismissed on the ground that some of the names had been attached to
                    the petition before the law authorizing a division had taken place. But the
                    citizens of the proposed county were not to be denied. Within twenty-four hours
                    horsemen were dispatched throughout the proposed county with the result that a
                    second petition was ready to lay before the commissioners representing an
                    overwhelming majority of the citizens. Although the board had adjourned to meet
                    in the morning, the petition was ready to be handed in, the commissioners heard
                    of the desperate efforts of the citizens of the western half of the county and
                    failed to show up. Nothing was done now until the December meeting when the
                    Kankakee people presented a counter petition to organize a county with a county
                    seat on the Kankakee. Their petition was dismissed and the 
                        Newton county
                     petition granted. An appeal was taken to the circuit court, then to
                    the supreme court, where the 
                        Newton county
                     citizens were sustained. This decision was handed down in November,
                    1859, and on December 8, 1859, the commissioners of 
                        Jasper county
                     made the final order on their records defining the boundaries of
                    the new county. 
                        Kent
                    , a town two miles from the southern line of the county, was made
                    the county seat. 
                        Morocco
                    , 
                        Brook
                    , 
                        Beaver City
                    , and a point about three miles east of 
                        Morocco
                     were also considered by the commissioners. Since 1860 there have
                    been nine efforts to locate the county seat at a more central point. Taking
                    advantage of the act of March, 1855, whereby a county seat may be relocated upon
                    a petition of two-thirds of the legal voters of a county, the advocates of 
                        Beaver City
                     presented such a petition to the commissioners on September 6,
                    1860. They had already erected a courthouse on the proposed site, an exact
                    duplicate of the one at 
                        Kent
                    . The commissioners ruled that the petition did not have the
                    necessary two-thirds and dismissed the petition. The town of Brook made a second
                    effort to secure the coveted honor and on June 3, 1861, presented a petition
                    which they claimed contained two-thirds of the voters, but they were overruled
                         on the ground that many of the signers
                    had joined the army and were therefore not legal voters. 
                        Beaver City
                     tried again on May 17, 1869, to get the county seat but two days
                    later their petition was dismissed. 
                        Morocco
                     made the fourth attempt on March 10, 1870, but they withdrew their
                    petition for some cause not disclosed on the following day. Two years later
                    Brook again appeared in the field and on December 24, 1872, presented a petition
                    bearing 902 names but it was set aside the day following. 
                        Morocco
                     must have had some energetic citizens, for on June 19, 1876, they
                    started a determined fight and were not defeated until the case had been carried
                    from the commissioners' court to the 
                        Newton county
                     circuit court, from there to the 
                        Jasper county
                     circuit court, thence to the 
                        Tippecanoe
                     circuit court, and finally, to the supreme court of the State.
                    These six attempts had been made under the law of 1855 and no further efforts
                    were made to secure relocation until after the law of March 2, 1899107 The law was backed by the people of 
                        Morocco
                     and provided that an election for or against relocation shall be
                    held upon the petition of four hundred legal voters, two hundred of whom must
                    have been free holders at the last general election. If sixty-five per cent, of
                    the voters favor relocation, the change must be made. Backed by the act, the
                    citizens of 
                        Morocco
                     presented on April 2, 1900, a petition in accordance with the act,
                    and an election was held on June 19, 1900. The vote stood 1,515 for relocation
                    and 1,415 opposed to a change. Since the petitioners had failed to secure the
                    necessary sixty-five per cent, of the vote cast, the county seat remained at 
                        Kentland
                    . Brook made the eighth attempt with a petition presented July 3,
                    1900. The election was held September 25, 1900, at which time 1,337 votes were
                    cast for relocation and 1,208 against it. And Kentland still remained the county
                    seat. The ninth and last attempt was made by 
                        Goodland
                     in the same year. On October 1 a petition was presented in
                    accordance with the law of 1899, and the commissioners set the election for
                    January 30, 1901. The Kentland people took an appeal to the circuit court, which
                    sustained the commissioners. The case was carried to the supreme court and on
                    March 19, 1902, it sustained the action of the circuit court, and ordered the
                    commissioners to fix another date for election. They selected June 7, 1902, and at that time 1,834 votes were cast for relocation and 697
                    against the same.

                        Kentland
                     had apparently been beaten at last, for the necessary sixty-five
                    per cent, was in favor of removing the county seat to 
                        Goodland
                    . But the end was not yet. The case was taken from the
                    commissioners' court to the 
                        Newton county
                     circuit court, from there it was venued to 
                        White county
                    , from 
                        White county
                     it was carried to the supreme court of the State and the latter in
                    November, 1903, in a lengthy decision decided in favor of 
                        Kentland
                    . In order to forestall such a close call again, 
                        Kentland
                     began to agitate the question of a new courthouse and on April 3,
                    1905, a contract was let for a new courthouse for the sum of $26,195.
                    The advocates of relocation now made their last desperate fight and tried by
                    every legal means to stop the erection of the proposed building. The case
                    finally landed in'the supreme court and a decision of that court on
                    June 30, 1905, stopped everything. By this time the building was started, the
                    foundation laid and the side walls up to the second story. Another year of legal
                    warfare ensued but the building was finally completed and turned over to the
                    county on August 6, 1906. 
                        Kentland
                     now bids fair to hold the county seat for several years to come
                    without having to undergo any effort to retain it.
            Thus ends the story of the county seats of Indiana up to 1914, but there is good
                    reason to believe that succeeding years will see further changes. The hundred
                    years of Indiana history have seen thirty-nine counties with from. two to seven
                    county seats each, and a total of one hundred and thirty-five towns in the State
                    which have been county seats at some time.

            An Early Indiana Surveyor—Lazarus B. Wilson
            By ALMA WINSTON WILSON (his tenth child)
            The families of Wilson, Jennings and Tomlinson crossed the Atlantic with the
                    colony following William Penn about the year 1685. All were from 
                        England
                    , and being of the same "Meeting" of Quakers, were
                    all Friends, and relatives. They settled first in the vicinity of 
                        Philadelphia
                    , and from there moved to different parts of the adjacent country.
            Thomas Wilson, my grandfather, was born January 13, 1753, and died at 
                        Sprigs Mill
                    , 
                  Washington County,
                            Maryland
               –five miles north of 
                        Hagerstown
                    –December 14, 1798. He lived in 
                        Bucks County
                     at the time of his enlistment in the Revolutionary Army, as
                    lieutenant, in Captain Joseph Tomlinson's company, and later, left his
                    company for three days–to be married to his captain's
                    sister, Miss Sarah Tomlinson, May 20, 1778. Returning to the scene of war, he
                    served faithfully to the end, assisting in receiving the standards from
                    Cornwallis' army when he surrendered at 
                        York-town
                    .
            In a book entitled The Boys of '76, the author,
                    Charles Carleton Coffin, makes mention of that event; although he makes a
                    mistake in stating the age of the young sergeant to be eighteen instead of
                    twenty-eight.
            At the close of the war Thomas Wilson, with his young family, moved to 
                        Franklin county
                    , Pennsylvania, where, on March 2, 1795, his seventh child, Lazarus
                    Brown Wilson, was born. But before this seventh child had reached his seventh
                    year, he was bereft of both parents, and was taken to 
                  Hagerstown, Maryland
               , to live with older members of the
                    family. It was there he grew into boyhood, and from boyhood to manhood; and when
                    in 1812 the call was made to "beat your plowshares into
                    swords," this tall, stalwart boy bid good-bye to his loved ones and
                    marched with his comrades to 
                        Baltimore
                    , where he was mustered in Captain Thomas Quantrill's
                    Company of Fowler's 39th Regiment, 
                        Maryland
                     Militia, and was at the battles of Fort McHenry and North Point.
            
            As a girl of fourteen years, studying 
                        United States
                     history, it was my habit to commit my lesson to memory after
                    supper, and recite it to my father before he retired. Well do I remember the
                    night when, as he sat on one side of the table and I on the other, in the
                    sitting-room of the old homestead, I handed him the history, saying,
                    "I'm ready." As he slowly arranged his spectacles he
                    asked, "Daughter, what is your lesson about tonight?"
                    "Fort McHenry and North Point," I replied. And as he took the
                    history he closed it, and laying it on the table, said: "Well,
                    daughter, I can tell you more about those battles than your book can."
                    "How so?" said I. "Because I was'
                    there," he replied.
            And then he began the story of how his. Regiment-and history tells us that there
                    were four hundred and fifty picked men of Fowler's 39th Regiment who
                    with other detachments formed the garrison,–marched all day in a cold
                    September rain, to 
                        Baltimore
                    , and at nightfall he and his comrades were too exhausted to eat
                    their rations, and, spreading their blankets on the wet ground, each man rolled
                    himself up as a bundle and lay all night with the rain falling upon him.
            You know the rest-how the British regulars fired and fled; how the British ships
                    poured shot and shell into Fort McHenry from sunrise, September 13th, to
                    sunrise. September 14, 1814; and while my father was one, who was giving shot
                    for shot and was defending the flag behind the fort, Francis Scott Key, held as
                    a prisoner on a British war ship in the harbor, watched through the port-hole
            
                    The rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air Gave proof through
                        the night that our flag was still there,
                    * * * 
                    And the Star Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of
                        the free and the home of the brave.
                
            For this service my father received the land warrant ordered by Congress, March
                    3, 1855, numbered 56,941. The war over, he left home, as many a youth has done,
                    to carve his own name on the pages of history, and with one companion, went, in
                    a canoe, down the river from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     to Natchez, and there began the active pursuit of fortune. His
                    retentive mind, love of nature and books, and a thirst for knowledge, must have
                    enabled him to gather up the elements of a higher education by the way, for in
                    1822 he was engaged as a surveyor and civil engineer in 
                        Missouri
                    , in which employment he  became
                    identified with the surveys and public works all over this western wilderness.
            He then came to Indiana, making a temporary stop at 
                        Paoli
                    , in 
                        Orange county
                    , reaching 
                        Indianapolis
                     for permanent residence about 1825. Here he was a companion and
                    co-laborer of that class of first citizens upon whom rested the growth and
                    development of the town which they had founded. He secured valuable property,
                    much of which was afterward sunk in his excessive zeal for railroad improvement,
                    for the generation of restless travelers was not yet born, and the immigrant had
                    not yet found "The Promised Land." In 1828 he was employed by
                    the State as engineer in the system of Internal Improvements, the chief of which
                    was the 
                        Wabash
                     and Erie Canal. He was civil engineer on the "National
                    Road" from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     to 
                        St. Louis
                     in 1832 to 1838, but when word reached the little town of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , in June, 1832, that 
                        Black Hawk
                    , chief of the Sac Indians, was on his way to scalp the pioneers of
                    Indiana, there was a call for volunteers, and again his patriotic zeal asserted
                    itself, and with a company, organized by Captain 
                        Drake
                    , armed with rifles, tomahawks and knives, he marched to 
                        Fort Dearborn
                     (now 
                        Chicago
                    ) under command of Colonel Russell, where the brave volunteers,
                    ready to protect their families and homes at any cost, found that Indiana was
                    not invaded, and the troops she raised were not needed; but there was every
                    reason for the terror of the settlers and their prompt response, as Black Hawk
                    was known to be a cunning and skillful leader. On their return home the company
                    was christened and heralded as the Bloody Three Hundred, a name by which it is
                    known in history to this day.
            The next important event in the life of Lazarus B. Wilson may be introduced by a
                    letter he wrote to Mary Todd Barbee, of 
                  Paris, Kentucky
               , a beautiful girl of nineteen, who was visiting
                    her aunt, Mrs. John G. Brown, in the homestead which stood fronting Meridian
                    street on ground now covered by the Federal Building. It is as follows:
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 
                                    Fort Wayne
                                 
                              
                           ,
                                        April 6th, 1833.
                        MY DEAR MARY:
                        You gave me permission to write one letter to
                                    you and that one, I will give now. As I am extremely anxious to
                                    hear from you; and 1 cannot reasonably anticipate a letter until
                                    after I shall have written. The time appears
                                    long–very long, my dear Mary, since I left you: and
                                    yet it is as nothing, compared with  that which must yet elapse before I
                                    shall enjoy the pleasure of seeing you again.
                        But the promise of Mary to make me the happiest man in Indiana,
                                    when I return, affords me the most pleasing anticipations of
                                    future bliss; and my heart assures me that there is an
                                    "eye will mark my coming, and look brighter when I
                                    come." Does it deceive me, my dear Mary? Does it
                                    flatter me, when it would persuade me, that in Mary, I meet with
                                    a corresponding feeling of affection? I hope it does
                                    not–for it is so sweet a thing to love–to
                                    know that the object of our love, is worthy of all our
                                    affections: And to feel that we are beloved by that being whom
                                    we adore–nay–almost
                                    worship–constitutes so happy a state of
                                    feeling–so much of heaven on earth, that I would not
                                    forego it–even if it were ideal, only. But I must
                                    change the topic.
                        I arrived here on the evening of the fourth day–I
                                    found the road much better than I had expected–and
                                    the weather pleasant–tho' cold.
                        
                           
                                        Fort Wayne
                                     is a larger place than I had expected to find. And
                                    it is handsomely situated, on the south bank of the St.
                                    Mary's river–down which it extends eastward,
                                    to the old Fort, which is at the junction of the last mentioned
                                    stream with the 
                                        St. Joseph
                                    's–here they form the
                                        Maumee river. I am thus minute; as this
                                    may become your place of residence. In regard to the inhabitants
                                    I can say but little; as I have become acquainted with but
                                    few–and with none of your sex. Mr. William's
                                        Lady,1 is at this time in 
                                        Chillicothe
                                     at her father's;2–but she will meet him in 
                                        Piqua
                                     about the 20th of next month to return to this
                                    place (which will be about the 24th.) I will then immediately
                                    start to 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    , to bring my dear lovely Mary; but before that day
                                    arrives, I shall expect to receive several letters from her. And
                                    upon the receipt of the first one, I promise to give her one
                                    thrice the length of this, in answer. In conclusion, my dear
                                    Mary, let me urge you to give me an early answer–I
                                    hope you will be able to inform me that your dear Aunt has
                                    regained her health. I shall ever esteem her very highly, for
                                    telling me that Mary was a good girl–Give me what
                                    news you have from 
                                        Kentucky
                                    –And all the news in

                        We meet with the natives every day. Men, squaws and papoos. And I
                                    have no doubt, but that, I could have a very neat pair of
                                    moccasins made, if I only knew the length, in inches and parts
                                    of an inch, of a certain little foot. Perhaps you may say, that
                                    I have 
                              
                                 1 Mr. Jesse L. Williams.

                                     seen it, often enough to
                                    retain a recollection of its length; this may be true; but to
                                    look well, it should fit very neatly.
                        This is a lovely night–the moon has risen from her
                                    watery bed, and seems to weep, because the dense atmosphere
                                    which hangs like a murky curtain along the eastern horizon,
                                    clouds or obscures the Austere of her borrowed beams. The clouds
                                    have disappeared, and the winds have crept into their caves; all
                                    is silent and calm, save a single voice, and that is the voice
                                    of a woman–lovely woman, and altho' two
                                    tenements off–I can distinguish the words of
                                    "home sweet home". Oh! this is a sweet song to
                                    a stranger. It calls him back to the society of friends most
                                    dear to him; to scenes most lovely and sacred–to acts
                                    of kindness–and words of love: It wakes a
                                    recollection, which is pleasing–because it is
                                    mournful, and mournful, because it portrays scenes of
                                    "joy departed, never to return."
                        Remember me with much kindness to your Aunt and Uncle and, to the
                                    "Forest Bride," and believe me to remain, ever
                                    my dear Mary
                        
                                    Yours

            Their marriage was celebrated at noon, June 18, 1833, the bridal couple leaving
                    immediately in the stage coach for 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , where my father was then engaged in the Government survey.
                    Fifty-six descendants have loved their name and honored their memory.
            The old covered bridge across White river at 
                        Washington
                     street, removed a few years ago was built from plans furnished by
                    him, the work being completed in 1834. As civil engineer, he surveyed, located,
                    and superintended the construction of the railroad from 
                        New Albany
                     to 
                        Michigan City
                    , from the time of its beginning to its completion, and was then
                    offered its superintendence, which he declined. He was among the first and most
                    zealous advocates of railroads. Indeed, it was said of him, that on that subject
                    he was a quarter of a century in advance of his times, contributing largely to
                    their success, though losing money in so doing. As a prophet of the railroad, he
                    lived to see the fulfillment of his predictions, which were considered visionary
                    when they were made.
            In 1844 and '45 he was president of the common council. In 1848 he
                    visited 
                  Philadelphia, New York
                and 
                        Boston
                     on business connected with the Internal Improvements. During the
                    sixties, when age forbade active participation in the -Civil War, it was his
                    eldest son, Oliver,3 who gave expression to the patriotic
                    zeal of his father, 
                  
                     3 Major Oliver M. Wilson.
               
                     and marched away to southern battlefields as
                    captain in the 54th Indiana Volunteers. From that time on, my father lived a
                    life of retirement, and my mind recalls the time when a large circle gathered on
                    Sabbath evenings around the open fireplace in the old homestead, and at
                    twilight, his strong voice was heard with others, in singing, the old familiar
                    hymns, "Safely through another-week," "There is a
                    land of pure delight," and many more of precious memory. But the voices
                    of that hearth are still and the circle that gathered on Sabbath evening is
                    broken, and only a memory.
            For forty-two years he shared with his beloved Mary, the same joys and sorrows
                    which fall to the lot of many of God's children, and on April 10, 1875,
                    after all Life's battles had been fought, "Death came as the
                    "benediction, that follows after Prayer."
            "But to live in hearts we leave behind is not to
                    die."
            His body was interred in Crown Hill cemetery, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where, surrounded by those he loved in life, he rests,
                    "Until the daybreak and the shadows flee away."
         
         
         
            The Newspapers of Rush County
            By JOHN F. MOSES Former Editor of the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Republican,
                    
                        Rushville
                    , Indiana
            Rush county's first printer, publisher and editor was William D. M.
                    Wickham. By the very few now living who knew him he is remembered as a tall,
                    angular man, of eccentric manners and speech. According to the late Dr. John
                    Arnold (long an authority on local history), Mr. Wickham issued the first number
                    of a little paper, about ten by twelve inches in size, at 
                        Rushville
                    , either late in 1822 or early in 1823, under the whimsical title of
                    the Dog Fennel Gazette. This was very soon after the
                    organization of 
                        Rush county
                    . Although it is said to have been published for several years, no
                    copies are known to be in existence at this time. Dr. Arnold describes the
                    printing press as the top of a sycamore stump. The impression was made with a
                    lever—a sapling let into a mortise in a tree which stood close beside
                    the stump. Another version of the story is that the printer secured his
                    "power" at the corner of a stout rail fence. Later, Wickham
                    built himself a better machine of timbers, which he humorously called
                    "Wickham's Velocity Press." The home and printing
                    office were under the same roof.
            Mr. Wickham made a second venture with the True American, the
                    first number of which is dated September 17, 1831. This was a four-column folio,
                    with columns 12 inches long, and was printed on a sheet 13 by 21½
                    inches in size. In his "salutatory" the editor admits a
                    Jacksonian bias, but promises to "meddle with politics very
                    sparingly," and to give his patrons "the best reading
                    obtainable, including Foreign and Domestic Intelligence, Legislative and
                    Congressional Proceedings, Miscellany, and the production of the Muse."
                    A three-line notice of a meeting of the Circuit Court is the sole item of local
                    news in this first issue; but the advertisements afford a glimpse of the life of
                    the village. These represent one merchant, a druggist, a milliner, a shoemaker,
                    two lawyers, a militia muster, a local lottery and a stray horse. Subscriptions
                    were invited on a sliding scale commencing with one dollar a year,  cash in advance. Any kind of "merchantable
                    produce" was a good tender.
            The True American does not seem to have prospered, for under
                    date of January 5, 1833, Mr. Wickham brought out the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Gazette as "a continuation of the True
                        American." The columns of the new paper were four inches
                    longer than those of the old one, but they soon shrank to the same length. The
                    sheet was much too large for the printed pages, leaving great margins, which
                    excited mirth among "envious contemporaries." On one occasion
                    when Mr. Wickham's pages were full and he printed the report of a local
                    election on the margin of his paper, their gibes provoked an interchange of
                    heated and uncomplimentary remarks. Reference is made in the first number of the
                        Gazette to "many attempts and frequent failures
                    to establish a press in 
                        Rushville
                    "; but names of other papers, if there were others, are not
                    mentioned.
            The next paper in order, the Indiana Herald and 
                            Rushville
                         Gazette, was probably the direct successor of the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Gazette, as its name is included in that of the new paper.
                    This was a folio with six wide columns to the page. It shows good work, both
                    editorially and mechanically, and was Whig in politics. Its founders were Samuel
                    Davis of 
                  Covington, Kentucky
               , and Thomas Wallace
                    of 
                  Chillicothe, Ohio
               , who met as printers in 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and there formed a friendship which led to this venture. Their
                    first number bears the date of March 7, 1835. The publication was continued by
                    them until December, 1839, when Corydon Donnavan became owner. Mr. Davis
                    returned to 
                        Covington
                    , his former home. Mr. Wallace remained in 
                        Rushville
                    , served two terms as county treasurer, and afterwards returned to
                    the newspaper business. In 1862, he laid aside his work one "press
                    day," to enlist in the 16th Indiana Infantry. He died in the army some
                    six months later.
            Mr. Donnavan, the new proprietor, changed both the name of the paper and its
                    politics, issuing his first number December 13, 1839, as Volume I, No. 1, of the
                        Hoosier and 
                            Rushville
                         Democratic Archive, with appropriate politics. Its history
                    will be given farther on.
            The Whigs being thus left without an organ, Pleasant A. Hackleman, a leading
                    lawyer of 
                        Rushville
                    , joined with his brother, Oliver C. Hackleman, and on the 25th of
                    April, 1840, brought out the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Whig. New material was shipped from 
                        Cincinnati
                     to  Laurel by canal and wagoned
                    from there to 
                        Rushville
                    , which had no railroad at that time. P. A. Hackleman was editor and
                    made the paper a force in Indiana politics. In April, 1843, the property passed
                    into the hands of R. F. Brown. P. A. Hackleman, who continued as editor, was an
                    orator and writer of great power. He served as clerk of 
                        Rush county
                    , was one of Lincoln's Peace Commissioners at the outbreak
                    of the Civil War, afterwards Colonel of the 16th Indiana Regiment, and had
                    reached the rank of Brigadier-General when he was killed in battle at 
                        Corinth
                    , 
                        Mississippi
                    . His brother Oliver spent most of his remaining years as a farmer.
                    The 
                        Rush County
                     Farmers' Insurance Association, which he organized, is a
                    monument to his foresight, courage and public spirit. He died in 
                        Rushville
                     at an advanced age.
            R. F. Brown sold the Whig in 1846 to 
                        Granville
                     Cowing and Norval W. Cox, two young 
                        Rushville
                     printers, who changed its name to the True
                    Republican, but continued it as a strong Whig paper, with General Hackleman
                    as editor. After his newspaper days ended, Mr. Cowing held a position in the 
                        United States
                     Treasury Department at 
                        Washington
                    . For many years he has lived at 
                        Muncie
                    , devoting himself to horticulture. Mr. Cox moved to 
                        Kansas
                    , was a member of the 
                        Leavenworth City
                     Council, and served with credit in a 
                        Kansas
                     regiment in the Civil War. He finally settled in
                            
                  Little Rock, Arkansas
               , where he was for
                    six years clerk of the 
                        Arkansas
                     Supreme Court, for seventeen years clerk of the 
                        Little Rock
                     school board and was Grand Master of the 
                        Arkansas
                     Odd-Fellows one term. He died in 1896. Very little is known to the
                    present writer about R. F. Brown after his leaving 
                        Rushville
                    . At the close of 1884. while he was publishing the St. Paris (O.)
                        Dispatch, his office burned, and he was seeking another
                    location.
            From this time on, frequent changes of owners mark the fluctuating fortunes of
                    the early 
                        Rushville
                     newspapers. In 1848. the names of T. Wallace & G. Cowing
                    succeeded those of G. Cowing & N. W. Cox as publishers of the True Republican. In 1850-51, the firm name was T. Wallace and
                    D. M. Bell. Three changes occurred in 1852. Thomas Wallace had it in May; D. M.
                    Bell & Co. followed in September; and in October the editor was the late
                    George C. Clark, for many years afterwards President of, the 
                        Rushville
                     National Bank. Before the end of the year, the paper suspended,
                    having reached its 17th volume (including the Whig.)
            
            
            On the 5th of January, 1853, the True Republican reappeared
                    under the capable management of A. M. Cowing and Thomas J. Kemper, who started
                    off with Vol. I, No. 1, of a new series. In 1854, these gentlemen changed the
                    name to the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Republican. In 1855, Nathan Shadinger bought Kemper's
                    interest, and the style changed to A. M. Cowing & Co. In July of the
                    same year, A. M. Cowing sold his interest to Lycurgus J. Cox and William J.
                    Cowing and the name of the firm became Shadinger, Cox & Cowing. In 1856,
                    they changed the name to the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Weekly Republican. In 1859, Mr. Shadinger dropped out. During
                    the Civil War he entered the Union service and was an officer in a negro
                    regiment. His two partners successfully continued the business under the name of
                    Cox & Cowing until October 24, 1860, when Andrew Hall bought the office.
            William J. Cowing removed to 
                        Washington City
                    , to take a position in the Agricultural Department and becoming
                    financially interested in the street railways of that city, made his home there
                    to the end of his life.
            Mr. Hall, who came next in order, had lived in 
                        Kansas
                     during the stirring period of the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     troubles and had actively supported the Free-State movement. The
                    management of the Republican rested on him during the trying
                    first three years of the Civil War. The pinch of war-time conditions caused him
                    to reduce the size of the paper for part of the time. He retired March 16, 1864,
                    but re-engaged in the newspaper business at 
                        Kentland
                    , Indiana, served as clerk of 
                        Newton county
                     and died there.
            His successor was L. J. Cox, who put off the editorial harness again June 21,
                    1865. Mr. Cox spent all his life in 
                        Rushville
                    , which was his native town.
            Lieut. Winfield S. Conde, home from honorable service in the 52d Indiana
                    Infantry, succeeded him. January 3, 1866, William H. Shumm became a partner. He
                    took over the whole business January 22, 1868, with Alexander B. Campbell as
                    editor and continued until September 9, 1868. The name of George W. Bates
                    appeared as local editor at one time. All of these men are dead except Mr.
                    Conde, who still lives near 
                        Rushville
                    . During the whole of the Civil War the Republican
                    ardently supported the Union cause.
            Drebert & Harrison, of 
                        Connersville
                    , bought the Republican October 6, 1869.
                    Harrison's name was dropped June 4, 1872.  Frank T. Drebert was a good printer and an
                    editorial writer of unusual ability. He sold the office to Charles W. Stivers,
                    of Liberty, Indiana, August 17, 1876. For many years afterwards he published
                    papers at 
                        Owatonna
                     and 
                        Chatfield
                    , 
                        Minnesota
                    , and died in that state.
            At the end of six months Mr. Stivers sold the Republican to
                    John F. Moses, of 
                        Huntington
                    , Indiana (Feb. 1, 1877.) As already stated, 
                        Rush county
                    's first newspaper was printed on a homemade press. For
                    nearly half a century following, its successors were laboriously
                    "worked off" on the old Washington hand press, then in general
                    use, at a speed of about 200 sheets an hour. In the summer of 1879, the Republican put in a hand cylinder press, the first in the
                    county, which would hardly meet present day needs; but people used to crowd the
                    press room on publication days, to see the new machine turn off 700 or 800
                    sheets an hour.
            April 1, 1881, Mr. Moses sold the Republican to Capt. Ulysses
                    D. Cole, of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , with whom he had formerly been associated in the publication of
                    the 
                        Huntington
                    
                    Herald. Henry Holt, later of the 
                        Franklin
                    
                    Republican, and for many years past an attorney in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , was Mr. Cole's local editor. He was succeeded by Carl R.
                    Martin, afterwards founder of papers at 
                        Roslyn
                     and 
                        Cle-Ellum
                    , 
                        Washington
                    . In 1882, Mr. Moses resumed editorial work on the Republican, and bought a half interest in the property January 1,
                    1884. At that time the firm name was changed to the Republican Company, which it
                    still bears. Captain Cole was an excellent newspaper man, retired in 1887, in
                    bad health, and died several years ago. Jacob Feudner acquired an interest in
                    the property January 24, 1884. The Republican, which had been
                    a six-column quarto for several years, was made a semi-weekly in 1891. Mr. Moses
                    retired April 1, 1903, having been editor of the Republican
                    for 26 years. Jacob Feudner, who then became owner of the property, still
                    carries on the business. He started the daily edition in 1904. At different
                    times, Will G. McVey, John Rutlidge, Edward Hancock, Claude Simpson, Clifford
                    Lee, Thomas J. Geraghty, B. O. Simpson, Allen Hiner and Roy Harrold have done
                    reportorial work on the paper, the last-named being still in office.
            What goes before traces in outline the fortunes of the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Whig and its successor, the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Republican, from the beginning to the present time. The
                    Democratic chronology is as follows:
            
            As already indicated, 
                        Rush county
                    's first three newspapers—the Dog
                        Fennel Gazette, the True American and the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Gazette —all founded and published by Wm. D.
                    Wickham, were Democratic in their sympathies. The fourth paper in the
                    succession—the Indiana Herald and 
                            Rushville
                         Gazette—established by Davis & Wallace
                    in 1835 as a Whig paper, was sold to Corydon Donnavan in 1840. He changed its
                    name to the Hoosier and 
                            Rushville
                         Democratic Archive, and put it in line with Democratic
                    policies.
            In 1845, the property came into the hands of Samuel S. Bratton, who at once
                    dropped the inconvenient title and issued his first number as Vol. I, No. 1, of
                    the Jacksonian, a name which it still bears. The lack of
                    complete files makes it necessary to trace ownership and editorship at some
                    periods by stray copies of the paper.
            From October 16, 1850, to February 22, 1854, George W. Hargitt published the
                    paper under the name of the Indiana Jacksonian- April 12,
                    1855, it appears as the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Jacksonian, with B. Burns as editor, and John L. Robinson as
                    corresponding editor. Mr. Robinson, who was a native of 
                        Rush county
                    , afterwards achieved much distinction in his party. He was county
                    clerk, a member of Congress and U. S. marshal for Indiana. For years he was very
                    influential in shaping his party's policies in Indiana. October 29,
                    1850, B. Burns and D. M. Bell controlled the Jacksonian. From
                    October 22, 1858, to October 20, 1859, it carried the name of Robert J. Price,
                    and suspended on the date last named. It reappeared December 23, 1859, with
                    Thomas Wallace as publisher and John L. Robinson and Ethelbert C. Hibben as
                    editors. A month later Mr. Robinson was sole proprietor and publisher. Robert J.
                    Price and Thomas Marlatt succeeded him October 5th, that year. On the 4th of
                    April, 1861, William A. Cullen and Cyrus Crawford took charge, the former as
                    editor. August 21st, following, Rodney L. Davis supplanted Mr. Crawford and the
                    paper appeared as Vol. I, No. 1, of a new series. Mr. Cullen was appointed
                    lieutenant-colonel of the 123d Indiana Infantry (mustered into service March 9,
                    1864), and identified himself with the Republican party until 1896. He was
                    probate and circuit judge, served in both houses of the Legislature and was for
                    many years a leading member of the 
                        Rush county
                     bar.
            The Jacksonian opposed the war for the Union, and the party
                    divided on war issues. Patronage fell off and the paper suspended  publication—for how long it does not
                    appear. But in order to revive it the local party leaders raised money for a new
                    equipment by organizing a stock company, selling shares in all parts of the
                    county. Robert S. Sproule was employed as publisher and editor. His first issue,
                    dated July 7, 1862, was numbered Vol. I, No. 1, of another new series. Files are
                    lacking to show how long this arrangement continued; but Elsberry H. Perkins was
                    in control November 18, 1863. Later, Mr. Perkins removed to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and for thirty years or more held a responsible position with the
                        Daily News.
            
            There seems to have been another suspension, for on August 31, 1865, the paper
                    reappeared with an announcement by Cyrus Crawford, that he had
                    "commenced its republication," which he did by starting off
                    with No. 1, Vol. I, of still another series, the file extending only to the
                    middle of the following December.
            The next file accessible shows that John S. Campbell was in possession from
                    November, 1867, to October 27, 1869. He had kept a bookstore in 
                        Rushville
                    , afterwards removing to 
                        Greensburg
                    , and spent his remaining years there. James Moody & Company
                    succeeded him. Their editor was Finley Bigger, Sr., a son of former Governor
                    Samuel Bigger and a member of the bar at 
                        Rushville
                    , who had been Register of the U. S. Treasury under President
                    Buchanan. Another suspension occurred November 17, 1870. A month later the paper
                    started up again under the management of Moody & Conde. In 1871-72, W.
                    S. Conde was publisher. Still another suspension occurred in January, 1873. In
                    May of that year, William E. Wallace, son of Thomas Wallace, an early local
                    publisher, took an interest in partnership with Mr. Conde. This arrangement was
                    of brief duration, for a few week's later (July 24, 1873), the property
                    was bought by George H. Puntenney, attorney, and W. E. Wallace', who,
                    in partnership or separately, owned and successfully managed it for the
                    following thirty-four years. Both were natives of 
                        Rush county
                    , and both good newspaper men. Mr. Puntenney was editor of the paper
                    for twenty-seven consecutive years. Puntenney & Wallace established the
                        Daily Jacksonian July 25, 1895. William S. Meredith was
                    local editor for seven years from 1900, and Thomas A. Geraghty for a long
                    period. In 1897, Mr. Puntenney bought out his partner and in 1900 Mr. Wallace
                    repurchased the entire property. In 1907, the Democrat Publishing Company  was organized and bought the Jacksonian, the Graphic, the Daily
                        Star, and the Independent, and merged them all into
                    one paper under the name of the Democrat, published daily and
                    weekly. Will L. Newbold was president of the new company. Melvin Rector, Robert
                    M. Gibson and Thomas Geraghty were editorial writers at different times. The
                    plan did not succeed. Democrats missed the historic old name of the Jacksonian, and the managers found the organization too expensive to
                    keep up. Finally, on the 15th of July, 1909, the paper and plant were sold to
                    Will L. Newbold and George H. Puntenney, Jr., the latter a son of the former
                    editor. These gentlemen restored the old name and the Daily

            This brings the history of the local Democratic press in outline down to the
                    present time.
            The 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Times, an independent weekly paper, was brought out by Lucian
                    W. Norris, April 12, 1870. Its publication cannot be traced beyond the following
                    October.
            About March, 1877, George W. Bates and Albert Bunting started the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Telegraph, using a plant furnished by Charles W. Stivers. The
                    paper was discontinued after a few months.
            The 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Graphic was established July 1, 1882, by Dr. Samuel W. McMahan
                    and George W. Campbell, attorney. It was a six-column quarto, Republican in
                    politics, published weekly. A prominent feature for some years was a department
                    devoted to the interests of light-harness horse breeders, then of some
                    importance in the county. In 1886, Mr. Campbell sold his interest to John K.
                    Gowdy, and McMahan & Gowdy were owners until 1893; but 
                        Butler
                     & Newby, as lessees, published the paper in 1891, and Gowdy
                    & Newby, in 1892 and part of 1893. June 17, 1893, Harry E. Manor, of 
                        Alexandria
                    , Indiana, bought the paper and took charge. Of his predecessors,
                    Dr. McMahan purchased an interest in the Western Horseman, at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , removed to that city, and died there. Mr. Gowdy, who still resides
                    in 
                        Rushville
                    , was twice sheriff of 
                        Rush county
                    , twice county auditor, served as Republican State Chairman and was
                    consul-general to 
                        France
                    , a position to which he was appointed by President McKinley. Mr.
                    Campbell is a practicing attorney at 
                        Rushville
                    . The Graphic plant was damaged by fire, October
                    23, 1893, and sold to Samuel J. Finney, who resumed its  publication December 15, 1893, and later made it a
                    semi-weekly. Mr. Finney associated Dr. George B. Jones with him July 10, 1895,
                    and in June, 1896, retired, leaving Dr. Jones as publisher. F. C. and D. D,
                    Hazelrigg. of 
                        Greensburg
                    , had the property six months, and Joe M. Taylor, of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , for one month, when Mr. Finney came into possession again. January
                    1, 1901, he sold out to Walter Kaler and T. A. Geraghty. The former retired
                    during the year, leaving Mr. Geraghty as publisher. The latter issued from the
                    same office the Daily Star, which he had previously started.
                    From November, 1902, to 1907, the two editions were published by the
                    Star-Graphic Company, when they were bought by the Democrat Publishing Company
                    and merged with the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Democrat.
            
            In 1886, E. C. Charles started a four-page weekly paper at 
                        Carthage
                    , called the 
                        Carthage
                    
                    Clarion. Politically it was Republican. A few years later he
                    sold his subscription list to the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Graphic, and discontinued the Clarion. Later
                    he began the publication of another paper there under the title of the Carthagenian. This paper was published for some years
                    afterwards as the 
                        Carthage
                    
                    Record by William Allan, whose death caused its suspension.
                    Publication was resumed by Chester G. Hill, into whose hands the property came
                    next. The plant was nearly destroyed by fire, and the paper stopped again in
                    consequence. After the lapse of some months he once more revived the paper as
                    the 
                        Carthage
                    
                    Citizen, with Miss Florence B. Hunt as editor, an arrangement
                    which still continues.
            The pioneer paper at Milroy was the Advertiser, a four-page
                    non-partisan weekly, founded by Charles H. Pollitt in 1882. He was succeeded by
                    Marcus Fisher and George W. Rowe, in turn. During this period the name was
                    changed to the Times and the Neivs. Dates
                    are not available. It was finally suspended, and revived as the Milroy Press by Harry O. Matthews in 1895. After him, John P. Stech,
                    present city treasurer of 
                        Rushville
                    , was publisher from August, 1896. He was succeeded by F. Curtis
                    Green, who was publisher until about 1910, when it was sold to Clyde Archey, the
                    present owner and editor.
            George S. Jones, a teacher, published the Manilla Mail for some
                    time in the '90s, but the paper was printed in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            The 
                        Rushville
                    
                    American was established November 22, 1894, as a small
                    four-page weekly by James E. Naden, who has been its only  owner. In 1902 it was enlarged to eight pages and
                    in 1909 was made a semi-weekly. The American supported the
                    Republican party until 1912, when it took part with the Progressives.
            In 1904, John Rutlidge began the publication of the 
                        Rushville
                    
                    Independent, weekly, and continued it until 1907, when it was
                    bought by the Democrat Publishing Company and discontinued.
         
         
         
            Autobiography of a Noted Pioneer
            Written by E. W. H. ELLIS, of 
                        Goshen
                    
               1
            
            MY father, William Robinson Ellis, was the son of Ezekiel
                    Ellis an officer in the Revolution serving under General Washington, and was
                    born in 
                        Windham county
                    , 
                        Connecticut
                    , April 6, 1784. His middle name he derived from his mother,
                    Elizabeth Robinson, of whose family I know nothing. He was a man of common
                    school education for that period. Studied medicine, I don't know where,
                    with Dr. Winter Hewett, a man of some note in his profession, who died in 
                        Batavia
                    , 
                        Genesee county
                    , 
                        New York
                    . My father practiced his profession awhile in 
                        Windsor
                    , 
                        Vermont
                    , afterwards at German Flats, 
                        Herkimer county
                     and at 
                        Penfield
                    , 
                        Ontario county
                    , 
                        New York
                    . In 1808 he was married to Hannah Brown, daughter of Capt. Isaac
                    Brown, who commanded a company of drafted men in the War of 1812. His residence
                    was in the town of 
                        Locke
                    , 
                        Cayuga county
                    , 
                        New York
                    . During the War of 1812, in addition to the duties of his
                    profession, my father engaged in merchandise in 
                        Penfield
                    , some 10 miles from 
                  Rochester, New
                    York
               , then in the county of 
                        Ontario
                    , but since known as 
                        Monroe county
                    . On the proclamation of peace in 1815, owing to the great downfall
                    in prices, and the dishonesty of his partners, his financial prospects were
                    ruined, and he was forced to close business and sacrifice all his means.
            At this place I was 'born on he 28th day of April, 1815. Another family
                    occupied the upper story of the house, one Erastus Yeomans, to which also came a
                    son on the same date. If I formed any acquaintance with the chap I have long
                    since forgotten him, but in his honor or his fathers, I am christened Erastus.
                    My father's preceptor also had to be remembered and thus was added the
                    two middle names making in all a name that but few have heard in full, or can
                    remember—Erastus Winter Hewett Ellis.
            In the year 1820, in company with my uncle, Daniel Ellis, my father determined to
                    try his fortunes in the far west and accordingly embarked in an humble craft,
                    skiff or scow, I can not say what, at 
                  
                     1 Mr. Ellis died at his home in 
                                Goshen
                             October, 10, 1876. He was serving as postmaster of the city
                            at the time of his death.
               
                     Ocean Point on the Alleghany
                    river, descended to Pittsburg and thence floated down the 
                        Ohio
                     to 
                        Cincinnati
                    . I can barely remember this place from the hearing of an organ as
                    we passed one of the churches. We settled at 
                        Jacksonburg
                    , a small town in 
                  Butler
                        county, Ohio
               ,
                    when my school days began. My first teacher was Peter Muntz who died a few years
                    since in 
                        Elkhart county
                    , Indiana, in whose possession I found a school book published by my
                    father entitled A Minor to Noah Webster's Spelling
                    Book. I learned rapidly in reading and orthography and at the age of seven
                    was regarded in all that country round as a prodigy in spelling. My father, who
                    was sometimes a teacher himself, took pride in showing me off, and I was the
                    champion in all the spelling matches in the neighborhood. I am a tolerable
                    speller yet, but I have had a good many bad spells since I was a boy.
            Owing to his disappointments in business, my father became discontented and
                    restless and although always successful as a practitioner, he never remained
                    long in any one place, but removed from point to point, going as far west as 
                        Leavenworth
                    , Indiana, and then step by step back through Bellefontaine, 
                        Ohio
                    , to 
                        Maumee
                    , thence down the lake in April, 1826, to 
                        Buffalo
                    , and thence to 
                        Knowles-ville
                    , 
                        New York
                    , where my mother died on the first of November, 1828. She left
                    surviving her myself, nearly 14 years of age, my brother W. R. Ellis, five years
                    younger, my sister Lucy Ann born in 1822 and my brother Isaac Brown, born in
                    1824. The latter died in the "Union army' in 1863 or 1864 near
                            
                  Nashville, Tennessee
               .
            While at 
                        Knowlesville
                     I attended one term at Grainer's Academy in the study of
                    Latin, and in the winter and spring of 1829 I taught school in the town of 
                        Royalton
                    , 
                        Niagara county
                    , 
                        New York
                     in two several districts, for five months, and was just at the
                    close of my term when my father who had always designed me for the medical
                    profession, wrote me that he had found a situation for me to study medicine at 
                        Brockport
                    , 
                        New York
                    . I immediately started for home, walked fifteen miles to
                    Knowlesville and having no money to pay my passage on the canal, I pawned my
                    watch for a small sum and proceeded homewards. About the first of September,
                    1829, I accompanied my father to Brockport, to the office of Dr. John B. Elliot,
                    a regular physician of considerable repute and success, and was received a few
                    weeks on probation. We afterwards entered into a written obligation, whereby I
                    agreed to remain with him during  my
                    minority, to attend his drugstore and do whatever else was necessary about the
                    office and house. He was to be my preceptor in medicine, and was to furnish me
                    board and clothing, but I was to repay him when I should be able for the
                    clothing advanced for the first two years. In other words I was to serve the
                    first two years for my board and tuition.
            Thus I was duly installed a student of medicine and remained with him for seven
                    years. It was a pleasant family and I remember with affection Mrs. Joanna
                    Elliot, who was to me during all this period of seven years more than a mother.
                    I was regarded and treated more as a son than a stranger, and I owe much to them
                    for my early training. Dr. Elliot and wife were earnest Presbyterians, very
                    devoted and very zealous. I attended church with them almost constantly after
                    the first year or two, and was for years librarian of the sabbath school and a
                    member of the choir. I was an industrious student, always up at. five in the
                    morning, and seldom abed till eleven at night. During the day my time was mainly
                    occupied in attendance upon the drug store, compounding medicines, posting books
                    so that my 'morning and evening hours were necessarily devoted to the
                    books. Besides my regular studies and the care of the store, I found leisure for
                    miscellaneous reading, and at the age of sixteen began to write extensively in
                    prose and verse, but at first anonymously, for the press. I wrote with a
                    prolific pen for various literary papers of that day, but little of it I think
                    survives in anyone's recollection. In the winter of 1833-4 I attended
                    medical lectures at Jefferson Medical College, 
                        Philadelphia
                    , and was a portion of the time a roommate of Dr. Daniel Brainard,
                    recently of 
                        Chicago
                    . On my return in the spring of 1834, I underwent an examination at
                            
                  Rochester, New York
               , and received my
                    diploma shortly before my 19th birthday. The censors were pleased to say that I
                    passed the best examination they had ever witnessed. From my early youth I had
                    devoted much attention to politics and became an ardent Jack-sonian Democrat.
                    This often annoyed my worthy preceptor, who boasted that he was a Federalist of
                    the old school, and we had many sharp contests on the matter, all however in
                    good humor. In the year 1834 at the–solicitation of many Democrats I
                    assumed the editorial control of a paper at 
                        Brockport
                     called the Village Herald, devoted to the success
                    of the Democratic party, and the election of. William L. Marcy as governor of
                    the State. This paper continued  about four
                    months I also assisted in originating and conducting for one year The Token a literary paper, of which about 1,000 copies were issued
                    semi-monthly. It was not much of a paper, but better I think than some I have
                    since seen. I received my first political promotion in 1835 when I was appointed
                    a commissioner of deeds for 
                        Monroe county
                    , out of which I accumulated a little over one hundred dollars, this
                    being my entire capital for the commencement of business for myself. I was also
                    elected and commissioned by Governor Marcy a lieutenant in the militia, and won
                    the military honors for a single year. I remained with Dr. Elliot until the
                    first of August, 1836, when I set my face westward in the company of a number of
                    families from Brockport, and arrived at 
                  Mishawaka, St. Joseph
                        county
               , Indiana, about the seventh of the same month
                    intent upon the practice of my profession. In the spring of 1837 my father
                    having removed to 
                        South Bend
                    , upon his solicitation I went to that point and engaged in business
                    with him. The next year he removed to 
                        Elkhart
                    , Indiana, and I accompanied him arriving in that town on my
                    twenty-third birthday. Our business was extensive by day and by night.
                    Throughout the country every house was a hospital, scarcely a family being
                    unvisited with disease. We were however, very successful in combating the
                    prevailing sickness and I had made up my mind to remain there for the future,
                    when a slight circumstance changed the whole current and tenor of my life.
            I had taken part in a Democratic county convention at 
                        Goshen
                    , had been appointed a delegate and attended a Congressional
                    convention at 
                        Lafayette
                    , January 8, 1839, which nominated Gen. Tilgh-man A. Howard for
                    Congress, and had thus become known as a Democratic politician. Soon after my
                    return I was visited at 
                        Elkhart
                     by the Hon. E. M. Chamberlain of 
                        Goshen
                    , who came to solicitate me to take the editorial control of the 
                        Goshen
                    
                    Democrat, assuring me that it would not interfere with the
                    duties of my profession.2 It suited my taste exactly, and I
                    soon acquiesced in the proposition, and about the twentieth of January, 1839,
                    became a resident of 
                        Goshen
                    . The proprietors of the Democrat office, of whom
                    I now recollect'Ebenezer Brown, E. M, Chamberlain, James Cook, John
                    Jackson, Dempster Beatty and Albert Banta, agreed to compensate me with the
                    munificent sum of two hundred dollars per annum and my board. The latter I had
                    at James Cook's, which cost 
                  
                     2 The Democrat is still one of
                            the leading papers of Indiana.
               
                     my employers two dollars per week. I also
                    purchased a share of the office. The office of the paper was on lot 123 on Main
                    street. I soon found it impossible to continue the practice of medicine while I
                    remained in the editorial chair, and the latter having peculiar attractions for
                    me, after the first year I abandoned my profession entirely, although I have
                    never regretted the time I devoted to its study. On the twenty-third of
                    September, 1839, my father died at 
                        Elkart
                     and is there buried. He was an honest man, an earnest devoted
                    Christian. He often added to his duties of doctor of medicine, those of a
                    minister of the gospel, and was generally a Methodist, but some times belonged
                    to the United Brethren. I have often heard him in the pulpit, and have been a
                    listener to much worse preaching since his day. At his death he was as poor in
                    purse as any of the apostles. As a gentleman and a scholar, he would have
                    ornamented a more exalted position, but 
                        Providence
                     doomed him to a life of poverty, peace to his memory! Thousands of
                    the poor at whose bedsides he had ministered still remember him with affection.
            The circulation of the Democrat was small, not exceeding 400,
                    while the amount of job printing and advertising was quite limited. I however
                    applied myself to the work with diligence and economy, and finally succeeded in
                    getting it on a paying basis, but it was by no means lucrative. For a long while
                    it was the only Democratic paper north of the 
                        Wabash
                     excepting the Sentinel3
                at 
                        Ft. Wayne
                     and the paper circulated throughout this territory. I issued also
                    an extra sheet during a portion of 1840 called the 
                  
                            St. Joseph county
                         Democrat, designed for circulation in 
                        St. Joseph county
                     and the same year published the Kinderhook
                    Dutchman, a campaign paper, devoted to the interests of the Democrat party,
                    and the re-election of Martin Van Buren. Of this paper about 1,200 copies were
                    issued, 100 being sent to subscribers at 
                        Indianapolis
                    . In August, 1841, I was elected the first auditor of 
                        Elkhart county
                     by about ISO votes over C. L. Murray and was re-elected in 1846.
                    The office was a great help to me, although the pay at first was only six
                    hundred dollars per annum. It enabled me to keep the Democrat
                    going, and to accumulate a little property. I continued to discharge the duties
                    of editor and auditor, doing all my own work, until, January, 1850, 
                  
                     3 Founded by Thomas Tigar and Vance Noll, June,
                            1833. The oldest paper of the region was founded at 
                                South Bend
                            , 1831.
                  
                     4 Piles are still preserved by the 
                                Elkhart County
                             Historical Society.
               
                     when having been elected by the Legislature,
                    Auditor of the State of Indiana, I resigned both positions.
            On the seventeenth day of May, 1842, I was married to Maria Crozier formerly of
                            
                  Chillicothe, Ohio
               , who was called away on
                    the twenty-first day of April, 1846, leaving two orphan children, Sarah Annette
                    and William R.
            On the twenty-seventh day of January, 1848, I was again married to Jeannette
                    Minerva, daughter of Ebenezer Brown. Her death occurred at 
                        Indianapolis
                     on the 16th day of June, 1856, leaving one child surviving her,
                    Emma Maria, also two children deceased buried in 
                        Goshen
                     and two buried in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            On the seventeenth day of August, 1858, I was married to Rosalie Harris, widow of
                    Leonard G. Harris and daughter of the late Samuel of 
                        Elkhart
                    . In these several cases my domestic relations were of the most
                    happy and agreeable nature, and I never cease to thank a kind 
                        Providence
                     for the blessings therein vouchsafed me. If I had had no other joys
                    in life this alone would compensate me for all its ills and make me thankful
                    that I have had an existence. In January, 1850, after a tedious journey of a
                    week we reached 
                        Indianapolis
                     and I took charge of the auditor's office, in the building
                    known as the Governor's House, on the Governor's Circle, the
                    office I afterwards removed to a room in Masonic Hall. In the summer of 1850,
                    Mr. John S. Spann and myself purchased of Jacob P. Chapman, the contract for the
                    state printing, and the printing materials of the Indiana State
                        Sentinel. Our duties under this contract we performed faithfully,
                    printing among other documents, The Revised Statutes of 1852.
                    Finding it desirable to have a paper connected with the business we commenced
                    the publication of the Indiana Statesman, a weekly paper,
                    which soon attained a circulation of over 2,000, which was continued two years,
                    and of which I was editor. In the course of the publication I found myself at
                    variance with the leaders of the Democratic party on the slavery question,
                    adhering as I did, to the position of the party throughout the North, in the
                    campaign of 1848, against the extension of slavery into the new territories.
                    Owing to this position I was defeated for the re-nomination for auditor in 1852
                    by John P. Dunn, Esq., and retired in January, 1853, at the expiration of my
                    three years' service. I took my final leave of the party in 1855 at the
                    Democratic State Convention, when it was proposed to make the Border Ruffian
                    policy  of the administration a test of party
                    fealty. Within this period I was elected by the Legislature a commissioner of
                    the Institute for the Education of the Blind, and was chosen secretary of the
                    board, the Honorable Isaac Blackford being president of the same. This position
                    I held about five years. I was also chosen a director and president of the Peru
                    and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad Company. The work was then constructed from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        Noblesville
                    , a distance of twenty-two miles and ironed with a flat bar. I
                    remained as president two years until the work was completed and in operation
                    from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to Peru. A consolidation was then made with the 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad Company whereby Hon. John Brough, afterwards Governor of 
                        Ohio
                    , became the president of the entire line from 
                        Madison
                     to Peru. In a few weeks Mr. Brough resigned this position and I was
                    elected to fill his place. The consolidation was afterwards dissolved, and I
                    remained president of the 
                        Madison
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     road for the term of two and one-half years, and then resigned and
                    returned to 
                        Goshen
                    . I was one of the directors of the Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                     Central Railway and of two or three other lines in their
                    incipiency. I was induced to invest $11,000 in a mercantile business
                    in 
                        Goshen
                    . The concern failed and I was compelled to sacrifice almost every
                    dollar of my property, amounting to not less than $40,000 to pay the
                    indebtedness of the firm. In 1856 I was nominated on the first Republican State
                    ticket as a candidate for Auditor of State. Oliver P. Morton was the candidate
                    for Governor and Conrad Baker for lieutenant-governor. During the season I
                    edited and published a campaign paper entitled We the People
                    having a circulation of 7,000 copies weekly. The ticket was defeated by between
                    5,000 and 6,000 votes. Once more back in 
                        Goshen
                    , poor and penniless, I purchased with C. W. Stephens the office of
                    the 
                  
                            Elkhart County
                         Times, changing the name of the paper to the 
                        Goshen
                    
                    Times; for more than two years I was its editor, when for a
                    very small consideration I parted with my interest to Mr. Stephens and thus
                    closed my connections with the press. In 1858 I was elected again as auditor of 
                        Elkhart county
                     and re-elected in 1862 making my entire service in that capacity
                    the term of sixteen years. I was present at the National Convention in 1860 when
                    Abraham Lincoln was nominated for the Presidency and rendered my utmost aid to
                    secure his election, an event which precipitated the Rebellion. A Peace Congress
                    having  been proposed by 
                        Virginia
                    , I was appointed by Governor O. P. Morton, a delegate for Indiana,
                    in conjunction with Caleb B. Smith, P. A. Hackleman, Godlove S. Orth, and L. C.
                    Slaughter. The two former are now deceased. My roommate at the Avenue House was
                    Mr. Smith, afterwards Secretary of the Interior. Our congress met in a hall
                    adjoining Willard Hotel, in 
                        Washington
                    , was presided over by Ex-President John Tyler, and for a month was
                    the scene of most earnest and angry discussion. The principal good anticipated
                    for it on the part of the North, and all that it accomplished, was to postpone
                    the commencement of hostilities until after the inauguration of President
                    Lincoln. About the first of March that gentleman came in disguise and at the
                    peril of his life in 
                        Baltimore
                     to Washington.
            During this period, with others, I had several interviews with General Scott,
                    then in command in the city, who expressed his belief that the Rebellion was
                    inevitable, and that the South would fight. He had but about 1,000 troops in the
                    city, and those men dispersed in such a manner as to show to the best advantage,
                    particularly on the twenty-second of February, Washington's birthday,
                    when they paraded the streets in every direction, giving to spectators the idea
                    of the presence of an immense body of troops. I remained in 
                        Washington
                     until after the inauguration of President Lincoln and with other
                    Indianaians called upon him and upon the retiring President, James Buchanan. Not
                    the least interesting incident of this brief sojourn in 
                        Washington
                    , was the great party at the residence of Stephen A. Douglas which
                    was attended by most of our members. For this service in the Peace Congress the
                    Legislature allowed us each the sum of four hundred dollars.
            The Rebellion came on apace, the President called for 75,000 three months men,
                    and throughout the War, and to its close. I devoted time and money, without
                    stint, to the raising of troops, the care of soldiers' families, and
                    the Sanitary Commission. My office was headquarters for everything connected
                    with the War. Backed by friends in 
                        Goshen
                    , I repaired to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and urged upon Governor Morton the propriety of raising a regiment
                    for three years service with headquarters in 
                        Goshen
                    .
            (April 9, 1873, I had written to this point, when Col. R. M. Johnston entered my
                    office and announced the receipt of a telegram from 
                        Jackson
                    , 
                        Michigan
                    , stating Col. E. J. Wood had committed  suicide in the Hibbard House with a revolver. At
                    request of the Masonic Lodge, I repaired to Jackson and brought the remains to 
                        Goshen
                    , to his family. Colonel Wood was a graduate of Dartmouth College,
                    the second colonel of the Forty-eighth Regiment of Indiana Volunteers, and had
                    been for two years judge of the Common Pleas court. He was en route to Saginaw,
                    when in a fit of mental aberration, he committed this act of self-destruction.)
            Governor Morton received the application with favor, and in a few days after
                    directed the organization of the Forty-eighth Regiment of Indiana Volunteers,
                    and telegraphed to me an appointment as commandant of the camp, to raise the
                    regiment. I proceeded immediately to work, and in a few days had made such
                    progress that all the companies required had commenced their organization. The
                    regiment was located two miles south of 
                        Goshen
                    , on the new-fair grounds, and subsequently by order of the regiment
                    the place was designated as Camp Ellis. Declining the honor of the colonelcy I
                    procured the appointment of Norman Eddy as colonel, M. B. Hascall as lieutenant
                    colonel and Ruggs as major captain. My son, William R., entered as a private in
                    Company I. E. J. Wood, captain, was appointed as sergeant, afterwards sergeant
                    major of the regiment, and when he was mustered out of service at 
                        Savannah
                    , after accompanying General Sherman on his march from 
                        Atlanta
                     to the sea, he held the position of first lieutenant. For my
                    services in connection with this organization I was allowed the sum of
                    $700.
            When it became necessary to order a draft for recruits for the service the
                    Governor appointed me as the enrolling officer for the county, and
                    superintendent of the draft. I accordingly appointed deputies in each township,
                    had the enrollment made and corrected, superintended the draft and took to 
                        Indianapolis
                     128 drafted men, many of them with their substitutes, most of whom
                    became members of the Fifty-seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteers. Subsequently I
                    was appointed deputy marshal of the county, and as such superintended further
                    drafts at 
                        Kendallville
                    , arrested fugitives, etc., filling this position for about one
                    year, until near the close of the War, when the office was abolished. It is a
                    gratification to me at this hour to feel that throughout the great struggle I
                    rendered every aid in my power for the overthrow of the inhuman Rebellion, and
                    to secure the crowning results of the victory. About the close of the war the
                    Legislature elected me one of the State directors of  the Bank of the State of Indiana, the duties of
                    which I discharged for one year, until the winding up of the institution. I was
                    also appointed by Governor Baker as one of a board of commissioners to examine
                    into some of the irregular transactions of the Sinking Fund Commission. In 1866
                    my last term as Auditor of 
                        Elkhart county
                     terminated, making 16 years of service in that capacity. A longer
                    period I presume than the office will be filled again by one individual. The
                    last few years I have devoted to my private affairs, which I confess are in
                    rather an unprosperous condition, but I hope some day to see the time when I can
                    obey the Apostle's injunction "to owe no man." And it
                    will be a source of gratification and of gratitude defend profound, even should
                    it leave me, as most likely it will without the possession of a dollar. I have
                    striven to be honest with my fellow men and hope I have succeeded. I have
                    endeavored to maintain a good reputation in the community, and have had many
                    evidences of their esteem and confidence. For a few years I strove earnestly to
                    secure the construction of a railroad from 
                        Goshen
                     south via
                    
                        Warsaw
                     to Peru, and was the president of an organization formed for that
                    purpose. It however failed, and the line was changed" to 
                        Wabash
                    , and for the last two years I have been its secretary. Ever since
                    its organization I have been a director and secretary of the Hydraulic Canal
                    Company, and for most of the time its treasurer. I contributed also towards its
                    construction the sum of 500 dollars. In 1872 I was the secretary of the
                    Republican State convention at 
                        Indianapolis
                     and was selected and elected as presidential elector for the Tenth
                    District, and in the electoral college cast the vote of the district for Ulysses
                    S. Grant for President and for Henry Wilson for Vice President.
            The only official position I hold now is that of Trustee of the State Normal
                    School located at 
                        Terre Haute
                    , to which I was nominated by Governor Baker in the winter of 1872-3
                    and confirmed by the Senate.
            These memoranda will not be complete without a statement of my connection with
                    the Masonic institution. My father was a Mark Master Mason, and I grew up in the
                    midst of the Anti-Masonic excitement of 1827-8 and the year succeeding. My
                    sympathies were early enlisted for the order. I felt that it was persecuted
                    unjustly, that it was slandered and maligned, and it needed no solicitation to
                    induce me to apply for initiation to the lodge under  dispensation which met in the southwest corner of
                    the old courthouse in 1846. Afterwards I became one of the charter members of 
                        Goshen
                     Lodge No. 12, and was for several years its master. I also aided in
                    the organization of 
                        Goshen
                     Chapter No. 45 and have been for several years its High Priest, and
                    am also the Thrice Illustrious Grand Master of Bashor Council of Royal and
                    Select Masters. I have been Grand King and Grand High Priest of the Grand
                    Chapter of the State. And on the introduction of the Scottish Rite in the State
                    I received all the degrees up to, and including the thirty-third and was chosen
                    the Grand Commander of the order in the State. Of Masonic songs, addresses,
                    sketches and essays my labors have not been few; I hope their tendency has been
                    to make men better and not worse.
            Interspersed along the course of my life have been addresses, orations, speeches,
                    sketches and essays innumerable. Not many remember them now–how few
                    will do so after the lapse of a few brief years!
            Looking back over the fifty-eight years of my existence, blessed with a
                    temperment that enabled me always to look on the bright side and always hope for
                    the best, I feel that I have enjoyed as much of earthly happiness as falls to
                    the lot of man on the average. Many days of sadness and sorrow, of
                    disappointments and loss have been mine, but I have striven to bear them with
                    fortitude, and even with cheerfulness.
            While I feel that I have not accomplishe'd what I should have done, I
                    have not been idle. My life has been at least a busy one, and as opportunity
                    offered I trust a useful one. Certain it is that I have not put myself
                    offensively forward for any of the public positions I have held, nor done a
                    dishonest or dishonorable thing to secure them.
            I have written this narrative for the entertainment of my children, and close it
                    on my fifty-eighth birthday, this 29th day of April, 1873.
         
         
         
            The Town of Bethlehem, Clark County, Indiana
            By MRS. ELINOR H. CAMPBELL
                    
                        Jeffersonville
                    , Indiana
            On record in the courthouse of this county appears the following:
            W. C. Greenup, surveyor of town of 
                        Bethlehem
                    , 
                        Clark county
                    , Indiana Territory. William Plasket this day personally appeared
                    before me, James McCampbell, one of the justices assigned to keep the peace and
                    made oath that this is the original plat or map of the Town of 
                        Bethlehem
                     in the county and territory aforesaid.
            Given under my hand and seal this 15th day of June, 1812.
            JAMES MCCAMPBELL. J.P.C.C.
            At that time we know the ground on which this town stands was owned by Jonathan
                    Clark, Col. John Armstrong, William Plasket, and others. As Col. Armstrong was
                    born in the town of 
                        Bethlehem
                    , Pennsylvania, this town was probably named in honor of his
                    birthplace.
            The plat shows that the streets running parallel with the river were called
                    Front, Second, and Third, while those at right angles with these were Poplar,
                    Walnut, Main, Bell and Sycamore, embracing sixteen full squares and a half
                    square beyond the two on the east side of Bell street, with the half square
                    between Walnut and Main on Second street reserved for public ground.
            In the country round about were then living the following families, whose names
                    appear in county commissioners' reports in connection with opening of
                    roads, etc.
            The name of Abbott is seen on record in 1779. The heirs of John Rodgers are
                    mentioned in 1806. Philip Boyer from near 
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               , William Kelly, born in 
                        Virginia
                    , later of Kentucky, came to this county in 1806. William Hamilton,
                    with his mother and two sisters, came in 1812. Jacob Hiltner, born in 
                        Northumberland county
                    , Pennsylvania, emigrated to 
                        Kentucky
                     and then to 
                        Clark county
                    , Indiana, several years before the birth of his son George in 1818.
                    Near 
                        New Washington
                     were the 
                        Adams
                    , 
                        Dougan
                    , 
                        Provine
                    , 
                        Fouts
                    , 
                        Montgomery
                     and other families.
            
            Of William, Provine it is recorded that because his mill was the only one on this
                    side of the river he was twice returned from service during the War of 1812.
            One of the first purchasers of a lot in the town was Bayley Johnson, who for a
                    lot centrally located paid ten dollars. Persons named Olmstead, Belden,
                    Sturdivant, Maston, Stephenson, Barnes, Rae, Gardner, Smock, Cravens, Robinson
                    and Goforth were owners of lots in the early years, while William Plasket and
                    William G. Armstrong seemed to have been the leading business men of the town.
                    The two latter operated the ferry, being taxed six dollars for the privilege in
                    1816. These men were also partners in general merchandise business, occupying
                    the large corner room of the two-story building which Mr. Armstrong erected on
                    the corner of Front and Bell streets. In connection with the store room was his
                    dwelling, and a continuous row of two-story buildings extended from the corner
                    building to the alley below. These buildings were destroyed by fire early in
                    '59.
            Mr. Plasket put up the large two-story brick house on the other front corner of
                    the same block. Wre find record of Henry Fix purchasing in
                    the town in the year 1820, P. R. Baldwin in 1840. Mr. Emanuel Pernet purchased
                    in 1848 the corner property from William G. Armstrong, while Thomas Wallace the
                    following year purchased from Mr. Armstrong the farm above the creek.
            Associated with every name here mentioned (save a very few of the first comers)
                    are personal memories very dear and tender, the Flaskets and Armstrongs being
                    relatives of my father and others acquaintances of my youth. When the
                    "War" commenced our good people had an immense flag flung to
                    the breeze from a sixty-foot pole, the ceremony made most impressive by the
                    reading of the constitution, speeches, and music, and on this day in June, 1861,
                    the greatest crowd of people ever seen in 
                        Bethlehem
                     gathered on the public ground. Our young men went to battle for the
                    "Union"–many never to return–and at home
                    all felt the effects of the War in one way or another.
            Uncle Tommy Rogers could get no help in planting corn and was glad to accept the
                    proffered service of two little girls, who for two days trudged between the
                    furrows dropping the grains in each proper place. When the eighteen-inch snow
                    covered the ground in the winter of '62 the physician
                    from New Washington was sent for  and the
                    little child born that night was soon left motherless, while the father was in
                    the army.
            The excitement attending the Morgan Raid can never be forgotten by all who lived
                    here in July, 1863. The fright was just as great as had the intelligence been
                    true that Morgan's men were coming on the road from New Washington, but
                    luckily it was a company of Home Guards instead. At that time mail was received
                    but three times in the week and daily papers were thrown from the passing mail
                    boat, being picked up by some one in a skiff and then from the corner stone read
                    aloud to the interested listeners who were eager to hear the War news.
            On a sad day in April, 1865, as the boat was landing to take on passengers my
                    father asked why the flag was at half mast and the reply was "for the
                    President." Stunned by the answer, we though not to say "good
                    bye" to some departing relatives but sadly picked up the paper that was
                    thrown down. The day was dark and gloomy and our hearts were filled with sorrow
                    because of the fearful news.
            In retrospect let us try to imagine something of the days as they were one
                    hundred years ago. The river flowed by this high bank then as now but only
                    keelboats, barges and pirogues plied the waters. Forests covered most of the
                    ground and wolves prowled through them still. The county was paying a bounty of
                    $1.00 for each wolf head. It was not until 1815 that any systematic
                    method of opening roads was inaugurated and of course there were no bridges.
            The housekeeping was such as we imagine existed in all primitive homes, but when
                    in 1815 Mr. Armstrong brought his bride from 
                        Cincinnati
                     he must have also brought many of the conveniences and comforts to
                    which she was accustomed. In 1819 a trip to 
                        Cincinnati
                     was made–Mrs. Armstrong carrying her baby on her lap as
                    she rode horseback.
            It is well for us to look back at our beginnings and, in so recalling the days
                    and ways of our ancestors, pay homage to their memory and resolve to make of our
                    lives the best record, possible.
         
         
         
            The Founding of the State School for the Blind—A Biography of
                    William H. Churchman
            By GEORGE S. COTTMAN
                    
                        Irvington
                    , Indiana
            If one interested in the notable men of Indiana should seek for information about
                    William H. Churchman he would not find even the briefest biographical mention of
                    him in any of the big gilt-edged books that pretend to save from oblivion the
                    representative men of the State. Yet this man, an active citizen of the State
                    for more than thirty-five years, in ability and in performance outranked many a
                    one whose name is blazoned conspicuously on the pages of our history. William H.
                    Churchman has never received the recognition and the honor that was due him, for
                    the reason, perhaps, that his services were not of a kind to keep him in the
                    public eye and he did not see fit to pay some publisher of commercial
                    "history" for a laudatory write-up with the customary picture
                    accompaniment.
            An educator in a special field Mr. Churchman was to the blind of this State what
                    Samuel Gridley Howe, "the Cadmus of the blind," or the famous
                    educator of Laura Bridgeman was to the darkened ones of 
                        Massachusetts
                    . He was, virtually, the founder of the work that has been done for
                    this class in Indiana. For though such work was one of the predestined duties of
                    a progressive commonwealth regardless of any one man, yet the intrusion of this
                    man into our history at the formative moment gave a distinctive character to the
                    early development. How this was can best be shown by a brief sketch of his
                    earlier life. Born in 
                  Baltimore,
                            Maryland
               , in 1818,
                    he lost his sight entirely during youth, and this determined the character of is
                    life-work. He was one of the first pupils in the Pennsylvania Institute for the
                    Blind, a pioneer school of the kind, and by the time he reached his majority he
                    had taken up teaching of the blind as a profession. From that time until the
                    close of a long life the rendering of service to those that sit in darkness was
                    with him a pursuit and a passion. Between 1839 and 1848 he taught in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , 
                  Ohio, Tennessee
                and 
                        Kentucky
                    . His first connection with this State was a matter of chance. In
                    the spring  of 1844 James M. Ray, of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , while attending the General Assembly of the Presbyterian church at 
                        Louisville
                    , witnessed, by invitation, an exhibition of blind pupils from the 
                        Kentucky
                     itu stitution, under Mr. Church. Mr. Ray, who is honored in our
                    history as a leader in all good works, was at once interested in behalf of the
                    blind of his own State, and through his invitation Mr. Churchman during the next
                    session of the Indiana Legislautre, brought some of his pupils to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to demonstrate what education had done for them. The Legislature
                    was enough impressed to levy a tax of two mills on each hundred
                    dollars' worth of taxable property to be applied in placing the blind
                    children of the State in other institutions until a school should be established
                    here. It should be added that the 
                        United States
                     census reports did not show many blind children to exist in the
                    State, and taking this as a basis the case did not seem to call for a very
                    liberal provision.
            At the session of 1845-6 James M. Ray and George W. Mears, in connection with the
                    secretary, auditor and treasurer of State, were appointed to administer the
                    funds, which, in the collection, proved to be enough to place twenty pupils in
                    the nearest existing institutions at a cost of $100 per year each.
            A word as to the status of the blind at that period. They were wholly
                    dependent–"a neglected, unhappy class," without
                    hope of taking any part in the world's work, and with no prospect of
                    being other than the veriest paupers if thrown upon their own resources. No
                    other defective was quite so unfortunate. There were many things the deaf-mute
                    could do. the victim of insanity, presumably, was at least less sensible of his
                    misforune; but the blind, unless specially trained, were pitiably helpless and
                    were acutely sensitive to it. The champions of their cause saw for them
                    possibilities of usefulness, independence and happiness, and with this incentive
                    for zeal the trustees proceeded to carry out their benevolent duties, never
                    doubting the eager co-operation of the beneficiaries, the only trouble they
                    anticipated being in the selection of the fortunate twenty from the many
                    applicants. Their first experimental step was interesting and educative. Through
                    newspapers and by circular they advertised broadcast the "benevolent
                    objects of the Legislature," and lo! as a result there were just five
                    applicants. The trustees were "exceedingly disappointed," and
                    on looking more closely into the matter learned that their experience was but a
                    repetition  of what had occurred in other
                    States, and- that, as they concluded, "the affections of the mothers of
                    the helpless blind required stronger assurances than your trustees could make in
                    publication." before commiting their tender charges into the hands of
                    strangers. It is not the only instance on record when philanthropic zeal failed
                    to reckon correctly with the human nature it had to deal with. In a word, not
                    only the State Legislature and the public generally, but the proposed recipients
                    of the benefaction had to be educated. In this dilemma the perplexed trustees
                    turned to William Churchman as one who knew and could advise. He proffered his
                    services, presented his plan, and with a horse, wagon and driver was put into
                    the field to seek out and visit personally homes having blind inmates, and to
                    create in such families ambition and confidence. Equipped with a specimen book
                    printed in raised letters, and some samples of handcraft made by blind pupils of
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     institution, he traveled about 1,520 miles through thirty-six
                    Indiana counties. This was in the early fall of 1846. The result was that the
                    twenty pupils the State could then care for were found and placed, eleven at the 
                        Ohio
                     institution and nine in 
                        Kentucky
                    . Moreover twenty-eight others of eligible age were found, and the
                    canvasser established the gross inaccuracy of the Federal census enumeration as
                    regarded this class.
            In 1847 the Indiana school for the blind was established with George W. Mears,
                    Seton W. Norris and James M. Ray as trustees; W. H. Churchman as acting
                    principal, at a salary of $800 per year; L. S. Newell, teacher of
                    music; Caleb Scudder, steward and master of handicraft; Samuel McGibben,
                    assistant mechanic; Mrs. Margaret Demoss, matron and mistress of handicraft, and
                    Miss Sarah Marsh, assistant. Mr. Churchman was made "acting"
                    principal because, with all the confidence in him, there existed no precedent
                    for fully installing a blind man in so responsible a position, and it was not
                    until 1851 that the trustees so far overcame their conservatism as to appoint
                    him superintendent in full. One of his first duties in his new capacity was to
                    visit all the leading institutions for the blind in the country to inform
                    himself of the latest improvements in methods of instruction and of
                    administration, and also to select in person books and apparatus.
            The beginning of the institution was on an humble scale in a rented building so
                    scant in its accommodations that the trustees had  to put up a cheap additional structure for a
                    workshop. The full list of the books for the blind at that time did not exceed
                    thirty and the entire equipment of books and apparatus cost but a little over
                    one hundred dollars. The total expense for the year was a little in excess of
                    $6,000. The term began with nine pupils only, but increased to thirty
                    and established a record among the institutions of the country for the first
                    year's attendance. Another promise for bigger things that year was the
                    purchase for $5,000 of the eight acres between Meridian and
                    Pennsylvania streets still used, and which was then described as
                    "adjoining 
                        Indianapolis
                     on the north."
            Mr. Churchman's first connection with the institution lasted until
                    October of 1853, up to which period he did pioneer work in establishing a
                    standard of excellence second to none. He advertised the aims and the efficiency
                    of the institution throughout the State by several educational campaigns with
                    his more advanced pupils through various sections, and, what was of vast
                    importance from the viewpoint of efficiency and progress, he sought to keep
                    before the public and the powers that were the peculiar problems of the work,
                    particularly the industrial problems, as only an expert could do. He pointed out
                    the fact that after the blind have been educated they still are not in a normal
                    relation to the world or on an equal' footing with those who see when
                    it comes to taking actual part in the struggle for existence. He also paid much
                    attention to the causes of blindness and published the statistics, forerunning
                    in that direction the recent work of Dr. Hurty who, through the State Board of
                    Health, has been ardently endeavoring to reduce blindness by showing where it is
                    preventable.
            Mr. Churchman may almost be spoken of as the father of the large building for the
                    blind still standing. In its materialization much was left to him. After a
                    thorough study of institutional buildings elsewhere he elaborated and personally
                    supervised plans that were drawn for him by a local draftsman, John Elder.
                    Subsequently the services of Francis Costigan of 
                        Madison
                    , perhaps the best-known architect in the State, were secured, but
                    Mr. Churchman kept track of every detail of construction, and tradition survives
                    of his detecting mortar, imperfectly mixed, that was going into the walls, and
                    of unsatisfactory bracings in the woodwork which he located as he traversed the
                    rooms and halls tapping with his cane, and caused to be torn out and remedied.
                    When completed  this building was considered
                    one of the best and most modern structures of its kind in the country, and as
                    nearly fireproof as the art of building had then attained to. Its cost was about
                    $68,000.
            Just as this building was completed and the zealous superintendent with a fine
                    equipment in hand, was ready to push and expand his work,
                    "politics," it seems, decided that an $800 position
                    ought to be connected up with some one more valuable to the reigning powers. At
                    any rate an old and vicious custom, prevailed and for a party reasons a faithful
                    public servant especially fitted for his important work, was summarily ousted
                    and replaced by a series of incumbents who, no matter what their natural
                    capacities, were so unadapted to the business in hand that the confession of
                    ignorance by at least two of them was positively naive. Of course the
                    institution continued to exist–even to grow, but one who carefully
                    examines the reports of Mr. Churchman and his successors will find a fundamental
                    difference which is the difference between an expert at his life's work
                    and a novice at a temporary job. At various times we have rumors of defection
                    within, criticism from without, and even of improper liberties taken by the
                    superintendent with girl pupils. All that is scandal of the past, but it points
                    its moral.
            In 1861 Mr. Churchman was recalled to the superintendency of the blind and
                    retained that position without interruption for eighteen years. The reiterated
                    appreciation and praise voiced during that period by the various trustees with
                    whom he worked was something more than perfunctory courtesy. One of the
                    trustees's reports affirms that "to his zeal and ability and
                    devotion to this work we are indebted for its superior condition and efficiency,
                    ranking, as it does, as one of the first if not the best school for the
                    education of the blind in the 
                        United States
                    ," and it further states that "his plans and ideas
                    have been studied, copied and made the model for other and older
                    States," while "his administration has been not only
                    appreciated at home but recognized abroad." In 1866 the trustees of the 
                        New York
                     State institution chose and elected him as the head of their
                    establishment, offering him as an inducement a salary nearly double that which
                    he received here, but at the earnest solicitation of our trustees he declined
                    the flattering offer that had been thrust upon him and remained here. It was by
                    his initiative that a convention of the educators of the blind, the second of
                    its kind, perhaps, in the world, was held in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1871. He was made chairman 
                    of its meetings, which were well attended from all over the country, and at the
                    close a permanent association of "American Instructors of the
                    Blind" was formed, with Mr. Churchman as one of the vice-presidents.
            Mr. Churchman illustrated within himself to a remarkable degree the possibilities
                    of the blind. Mentally he was no ordinary man. As a scholar his knowledge was
                    extraordinary. As a thinker he was vigorous, searching and subtle, and the ease
                    and clearness with which he could expound a profound and far-reaching subject
                    was a matter for wonder to those less gifted. In his report of 1866 a long
                    disquisition on the blind viewed largely from the angle of philosophy and
                    psychology shows admirably the wide range of his mind, and from long training in
                    dictation he expressed himself verbally with the same facility, as his friends
                    well remember. Even more remarkable were his powers of minute observation and
                    his mastery of facts and details. A little story is apropos here. The present
                    writer's father, a merchant tailor in 
                        Indianapolis
                     during the fifties, first met Mr. Churchman when he came into his
                    store one day and requested to "see" some fabric for a suit of
                    clothes. The skeptical tailor, with a touch of facetiousness, threw out a number
                    of bolts on his counter, the two at the opposite ends being identical. The
                    customer went along the line carefully feeling each piece of cloth till he came
                    to the end, when he turned up his face attentively. Then he went back to the
                    first bolt and fingered it once more. "Why," he said,
                    "these two are just the same."
            Mr. Churchman left the institution in 1879, and the last three years of his life
                    were spent with his half brother, F. M. Churchman, whose home was six miles
                    southeast of the city, and there he died very suddenly on May 17, 1882. His
                    funeral services were held in the chapel of the institution with which he was so
                    intimately identified, and the chief speaker was the Rev. Oscar C. McCulloch,
                    than whom no one was better fitted to pay sympathetic respect to a strong and
                    useful man.
         
         
         
            Some Memoirs of the Polke, Piety Mccoy, Mcquaid, and Mathes Families
            By the late JAMES POLKE of 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana
            The reminiscences which follow were written about 1886 by Elder James Polke, who
                    was a nephew of Judge William Polke, whose account of his captivity by the Miami
                    Indians was published in the June number of this magazine. James Polke was born
                    in 
                        Shelby county
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    , 1804. Two years later he came with his father to 
                        Knox county
                     and there spent almost his whole life. He was a prominent citizen
                    of the Maria Creek settlement, helped organize the present Maria Creek Baptist
                    church in 1833, and was well acquainted with the people of that historic
                    neighborhood. He was a witness of and a participant in that long struggle in the
                    Baptist church which hindered its progress for a quarter of a century. The
                    struggle arose over the origin of evil and resulted in the formation of the two
                    factions known as the "one seed" and the "two
                    seed" Baptists. This struggle had hardly reached its height when
                    another of greater virulence arose over the question of sending out
                    missionaries. The old or "one seed" school regarded missions
                    as sacrilegious, as the attempt of men to interfere with the work of God.
                    Another large faction of the church followed Alexander Campbell and formed the
                    Christian church. Elder Isaac McCoy, an uncle of James Polke and a
                    brother-in-law of Judge William Polke, was a leader in the missionary work among
                    the Indians. His papers, which were deposited by his son in the 
                        Kansas
                     State Historical Society, and those of William Polke, if they have
                    been preserved, will throw a great deal of light on the history of the Indians
                    in Indiana. These pioneers objected to the treatment the Indians were receiving
                    at the hands of the traders and tried to inaugurate a plan whereby the Indians
                    might be educated, Christianized and thus transformed into citizens. A half
                    century after their labors ceased the government, under the Dawes Act, put their
                    plan into successful operation, and has thereby saved a few of the red men from
                    destruction.
            It will be noticed that the southern members of the Polk family 
                    
                  TABLE I
                  
               
                     write their names "Polk,"
                    while most of those who came to 
                        Kentucky
                     and Indiana add a final "e." The original name is
                    "Pollock." Such variations in spelling family names were not
                    uncommon in pioneer days.
            These memoirs were written by Mr. Polk at various times, the last part having
                    been written July 15, 1886, immediately before his death. There is some
                    duplication in the story, but so little that it has been thought best to print
                    it almost entire. The writer, however, gives two accounts of his trip to 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in 1821 and these have been combined by the editor into a single
                    continuous narrative.
            The genealogy of the Polk family offers a great many difficulties, chiefly on
                    account of the great number of its members and their wide dispersion. The
                    founder of the family in 
                        America
                     was Robert Bruce Polk and Magdalene Tasker Polke, who came to
                    America from 
                        Ireland
                     and settled in 
                        Maryland
                     in 1672. They had nine children, as shown in table I below. The
                    second son, William, had a large family and from two of his sons, William and
                    Charles, are descended the members of the family spoken of in these memoirs. The
                    latter son was an Indian trader on the upper Potomac. The former moved west to
                    the frontier then at 
                        Carlisle
                    , Pennsylvania. Here he married Margaret Taylor. He intended to go
                    west to the 
                        Ohio
                    , but the Indians were in an ugly mood and he turned south, going to
                    the back country of 
                        North Carolina
                    . This was in 1750. He and his sons took a prominent part in the
                    Revolution. A son, Colonel Thomas Polk, married a sister of General Evan Shelby,
                    the hero of King's Mountain. President James K. Polk was a grandson of
                    Ezekiel Polk, a son of the pioneer named above and a signer of the Mecklinburg
                    Declaration. Table I shows this branch of the family. The family includes a
                    large number of prominent men both in State and National affairs.
            Charles Polk, the Indian trader mentioned above, was the second son of William,
                    the second son of Robert Bruce Polk. Charles had a store at the north bend of
                    the Potomac river in 
                        Frederick county
                    , 
                        Maryland
                    . He is mentioned in Christopher Gist's Journal and also in
                    the Colonial Records of Pennsylvania. He had six children, all of whom came west
                    as narrated by James Polk in the memoirs. Table II below shows his descendants.
            Charles Polke, 2d, was the fifth son of the Indian trader. He 
                    
                  TABLE II
                  
               
                     reached 
                        Kentucky
                     about 1780. Judge William Polke, a member of the Indiana
                    Constitutional convention of 1816, was his eldest son. Judge Polke was Indian
                    agent at 
                        Fort Wayne
                     for many years. His-oldest sister married Captain Spier Spencer, of 
                        Harrison county
                    , who was killed at 
                        Tippecanoe
                    . His second sister, Sarah, married William Bruce, founder of
                    Bruceville, and a personal friend of Lincoln. His third sister, Nancy, married
                    Peter Ruby, and their descendants live in several parts of Indiana. The fourth
                    sister, Christiana, married Rev. Isaac McCoy and spent most of her life with her
                    husband as a missionary among the Indians. Dr. Thomas Polk, a younger brother,
                    went to 
                        Texas
                     in 1820 and took an honorable part in the Texan war of liberation.
                    Charles, 3d, another brother, took part in the campaign of 
                        Tippecanoe
                     with nearly all the men of the family, and later settled down in 
                        Knox county
                    , where his descendants are still living.
            Table III below shows the relationships of the Perry county Polkes, most of whom
                    are the descendants of the Rev. Charles Polke, who sat for Perry county in the
                    Constitutional convention of 1816. The Guthries, Ballards and Thrustons, of 
                        Louisville
                    , are related to this branch. The Polke family of Greenwood,
                    Indiana, are descended from James Polk, seventh son of Edmond Polk, who came to 
                        Kentucky
                     in 1780.1

            CHARLES POLKE, SR.2
            
            "Charles Polke was born about the year 1744, and when thirty-years old
                    (1774), was married to Delilah Tyler, of 
                        Virginia
                    . Ed-mond died at the age of eighty-seven years; Sally Polke Piety
                    at the age of ninety-eight; Thomas died about the age of sixty. Charles Polke,
                    Sr., died in 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana, in the year 1823, at the age of seventy-nine. Their
                    numerous descendants are now scattered over the West and Southwest, to 
                        California
                     and 
                        Oregon
                     and the territories.
            "Charles Polke, as related above, removed to 
                        Kentucky
                     and settled in 
                  Nelson
                        county, Kentucky
               , about seven miles from Bards-town. The Indian
                    tribes were hostile, and the early settlers were compelled to erect and live in
                    stockade forts for their protection and safety.
            "In the year 1782, in the month of August, a band of Indians crossed
                    over the Ohio river near the mouth of the 
                        Kentucky
                    , about fifty or sixty miles from 
                        Bardstown
                    , and surprised or set fire to the fort in which Charles Polke, Sr.,
                    and family lived; and in the darkness of the night it was burned down and all
                    the inmates were killed or made prisoners by the Indians.
            "The celebrated Indian fighter and hunter, Bland Ballard, while out
                    hunting some twenty miles from this fort, discovered a band of Indian warriors
                    on the day previous to its being burned. These Indians were making towards the
                    station near 
                        Louisville
                     or 
                        Bardstown
                    . Bland Ballard hastened to the station to give them warning of
                    their danger, and an effective force under Captain Charles Polke, Sr., sallied
                    forth to surprise the Indians, as it was not known what station they intended to
                    attack; but they failed to discover them. It was afterward ascertained that the
                    Indians were in ambush near the fort when Bland Ballard arrived the evening
                    before, and in the early morning the fort was burned down.
            "Mrs. Delilah Polke and four children were taken prisoners, to-wit:
                    William, seven years of age, and three younger sisters, Elizabeth (Polke)
                    Spencer, Sally (Polke) Bruce and Nancy (Polke). Ruby. The Indians departed from
                    the burnt fort in haste to get back to their comrades over the Ohio
                        river, which they reached on

                    station (known afterward as the 'burnt station'), with the
                    prisoners whom they did not kill. They crossed over in the canoes which were
                    concealed on the 
                        Kentucky
                     side, being now out of danger of pursuit. Here were encamped a
                    large band of Indians with their horses and plenty of provisions gathered in
                    store by their hunters on their arrival; and from here near the mouth of the
                        Kentucky river they traveled slowly to the Maumee near 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , and thence down the Auglaize to Lake Erie, and thence to
                            
                  Detroit, Michigan
               , which at that day
                    was held by a British garrison. Mrs. Polke and a part of the children were taken
                    to the fort and there remained. And here in this British garrison my father,
                    Charles Polke, Jr., was born on the 20th of October, 1782, about two months
                    after the capture of his mother and her children near 
                  Bardstown, Kentucky
               , distant some four hundred miles.
            "My grandfather spent his time in traveling and trying to find out the
                    fate and fortune of his wife and children; and I have heard him tell of coming
                    out to "Old Post" 
                        Vincennes
                     in 1783, and here at this Old Trading Post he got word through
                    Indians or Indian traders of the safety of his wife and children at 
                        Detroit
                    , about eleven months after their capture by the Indians.
            "He immediately set out for 
                        Detroit
                    , arriving there about one year after their capture. He had the good
                    fortune and the joy of again meeting and greeting his wife and the captured
                    children, and in addition, the little stranger Charlie about ten months old.
                    After remaining at 
                        Detroit
                     for a time, it being the close of the Revolutionary war, the
                    British officer in command, General de Peyster, gave him every assistance for
                    their safe return, and secured the services of Simon Girty to pilot them through
                    the wilderness of 
                        Ohio
                     to the

                        Virginia
                    . After a short stay in the region of country from whence he had
                    emigrated some three years previous to the wilds of 
                        Kentucky
                    , he came back to 
                        Kentucky
                     down the Ohio river again, poor as a church

            THOMAS PIETY
            
            "In the latter end of the eighteenth century, and during the time of the
                    English and French wars in Europe and America, at the treaty of 
                        Paris
                    , 1763, the French government ceded to 
                        England
                     "New France" and other
                    American possessions east of the Mississippi river.
            "Austin Piety, an English officer, was stationed at 'Fort
                    Pitt,' at the headwaters of the Ohio river, now
                    'Pittsburg,' Pennsylvania. He was united in marriage to Sarah
                    Polk about the year 1769. He, with his command, was ordered to Kaskaskia, on the
                        Mississippi River in 1770 by the British authorities.
                    He descended the Ohio river with his wife and troops under
                    his command, as far as the Falls of the Ohio river, and
                    there made a short stay in order to lay in a supply of buffalo and other meat;
                    from thence down the river to its mouth (now 
                        Cairo
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    ), and from thence up to their destination, 'the American
                    Bottom,' on the east side of the 
                        Mississippi
                    , opposite 
                        St. Louis
                    . During their stay the subject of this sketch, to-wit Thomas Piety,
                    Sr., was born in 1770. Austin Piety returned to Fort Pitt with his command, and
                    during the Revolutionary War reutrned to 
                        England
                    , and from thence never 
                    returned, leaving his wife, Sarah Piety, and four children in 
                        America
                    .
            "Sarah Piety, the mother of these four children (Thomas, who was the
                    oldest, and three sisters, who were younger), in company with her three
                    brothers,–Edmund, Charles and Thomas Polke,– came down the
                        Ohio river to 
                        Kentucky
                     in the year 1780. They landed at the Palls of the 
                        Ohio
                     where the city of 
                        Louisville
                     now is situated. They settled near 
                  Bardstown, Nelson
                        county, Kentucky
               , in a stockade fort to protect them from the
                    Indians, who were hostile.
            "Thomas Piety was united in marriage with Miss Mary Duncan, when he was
                    about twenty years of age, and shortly afterwards joined General Arthur
                    Sinclair's [St. Clair's] army against the Indian tribes of the
                    Northwest. Thomas Piety was in the. battle of General Sinclair's
                    Defeat, 1791, and was wounded; but he and a wounded soldier were mounted on a
                    small pony horse and saved themselves in the retreat and returned home to 
                        Kentucky
                    . He lived in 
                        Kentucky
                     until the year 1814, and then moved to Indiana Territory in company
                    with Abram McClelland and family.
            "They settled where the town of 
                        Carlisle
                     now stands in the winter of 1814-15. The Indians stole all their
                    horses, which he had taken in payment for his land in 
                        Kentucky
                    . In the month of February he removed into Polke's Fort in 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana Territory. In August following Thomas Piety and family
                    settled on Congress lands on Maria creek, and here secured a home where he lived
                    and died, 1835, aged about sixty-five years. His wife survived him many years,
                    and died at the advanced age of eighty-two years. They were buried side by side,
                    with a monumental stone upon which are engraved their respective ages and dates
                    of their deaths, with that of children and grandchildren, near the Maria Creek
                    Christian Church, on the banks of Maria creek.
            "I cannot describe the jottings of the life of Thomas Piety, Sr., who
                    lived and died on the outskirts of civilization, without stating some further
                    particulars and incidents of -his eventful life. He claimed to be the first
                    American-born child in the Northwest Territory (1770). I have often made this
                    statement, and on searching the pages of the early history for the nearest
                    approach to it, find that it is that of Mrs. Heckewelder, born near 
                        Marietta

                        Ohio
                    , in the year 1781, eleven years afterward. At the present writing,
                    1884, there are four survivors yet living, the descendants of Thomas  Piety, Sr., and wife, to-wit: Mrs. Sally P. Risly,
                    86 years, who still resides on the old farm of her father, Mrs. Ann P. Taylor in
                    the Rock River country of 
                        Illinois
                    , William D. Piety, near 
                        Bruceville
                    , 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana, 76 years of age, and Mrs. Susan P. MlcOuaid of 
                        Franklin

                    , 72 years of age.
            "There were born to them thirteen children, six sons and seven
                    daughters, all of whom were fully grown men and women with exception of, who
                    died aged four years in the year 1818. The descendants of Thomas Piety are now
                    to be found all over the Northwest and Southwest from 
                        Texas
                     to

            ISAAC MCCOY
            
            "But who is this Isaac McCoy? He is of Irish descent, and was born near
                    Uniontown, Pennsylvania, June 13, 1784. When he was six years of age his father,
                    William McCoy, and his mother, Elizabeth McCoy, removed to 
                        Shelby county
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    . He was converted at the age of. sixteen years, and baptized by
                    Joshua Morris, March 6, 1801. The best schools around him could only teach him
                    reading, writing, and arithmetic, but he made rapid progress in grace and
                    knowledge. He was married before he was twenty years old to Miss Christiana
                    Polke, a daughter of Captain Charles Polke. She was a lady most admirably
                    adapted to the great work that was before him, though then unseen. At the age of
                    twenty-six years he was ordained at the Baptist church at 
                        Maria creek
                    , 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana Territory, about fiften miles north of the 
                        Old Post Vincennes
                    , which church he and his wife had joined by letter in the year
                    1810, only one year after its organization, which took place on the 20th of May,
                    1809, with thirteen members.
            "The 
                        Wabash
                     Association was formed in 1809. At the beginning of this
                    association it contained only two ministers, to-wit, Isaac McCoy and Alexander
                    Devin, on the 
                        Wabash
                     and south to the Ohio river. A meeting of the 
                        Wabash
                     Association was held October 20, in the year 1810, at the 
                        Bethlehem
                     church, 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana Territory. It was composed of six churches and 143
                    members. Elder George Waller, from 
                        Shelby county

                        Kentucky
                    , preached the introductory sermon. Alexander Devin was moderator,
                    and W'illiam Polke, clerk.
            
            "After the ordination of Isaac McCoy by George Waller and Alexander
                    Devin as ministers, in 1810, at 
                        Maria creek
                     (see Benedick's History, Vol. 2, pages
                    263 and 548), Isaac McCoy purchased a small tract of land, 90 acres, on Maria
                    creek, on which he resided until 1818. He was a wheelwright by trade and during
                    all his leisure time he made and repaired spinning wheels, both large and small,
                    also frame chairs, etc. In the summer of 1818, he, in company with Elder Hinson
                    Hubbs, of 
                        Kentucky
                    , went west to 
                  St.
                        Louis, Missouri
               . He visited Rock Springs, 
                        St. Clair county

                        Illinois

                        Rock Springs
                     and a theological school was afterwards established at this place.
                    Isaac McCoy returned home only in time to witness the death of his eldest
                    daughter, Mahala, in her fourteenth year, who died the 13th day of August, 1818.
                    She is buried in the old churchyard on the banks of Maria creek.
            "Isaac McCoy engaged in the missionary work this year (1818), and
                    removed in the autumn of this year to an Indian reservation, six miles square,
                    on a township of thirty-six sections of one mile square each, situated on the
                    waters of Raccoon creek, 
                        Parke county
                    , Indiana. Here he erected buildings and a schoolhouse and opened up
                    a school, collecting a number of Indian boys and girls of French and Indian
                    descent. But in this new country he and his family were greatly afflicted by
                    sickness, and the school was suspended for a time. Isaac McCoy was attacked by
                    typhoid fever during his stay at this place, and sent to 
                        Vincennes
                    , eighty-five miles distant, for his old doctor, Jacob Kuykendall,
                    his old physician, in 
                        Knox county
                    . The doctor and my father, Charles Polke, set out on horseback, and
                    at the rate of five miles per hour made the trip in seventeen hours. The doctor
                    administered successfully and returned to his home in 
                        Vincennes
                    . But McCoy's field of labor was too circumscribed here at
                    this place, and in the spring of 1820 he went to 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , about ISO miles through the wilderness of Indian country. He
                    returned and moved to 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , and occupied the garrison barracks and other buildings which had
                    been used by the soldiers at this place. And here at this place he gathered in
                    seventy or eighty Indian children, from twelve to fifteen years of age, and
                    opened up a school, and many of them were taught to read and write.
            "Mr. McCoy traveled far and extensively, and his devoted and  self-denying wife and others attended the mission
                    family and -school until October, 1822, when McCoy removed to Carey Station,
                    situated near 
                        Niles
                    , 
                        Michigan
                    . Here he labored until the year 1829, when McCoy's whole
                    time and energies were spent in the' removal of the Indian tribes west
                    of the Mississippi river to the Indian Territory; and in
                    1830 Carey Station was abandoned.
            "In the year 1842 the American Indian Association was formed. Mr. McCoy
                    was its originator and the secretary of the same. His headquarters were at
                            
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               , and for four years
                    he pleaded the cause of the poor Indians. He died at 
                        Louisville
                     on the 21st day of June, 1846, aged 62 years.
            "When Isaac McCoy engaged, in the year 1818, in the missionary work, a
                    strong tide of opposition arose against foreign and domestic missions in the 
                        Wabash
                     and other (Baptist) associations of Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                    . The opposition to missions was headed by Daniel Parker of
                            
                  Newport, Illinois
               , and others,
                    generally known as the "Two-seed Baptists." This produced a
                    split in the 
                        Wabash
                     Association about the year 1824.
            "The Two-seed Baptists retained the name of the 
                        Wabash
                     Association. Those churches which were the advocates of missionary
                    work organized the Union Association, a large and influential body, and by this
                    name it is known at present (1881). It has held its annual meeting for sixty
                    years. The old '
                        Wabash
                     Association' after five years declined and ceased to meet
                    at its annual meeting, and today is one of the things of the past."
            CKARLES POLKE, JR.
            "Charles Polke, son of Captain Charles Polke, was born at 
                        Detroit
                    ', 
                        Michigan
                    , in the British garrison, October 20th, 1782, his father's
                    family having been taken prisoners in 
                        Kentucky
                     and taken to 
                        Detroit
                     by a band of Indian warriors. His father went to 
                        Detroit
                     in 1783, and recovered his lost ones and returned to 
                        Kentucky
                    . Few educational advantages were enjoyed in that early day, and
                    Charles Polke never had gone to school one year, all told; yet he learned to
                    read and write, and by self application was enabled to transact business and
                    become an active and useful citizen in the early settlement of Indiana
                    Territory.
            "Charles Polke came out to the '
                        Old Post Vincennes
                    ' in the  spring of
                    1806, and rented some land of Judge Henry Vanderburgh near the Fair Grounds and
                    cultivated a crop of corn. He returned to 
                        Shelby county
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    , and having sold his small farm on the waters of Clear creek and
                    Gulf's creek, near their junction at Brashear's creek or
                    headwaters of Salt River, 
                        Kentucky
                     (a river ever made memorable by many disappointed politicians of 
                        Kentucky
                     and Indiana), he emigrated to Indiana Territory on pack horses. He
                    crossed the Ohio river seven miles below 
                        Louisville
                     at Oatmans' Ferry, below the highlands on the west side of
                    the Ohio river. He traveled along the Indian trace by way
                    of Corydon, the Blue river barrens, the French Licks, down
                    the Patoka river, past White Oak Springs and the Mud Holes
                    to White river, crossing it below the junction of east and
                    west forks at Wright's old ferry to 
                        Vincennes
                    . This was the old route through the wilderness to the Falls on the
                        Ohio river, and no wagon or carriage had ever passed
                    through it until 1808, when a train of emigrants came through to 
                        Vincennes
                    , with their wagons and stock following this old buffalo and Indian
                    traceway as above described.
            "Charles Polke made short stay in 
                        Vincennes
                    . He bought 100 acres of land on the waters of Maria creek, 15 miles
                    north of 
                        Vincennes
                    , and during the year 1807 erected a log cabin and commenced
                    improving here on these lands. The Miami and 
                        Delaware
                     Indian hunting grounds were here, and during the fall season they
                    were encamped all along Maria creek at the springs of water, and were peaceable
                    until 1809 and 1810. Then they became troublesome, being set on by British
                    agents, by Tecumseh and other war chiefs. This new country was grown up with
                    high grass and on the prairies and barrens the fires in the fall of the year
                    were terrific. There were no roads, no farms, and little or no stock to graze it
                    down. The fires would run all over the lands from the Wabash
                    river to White river, leaving prairies black and
                    bleak, and the barrens and small glades with few exceptions in the same
                    condition. On the north, Busseron creek with its few settlers was the limit of
                    the white settlements, and on the east we were on the outside settlement to the
                    border settlements of the 
                        Ohio
                     State line on the waters of the White Water
                    river in 
                        Wayne
                     and 
                        Franklin
                     counties, Indiana. This remained a new country for forty years and
                    was subject to great sufferings from sickness, fever and ague prevailing among
                    the border settlers and whole families being prostrated by  sickness, not one member being able to help
                    another. The sickness brought about great suffering but did not prove fatal to
                    that extent that might be supposed. The War of 1812 between the 
                        United States
                     and 
                        England
                     terminated December, 1814; and the tide of immigration flowing in
                    from the surrounding states, this wild condition of our country soon changed and
                    Indiana Territory in 1816 became the State of Indiana.
            "Charles Polke was at the battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , November 7, 1811, going with General
                    Harrison's army up the 
                        Wabash
                    . On their way they erected the 'Outpost Fort
                    Harrison' a few miles above the city of 
                        Terre Haute
                    . But these are all matters of history on which I need not dwell. In
                    the year 1816 Indiana Territory became* the State
                    of Indiana and 
                        Knox county
                    –the mother county– extended north to the
                    southern end of Lake Michigan.
            "Charles Polke died in the year 1845, aged 63 years, having lived to see
                    wonderful changes in his day over all the wild country of northern Indiana. He
                    saw the wilderness and solitary places give way to the tide of immigration of
                    civilized and Christianized men and women; and in place of the Indian wigwams
                    and war-whoop he saw those waste places become the homes of civilized man with
                    farms and villages, towns and cities, with school houses, church houses,
                    railroads, etc. But on these changes I need not now dwell, and therefore will
                    bring to a close these jottings of pioneer life."
            JAMES POLKE
            
            "James Polke, author of these memoirs, the eldest son of Charles Polke
                    and Margaret his wife, was born on the 5th day of September, 1804, in 
                        Shelby county
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    , near the junction of Clear creek and Gulf's creek,
                    forming Brashear's creek, a tributary of Salt
                    river, which runs into the Ohio river below the
                    city of 
                        Louisville
                    .
            "My father, Charles Polke, was united in marriage with Margaret McQuaid,
                    the eldest daughter of Rev. James McQuaid, in the year 1803. My father bought a
                    small tract of land in the deep and dark forest of that early day of pioneer
                    life in that (then) new country. The locality of his new home proved to be
                    sickly, subject to fever and ague and in the year 1806 he sold out his new home
                    and came out to '
                        Old Post Vincennes
                    .'
            
            "My father carried me in his lap on horseback and my mother carried my
                    eldest sister (Delilah), then about nine months old. With their pack horses they
                    rode through the wilderness over one hundred miles and arrived at the
                    'Old Post' in September, 1806. The village was composed of
                    French inhabitants and Indian traders, with but few American inhabitants. Major
                    William Bruce, a brother-in-law of my father, had come to Indiana Territory in
                    1805 and settled about 8 miles north of 
                        Vincennes
                    , where the town of Bruceville is now located, lots having been sold
                    in 1816. My father spent the first winter here and during his stay bought 100
                    acres of land on the waters of Maria creek. In the early spring of 1807 he
                    erected a cabin house on this land and made a permanent settlement. He lived and
                    died on the same (in 1845), my mother surviving him ten years and dying in 1855,
                    aged 70 years. The first dawning of my memory of the things of my eventful life
                    were here in this humble cabin house. Here we were in Indiana Territory, the
                    country wild and unsettled, surrounded by Indians in this (then) wilderness
                    land. The Indians camped and hunted around us during their hunting season and
                    the crack of the rifle could be heard almost any day, killing deer, wild turkeys
                    and other game; but all was peaceable then. About the year 1810 things were
                    changed by the influence of British traders over the war chiefs among the Indian
                    tribes of the Northwest; but this is a matter of history, as are the Indian war
                    of 1811 and the British war of 1812 which followed, and the peace that followed
                    in 1815.
            "In this new country, as indicated, my experience of life commenced and
                    for die first -5 years of my life events are deeply imprinted on the tablet of
                    my heart and memory. The Indian War of 1811 was fast looming up and my father
                    took me on horseback behind him to my grandfather's in 
                        Shelby county
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    . We traveled the trace-way by which he had come to Indiana
                    Territory in 1806–through the Blue River Barrens
                    by 
                        Corydon
                    , 
                        Harrison County
                    , Indiana. My uncle, Spier Spencer, the first sheriff of the county
                    (1808), lived here. He had been with General Sinclair [St. Clair] and General
                    Wayne in the early Indian wars. He had organized a volunteer company to fight
                    the savage Indians of the 
                        Upper Wabash
                     on the 
                        Tippecanoe
                    . I saw him parade his company in the streets of Corydon. He joined
                    General Harrison at 
                        Vincennes
                    , then the headquarters. My father soon returned to Indiana  and joined in General Harrison's
                    campaign to 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , which was fought on the 7th of November, 1811. Those brave heroes
                    fell–Joseph Daviess, Abram Owen, Captain Spencer and others. The army
                    returned by Fort Harrison, an outpost erected by the army on their march up the
                        Wabash river, sixty miles norh of 
                        Vincennes
                     in the immediate neighborhood of 
                        Terre Haute
                    , Indiana.
            "I remained in 
                        Kentucky
                     two years and in August, 1813, returned home to 
                        Knox county
                    . I was sent to such schools as were common at that day and learned
                    to spell and read some. My mother and five small children, with a portion of
                    William Polke's family, were sent to 
                        Kentucky
                     in the spring of 1813, and all returned in August, 1813, as above
                    stated, to the old fort on William Polke's farm. In the early spring of
                    1814, my father removed his family to our old cabin house on the farm and risked
                    all danger from roving war parties of Indians in their raids on the frontiers of
                    Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                     Territories.
            "In the year 1821, when I was seventeen years of age, I went with Judge
                    William Polke and his sister, Mrs. Christiana McCoy, with her four small
                    children to 
                        Fort Wayne
                     on horseback. (William Polk and Christiana McCoy, wife. of the Rev.
                    Isaac McCoy, and four small children, had just made the voyage down the 
                        Wabash
                     in a pirogue or large canoe in the month of Aipril from 
                        Fort Wayne
                    . They floated down the stream by day and when the night came on
                    they landed their canoe and struck up camp on the bank of the river, taking
                    their tent, camping equipage, etc., from the canoe, remaining over night and
                    renewing their journey next day. They were ten days making this voyage by the
                    river from 
                        Ft. Wayne
                    , Indiana to 
                        Vincennes
                    . The mosquitoes were very thick in these forests and annoyed them
                    at their landings.) We set out on the 5th of September, 1821, from 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana, up the Wabash river by way of Merom
                    and 
                        Terre Haute
                    , which was a small town at that early day. We took dinner five
                    miles above the town at Colonel Turtle's, and setting Christiana McCoy,
                    a sister of William Polke out, crossing Otter creek at 
                        Markleville
                    , and from thence to Jacob Bell's on Raccoon creek,
                    remaining over night. We set out the next morning and made a short stop at
                    dinner at our old friend Lemuel Morman's, in the
                    'Hart' settlement on the outside or frontier at that early
                    day. And here taking the Indian trace through the wilderness of forest trees up
                    Raccoon creek, we made our first encampment in the wilderness  at a deserted Indian village, on Little Raccoon
                    creek, called 'Cornstalk village,' about two miles from 
                        Ladoga
                     of the present day and about ten miles from Craw ford sville,
                    Indiana. The following day we passed old 'Thorntown,' a
                    deserted village in 
                        Boone county
                     on the head waters of Sugar creek. The third night we struck up
                    camp on the waters of Deer creek and on the fourth day we crossed Pipe creek
                    about five miles from the Missionary town and here were the Indian wigwams or
                    camps still held by the Manu [Munsee] Indians, some sixty or seventy in number.
                    We crossed the rocky streams at their town and traveled ten miles and crossed
                        Wabash river near the mouth of Salamony or Lagro of the
                    present day. We traveled, we supposed, about thirty miles a day, in Indian
                    style, along these narrow traceways and often got into yellow jackets'
                    nests which wild animals had torn out.
            "The northern portion of Indiana was a wilderness from 
                        Parke county
                    , Indiana, on the waters of Raccoon creek, to 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , 150 miles distant. We were five days in this wilderness country,
                    camping out of nights. We would put bells on our horses and hobble them at
                    night, to feed on the wild pea vine and blue grass pastures along the trace-way.
                    We traveled the Indian trace up the 
                        Wabash
                     by way of 
                        Ladoga
                    , old Thorntown, on the head waters of the Sugar creek, crossing
                    Wildcat, Deer and 
                        Pike
                     creeks, to Massunaway at the old town. There were about sixty
                    Indians in their bark houses at this place. We crossed the Wabash
                        river near the mouth of Salamony, near Lagro, thence up to the
                    forks of the river, at 
                        Huntington
                    , thence by Raccoon village or 
                        Roanoke
                     to the portage dividing the waters of the 
                        Wabash
                     south and the waters of the Maumee north. I was then 17 years of
                    age. We arrived safely at the fort and found all alive, it being the time of the
                    payment to the Indians of some $20,000 and other goods, the Miamis
                    and Pottawattamies.
            "
                        Fort Wayne
                     was not occupied by soldiers, but the 'Old Fort'
                    and barracks and flagstaff with flag fluttering in the breeze were there. A few
                    Indian traders were in log huts in the village, the Ewings and Coquelards. Also
                    a few settlers in the neighborhood and the Indian agent, Benjamin Kircheville
                    [or Kercheval]. The fort stood at the junction of St. Mary's and 
                        St. Joseph
                    's rivers which form the Maumee river,
                    flowing to Lake Erie, and made memorable by General Harmer's defeat in
                    1790 by the Indians.  Here I saw the last
                    grand rally of the Indians, 700 in number, encamped around the old fort to
                    receive heir money from the Indian agent, about $20,000, and other
                    goods which suited their modes of living–blankets, guns, powder and
                    lead, knives, camping kettles, etc.
            "The village consisted of a few log houses outside the fort and some
                    cultivated land. The Indian traders, the Ewings, Coquelards, etc., had goods in
                    the log houses for the Indian trade. The barracks of the fort was used for the
                    missionary's family, by Elder Isaac McCoy and for schooling Indian
                    children. A number of Indian children from ten to twenty years were collected in
                    this missionary school and many were learning to read and write.
            "After a few days stay, my uncle, Judge William Polke and I returned. I
                    had enjoyed a fishing party down the Maumee two or three miles with the Indian
                    boys in a large canoe, with gigs. We took in some nice fish. Our journey through
                    the wilderness afforded much to talk of for many years.
            "In 1822, the Rev. Isaac McCoy removed his missionary family and school
                    to the St. Joseph river, 
                        Michigan
                    , near the city of 
                        Niles
                    , 
                        Berrien county
                    , about fifteen furlongs from the late at the mouth of the
                        St. Joseph river. This had once been the home of the
                    Pottawattamie Indians, as shown by the large section of land grown over with
                    blue grass and corn hills for many miles and other traces of early Indian
                    settlements and their traditions.
            "Judge William Polke had joined in the missionary work at 
                        Fort Wayne
                     and followed it up in the new fields of labon In order to obtain a
                    supply of pork for their family of near eighty persons (including the Indian
                    children attending school), he came to Indiana to purchase hogs to be driven on
                    foot to the Carey Mission, 
                        Michigan
                    . In the month of December, 1823, he left 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana. Mr. Polke got four hands to assist him in his undertaking
                    of collecting and driving hogs through this wilderness to 
                        Michigan
                    . Mr. John Hansbrough and George W. Linsey, sons-in-law of Mr.
                    Polke, and John Cox and myself (then in my nineteenth year) agreed to go to 
                        Michigan
                     with this drove of hogs. We went through 
                        Clay county
                     and bought hogs on the Walnut fork of Eel
                    river, near the town of Bowlingreen, the first county seat laid off
                    for 
                        Clay county
                    , Indiana. We were successful in gathering together our drove of
                    hogs off the oak and hickory and beechwoods.  These hogs lived, grew and fattened in the woods. The hogs were bought and
                    the price paid in silver money was $1.25 per hundred, gross weight,
                    or about $1.50, net weight. We set out from this frontier
                    neighborhood by way of 
                  Greencastle, Putnam
                    county
                and from thence to 
                  Crawfordsville, Montgomery county
               , Indiana. Here we were on the
                    outskirts of all settlement. Four families had gone into the Wea Prairie some
                    fifteen miles distant the spring before, and plowed up a hundred acres of
                    prairie and planted it in corn before the lands were opened for sale or
                    settlement. We reached this settlement the first night after leaving 
                        Crawfordsville
                    . Proceeding the next day, we reached the Wabash
                    river below the mouth of Wildcat creek, at Davis's Indian
                    trading-house on the west side of the river Wabash. We had
                    two horses with us on which were packed our camping equipage and our provisions
                    on this journey of over 115 miles distance.
            "We succeeded in getting a long perogin [pirogue] and a canoe from his
                    trading-house across the river with some assistance, and forcing the hogs into
                    the river between these water crafts, they all swam across the river safely.
                    Then we swam our horses across above our canoe. It was a cold swim as there was
                    snow on the ground and ice on the river. But we were fortunate in getting these
                    watercrafts and in getting our drove and horses and ourselves all landed over
                    the river Wabash, which was the most formidable obstacle to
                    overcome on our journey. We had a hundred miles of wilderness to travel, mainly
                    up the river Tippecanoe. And here from Davis's
                    trading-house we took the wrong Indian trace. Passing over the 
                        Tippecanoe
                     Battle Ground and leaving the trace, we bore more to the east,
                    camping out in the woods that night. The next morning, falling in company
                    with' some Indian men, they showed us the Indian trace in the prairie
                    north of the Battle Ground, some two miles above it.
            "On the second day we came to the banks of the Tippecanoe
                        river and crossed the 
                        Little Tippecanoe
                    , encamping in an open barren country where it became cold and
                    frosty. On the third day it was bleak and cold and we encountered some
                    difficulty from the marshes being frozen over with ice. Unacquainted, we had to
                    make our way with a considerable degree of uncertainty. We had to break through
                    these frozen-over marshes and wade through the ice and water
                    as they came, also all the creeks before us. This was  severe at times in the open prairies and barrens.
                    However, in all our journey we were never in ice and water over waist deep, Qn
                    the third night we encamped near a bluff on the Tippecanoe
                    river, near where the place of 
                        Monticello
                     in 
                        White county
                     is now situated. There is a great sameness in the appearance of the
                    country up this river, made up of barrens and strips of low prairie with palms,
                    etc., until you reach the southern bend of 
                        St. Joseph
                    's river. Sumptuous Prairie is the largest prairie in this
                    section of the country, with some good burr-oak barrens, etc., and good-looking
                    lands.
            "We were six days out from our crossing the Wabash
                    river, arriving at our journey's end on the 24th day of
                    December, 1823. The next day was Christmas Eve and a good merry time spent at
                    Carey Station on the waters of the 
                        St. Joseph
                    , the first and last of it ever seen by me. After a few days,
                    December 27, we four persons and one horse set out to retrace our journey
                    homeward. There was some snow on the ground, but the weather clear, thawing some
                    at midday, and in all our journey going and returning home we remained healthy.
            "We left the mission station on the 27th day of December, 1823, with our
                    pony carrying our camp-tent and provisions for the journey We had calculated to
                    reach the Wabash river, 100 miles distant, at the end of
                    the third day, but the morning of the fourth day we were ten or twelve miles
                    above the 
                        Tippecanoe
                     Battle Ground, short of provisions–on about one-half
                    rations. The weather had moderated and the snow melted and the snow water
                    running into our narrow trace made it disagreeable traveling, but about noonday
                    we got to Davis's trading house where we expected to get something to
                    eat. In this we were disappointed, finding that Mr. and Mrs. Davis were absent
                    from home, and after a short stop here; we crossed over the 
                        Wabash
                     in a canoe, swimming our pony across the river beside the canoe. We
                    were now on the east side of the river and it was the afternoon of the fourth
                    day. We set forward to reach the settlement on Wea Prairie some six or eight
                    miles distant, arriving at this out settlement of four families, to-wit, Black,
                    Babcock and Thorntons, late in the afternoon. We had staid here with our drove
                    of hogs on our trip to 
                        Michigan
                     with Mr. Black, or rather Mrs. Black and family, composed of eight
                    or ten children, two or three of whom were large young women, fully grown. We
                    were hospitably treated in our outward journey and  here we were back again on the borders of
                    civilization. The father and mother were both absent, but the girls took us in
                    for the night. We were hungry and weary with our travel through melted snow and
                    presented rather a hard appearance. We found the family out of flour and meal
                    and one of the girls took buckwheat and groimd it on a hand-mill, while the
                    others made other preparations for the supper. As soon as could be expected the
                    supper was announced as ready and before us these good girls had served up pork
                    and potatoes, buckwheat cakes, with honey and milk, etc., and we did ample
                    justice to the good things set before us. Our host had gone to the
                        Ohio river for money to meet the land sale at 
                        Crawfordsville
                     and had flot returned, and now the land sale of the district was in
                    progress. The wife had gone to the sale of lands, in order if possible, to save
                    their Congress improvements [a squatter's rights under the law] and
                    their new home on this frontier settlement. About the time the supper was ended
                    the mother came home from the land sale at 
                        Crawfordsville
                     and reported her good success–and there was joy in the
                    household that night. All were merry and cheerful. She had made a friend in the
                    person of Mr. Ambrose Whitlock, the Receiver of the land office, who had
                    assisted her in securing their home. December 31, 1823, on the morning of the
                    last day of the year we left our hospitable friends and went to 
                        Crawfordsville
                     and remained over night with Mr. Henry Restine, who kept a tavern.
                    Mr. Restine had been in the ranging service of the War of 1812 and had boarded
                    at Polke's Fort in 
                        Knox county
                    , therefore we were agreeably entertained and every courtesy
                    extended to us as desirable.
            "The 
                        Crawfordsville
                     land district embraced a large section of rich land on the upper 
                        Wabash
                    . It had attracted a large crowd of land speculators and the tide of
                    immigration and settlement was flowing rapidly up the Wabash
                    river and to the West. Indeed the Wea and Shawin Prairies in 
                        Tippecanoe county
                     were a very desirable section of country and are now in a high
                    state of improvement.
            "We left 
                        Crawfordsville
                     for 
                        Greencastle
                    , where we remained over night and on the next day we continued our
                    journey. The weather was warm and our roads muddy. Through Curry's 
                        Prairie
                     we had to wade through water from shoe-mouth deep to half-a-leg
                    deep for miles. And here I will remark that In all our trip there never was a
                    night on going out or returning home but 
                    our feet were wet. And we remained in good health. On the eighth day after
                    leaving 'Carey Mission,' in 
                        Berrien county
                    , 
                        Michigan
                    , we arrived at our home in 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana. The estimated distance traveled was something over two
                    hundred miles.
            "I now had entered my twentieth year of age. My father's family
                    were now growing up to manhood and womanhood, and he had gone into trading down
                    the river to 
                        New Orleans
                    , on flat boats, and had made one trip and was busy with
                    boat-building in order to load it with produce and make another trip in the
                    early spring. I now was put in charge of the farm during his absence down the
                    river, to take care of stock and other business and plow land, plant corn and
                    cultivate the same. So things were passing away and farming and river-trading
                    were becoming different callings. The farm was running down, the fences and
                    buildings were down and becoming dilapidated, and the wants of the large family
                    were many. For the next two years a great sameness of life took
                    place–the winters consuming all the summers could yield. I now had
                    become of age, or full twenty years old. My father had traded down the river and
                    had been unsuccessful and had become involved in debt and, as intimated, the
                    farm was in a bad condition, fences and buildings needing repairs. Indeed the
                    fences had to be repaired in order to secure the crop. For the last six months,
                    after becoming of age, before setting out in life, for my mother's and
                    sisters' and the children's sake. I still remained on the farm
                    as one of the. family. During the winter of 1826 I cut and split four thousand
                    rails and took the team and hauled them all round the farm for repairing of
                    fences.
            "In the month of February, I left my father's house with horse,
                    saddle and bridle. Possessed of strong body and strong will, with spirits
                    buoyant with an education sufficient to transact my own business in life, my
                    first adventure was to assist in opening up and tending a sugar camp on
                        White river, near where the: own of Edwards-port now
                    stands.
            "In the spring of 1826 I left the home of my father and mother and took
                    charge of a small farm near Edwardsport on which William Keith had taken a lease
                    of years. I took the oversight of the boys and cultivated a corn crop of some
                    twenty-five acres on shares, which yielded me near four hundred bushels of corn.
                    After the corn crop was laid by I was then employed by citizens of the
                    neighborhood  to teach school and for the
                    first time I undertook the task. of school-keeping, for three months. Some of my
                    school children were on the east side of White river and
                    had to cross over in a canoe mornings and evenings to attend school. By the
                    united efforts of the two neighborhoods, thirty or forty scholars Were gathered
                    in this school, the first on the west banks of White hiver ever taught above
                    'Decker's Old Station' on the 
                        Vincennes
                     and 
                        Evansville
                     road. After the expiration of school, I assisted my father in
                    getting out timbers and building a flatboat, gathering a crop of corn, etc.,
                    until the early spring of 1827. When the early rise in the river came we were
                    ready to make the trip to 
                        New Orleans
                    . We set sail and after a long tedious voyage of some five or six
                    weeks, we landed at the city of 
                        New Orleans
                    . After making sale of our boat-load of produce, at most ruinous
                    prices, we boarded the steamboat 'Hibernia,' and at the end of
                    nine days and nights were landed in 
                        Evansville
                    , on the Ohio river. The town was a little
                    dog-fennel village at that early day. Wre set out on foot
                    for 
                  Vincennes, Knox county
               , Indiana, but were soon
                    leg-weary and sore-footed. We then hired a hack to convey us to 
                        Vincennes
                    . We' were gone about two months on this voyage to the city
                    of 
                        New Orleans
                    . After my return home off the river, I labored on my
                    father's farm through the summer of 1827. My eldest sister Delilah and
                    I took a journey to 
                        Shelby county
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    , and from thence to 
                        Union county
                    , Indiana. I returned home by 
                        Indianapolis
                    . It was then a new place, a stumpy little town."
            HENRY MCQUAID
            
            "Henry McQuaid emigrated from 
                        Ireland
                     to America in the fore part of 1700. He settled in 
                        Shelby county
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    , in 1782, at the close of the Revolutionary War. He secured a large
                    tract of land at that early day, but from disputed titles he lost a*
                    portion of these lands. He died in 1795 and James McQuaid, his only son, settled
                    on a portion of the lands acquired by his father, and lived and died on the
                    same. James McQuaid was married to Isabel Pearce, about the year 1784, and there
                    were born six sons and six daughters: Margaret McQuaid, the eldest, born January
                    10, 1785; Henry, Nancy, Polly, Elizabeth, John, Fanny, James, Joel; Milton and
                    Malitta were twins; William was the youngest. All the children lived to be full
                    grown men and women.
            
            "James McQuaid was a farmer and cleared up and cultivated a large farm
                    on which he lived forty-five years. He died at the age of 70 years. Henry
                    McQuaid was a seceder Presbyterian in faith and a strict Sabbatarian. His son
                    James united with the regular Baptist church and was licensed to preach and in
                    time set apart by ordination. His father opposed him in his religious views, yet
                    nevertheless, he labored for near fifty years in the ministry. Shortly after his
                    ordination he became the pastor of the Clear Creek, Baptist church, near
                            
                  Shelbyville, Kentucky
               , and for forty
                    years he held the same without change. James McQuaid was a warm hearted
                    devotional man. He was a good singer and exhorter and he labored successfully in
                    the ministry and many souls were converted under his preaching and united with
                    the Baptist churches of 
                        Shelby county
                     and the surrounding counties.
            "He became popular and married more young people than any other minister
                    in all the surrounding country. He was called to their homes to marry them; they
                    came to the church and to his house, and on the public highways to get married.
                    James McQuaid organized a number of churches in 
                        Kentucky
                     and in the year 1809 he came to Indiana Territory to visit his
                    eldest daughter, Margaret Polk and family; and during his stay organized a
                    church on Maria creek with thirteen members. This church exists at the present
                    day, a large and influential body. It was organized on the 20th day of May,
                    1809. James McQuaid visited Indiana Territory in 1813 and again in 1818. The
                    trouble of the Indian War had passed by and the country become quiet and the
                    tide of immigration had flown into Indiana rapidly. The Baptist church which he
                    had organized nine years previous was now in a prosperous and growing condition
                    with more than one hundred members with no disturbing elements to its growth and
                    prosperity."

                    was born in 
                        North Carolina
                    , April 14, 1800. Came to Indiana Territory in 1808, was married to
                    Celia Barber, 1818. Became a member of the Baptist church at 
                        Shiloh
                    , in 
                        Perry County
                    , Indiana, September 9, 1821. He was baptized by Elder Charles Polke
                    and licensed to  preach in 1823, and
                    ordained July 31, 1824. He was truly a pioneer preacher, traveling through heat
                    and cold, mud and snow, through winds and storms to preach. He was instrumental
                    in gathering in two thousand souls as the fruit of his labor. He enjoyed but few
                    advantages in his younger days, and in truth he was a self made man. Elder
                    William Stancil was a well developed man–six feet high and weighed
                    about two hundred pounds. He traveled on horseback with his saddlebags. He
                    preached in the log cabins, log school houses and log churches, over southern
                    Indiana, and received but little pay for his labors. He has gone to receive his
                    reward."

            "Robert Polke, youngest son of Captain Polke, ST., was

                        Kentucky
                     in 1798. His mother, Delilah Tyler, died at his birth and he was
                    nursed and brought up by his elder sisters in his father's house until
                    he was ten years old and then was brought to Indiana territory with his eldest
                    brother, William Polke, in 1808. When sixteen years old he joined Andrie company

                        Virginia
                    , was introduced to my acquaintance by Brother Abner Davis. The
                    articles on the Patriarchal,  Jewish and
                    Christian dispensations, also the Kingdom of the Clergy, creeds, confession of
                    faith, etc., stirred up investigation among the people. These were stirring
                    times among the people of 
                        Kentucky
                    , Indiana and elsewhere and a division took place and the first
                    Christian church was organized at 
                        Bruceville
                     in the year 1832, and others following.
            "The Christian church at 
                        Maria Creek
                     was organized 1833. Also the Christian church at 
                        Vincennes
                     the same year (1833). And the following named preachers all of whom
                    had labored among the Baptist churches became advocates of Primitive
                    Christianity and stood firm to the end of life, to-wit: Abner Davis, David
                    Warford, Bruce Field, John B. Haywood, Albert P. Law. All have passed over the 
                        Jordan
                     to receive their reward. Morris R. Trimble entered the field as an
                    evangelist. He was a tower of strength and an untiring worker in the cause. He
                    also lies silent in the grave with a host of others with whom I have labored and
                    fraternized."

                    where the town of 
                        Gosport
                     now stands."]
            "When I was a lad my parents came to the 'New Purchase and
                    settled on a tract of land, afterward owned by Thomas Sandy one mile north of
                    Gosport. The old boundary line crossed the country west of the tract where
                    Gosport now stands. We came to the place a year or more before land in the New
                    Purchase was [opened]. All the country west to the, Wabash
                    river was then called 
                        Wabash
                     Court. The country was then an unbroken wilderness. The noble red
                    man roamed over the country and not a day passed over that we did not hear the
                    crack of his rifle as he brought down the deer or turkey which were abundant in,
                    these early days, and the nights were made hideous by the howling of the wolves,
                    the screams of the panther and the hootings of the owls. But we had a more
                    deadly enemy than these. The terrible rattlesnakes lurked in our paths and  in our camps causing great terror by day
                    and night. The snakes would den up in the winter in the rocky bluffs and crawl
                    out in the spring and spread through the country. In October and November they
                    would return to their dens in the bluffs and sinkholes by hundreds, lying torpid
                    until warm weather. Their bites did not always prove fatal but still they were a
                    terror.
            "The first winter the settlers generally lived in camps, with open
                    fronts and without floors, with bed-quilts and deer skins hung round with
                    hickory or elm bark thrown on poles for floors on which they slept. The mother
                    made johnny cake with sweet milk and venison or turkey for our fare.
            "My father came to the settlement in 1820 when there were but few
                    settlers here. Uncle Ephraim Goss and family with his son-in-law Philip Hodges,
                    Jerry Sandy. Benjamin Arnold, Abner and William Anderson, David Lukinbill, John
                    Treat, grandfather of W. B. F. Treat, and Isaac James and John Buskirk lived
                    across the river. Others came in shortly afterwards and settled north of us.
                    They were the Brasiers, Thompsons, Ashes, Steerwalt and sons, John and Jacob;
                    Colonel Robert McWooden and others.
            "The land where Gosport now stands belonged to a man in 
                        Ohio
                     who wanted to sell it. My father and I wanted to buy it for the
                    purpose of making a farm on it, but we were anticipated by other parties who got
                    it. Colonel Wooden and others laid off the town of Gosport in 1828.
            "I was married March 5, 1828 and the first work done after marriage was
                    to cut and split 1,000 rails for old gVandfather Ditte-more, which I did in one
                    week, walking from home a mile away and taking my dinner with me. I made the
                    rails in the center of the city of Gosport, the first work done to improve the
                    town and the price received was 33 ⅓ cents per 100 or
                    $3.00 per 1,000. I invested this $3.00 in sugar kettles
                    with Mrs. Owens of Blooming-ton and I and my young wife made over 300 pounds of
                    maple sugar, a part of which we exchanged with Mrs. Owens of whom we had bought
                    the kettles, for coffee, paying fifty cent per pound for the coffee with sugar
                    at twelve and one-half cents per pound."

            MAJOR CHARLES M. TRAVIS
            
            MAJOR CHARLES M. TRAVIS
                    (1845-1913) was born in 
                        Grand-view
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    , October 30, 1845. His early life was spent in this village. When
                    but a lad of sixteen years of age he went to 
                  Paris, Illinois
               , and there enlisted in Company E of the Twelfth
                    Regiment

                     Volunteer Infantry. He served with this regiment until the close of
                    the Civil War, having taken part in over fifteen battles.
            At the close of the Civil War he was appointed a cadet from General
                    Sherman's army to West Point but resigned the commission and came to
                    Indiana, attending school at the 
                        Waveland
                     Academy at 
                        Waveland
                    , Indiana, and graduating as the valedictorian of a class of
                    thirty-five. He moved to 
                        Crawfordsville
                    , Indiana, and became a student at 
                        Wabash
                     College. He studied law under General Lew Wallace and the
                    friendship between the two men was so firm that General Wallace received his
                    student as his law partner. Under the administration of President U. S. Grant,
                    Major Travis was appointed as 
                        United States
                     consul to the port of Para, 
                        Brazil
                    , South America, which office he filled with distinction. At the
                    close of his term of office in this foreign port he returned to 
                        Crawfordsville
                    , Indiana, and resumed his practice of law. He was a frequent
                    contributor to the press and was active in fraternal and political circles. He
                    was an orator of ability. In 1889 he was elected by the Grand Army of the
                    Republic as Department Commander for Indiana, and during his administration laid
                    the corner stone of the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors'
                    monument at 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            He was appointed as one of the commissioners from Indiana to the World's
                    Columbian Exposition at 
                        Chicago
                     in 1893 and at the close of the Exposition was secured by the
                    commissioners to prepare a complete report and embody it in book form for the
                    government.
            At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, Charles M. Travis was presented with
                    a commission as major of the Eighth 
                        United States
                     Infantry. His commission was signed by Secretary of War Alger, his
                    warm personal friend. He at once joined his regiment and served till the close
                    of the war and was mustered out,  a veteran
                    of two wars. The last two years of his life his health was much broken and he
                    died December 22, 1913 in a hospital at 
                  Danville, Illinois
               . October 7, 1872, Charles M. Travis was united in
                    marriage to Mary DeEtta Salisberry of

                        Fort Wayne
                    , Indiana, survive him.
            JOHN V. BUSKIRK
            
            JOHN V. BUSKIRK was born near Gosport,
                    Indiana, June 16, 1828, and died at that place December 26, 1913, aged 85 years.
                    He was the youngest son of John Buskirk. In 1848 he married Lavada Starks who
                    died in 1855.
            The Buskirk family has a historic war record. The grandfather of John was in the
                    Revolutionary war; his father was in the war of 1812 and suffered a wound in the
                    battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    . John was a member of Company B, Fourth Indiana Infantry in the
                    Mexican war and Company F, Twenty-seventh Indiana Infantry during the Rebellion.
                    During the Mexican war he fought in all the important battles from Pueblo to and
                    including the capture of the City of Mexico. During the Rebellion he
                    participated in the battle of 
                        Gettysburg
                     and a great many more of those serious encounters. He has always
                    been a very patriotic citizen. This spirit of patriotism was manifested the past
                    summer when he went to the National Reunion of the Union and Confederate
                    soldiers who fought at the battle of 
                        Gettysburg
                     fifty years ago. In the "40s" he was one of the
                    active "flat-boaters" on White river and
                    made numerous trips from here to 
                        New Orleans
                     on flat-boats loaded with meat and grain.
            The funeral services were conducted at the home of his daughter, Mrs. M. E.
                    Dunnigan, at 
                        Gosport
                    , Sunday December 28, by Wm. S. Mead, Commander Gettysburg Post No.

                        Spencer
                    , Capt. D. E. Beem, past Department Commander, Capt. C. A.
                    Hutchinson, Adjutant, Maj. W. W. Daugherty, U. S. A., retired, Maj. D. I.
                    McCormick of the Spanish-American War and a platoon of Company D, First Regiment
                    I. N. G., with Trumpeter M. E. Mc-Naught, under command of Captain J. C. Clark
                    and Lieutenant James Allen.
            The obituary was then read by Dr. J. Wooden, one of the three survivors of the
                    Mexican War, of 
                        Owen county
                    . The other surviving  Mexican
                    veterans are Thomas A. McNaught, of 
                        Spencer
                    , Dr. J. Wooden, of Gosport, and Captain Wellman, of 
                        Quincy
                    .
            The casket was draped with the old original flag of the Fourth Indiana Infantry,
                    which was commanded by Colonel Willis A. Gorman during the war with Mexico. This
                    is an honor seldom conferred at a soldier's funeral, and was made
                    possible only through the courtesy of Major McCormick, custodian of flags in the
                    State library, who with Major Daugherty brought the flag from the State House
                    for the occasion. The remains were taken in charge by the Guard of Honor under
                    command of Captain Clark and Lieutenant Allen and escorted to their final
                    resting place in the Buskirk cemetery, where they were interred with the honors
                    of war, the last tribute of respect that can be paid by comrades in arms to a
                    deceased soldier.

            HISTORY TEACHERS
                    OF INDIANA
            
            THE annual convention of the History Teachers of Indiana was
                    held at the Claypool hotel, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , February 13 and 14.
            The discussions were all marked with commendable enthusiasm. There was
                    considerable unrest manifested among the teachers in view of the readjustment
                    necessary to meet the demands of the times expressed in vocational teaching.
                    Harry W. Wood of the Manual Training High School of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , discussed this tendency in its relation to Civics. His plan was to
                    lay aside the old emphasis on constitutional and legislative history and
                    acquaint the student with the actual machinery of government as it shows itself
                    in the neighborhood. This can best be done by visiting the councils, courts and
                    other governmental agencies.
            In keeping with this idea some of the teachers would rearrange the course of
                    study shifting the emphasis to those periods of history chiefly characterized by
                    commercial readjustment. On the other hand there were those who think that
                    history is of sufficient importance and dignity to stand alone. These would
                    teach the lessons of  humanity from all
                    periods of the world's history. They also deprecated the continual
                    meddling with the course of study necessary if the subject of history must be
                    reorganized for every fad that sweeps over the field of education.
            A second line of discussion had to do with the Centennial Celebration of Indiana.
                    The building of a Centennial Museum was discussed and a committee consisting of
                    Dr. Woodburn of Indiana University, Dr. Moran of Purdue, and Professor Lindley
                    of Earlham appointed to cooperate with others in creating a public sentiment
                    favorable to the project. It was recognized that pretty hard work was ahead in
                    this direction, due largely to the failure of the old Centennial Commission.
            Various committees were appointed as follows: to revise the course of

            MICHIGAN HISTORICAL COMMISSION
            
            AN act of the Legislature of 
                        Michigan
                    , 1913, provided for a Historical Commission to consist of seven
                    members, six of whom were to be appointed by the Governor, the governor, ex
                    officio being  the seventh member of the
                    board. These members are to serve six years, without pay, one retiring annually.
            This Commission has power to collect all historical material available in or out
                    of the State and it is made the custodian of the same. Its power in this respect
                    is wide. Records of Indian tribes, French explorers, missionaries and traders,
                    English and American soldiers and settlers are to be sought. The survey is not
                    limited to 
                        Michigan
                     alone but includes the Northwest territory.
            The act provides for a secretary at a salary of $1,800 and a curator
                    at $1,000. The law sets aside $5,000 per year for the
                    expenses of the commission, the cost of printing and binding to be done by the
                    State as other public printing is done.
            The Commission includes the best historians of the State. Its first work will be
                    to reprint the collections of the 
                        Michigan
                     Pioneer and Historical Society. These publications now number 38
                    volumes.
            A series of volumes will be known as the Original Documents Relating
                        to the History of 
                            Michigan
                         and the Northwest Territory. These will succeed the Pioneer and Historical Collections mentioned above. The
                    materials for his will be gathered from 
                        Washington
                    , 
                  London,
                            Paris
               , Quebec and
                    elsewhere. W. G. Lelarid is now in 
                        Paris
                     gathering this material.
            The plan of distribution is especially commendable. One copy of each volume is to
                    be given to each public library in the State and one to each State and
                    University library as an exchange. Volumes will be sold for one dollar each to
                    the public.
            The Commission is organizing an Information Bureau of State History. When this is
                    in working order it is hoped a secretary will be able to supply free to all
                    citizens any information in regard to the State History.
            The commission cooperates with all county societies, all colleges and libraries.
                    It prepares directions and bibliography for local work, and coordinates the work
                    being clone in various parts of the State.
            The Commission is also preparing for the construction of a State museum as a home
                    for its historical property. 
                        Michigan
                     is thus preparing in a worthy way to take care of its history. The
                    only expense entailed on the State is the cost of publication which is only a
                    trifle. Yet it is that trifle which now keeps Indiana from publishing anything
                    in this field. A publication fund of $10,000 per  year would enable the historians of Indiana to do
                    for our State what is being done by our neighboring States.
            A CONFERENCE
                    ON TAXATION
            
            ON February 5th and 6th, there took place at the University a
                    very notable event in the form of "A Conference on Taxation in
                    Indiana." From all parts of the State were assembled public officials,
                    both State and local, students of public finance and representatives of the
                    business interests, to participate in a varied program dealing with the
                    important subject of taxation and tax administration. In all, seventy persons
                    were registered in attendance, exclusive of the members of the University.
            All arrangements for the conference were made by President Bryan and Prof.
                    Rawles, as director of the Extension Division. In a "foreword"
                    to the program sent out with the invitations to attend the meeting, the object
                    of the conference was clearly stated, as follows: "The subject of
                    taxation is important to every citizen of the State. Progress toward the ideals
                    of social justice and industrial efficiency is impeded by an imperfect system of
                    taxation. No apologies seem necessary for the calling of a conference to
                    consider in a dispassionate way the present situation in Indiana with a view to
                    ascertaining just what are the imperfections in our system, and how they may be
                    remedied."
            Governor Ralston, who was expected to preside at the opening session on Thursday
                    morning, February 5th, was unfortunately unable to be present. The Hon. John B.
                    Stoll, the respected veteran editor of 
                        South Bend
                    , was secured to act in his place. An address of welcome was
                    delivered by President Bryan, who emphasized the great importance of the subject
                    of taxation as exemplified in the world's history.
            The conference was particularly fortunate in securing as speakers from outside
                    the State such men as Mr. Lawson Purdy, Drs. Thomas S. Adams, Joseph French
                    Johnson, David Friday and Raymond V. Phelan. What they had to say carried with
                    it the weight of authority in a high degree. The tax features of important,
                    progressive States were presented by them in a clear and forceful way while, in
                    addition, the fundamental principles of taxation were driven home with
                    convincing logic. While there was some dissent as to the advisability of
                    adapting certain features from the tax systems  of other States, to that of Indiana, yet it was
                    generally admitted by those present that Indiana would do well to profit by the
                    success of her sister commonwealths.
            In the discussion of our local tax laws, the attention of the conference was
                    directed chiefly to two things, the taxation of intangible property and the
                    control of local assessments. Generally speaking, it was the view of the
                    conference that the present taxing clause of the State Constitution, providing
                    for the general property tax, fails to meet with success or to provide equality,
                    when applied to the taxation of money, credits and other forms of intangible
                    property. Under the present system such property largely escapes or, if
                    assessed, it pays more than its proper burden. Instead of the general property
                    tax, a "classification" system was urged, thus, allowing for
                    the imposition of different rates of taxation on different classes of property,
                    or even the total exemption of certain kinds of property. In order to adopt such
                    a system a change in the State's Constitution would be necessary.
                    Accordingly there was strong sentiment in favor of a Constitutional Convention,
                    preceded by the appointment of a special tax commission to make an exhaustive
                    study of Indiana's needs.
            The second question which caused lively discussion was the defects of our present
                    methods of assessment. The members of the State Board of Tax Commissioners
                    asserted that the local assessments were perforce most unequal and unjust,
                    because the Board had neither control over the selection of the local assessors
                    nor the power to order a reassessment where careless, inefficient, or
                    discriminating work had been done. The placing of assessors on a civil service
                    basis was urged, so as to take them out of the trammels of local politics. On
                    the other hand sharp criticism was directed at the State Board itself by the
                    "Hon. J. P. Dunn, who asserted that the body was even more deficient in
                    the assessment of railroad property, which is intrusted to it, than were the
                    local assessors in their work.
            The crowning work of the meeting was the formation of the "Indiana State
                    Tax Conference" instituted to carry on the work of public education. In
                    fitting recognition of his work in starting the movement, Prof. W. A. Rawles was
                    chosen president of the permanent organization. Other officers selected were,
                    John B. Stoll, John A. Lapp, Dan M. Link, Fred E. Simms and L. S. Bowman,  vice-presidents, Fred B. Johnson, secretary
                    and W. K. Stewart, treasurer.
            Altogether the conference was a most successful one. Its fruits seem bound to
                    appear in a more intelligent understanding of local tax problems and in greater
                    prestige for the University throughout the State. Indiana University showed that
                    it possessed rare opportunities for serving the people. Everywhere there was
                    expression of opinion among the delegates at the conference that our ultimate
                    goal should be, and would be, that of 
                        Wisconsin
                     and 
                        Minnesota
                    . The proceedings of the conference will be published by the
                    University.

            THE National Society of the Colonial Dames of America is
                    taking up in a systematic and comprehensive way the preservation of materials
                    relating to its history. A committee on the Preservation of Existing Records has
                    been appointed and is now actively at work. This committee has asked the members
                    of the society resident in Indiana to assist in this work. The following
                    information and records are desired: 
                  Records in family Bibles. The names and addresses of all persons
                            possessing family Bibles containing such records.
                  The condition of the town records of the oldest town in each -county,
                            whether the records are kept in a fireproof safe, whether the county or
                            town authorities are interested in the preservation of such records.
                  The oldest graveyards in each county, their condition, location and
                            number of colonial stones contained.
                  The oldest church organization in each county, the age of the present
                            building, the oldest church records, and their condition and state of
                            preservation.

            Reviews and Notes
            
               The Life of Thaddens Stevens, By JAMES A.
                        WOODBURN, PH.D. (
                        Indianapolis
                    , The Bobbs-Merrill Company.) Pp. 610. 1913.
            Books sometimes suffer, as children do, from inability to choose the author of
                    their being. This biography, the best and probably the definitive life of
                    Stevens, does not belong to this class. A satisfactory account of the great
                    "reconstructionist" could not be written by a man of partisan
                    spirit; it would be either a fulsome eulogy or an untempered denunciation.
                    Professor Woodburn's historical spirit and natural disposition combine
                    to produce a biography which does full justice to its subject and at the same
                    time never misrepresents him or his work. The author's task, moreover,
                    has been thoroughly done. Practically all existing materials, public records,
                    private letters, even oral tradition, have been drawn upon and welded together
                    in a masterly historical and literary production. Nowhere can one find a better
                    representation of the great movements with which Stevens identified himself,
                    especially the prosecution of the war against the seceding states and the
                    reconstruction after the war.
            Stevens' long career is covered with a just proportion devoted to his
                    private life, his business affairs and his public services. The reviewer finds
                    only one episode of importance which is not satisfactorily described, namely
                    Stevens' apparent indifference or even opposition to the appropriation
                    necessary to complete the Alaskan purchase and his later support of this
                    appropriation. At the time, there was some talk of scandal in connection with
                    the completion of this affair and the whole transaction has never been
                    satisfactorily explained. It may well be, however, that material is not
                    available for an inside explanation, or that there is after all nothing really
                    there to explain. With this possible exception we have in Professor
                    Woodburn's book a complete account of Stevens' career as an
                    Anti-Mason Pennsylvania politician, as an iron manufacturer and as leader of the
                    national House of Representatives during the war and reconstruction.
            Perhaps the greatest single contribution which Professor Wood-burn makes to our
                    understanding of Stevens and the public questions of his day is contained in the
                    very interesting chapter upon "Ways  and Means in the War, the Greenback" and the two later chapters upon
                    "The Greenbacker." Here Stevens' advocacy of the
                    Legal Tender act, his attempt to make greenbacks legal tender for everything,
                    even payments of interest on government bonds, and his later effort to continue
                    and extend the issue of greenbacks are presented so sympathetically as, not
                    indeed to convince us that he was right, but to enable us to understand clearly
                    his side of the controversy and to give us respect for his views.
            An authoritative statement of the facts upon which Stevens based his policy of
                    reconstruction, and of the conditions which formed the background of this policy
                    is very timely. With a due sense of the evils of Reconstruction as the Stevens
                    faction carried it out, and of the growth of humanitarian and philanthropic
                    sentiments since 1868, the reviewer finds himself unable to join in the
                    unmitigated condemnation with which reconstruction is now usually visited.
                    Stevens and the radical Republicans faced a situation in which it seemed more
                    than likely that the results of the Civil War, except in the bare saving of the
                    Union, would be lost. Southern negroes could have been kept in virtual slavery
                    and the anti-war element in the Democratic party might have gotten control of
                    the government, had there been weakness or halfway measures in the
                    reconstruction of the South. A 'policy of unreserved generosity on the
                    part of the North, an unconditional recognition of local governments in the
                    South, and an immediate consigning of the war to oblivion were under the
                    circumstances hardly to be expected. Failing in this, it was probably fortunate
                    that a man like Stevens came to the front to drive firmly and relentlessly to
                    the bitter end the policy of forcing upon the South the recognition of the new
                    order of things.
            The volume as a whole is worthy of its author, the dean of Indiana historians,
                    and of the years spent in its preparation. It is a real pleasure to read a book,
                    at whose close one feels that he has been face to face with a great historical
                    subject treated in the best historical manner of our modern scientific school.

            INDIANA must acknowledge its great indebtedness to the 
                        Illinois
                     State Historical Library and through it to Dr. James for this
                    volume of collections. The documents here brought to the service of historians
                    are as much a part of the history of Indiana as they are of that of 
                        Illinois
                    . Over three hundred letters, diaries, reports and memoirs are
                    included in the collection. As the text indicates, these documents have to do
                    with George Rogers Clark's campaign in the West. The author has been
                    liberal however in his selection and practically all contemporary documents
                    dealing directly with the campaigns have been included. For instance there are
                    documents by Abraham. Hite, John Gabriel Jones, John Clark, Patrick Henry,
                    Thomas Jefferson, William Harrod, Gabriel Cerre, H. Perrault, David Lyster,
                    Alexander Mlacomb, R. B. Lemoult, Governor Hamilton, and a score of others.
                    About seventy-five are by Clark himself.
            While the central theme of all the papers is the conquest by Clark, not all the
                    papers by any means relate to battles and marches. The whole life in the western
                    country is illuminated, its conventions, its civil organization, its social and
                    economical conditions.
            It would not be interesting to the readers of this magazine to go into a
                    discussion of the reliability of these sources. Few, if any, would have the
                    means of judging the value of any criticism offered. In general it may be said
                    that the reputation of Dr. James is sufficient to guarantee the highest accuracy
                    in the work. He is familiar with the field, the characters and the science of
                    history, and has had the hearty cooperation of scholars and librarians.
            The first 167 pages are used by the author in a sketch of the period based on the
                    documentary materials following. This arrangement has an advantage and also a
                    serious disadvantage. This introduction is perhaps the best history in print of
                    this particular period and a reading of it leaves little to be desired in the
                    way of explanation of the documents following. On the other hand for one
                    consulting a particular document it is rather difficult to get the bearings
                    without going to the introduction and reading several pages. A good general
                    index reduces this difficulty very materially. Moreover a note of explanation
                    for each document would necessitate a  large
                    amount of repetition. On the whole perhaps the author has selected the lesser of
                    the difficulties.
            There is a criticism that might be suggested on the general format of the book.
                    It is too thick for its size of page and style of binding. The thickness of the
                    882 pages equals five-ninths the width of the type page. Unless one breaks the
                    binding reading its small pages is like reading a bill on a telephone post. One
                    must either ke: p his head nodding or else keep the book turning. This criticism
                    is useless as the different volumes have to conform to the style and format of
                    the others of the series.
            Some of the controverted points in regard to the documents offered are discussed
                    at the close of the volume. The Memoir of Colonel Clark has
                    been criticised as that of a vain old man, prepared long after the events which
                    it describes and after the natural keenness of his mind had been dulled by years
                    of intemperance. In general the author dissents from this criticism and regards
                    the Memoir as a valuable and trustworthy document. The volume
                    should find a place in all Indiana libraries.

            "PAUL CUFFE
                    and His Contribution to the American Colonization
                        Society," is the title of a 32-page separate from Volume VI of
                    the Proceedings of the Mississippi Valley
                        Historical Association. The author is Henry Noble Sherwood, formerly
                    professor of history in the University of 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Paul Cuffe was a colored man who lived at 
                        Cuttyhunk
                    , 
                        Massachusetts
                    . He accumulated a considerable amount of property as a trader and
                    sailor. This property he generously used in providing for the education of the
                    American negro and his deportation to Africa. He took a small colony of negroes
                    to 
                        Sierra Leone
                     in 1813 and made several trips to America and 
                        England
                    . In 
                        England
                     he had an interview with the directors of the African institution
                    and advised with them as to the best means to stop the slave trade. Cuffe was
                    intimate with the principal men who organized the American Colonization Society
                    and the example he gave in negro deportation was an encouragement to them to
                    persevere in the objects of the society. His death in 1817 was the occasion of
                    many tributes by the members of the newly formed society. Mr. Sherwood has
                    recently published through Mississippi Valley Historical
                    Association, "The Settlement of the John Randolph  Slaves in 
                        Ohio
                    " and through 
                        Ohio

                    Movement in 
                        Ohio
                    ." These with other contributions will constitute his
                    doctor's thesis in Indiana University.

               History of 
                            Johnson County
                        , Indiana. By ELBA L. BRANIGIN, A. M. (
                        Indianapolis
                    ; B. F. Bowen & Co., Inc. Pp. 863.)
            MR. BRANIGIN, the author of the above is a
                    well-known attorney of 
                        Franklin
                    , an alumnus of 
                        Franklin
                     College. The author pitches right into his work and gives us 557 pages of history. The familiar discussion of Moundbuilders
                    is missing as are also the well-worn biographies of the presidents of the 
                        United States
                     that have done duty to pad so many country histories and from
                    present indications are going to have to work over time again in the near
                    future. 
                        Johnson county
                     is not rich in historical material. It is just one of the plain
                    substantial counties of Indiana. But the author has found plenty of valuable
                    materials to make a good readable volume, materials well worthy of preservation.
                    We frequently overlook this value in county histories. Not every county has been
                    the seat of world-famed events but every county in Indiana has a number of
                    churches, schools, lodges, cities or towns, newspapers and other results of
                    social and neighborhood activities that have clustered around them many enduring
                    memories and traditions. These are just as surely the materials of history as
                    are marches, sieges, or congressional fiascoes. Mr. Branigin has done this. He
                    has preserved a history of nearly, if not all these institutions. The diary of
                    Samuel W. Van Nuys, a volunteer of Company F, Seventh Indiana, is a novelty in a
                    county history and opens up a field not usually worked by local historians.
                    Lists of county, township, city and town officers are given, election statistics
                    and census materials bearing on the growth of the county.
            The last 300 pages are taken up with biographies. These are usually written by
                    the persons themselves and are thus autobiographies. While there are a great
                    many wasted adjectives interspersed here and there the substance of each sketch
                    is fact. A great deal of valuable material is thus preserved. Society is able to
                         preserve a biography of each of its
                    members if it chooses so to do. The most enlightened states of the world are
                    doing it or have done it The most expensive way to do it is by county histories
                    but that way is far better than none. A set of histories covering Indiana in
                    1825 and another in 1850, and another in 1875 would look good to a historian of
                    Indiana now.

            THE
                    Year Book, Indiana Federation of Clubs for 1913-1914 is an
                    excellent resume of the work done by the organization during the year. A glance
                    through it shows the wide range of activities carried on by the Federation. The
                    State is organized by Congressional Districts and counties, each division with
                    its appropriate officers. Work is done along the general lines of Library
                    Extension, Public Health, Legislation, Charities, Household Economies, Civics,
                    Conservation, Art, Music, Agricultural Education, History (especially of
                    Indiana), Parent Teachers Clubs, Literature, Country Life, Education and some
                    others. The annual convention was held at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , October 21-24 inclusive, 1913. The president is Miss Vida Newsom, 
                        Columbus
                    , Indiana. The Indiana Magazine of History wishes to cooperate with
                    the Federation in all ways possible, and especially in the work on Indiana
                    History.
            WILLIAM K. BOYD, Professor of History in
                    Trinity College, 
                        North Carolina
                    , has recently published a Syllabus of 
                            North Carolina
                         History from 1584 to 1876. The author
                    divided his subject into ninety-three chapters each of which he outlined and
                    furnished with a suitable bibliography. The syllabus makes a pamphlet of 100
                    pages. The last chapter is an. outline for the study of local history. A similar
                    pamphlet would be a valuable addition to the historical literature of Indiana.
                    It is worth while to note in this connection that 
                        North Carolina
                     has recently published thirty-one volumes of Colonial and State
                    records.
            DR. FREDRICK JACKSON
                        TURNER, of 
                        Harvard
                    , has prepared a List of References on the History of
                        the West for the use of his classes. There are 129 pages of titles
                    divided into fifty-two chapters, Under each chapter are listed those books
                    treating especially of a certain field. Each chapter is divided into a general
                    field and  special fields under which the
                    references are appropriately listed. On the whole it is a well-selected and
                    comprehensive list. Little attempt has been made to value the different books
                    referred to, though a star has been used occasionally to designate what the
                    author considers the best authority on the subject in question.
            
               Why Indiana Needs a New Constitution is the title of a booklet
                    issued by. the Woman's Franchise League of Indiana. The contents of the
                    booklet is an address by Prof. James Albert Woodburn before the second annual
                    convention of the league held at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , May 5, 1913. Prof. Woodburn favors a new constitutional convention
                    that will give Indiana a new system of taxation, woman suffrage, the short
                    ballot, initiative and the referendum. "The fundamental law should deal
                    with broad general principles. A constitution of a million words dealing with a
                    multitude of prohibitions and specifics borders upon the absurd in political
                    science," says the author.

            DR. SOLON J. BUCK has
                    issued as a separate his article from the Proceedings of the 
                            Mississippi
                         Historical Association, 1912, on "The 
                        New England
                     Element in 
                        Illinois
                     Politics before 1833." Only a half dozen biographies are
                    sketched. The chief interest of the paper is the indication it gives of the vast
                    amount of work that must be done along that line before any valid
                    generalizations can be drawn concerning the work or influence of the settlers
                    from the various sections of the country from which the pioneers emigrated.
            THE
                    Indiana University Alumni Quarterly made its first appearance
                    January, 1914. It is a quarterly of 124 pages standard magazine size, published
                    by the Alumni Association of Indiana University. Dr. S. B. Harding of the
                    Department of History, Indiana University, is editor and Dr. M. E. Haggerty of
                    the Department  of Philosophy is business
                    manager. An article by Judge David D. Banta, Dean of the School of Law at the
                    time of his death in 1896, on the "History of Indiana
                    University" is the leading article and sets a rapid pace for the
                    contents of following numbers. Judge Banta had personally known many of the
                    first students who attended the university and it is of these and their life he
                    writes rather than the formal acts of Legislatures and trustees. The school life
                    of the times is here pictured better than in Hall's New
                        Purchase. A portrait of Judge Banta and a map of Indiana in 1818 by Dr.
                    Shockley accompany the article. The second article is entitled
                    "Bohemian Literary Men in the Age of Elizabeth" and was
                    written by Prof. Frank Aydelotte of the English Department. Prof. Aydelotte
                    takes us into these literary workshops and in truth one can hardly say that he
                    is tempted to remain. The remainder of the Quarterly is taken
                    up with university news, reviews of books and articles written by alumni, and
                    news notes of the alumni arranged by classes. We expected a good magazine and
                    our high expectations have been more than realized in the artistic appearance,
                    the typographical excellence and in the subject matter of this first number.
                    Surely no alumnus will fail to become a member of the Alumni Association and
                    thus become a subscriber to and supporter of the Alumni
                    Quarterly.

                         Journal of History and Politics for January contains as
                    its leading article a study of the Mormon migration across 
                        Iowa
                     in 1845-6. The trails are laid down on a map and the camps marked.
                    Each Mormon party had regard to the next party following and either planted a
                    crop of corn, potatoes and garden truck at the camp or harvested one formerly
                    planted so that the oncoming pilgrims would find a stock of provisions on hand
                    at each "Camp of 
                        Israel
                    ." The "Miller Thompson Contest" for a
                    seat in Congress is the subject of an article in the same number by Louis B.

            THE January number of the 
                  
                            Missouri
                         Historical Review opens with an article on "The
                    Value and the Sale of the 
                        Missouri
                     Slave," by Harrison A. Tresler of the University of
                    Monatna. From tax books, reports of auction sales, from newspapers and from
                    court records the author has collected sufficient data to show the extent of the
                    trade and the range of prices paid for slaves. The study  shows that the price of slaves gradually rose from
                    1820 to 1860. In 1854 a first class man twenty-three years old sold for
                    $1,440. Boys, ten to twelve, brought around $800. The
                    official "block" from which slaves were sold in 
                        St. Louis
                     was the east door of the court house.
            GEORGE PENCE, field examiner of the State
                    Board of Accounts, has recently discovered the first Thanksgiving Day
                    Proclamation ever issued in Indiana. In reality the proclamation called for a
                    day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer; just the opposite of our Thanksgiving.
                    The latter is a thanksgiving for the bounties of the season. The former is
                    observed to propitiate the overruling power so that good crops may be raised.
                    The clay of humiliation and prayer rightfully comes in the
                    Spring–second Friday of April– while the Thanksgiving day
                    celebration is in the fall when the farming season is over and the crops housed.
                    The proclamation in the bold clear hand of our first governor is reproduced in
                        fac simile in the

                    Palladium during the last part of November and the first part
                    of December published the memoir of Henry Hoover. Mr. Hoover was one of the
                    early pioneers of 
                        Wayne county
                    . His diary and memoir is a valuable contribution to the early
                    history of 
                        Wayne county
                    .
            B. J. GRISWOLD is preparing a series of articles on the
                    History of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    . These will appear weekly during the year in the 
                        Fort Wayne
                    
                    Sentinel. They will be illustrated by two hundred pen drawings
                    of the famous characters and events of the three hundred years covered. The
                    first of these articles appeared Saturday, January 3, 1914. The first article
                    filled seven columns and contained four illustrations and eight maps. These are
                    the rare maps of the early explorers and are taken largely from
                    Winsor's Narrative and Critical History of America.
                    If the remaining articles maintain the high level of the first one Mr. Griswold
                    will have done an excellent piece of work.
            IN the January History Teachers'
                        Magazine, Waldo L. Cook, of the 
                        Springfield
                    
                    Republican,. discusses "The Press in Its Relation to
                    History." His conclusion is that the more history an editor knows  the better for his readers. History is not
                    only a warehouse for the editor but by its aid he is enabled to satisfy the
                    demands of his readers that he know everything. A wide knowledge of history he
                    concludes is the best guaranty of a wise policy on the part of the editor. In
                    the same number Wilbur F. Gordy discusses the value of local history. He finds
                    its chief value in the fact that it adjusts the pupils to the society in which
                    they must later find their places.
            THE
                    
                  
                            North Carolina
                         Booklet, for January, 1914, has an article by Major
                    William A. Graham on "New Year's Shooting, an Ancient German
                    Custom." It is only a few years since this custom was common in
                    Indiana. The author attributes its origin to the Germans of Pennsylvania and
                    Carolina. The preacher usually accompanied the crowd. It was not, he says, a
                    carousal but a sober fraternal greeting. As it was practiced in Indiana, it was
                    a surprise to the one "shot" who must then produce the good
                    things to eat. In the Carolinas it seems the one visited was called out to hear
                    the firing. The writer thinks the custom dates back to Feudal times when the
                    tenants thus greeted the lord and enjoyed his good cheer.
            THE congregation of the Second Presbyterian church of 
                        Indianapolis
                     celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of their
                    church November 20, 1913. Among the charter members who founded the church
                    November 19, 1838, were Bethuel F. Morris, Daniel Yandes, John Ketcham arid
                    Catharine Merrill. Henry Ward Beecher was their first pastor, serving from 1839
                    to 1847. A bronze tablet bearing the names of the first pastor and those of the
                    fifteen charter members was dedicated. An account of the celebration together
                    with a brief history of the church is given in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News, November 21, 1913.
            THE State Historical Society of 
                  Topeka, Kansas
               , has the Isaac McCoy manuscripts in
                    thirty-eight bound volumes. That society has 40,115 books, 41,903 volumes of
                    newspapers, 136,743 pamphlets, 137,304 archives and 44,628 manuscripts bearing
                    on local history. This is quite a contrast to our own State Historical Society,
                    now seventy-five years old and without so much as a home. It seems about time
                    for us to wake up.
