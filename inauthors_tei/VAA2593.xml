                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p>Doubtless you have heard of the artless Irish maid who went to the postoffice and
                    asked:</p>
                <p> &quot;Is ther-re anny letther fur me?&quot;</p>
                <p> &quot;What name, please?&quot; the polite postal clerk queried.</p>
                <p>&quot;Faith, that will be on the letther!&quot; she replied with a slight
                    show of resentment.</p>
                <p>If you shall ask us why we should inflict the public with another volume of
                    verse, the answer will be in the book itself. The author believes he has a
                    genuine mes- sage in this book, one which the world will do well to read and
                    ponder over.</p>
                <p>It reflects the loftiest sentiments and the noblest aspi- rations of, at least,
                    one humble, human heart. We can climb no higher. We can aspire no further. Many
                    of the sentiments herein expressed may not coincide with your views, your bias,
                    your prejudices. We are sorry for that. We love to be in perfect accord with all
                    of our friends. But the Truth, as we see it, compels us, and we must not be
                    disobedient to the heavenly vision, as poor, old, beaten-up, persecuted Paul
                    might have said.</p>
                <p> From our standpoint, the most beautiful ideal of all time, of all history, is
                    the character of Jesus Christ, and the next, that of our beloved country, best
                    typified and -represented by what we call &quot;Old Glory&quot;. We
                    believe that no nation under the sun comes as near placing be- fore the eyes of
                    humanity the principles of that first ideal as our glorious union of the States.
                    We are sorry that lthe great guns of this Republic should ever be trained<pb
                        id="VAA2593-004" n="[]"/>to the destruction of any portion of the human
                    race. We are thankful that our noble President tried every reasonable means of
                    averting this sad condition. But law-violators, truce-breakers, treaty-ignorers
                    must be punished, and we are happy to know that we have a nation and a people
                    that are as unconquerable as God&apos;s eternal right itself!</p>
                <p>What a pitiable situation had faced crushed, enslaved, outraged Belgium,
                    bleeding, but heroic France, and the land of our fathers, the isles of Britain,
                    had there been no &quot;God&apos;s Country&quot;, no America! What a
                    message the Old Flag carries across the seas! No wonder the French and the
                    English wept frantic tears of joy when &quot;the starry banner of the
                    free&quot; swept down their boulevards! And a part of the message that the
                    Old Flag bore and is bearing has been caught, we trust, within the pages of this
                    book!</p>

                        <l rend="ti-1">When the German began his invasion</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And assembled his numerous clans;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Myself and my father and mother</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">After crushing of Liege that day.</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">I then was a girl scarcely twenty,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">My parents were feeble and old;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">My brother, a soldier of Belga,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Had fought with her regulars bold</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">For our home and our country so sacred,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">For the honor of Albert, our king,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Till the foeman had taken the city</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And crushed it within his steel ring.</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">And had left us all helpless, forsaken,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">To gaze on our sorrow aghast;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And oh, my dear brother, where was he?</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">I shuddered and paled at the thought;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">For over beyond, on the hillside,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Was the last place the Belgians fought;</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">And a taint in the wind and the breezes,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And a stain on the rivulet&apos;s flood,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Made me think though I fain would forget it,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">And there settled a deep, awful silence</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Save a now-and-then, air-breaking boom</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Of the cannon that told how the German</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Was blasting and drilling his way</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Into the heart of my country</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">And I longed to slip out in the night</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">To the battlefield there in the distance</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And search for my brother in spite</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Of the stern command of the German</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Who had published it loudly and bold:</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">With the day&apos;s loud bellow of cannon,</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">I prayed to my God up in heaven</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">For strength to be brave and for power</l>

                    <head>THE SNOWY OWL</head>
                    <lg>
                        <l rend="ti-1">The snowy owl sat on a tree,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">His feathers were ruffled and torn,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">A bump on his head that was swollen and red</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Made him feel very wretched and lorn.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l rend="ti-1">He had come from the far, frozen north,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And feeling his worth in the land,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">He had tested the skill of a fluttering mill</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">That a farmer had placed there to stand.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And a fan of said fluttering mill,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Took a smash at the head of the owl,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And hit him its best on the top of the crest,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And down went both feathers and fowl.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l rend="ti-1">He lay quite a while in a trance,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Then arose with an unsmiling face,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And spluttered and croaked like a fellow half choked,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And sat down his misfortunes to trace.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l rend="ti-1">&quot;The white bear is cruel and cold I&quot;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">He said with a snap of his beak,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">&quot;But he beats half a mile this blamed thing that
                            will</l>
                        <l rend="ti-5">smile,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">And knock off your head ere you speak!&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Then I thought that the wail of Sir Owl</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Had a moral we all could well take;</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">For how often do we travel country and sea</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Life&apos;s better conditions to make.</l>

                        <l rend="ti-2">The new thing we sought hard and far</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Is a deal more unkind to our sensitive mind</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Than the old thing we sought to debar!</l>

                        <l>John&apos;s had his ups and downs</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>I remember when he lost his darling child,</l>
                        <l>His precious Dorothy</l>
                        <l>She was the apple of his eye;</l>
                        <l>His honest soul was buried deep</l>
                        <l>In love for her.</l>
                        <l>It almost broke my heart</l>
                        <l>To see him struggle with a grief so poignant</l>
                        <l>In his simple-hearted way!</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg>
                        <l>But after all the jolts and blows,</l>
                        <l>The disadvantages of life and birth,</l>
                        <l>For such an awkward colt,</l>

                        <l>I used to feel chagrined</l>
                        <l>When Johny, in the old debates,</l>
                        <l>Would talk about the &quot;Poke o&apos; Rome&quot;;</l>

                    <lg>
                        <l>But I&apos;ve got over that a long ago.</l>
                        <l>I look beyond mistakes in words,</l>
                        <l>And see the honest, home-spun soul behind,</l>
                        <l>Big of heart, faithful and true,</l>
                        <l>But awkward!</l>

                        <p>The first part- of the following story-poem was sug- gested to the author
                            by hearing Comrades David S. and George M. Whitenack, who were captured
                            during the civil war, and confined in Andersonville Prison, tell of
                            their experience in, and escape from, this loathsome pen. They both now
                            reside in Greenwood, Indiana.</p>
                        <p>The story-poem departs, to some extent, from the nar- rative they gave,
                            but not more, perhaps, than the rules of fiction and of verse allow.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the story-poem was suggested by hearing the venerable
                            Dr. P. W. Payne, of Franklin, Indiana, tell of his experience in passing
                            a mob late one night engaged in hanging some poor wretch. His prayer,
                            &quot;Oh, Lord, have mercy on my soul l&quot; made such an im-
                            pression on the doctor, then a young man, that for weeks and weeks it
                            rang through his ears constantly. There was no rescue, however, in the
                            instance the doctor described.</p>

                                <l>He then made haste to softly say:</l>
                            </lg>
                            <lg>
                                <l>&quot;What means this throng so late at night?&quot;</l>
                                <l>&quot;Oh, them?&quot; says he, &quot;Why,
                                    they&apos;re all right!</l>
