            Daniel D. Pratt: Lawyer and Legislator
            Joseph E. Holliday⋆
            
            It has been Daniel Pratt's fate to be one of the nearly forgotten senators from Indiana. He
                    served in Congress for only one term, 1869–1875, and no important piece of legislation is
                    connected with his name. He was a modest, rather self-effacing man who served in an arena where
                    modesty is seldom the rule. Active during a period of extreme political partisanship, he was a
                    moderate. In an age when the reputation of many politicians became spotted, his shone with luster.
                    His Senate colleague from Indiana was Oliver P. Morton, the Civil War governor, who had entered the
                    Senate in 1867 and whose prominence always overshadowed that of the Junior Senator from Indiana.
                    After completing his term in the Senate, Pratt became commissioner of internal revenue at the time
                    of the exposure of the Whiskey Ring. As did so many other good men connected with the Grant
                    administration, he resigned without completing his term, because the President insisted on
                    dismissing a courageous investigator of the Whiskey Frauds. Although Pratt lacked political flair
                    and brilliance, he was an able public servant, an arduous worker, and a politician of integrity.
            Pratt came to Indiana from the East as a young man. He was born in 
                  Palermo, Maine
               , on October
                    26, 1813, the son of a country physician. His family, however, soon moved to 
                        Madison County
                     in western 
                        New York
                    .1 His formal education was better than that of most Americans of
                    his time. He was graduated from 
                        Hamilton
                     College, Clinton, 
                        New York
                    ,

                            (Indiana Division, Indiana State Library, 
                                Indianapolis

                     in 1831 as valedictorian of his class. While a student at 
                        Hamilton
                    , he was greatly influenced by John H. Lathrop, professor of mathematics and natural
                    philosophy, who later became president of the universities of 
                  Missouri, Wisconsin
               ,
                    and Indiana, and a "pioneer in higher education in the Middle West."2 The young graduate taught for a short time at 
                        Madison
                     University in 
                        New York
                     but soon determined to move west.
            Pratt came to maturity during the decade of the 1830's when the Jacksonian westward
                    migration was at its height and the lure of the West strong. In 1832, with thirty dollars in his
                    pocket, he left 
                        New York
                     by way of the Erie Canal. By the time he reached 
                  Chillicothe, Ohio
               , he
                    found his small savings so depleted that boat travel was no longer possible. Leaving his trunk to be
                    brought on by boat, he walked to 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Pausing there for only a short time, he pushed along the Ohio
                    River to 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , Indiana.3 Here Pratt advertised himself as a teacher and taught a
                    few students during the summer of 1832. In the fall of that year he was appointed principal of the
                    seminary at Rising Sun, Indiana, a few miles farther down the Ohio River.4
            
            Teaching, however, did not appear to offer the opportunities that the ambitious young man desired;
                    law seemed to be a more alluring profession. George H. Dunn, prominent lawyer and politician of 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , and Pinkney James, a well-known businessman of Rising Sun, gave him letters of
                    introduction to influential friends in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Thus, after fifteen months in southern Indiana, and carrying letters of introduction
                    to Governor Noah Noble, Judge Bethuel F. Morris, Samuel Merrill, the state treasurer, and Calvin
                    Fletcher, he moved once more.5
            
            When Pratt came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1833, it was a town of about twenty-five hundred inhabitants and in its first decade
                    as the state capital. The new statehouse was still

                     under construction. Through Pratt's eyes, the city
                    looked promising. As he wrote in 1834 to his friend, John H. Jones, "The country around
                    here is beautiful and fast filling up—and 
                        Indianapolis
                     contains all kinds of society and has already made considerable advances in
                        refinement."6 Calvin Fletcher, one of the leading lawyers in the
                    capital, permitted Pratt to study in his office, and from this association there developed a very
                    fine friendship. Their correspondence and visits continued until Fletcher's death in
                        1866.7 The young law student also needed to maintain himself while studying.
                    Governor Noble employed him for a time as his private secretary and appointed him a quartermaster
                    general at a salary of fifty dollars per year. He also found part-time work with Secretary of State
                    William Sheets, who employed him as a clerk while the general assembly was in session.8
            
            Despite these jobs and his legal studies, Pratt did not neglect opportunities for gaining experience
                    and training as an orator. In his younger days, Pratt wrote out his speeches and memorized them. He
                    joined the newly-organized Athenaeum in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and among his papers is a copy of an address on "The Atmosphere,"
                    with the notation that it was read before members of that organization on February 24, 1835.9 There are also copies of several addresses on temperance, a reform in which
                    Pratt retained an interest throughout his life.10 The decade of the
                    1830's was one of revived interest in slavery and intemperance; each received attention
                    from reformers. Pratt's law mentor, Calvin Fletcher, was greatly interested in both of
                    these movements, and Pratt was quite likely influenced by him.11

            The militant antislavery movement, beginning in the decade of the 1830's, was probably too
                    extreme for Pratt's cautious, legalistic, and conservative outlook. Rather, the gradual
                    methods advocated by the American Colonization Society were more appealing to him. Another
                    handwritten address among his papers, with the notation that it was delivered in a Methodist church
                    at 
                        Indianapolis
                     on July 6, 1834, indicates his interest in antislavery. It is a plea for greater
                    support for the Indiana branch of the American Colonization Society. Using the well-known phrase of
                    the Declaration of Independence as a premise, Pratt asked his audience if the colored man was
                    recognized in Indiana as the equal of the white man. After sketching the disabilities under which
                    the free Negroes lived in the state, it was obvious that "while they live and work among
                    us, they are not of us." While Pratt had no hope that their condition would be better in
                    the foreseeable future, he urged greater public interest in the society's branch in the
                    state, which sorely needed some financial support. The state branch had been organized in 1829, but
                    after five years no more than $600 had been contributed by Hoosiers to the parent
                    society. Pratt expressed his belief that the society's program would not only aid the free
                    Negroes in America, but that 
                        Liberia
                     could serve as a base for "the redemption of Africa" from barbarism
                    and Islam. Therefore, he urged Hoosiers, as philanthropists and Christians, to contribute. Referring
                    to the 
                        Denmark
                     Vesey revolt in 
                        South Carolina
                     in 1822 and the revolt of Nat Turner in 
                        Virginia
                     in 1831, he continued: "It becomes, then, a matter of serious policy to remove
                    as fast as possible combustibles that may one day ignite and spread confusion and devastation
                        around."12
            
            By 1836 Pratt felt prepared to start practicing law on his own, and he chose to settle in 
                        Logansport
                    , seventy miles north of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Since a large part of Fletcher's business was devoted to debt collections,
                    Pratt had been sent to various parts of the state on such errands and, therefore, had an opportunity
                    to observe a number of towns.13 In 1836 
                        Logansport
                     had about eight hundred inhabitants. It had been

                     laid out as a town in 1828 and became the county seat for 
                        Cass County
                     the following year. It was in the heart of what was then called the "
                        Wabash
                     Country." Located on the 
                        Michigan
                     Road, which was being constructed southward from Lake 
                        Michigan
                    , it had the added advantage of being on the proposed route of the 
                        Wabash
                     and Erie Canal, which was then under construction.14 Its proximity
                    to the areas occupied by Miami and Potawatomi Indian reservations also made it a lively trading
                    center. It was near their "Treaty Grounds," and, since considerable litigation
                    originated there, it was a place where there was need for lawyers. At that time 
                        Indianapolis
                     lawyers came there to practice when the circuit court was sitting.15
            
            One position which Pratt sought during his first year of legal practice was that of assistant clerk
                    of the lower house of the general assembly of 1836–1837. But as one of four aspirants
                    nominated for that position, Pratt lost to George P. R. Wilson.16 This was
                    apparently his first political contest. The policy of the federal government in removal of the
                    Indians gave Pratt another opportunity for a temporary position. Colonel Abel C. Pepper, the Indian
                    agent, was negotiating a treaty of removal with the tribes near 
                        Logansport
                     in 1838, and Pratt eagerly accepted a post as his assistant secretary. Pratt's
                    salary was four dollars per day, with an additional sum of eighty-five dollars for keeping the
                    accounts and distributing the gifts.17 Many years later Pratt vividly recalled
                    this experience—the methods used in treaty negotiations, the transfer of lands, the
                    distribution of presents and money, and the drunken orgies of the Indians.18
            
            While Pratt was with Colonel Pepper during the Indian negotiations his thoughts turned to marriage.
                    The girl to whom he decided to propose was Sophia James, who five years before had been his
                    "most talented pupil" at Rising Sun

                    Pepper and the daughter of Colonel Pinkney James, a man of wide business interests. Pratt's
                    proposal of marriage was favorably received, and on November 28, 1839, he married Sophia.20
            
            Pratt devoted all his energies to building up a law practice. Apparently, one of the reasons for the
                    fine practice he eventually developed was "the exclusive and exhaustive manner in which he
                    gave himself to his profession."21 Nonetheless, the first few years
                    were financially lean; Pratt later recalled that his earnings during the first year were from
                    $300 to $400.22 The Panic of 1837 and the ensuing
                    depression had to be weathered. Judged by current standards, the scale of fees on which the lawyers
                    of 
                        Logansport
                     agreed to base their charges in 1835 was indeed modest. For debt collections under
                    $100, the fee was 10 per cent; from $100 to $500, it was 6 per
                    cent; 5 per cent fee was charged for collections over $500. A fee of $1.50 was
                    to be charged for preparing a mortgage or executing power of attorney; $10 was the
                    established fee for filing a bill in chancery; and $15 was the charge for attending a
                    chancery suit.23
            
            Pratt entered into a law partnership with William S. Palmer, but this partnership was dissolved in
                    1843, and evidently the two lawyers divided their business when they ended their association.
                    Several years after the dissolution, Palmer absconded with nearly $500 in debt
                    collections belonging to clients, some of whom had started with the firm of Pratt and Palmer. Pratt
                    was scrupulously honest and was deeply hurt by this action of his former partner.24 After practicing alone for several years, Pratt formed a partnership with Stephen C. Taber,
                    son of a wealthy

                    widely-scattered properties.25 In 1858 Pratt accepted one of his former
                    students, Dudley H. Chase, as a partner for a short time.26 His last partner was
                    his nephew, Daniel Pratt Baldwin, who came to 
                        Logansport
                     from 
                        Columbia

                    .27
            
            As a young lawyer in a raw country, Pratt handled almost any practice that came his way. One of his
                    early cases concerned the Scott murder of 1838. Jeremiah H. Harrison, a shoemaker by trade, had
                    moved to 
                        Logansport
                     from Rising Sun. In a night of brawling in a tavern, David Scott, a popular farmer of
                    the neighborhood, was stabbed, and Harrison was charged with the murder. Harrison was too poor to
                    employ legal counsel, and the court appointed Pratt and William Z. Stuart to defend him. The jury
                    found Harrison guilty of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to be hanged. Evidently Pratt was
                    firmly convinced that the evidence of Harrison's guilt was not clear, for he made two trips
                    to 
                        Indianapolis
                     by horseback to seek reprieves from the governor. Since Scott had been a popular man in
                    the community, Pratt was hanged in effigy by some local residents for delaying the execution.
                    Harrison, however, committed suicide the night before he was to be hanged.28
            
            Much of Pratt's business consisted of collection of debts, payment of notes, and transfer of
                    real estate.29 As his reputation grew, he became legal counsel for W. G. Ewing
                    and G. W. Ewing, Indian traders, land speculators, and merchants, who had extensive land holdings in
                    northern Indiana.30 The

                        counties.31 The 
                        Lafayette
                     branch of the State Bank of Indiana also sought his services as its agent in the

                        Logansport
                    .32
            
            By the decade of the 1850's Pratt's professional stature had grown to the place
                    where he was considered among the best lawyers in northern Indiana. This position was a result of
                    his integrity, the thorough way in which he prepared his cases, and his skill in pleading.
                    "He was of indefatigable industry…. When employed in time, he was never
                    surprised or defeated. He would explore every phase" of a case.33
                    William Z. Stuart, a member of the 
                        Logansport
                     bar and later a judge of the state supreme court, is quoted as having said that Pratt
                    "`would develop more original views of law in a case that he studied, and maintain them
                    better and with more authorities'" than any other man he ever knew.34 Pratt's closing argument before a jury was considered the strongest feature in
                    his conduct of a trial case. David Turpie wrote: 
                        An argument to a jury, delivered upon the facts of the case in the close, was by him very
                            seldom made in vain. He was tall in stature, some inches over six feet, and well
                            proportioned in his whole figure. His voice when raised to its full pitch and volume might
                            literally be well likened to the sound of many waters.35
                  
                    In general, Pratt seems to have been at his best in a jury trial.36
            
            A discussion of Pratt's legal career would not be complete without reference to the young
                    men who read law in his office. Pratt himself wrote: "I regard the most useful and
                    honorable part of my life that [which was] engaged in teaching."37
                    Between twenty-five and thirty students were trained by him. Among these were John Upfold Pettit,

                    the opportunity to study with him.38 Turpie later recalled Pratt's
                    methods of instruction. He remembered him as being always "considerate" and
                    "conscientious in the discharge of his duty" toward these young men: 
                        Unless actually engaged in court he spent some hours every Saturday with his students,
                            questioned them closely on the subject upon which they were reading, answered himself
                            questions upon the same, and sometimes advised that a particular section or chapter should
                            be read over again, saying, by way of encouragement, that he had, when a student, taken the
                            same course. He accepted no compensation for his services; the work which a student did in
                            the office was perhaps of some assistance to him, but more to the student.39
                  
                    Pratt's reputation at the bar and his eloquence as a public speaker led also to
                    many invitiations for public addresses40 and to honorary membership in the
                    college literary societies of Asbury (now DePauw), 
                  Wabash,
                            Franklin
               , and Wittenberg (
                        Ohio
                    ) colleges.41
            
            Pratt's rise to eminence in the legal profession was accompanied by ventures in politics.
                    The Whig party, generally regarded as the more conservative of the major parties of the time, was
                    the one with which Pratt affiliated. The men who probably influenced him the most at the beginning
                    of his residence in Indiana were National Republicans or Whigs. As already mentioned, Governor Noble
                    helped him in 
                        Indianapolis
                     when he was a young law student. Calvin Fletcher, his legal preceptor and close friend,
                    and Pinkney James, his father-in-law, were Whigs. With the congressional election of 1847
                    approaching, Pratt sought the Whig nomination for Congress from the Ninth District. His chief rival
                    was John B. Niles, but Pratt was chosen as the Whig candidate at the district convention at 
                        Plymouth
                    .42

            At this time the Mexican War was being fought, and the question of extension of slavery into
                    territory that might be acquired from Mexico was being debated. In the fifteen counties comprising
                    the Ninth Congressional District, which was located in northern Indiana, the population included
                    many settlers from the East. Free-Soilism had a greater number of sympathizers there than in the
                    southern section of the state. With most of them, the war was not popular.43 The
                    Democratic administration of President Polk was waging the war, and, as the opposition party, the
                    Whigs had to speak carefully on war issues. Pratt wrote to John D. Defrees, a Whig leader in the
                    state, for advice on the position he should take in his campaign. Defrees' reply was a
                    model of caution, astuteness, and political sagacity. He advised Pratt to uphold the
                    "no-annexation principle" as far as any Mexican territory was concerned but to
                    support the soldiers in the field as long as the war continued. The old Whig planks, advised
                    Defrees, should not be discussed at great length, although the subtreasury and tariff might be
                    mentioned, "occasionally and mildly."44
            
            Pratt's Democratic opponent was Charles W. Cathcart of 
                        La Porte
                    , who was seeking re-election. A former sailor, land surveyor, farmer, and member of the
                    state senate, Cathcart had served as a presidential elector in 1844 and had been elected to Congress
                    in 1845.45 As was customary at that time, the two candidates conducted a joint
                    canvass of their district from June 29 to July 31.46 The chief issue was a
                    national one—the support of the war, and particularly the question of voting supplies for
                    the American army fighting in Mexico. Cathcart stood on his record in supporting the war and
                    American troops. Pratt pledged his support to the army, but opposed the annexation of any possible
                    slave territory from Mexico.47 Pratt went down to defeat in his first serious
                    effort for an elective office; Cathcart received 7,474 votes, Pratt

                    that year the Whigs won four of the ten congressional seats from Indiana.48
            
            In 1848 a presidential campaign was fought. By that time the war with Mexico was concluded, and the
                    issue of slavery in the newly acquired territory was a burning one. The Whigs had the major military
                    heroes of the war; both General Zachary Taylor and General Winfield Scott were serious contenders
                    for the Whig presidential nomination. Scott was more popular with the Indiana Whigs than Taylor was.
                    At the Battle of Buena Vista, the Second Indiana Regiment had retreated, and General Taylor had
                    censured it, an action that lost him much support he might have had in the state.49 Pratt was a delegate to the Whig national convention in 
                        Philadelphia
                     and was the last of the Indiana delegation to switch his vote from Scott to Taylor.50 Pratt took this occasion to visit his old home in 
                        New York
                     and then returned to Indiana to throw himself into the canvass for the Whig ticket.51 He had accepted the nomination as presidential elector and participated,
                    during July and August, in a joint canvass with Dr. Graham Fitch, Democratic contestant for the same
                        post.52
            
            Although Indiana went Democratic in the election, the national success of the Whig ticket and
                    Pratt's share in the canvass of 1848 placed him in a strong position for renomination for
                    Congress in 1849. He was also mentioned as a possible candidate for governor.53
                    Pratt now displayed an unfortunate flaw in political shrewdness—excessive caution,
                    hesitation, or timidity—which prevented him from grasping opportunities for political
                    advancement. Although his friends were certain that he again could have had the congressional
                    nomination had he demonstrated that he wanted it, he did not do so, and the district convention
                    chose William Wright

                     as the Whig candidate for Congress.54
                    Graham Fitch, Pratt's friend, neighbor, and family physician, was nominated for Congress on
                    the Democratic ticket. Fitch had entered politics in 1836 as a candidate for the state legislature.
                    He was elected to Congress over Wright and later served as 
                        United States
                     senator.55 In 1852, as a member of Congress, he was asked by the
                    secretary of war for a nomination for the Board of Visitors of West Point. He suggested Pratt, but
                    the appointment was not offered.56
            
            Having failed election to Congress in 1847 and having permitted the Whig nomination to go to another
                    in 1849, Pratt turned his attention to a race for the state legislature. The railroad fever had
                    reached 
                        Logansport
                    , and its citizens were interested in securing better railway facilities to the East.
                    The Lake 
                  Michigan, Logansport
               , and Ohio River Railway Company, a
                    north-south line, had been chartered in 1848. In order to join an east-west route, 
                        Logansport
                     citizens hoped to intersect the proposed 
                        Indianapolis
                     and Bellefontaine line between Anderson and 
                        New Castle
                    .57 Under the old Indiana constitution it was necessary that the
                    legislature pass special charters for each road. This necessitated a legislative amendment to the
                    first charter of the Lake 
                  Michigan, Logansport
               , and Ohio River
                    Railway. 
                        Cass County
                     thus needed a strong representative in the legislature to take care of these vital
                    local interests, and Pratt had been very active in the 
                        Logansport
                     railroad mass meetings.58 At the 
                        Whig county
                     convention in January, 1850, he had no opposition for the nomination as representative
                    from Cass and Howard counties to the lower house of the general assembly.59 The
                    small Free Soil party in 
                        Cass County
                     also endorsed his candidacy, and he was elected to the Thirty-fifth General
                        Assembly.60
            
            When Pratt took his place at that session, it was as a member of the minority party. The Democrats
                    elected Ebenezer Dumont as speaker. This general assembly also re-elected Jesse D. Bright to the 
                        United States
                     Senate. In

                     spite of his affiliation with the minority party, Pratt soon
                    emerged as one of the leaders in the house. Appointed to serve on three standing
                    committees—Judiciary, Benevolent and Scientific Institutions, and State
                    Prison—he was made chairman of the last.61
            
            Pratt soon gained wide attention as the author of the report of a select committee to recommend
                    additional appropriations required by the protracted meeting of the state constitutional convention.
                    This lengthy session, with its added expense, had irritated many voters.62 The
                    committee report called attention to the fact that the first constitution of Indiana had been framed
                    in twenty-one days, whereas the convention to revise it had already spent four months in debate. It
                    stated that, while the act calling the convention did not actually limit its session, the committee
                    believed that the previous legislature had never expected a session longer than three months. If
                    "strict economy of time" had been used, the convention's work could have
                    been completed in the three-month span. The report concluded that "the people are restless
                    and dissatisfied with the state of things."63
            
            The house journal records that Pratt introduced twenty bills during this session, fifteen of which
                    became laws.64 Among those that were successful was the "NewCastle
                    Amendment" to the charter of the Lake 
                  Michigan, Logansport
               , and
                        Ohio River Railroad.65
            
            Pratt was not a candidate for re-election in 1851,66 nor is there any evidence
                    that he expected to be a candidate in 1852. The 
                        Cass County
                     Whig convention of September, 1852, over which Pratt presided as chairman, nominated

                     the lower house.67 It was later found,
                    however, that Dunn was a justice of the peace whose commission would not expire for two years. The
                    new constitution declared any state officer ineligible as a candidate for another state office
                    during his term. Dunn withdrew, and Pratt was selected to make the race.68 It
                    was very short notice, for the elections were only a few weeks away, but he won by a majority of
                    twenty-four votes.69
            
            In the Thirty-seventh Session of the legislature in 1853, Pratt was again a member of the minority
                    party in the house. Among his friends in the majority party was David Turpie, his former law
                    student, who was now flexing his political muscles and was the Democratic representative from White
                    and 
                        Benton
                     counties.70 Pratt's role in this session was in marked
                    contrast to the active part he played in the earlier one. He was appointed to the committees on the
                    judiciary and corporations, but held no chairmanship.71 The record indicates
                    that he introduced only eight bills, four of which were passed.72 One of the
                    successful ones authorized two or more railroad companies to assume a common name.73
            
            One of the major bills which some legislators hoped to force through this session of the assembly was
                    one to repeal the Free Banking Act of 1852. The subject of banking was so highly controversial in
                    Indiana in this era that it seemed impossible to reach any general agreement within either party on
                    the subject. The Second State Bank, with its branches, and a number of recently authorized free
                    banks were doing business in the state in 1853.74 Although the Whigs were
                    regarded as strong supporters of the State Bank, there were numerous Whigs who supported free
                    banking. Pratt was among them. The 
                        Cass County
                     Whig convention of 1852 had adopted a resolution, introduced by Pratt, endorsing free
                    banking "with proper supervision" and opposing a system

                     granting a "monopoly" of banking.75 The general assembly of 1852 had authorized "free banks";
                    now after only one year of free banking, it was proposed that the banking structure again be changed
                    by repealing the Free Banking Act of 1852. The repeal bill passed the senate, but when it reached
                    the house, a bolt was staged by those members who favored free banking, including Pratt, and the
                    attempt to repeal the act thus failed.76
            
            These two sessions of the general assembly offered Pratt the only legislative experience he had until
                    his election to the 
                        United States
                     Senate in 1869. In that interval of sixteen years, great changes were taking place in
                    the country. Pratt's party was in the last months of its existence when he left the
                    legislature in 1853. Out of the political flux that followed, a new party emerged in which he found
                    a place for his loyalty. In 1854 Stephen A. Douglas introduced the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Act, with its provisions for the organization of two territories in the West, the
                    repeal of the 
                        Missouri
                     Compromise line, and popular sovereignty as a method of solving the question of slavery
                    in the new territories. The political repercussions of that act are well known. The Whig party
                    disintegrated, and new political groups struggled for the allegiance of the voters. Out of this
                    change came the formation of the Republican party.
            There were at least five groups that combined to form this new party in Indiana—the
                    old-line Whigs, Know-Nothings, antislavery Democrats, temperance advocates, and former Free-Soilers.
                    But their fusion did not develop quickly. Skill and time were needed to accomplish this, and, above
                    all, leadership. Whig leadership appears to have been primarily responsible for this fusion, but
                    that leadership could not be too blatant or asserted too aggressively for fear of alienating some
                    elements within the new party.77 Pratt was a representative of three of these
                    elements in the embryonic party. He was an old-line Whig, an opponent of slavery, and a strong
                    advocate of temperance. His correspondence reveals no suspicion of any adherence to the Know-Nothing
                    movement.

                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Act, or Fusionists as they were then called, was held at 
                        Indianapolis
                     on July 13, 1854. Pratt took no active part in it, and appears not to have been
                        present.78 In the following year a similar meeting was held in 
                        Indianapolis
                     on July 15, and there is a copy of the call to attend that meeting among
                    Pratt's papers, which was franked to him over Congressman Lucien Barbour's
                        signature.79 William Wallace, of 
                        Marion County
                    , wrote Pratt, urging him to attend and "to bring along with you as many
                    delegates from Old Cass as you can." Wallace also wrote that Pratt would be expected to
                    address the crowd and warned: "We shall be disappointed if you are absent."80 But neither the 
                        Logansport
                     newspapers nor Pratt's correspondence mention his presence at the convention.
            Pratt's sympathies, however, were known to be with this Fusionist party, and, as the
                    campaign of 1856 began to gather momentum, he was proposed as the candidate for governor.81 In his letter to the 
                        Logansport
                    
                    Journal declining to be a candidate, Pratt stated that he had wavered between his
                    political ambitions and his "professional trusts," and had reluctantly reached the
                    conclusion that demands of the legal profession made it impossible for him to undertake a heavy
                        campaign.82 He did, however, accept the nomination for presidential elector
                    from his district, and he participated in the campaign.83 The Democrats carried
                    the state in that year.84 During the next four years, Pratt's name was
                    advanced for judge of the state supreme court in 1858 and for attorney general of Indiana in
                        1860.85

            During the presidential election year of 1860 Pratt became very active. He attended the Republican
                    state convention at 
                        Indianapolis
                     on February 22 and was chosen as one of the delegates-at-large to the national
                    convention at 
                        Chicago
                    .86 At 
                        Chicago
                     he was given the post of "reading secretary," since his stentorian
                    voice could carry over the noise of that rather unruly convention.87 Returning
                    from 
                        Chicago
                    , Pratt did yeoman service in the canvass. Calls from managers in his own district and
                    in northern Indiana indicate how highly his services as a political orator were valued.88 The Republicans were successful in carrying the state in that year. The
                    governor-elect, Henry S. Lane, was soon elected to the 
                        United States
                     Senate, and Lieutenant Governor Oliver P. Morton succeeded as governor.89 But no sooner had the Republican administration taken over the reins of government than
                    it was faced with unprecedented problems. With the outbreak of the Civil War, the
                    administration's abilities were severely tested in supporting the Union cause.
            These war years not only brought public sorrows for Pratt but private ones as well. Mrs.
                    Pratt's health had begun to fail as early as 1857. In the early summer of 1861, the family
                    spent a long vacation on Martha's Vineyard, where Pratt had an opportunity to engage in his
                    favorite sport of fishing.90 The change did not help his wife, however, and she
                    died in November, 1861.91 Her loss was felt keenly by her husband and three
                    surviving children.

                     Lane, he was later commissioned a lieutenant.93 Young Pratt was with the Army of the Potomac through its long series of campaigns. When the
                    government decided to enlist Negro troops, Pratt sought from Secretary of War Stanton a commission
                    for his son in a colored regiment, but "the interests of the services" would not
                    permit it.94 On May 29, 1864, on the eve of the Battle of Cold Harbor, James was
                    killed near 
                        Hanover

                        Ohio
                     Female College, in College Hill, to take care of her father and younger brother.
                    Shortly after the war she married Edward S. Huntington.96 The younger son,
                    Charley, became the black sheep of the family—an alcoholic and a ne'er-do-well.
                    The escapades of this scape-grace became a source of constant worry and sorrow to his father until
                    the young man's death in 1873.97
            
            In spite of these personal sorrows Pratt undertook those duties which leaders in a community are
                    called upon to do in times of crisis. He assisted in encouraging enlistments. When, in 1861, "
                        Cass County
                     sent out, upon a three days' notice, two companies of soldiers, he advanced
                    hundreds of dollars to the needy families of those who had gone."98
                    During the excitement of Morgan's Raid in Indiana during the summer of 1863, he helped to
                    organize the home guard.99
            
            Throughout his life, Pratt was a true humanitarian, sympathetic to a righteous appeal. When the
                    potato famine occurred in 
                        Ireland
                     in 1846–1847, he and the Rev. M. M. Post were 
                        Cass County
                     leaders in collecting money, wheat, and corn for the sufferers.100
                    Pratt was a member of the 
                        Logansport

                    Indiana Reform Alliance, which strove for a state prohibition law.102 One of the
                    provisions of Pratt's will set aside the income from $5,000 for the city of 
                        Logansport
                     to use in "relieving the necessities of the worthy poor… overtaken
                    by sickness, old age, or misfortune."103 Pratt had been reared by a
                    devout Baptist mother, and although one of his brothers was a Baptist clergyman, Pratt himself never
                    affiliated with that church. His nephew wrote that he was a Unitarian,104
                    probably refering to his theology rather than to church membership.
            During the war years, Pratt was not inactive, but there was a decline in his political activity. He
                    did not forsake politics completely, but he was not an active campaigner. Yet he was the nominee of
                    the Republican legislators for one of Indiana's seats in the 
                        United States
                     Senate in 1863. Although the elections of 1860 had been favorable for the Republicans,
                    the methods of the Morton administration often irritated and even angered many voters in the state.
                    Nor was the course of the Lincoln administration popular with many of them. Consequently, the
                    political pendulum swung in reverse in the off-elections of 1862, giving the Democrats a majority in
                    both houses of the general assembly.105 What followed is a confused and sordid
                    story. Legislators from both parties displayed excessive partianship inflamed by wartime passions.
            The election of two 
                        United States
                     senators—one, to serve the unexpired term of former Senator Jesse Bright,
                    the other, to serve the regular six-year term that followed—was an important item of
                    business for that session of the assembly. When Jesse Bright was expelled from the Senate on
                    February 5, 1862, his successor was appointed by the governor to hold office until the next session
                    of the legislature. Governor

                     Morton then appointed Joseph A. Wright, the former Democratic
                    governor and a War Democrat. His term would normally expire in March, 1863. By the time the assembly
                    convened, he had served less than a year, and if elected by the assembly in 1863, he would serve for
                    only the few weeks until the expiration of Bright's term.106 The
                    Republican caucus, therefore, chose Wright as their candidate for the long term. Pratt was then
                    nominated for the short term. The Democrats chose Thomas A. Hendricks to oppose Wright and David
                    Turpie to oppose Pratt. Thus, teacher and former student were rivals for the same seat. For a time,
                    a bolt by some Republican legislators blocked any business of the legislature, but the bolters were
                    finally persuaded to return.107 By a vote of 85–62, Turpie was
                    elected for the short term, and Thomas A. Hendricks won the regular seat.108
                    There is no evidence that Pratt sought this office. In fact, the statement appearing in a 
                        Cass County
                     history that he knew nothing of the choice of the caucus until he read of it in the
                    columns of the 
                        Cincinnati
                    
                    Gazette, might well be true.109
            
            Near the close of the war Pratt increased his political activity. He sought a federal appointment,
                    either as district attorney or as judge of the Federal Court of Claims. His services to the
                    Republican party and his outstanding success in the legal profession apparently made him a strong
                    candidate for an appointment to the judicial branch of the federal government. He also had a good
                    friend in 
                        Washington
                    , Schuyler Colfax, then Speaker of the House. But because of pressure from other
                    quarters and the inability of the Indiana delegation to agree, President Lincoln turned to other
                    applicants for these posts.110 Unsuccessful in securing an appointment, Pratt
                    sought an elective office.
            In the election year of 1868, the Republicans held their state convention in February.
                    Pratt's law partner, D. P. Baldwin, a member of the Republican State Central Committee, was
                    in 
                        Indianapolis
                     before the convention met. The managers agreed that Pratt should be temporary chairman
                    of the convention. Baldwin sent a telegram to Pratt telling

                     him of the choice and added, "You must be
                        here."111 The newspapers also reported that Pratt would be
                    temporary chairman.112 But for some reason which is not now apparent, Pratt did
                    not preside, nor was he present. General Thomas Browne was elected temporary chairman, and James
                    Hughes, of 
                        Monroe County
                    , became permanent chairman. The enthusiastic convention adopted a platform calling for
                    the payment of government bonds in greenbacks, except where payment in coin was expressly called
                    for. The rapid contraction of the currency was condemned, as was the monopoly of public lands
                    "either by individuals or corporations." With reference to the question of Negro
                    suffrage, which was to emerge as a prominent issue in this campaign, the platform stated that
                    "the question of suffrage in all loyal states belongs to the people of those
                    states." Conrad Baker was nominated for governor and Will E. Cumback, for lieutenant
                        governor.113
            
            The district conventions were held amid considerable doubt regarding the results, since the
                    legislature had re-districted the state for representation in both the legislature and Congress. In
                    the new Eighth District, Pratt was successful in winning the Republican congressional nomination.
                    His Democratic opponent was Nathan O. Ross.114 As the campaign in this district
                    came to a climax, the Republicans brought into the district, Colfax, their vice-presidential
                    nominee, Governor Walter Harriman, of 
                        New Hampshire
                    , Paul Troback, a German-American member of the 
                        Alabama
                     legislature, and Horace Maynard, strong Radical congressman from 
                        Tennessee
                    . At a mammoth mass meeting held at 
                        Logansport
                     on October 2, a crowd estimated at 15,000 persons heard all of these speakers.115 The race was a successful one for Pratt; the vote was 17,227 for Pratt and
                    14,496 for Ross.116 Pratt, however, had not yet left for

                     senator. This unexpected turn of events resulted from one of those violent intraparty
                    quarrels that erupted at a meeting of the state legislature.
            In 1869 the Republicans had a majority in both houses of the general assembly. They also had several
                    aspirants who hoped to succeed Thomas A. Hendricks in the 
                        United States
                     Senate. There had been some sentiment in favor of Walter Q. Gresham. According to
                    Gresham's wife and biographer, the Republican state chairman, Governor-elect Conrad Baker,
                    and a number of 
                        Greenfield
                    , Indiana, Republicans favored his candidacy before the legislature met. Although Morton
                    and Gresham were antagonistic, Morton had agreed not to oppose Gresham. But Gresham found that Negro
                    suffrage was to be backed by the regular administration leaders, and he was opposed to pushing it at
                    that time. He therefore eliminated himself as a candidate before the legislature convened.117
            
            Godlove S. Orth was another candidate who was eager for the honor. He solicited Pratt's
                    support, and wrote that Pratt could "do much among the Members elect [sic] from your district, and with that support I shall feel much encouraged in my
                        efforts."118 But Orth's candidacy received very little
                    support either before the meeting of the legislature or after a deadlock developed. When the
                    legislature assembled, it was clear that Lieutenant-Governor Will E. Cumback, of 
                        Greensburg
                    , was the strongest contender. Cumback had been very busy in building strength for this
                    election. Shortly after the elections of 1868, he wrote to George F. Chittendon, a member of the
                    lower house from 
                        Madison
                     and Henry counties, requesting him to write to some of his colleagues. He stated that
                    some of them might not know that "it was the understanding of our State Convention that if
                    I would make the race for Lieutenant Governor that I should have the preference for
                    senator," and added, "Should I succeed I will be in a position where I can help
                    you or any of your friends."119

            Three other men were likewise hoping that the lightning would strike them. One of these was James
                    Hughes. Hughes was a former professor of law at Indiana University who had served as a judge of the
                    circuit court, a member of the national House of Representatives from 1857–1859, and a
                    judge of the 
                        United States
                     Court of Claims from 1860–1864. He was a War Democrat and had supported the
                    Morton administration. After the war he was appointed an agent for the Treasury Department. He was
                    now a member of the state senate and was inordinately ambitious for the senatorship. He was
                    politically restless and was always a man of strong personal feelings.120
                    Richard W. Thompson was another candidate. He was urged by John D. Defrees, who was then
                    congressional printer, not to "let modesty keep you too much in the background,"
                    but to write to the Republican legislators and inform them of his interest in the office. Defrees
                    wrote that "it is about time that the custom of running for two offices at once should be
                        repudiated."121
            
            The custom to which Defrees referred was that of electing governors to the Senate. It is probable
                    that Governor Baker hoped that the custom would be continued.122 The newspaper
                    accounts of the Republican caucuses, however, do not mention his name as being under consideration
                        there.123 Of all of these candidates, it was Cumback who showed the greatest
                    strength. In the first caucus of the Republican legislators, it was reported that he had 51 of the
                    76 votes of those attending, while the remaining votes were scattered among other contenders.124
            
            A group of Cumback's personal enemies within the party, aided by the Democrats, engineered a
                    coup de gr$aCce that blasted his chances for election. The moving spirit of this group
                    was James Hughes, who had little respect for Cumback, whom he claimed had opposed his nomination as
                    a state senator and had excluded him from the senate's standing

                     committee on education. He especially desired this committee
                    assignment since he represented the county in which the state university was located.125 Thus, with violent personal hostility toward Cumback and strong aspirations for the
                    office, Hughes hoped to unite the Democratic legislators with enough anti-Cumback Republican members
                    to be elected to the Senate.126 Through this coalition, a senate resolution was
                    passed calling on Governor Baker to transmit certain correspondence that had passed between Cumback
                    and Baker in 1868.127 In this way an opportunity was found to brand Cumback as
                    unethical and unfitted for the high office he sought.
            The correspondence consisted of four letters, the first of which was from Cumback to Baker, dated
                    January 6, 1868. In it, Cumback proposed that if Senator Hendricks were to resign while the
                    legislature was not in session, the governor could appoint his successor. If Baker were elected
                    governor, Cumback asked assurance of receiving the senatorial appointment from him, and, if such
                    assurance were given, Cumback promised not to contest the party nomination of Baker for governor.
                    Baker's reply was a scorcher. He stated that such a proposition was "corrupt and
                    indecent" and that he felt "humiliated that any human being should measure me by
                    so low a standard of common morality as to make it." Cumback then requested the return of
                    the first letter, but Baker refused.128
            
            The striking disclosure of this year-old correspondence offered an opportunity for the senate to pass
                    a resolution censuring its own presiding officer for making "a corrupt and indecent attempt
                    to tamper with… the appointing power vested in the Governor."129 Anti-Cumback Republican legislators, including Hughes and nine others, now refused to vote
                    for Cumback. The resolution of censure was later expunged after it had served its partisan
                        purpose.130 Seven joint sessions of the two houses failed to elect a
                    senator. The Democratic members refused to cooperate any longer, but

                     voted for Thomas A. Hendricks. By this time the friends of
                    Pratt were actively promoting his candidacy as a compromise candidate.
            Gilbert A. Pierce and James S. Frazer of 
                        Warsaw
                     were most active in Pratt's behalf. Both of them were old friends and both
                    were from the northern part of the state.131 When Cumback failed to be elected
                    on the first few ballots, it was unfortunate that he did not withdraw. When he did do so, he
                    attempted to throw his influence in favor of James C. Veatch,132 which merely
                    added to the difficulty. The strident voices of the factions indicated serious party
                    discord—just what the Democrats hoped would develop. Finally, on the morning of January
                    22, 1869, a tired Republican caucus nominated Pratt.133 When the eighth joint
                    session of the legislature met, the Republicans were able to elect him. The total number of votes
                    cast was 143, with 73 necessary to elect. Pratt received 83 votes and Hendricks, 60.134
            
            In telegraphing his congratulations, Speaker Colfax told Pratt that he "must be a child of
                        destiny."135 Pratt had nothing approaching a personal organization
                    within the party. He had been actively identified with the party since 1856; candidates for party
                    nominations had solicited his influence; and his genial personality had won him many friends.136 He was the choice of the Republicans in the assembly for senator in 1863,
                    when there was little likelihood of success. He lived in the northern part of the state, and
                    sectional balancing of candidates played a part. There was no group within the party which bore him
                    a grudge, as was the case with Cumback. Pratt was a good compromise candidate, a man of stature in
                    his community and profession, and without any strong ties of obligation to a faction. After
                    Pratt's election, the

                    "persistently" his nomination. The reasons

                    entangling alliances," and he "was not a candidate, but was a modest
                        man."137
            
            Pratt's election also came without the active assistance of Morton, who might have been
                    expected to have exerted some influence on the election. The paucity of correspondence between Pratt
                    and Morton is not without significance in assessing their personal relationship. No congratulatory
                    letter from Morton is to be found among Pratt's papers. There is evidence of an episode
                    dating from 1865 that might have prevented cordial relationships. In that year Pratt went to 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., during which time he checked on military volunteers from his
                    county—an act that appeared to question Governor Morton's figures in determining
                    draft quotas, and hence, was to be regarded by the governor as presumptuous on Pratt's
                    part. Word reached Morton through the columns of the 
                        Huntington
                     (Indiana) Democrat that this was the object of Pratt's
                    visit, and he at once challenged Pratt. Morton's letter of inquiry, delivered by an aide,
                    Charles J. Jacobs, was peremptory, terse, and arrogant.138 Pratt replied that
                    the primary object of his visit was to obtain a pass from the War Department to seek the grave of
                    his eldest son, killed in 
                        Virginia
                    ; but he had also sought information on quotas from the War Department, although he had
                    made no discovery as stated in the newspaper article.139
            
            The relationship between the Indiana Senators continued to be a very formal one and never ripened
                    into cordiality during their association in the Senate. Morton had developed the habits and
                    attitudes of an autocrat. As his biographer wrote, Morton "suffered no peers among his
                        associates."140 Pratt had not worked closely with Morton during the
                    war. Never autocratic or vigorously aggressive, Pratt was a man of independent judgment and strong
                        convictions.141 Consequently, he was not one who merely reflected

                     views in the Senate; he followed his own path, reached his own
                    conclusions, and acted upon them in an independent fashion.
            At the time of his election to the Senate, Pratt was fifty-five years of age. He had attempted to
                    take up some of the broken strands of his family life, caused by the death of his first wife and
                    eldest son, by remarrying. In 1865, he married a widow, Mrs. Jane D. Warren.142
                    In 1869 Pratt was a strapping man, six feet four inches in height and 270 pounds in weight; later he
                    became much heavier.143 The story was current that, because of his size, a
                    special chair in the Senate chamber was constructed for him and later used by Senator David Davis,
                    of 
                        Illinois
                    , another giant.144 His voice matched his height and weight. His
                    physical appearance and voice conveyed dignity, authority, and presence. In spite of this, however,
                    there was a modesty, bordering on genuine humility, that manifested itself after his election to the
                    Senate.
            The party wounds opened by the Cumback-Baker correspondence had not yet healed when Pratt reached the
                    astonishing conclusion to resign his seat in the Senate. He had been senator for less than a year
                    when this decision became known, and it created consternation among the party leaders in his state.
                    It was probably the greatest blunder of his career. Pratt's decision to resign was the
                    result of a number of factors. His letter to Governor Baker, forewarning him of the resignation,
                    gave limitations of his capabilities as the reason. He wrote: "Whatever capabilities I
                    possessed as a mere lawyer, I have none as a statesman—and it is too late in life to
                    qualify for this place."145 His formal letter of resignation, written
                    two days later, gave personal reasons—his legal practice, which was suffering, and the
                    need for directing the legal studies of his younger son.146 Pratt's
                    intention to resign became widely known, and there was considerable speculation over it.

                     mentioned.147 What is more probable,
                    although he did not mention it in his letters, is that the crass and sordid search for offices
                    depressed him. Certainly office-seekers were harassing him from every side.
            Whatever his reasons, they were overborne by influences from his home state. Even Morton wrote one of
                    his few letters to Pratt to encourage him by telling him: 
                        You greatly underrate your ability, and if you will but make a speech upon some question you
                            have examined, you will make a fine impression and be relieved effectively from the timidity
                            which oppresses you.… If, however, you have determined to resign or have done so,
                            I shall be glad to have you let me know, and also whether you have communicated your purpose
                            to other persons besides Governor Baker. There will be an immense scramble for the place and
                            I shall feel a deep interest in the character of your successor.148
                  
                    Governor Baker and others were more urgent in their pleas, reminding Pratt that harm would
                    come to the party by opening old wounds, and of the impossibility of making an appointment that
                    would give general satisfaction.149 The party state chairman, A. H. Conner,
                    telegraphed that Pratt's resignation would "make a difference of thousands of
                    votes at the next election.… It would be charged that you are not in sympathy with our
                        party."150 Pratt yielded to this pressure and decided to retain his
                    seat for the remainder of his term. He determined to fulfill his duties to the best of his ability.
                    During his six years of service, he would earn the esteem and confidence of his colleagues and
                    establish a reputation for integrity and faithful performance of his tasks.

            Pokagon is now an almost forgotten name except among those travelers in the Midwest who visit the
                    Potawatomi Inn in Indiana's Pokagon State Park or the small village of
                    Pokagon in 
                  Cass County, Michigan
               . But during his lifetime Chief Simon Pokagon of the
                        Potawatomi1 was known to many because of his two visits with Lincoln at the
                    White House, his appearance as unassuming guest of honor and orator for the 
                        Chicago
                     Day celebrations at the Columbian Exposition, his various other public addresses, and
                    his articles on Indian subjects in national magazines.2 His most extensive
                    literary work, the prose-poetry romance of the forest entitled O-Gi-Maw-Kwe
                        Mit-I-Gwa-Ki (Queen of the Woods), was in type but not yet published at the time of his
                    death in 1899.
            His contemporary reputation was such that the editor of the Review of Reviews
                    referred to "this distinguished Pottawattomie chieftain" as "one of the
                    most remarkable men of our time.… His great eloquence, his sagacity, and his wide range
                    of information mark him as a man of exceptional endowments."3 A feature
                    article in the Arena spoke of "this noble representative of the
                    red-man" as "simple-hearted and earnest."4 Looked on
                    as the "best educated full-blood Indian of his time,"5 he was

                    epithet then considered a high compliment. And in an obituary notice a 
                        Chicago
                     newspaper summarized: "He leaves behind him among the Indians no successor to
                    his poetic and literary ability."7 From our vantage point of some six
                    decades later it seems fitting, therefore, to look again at the career of Chief Simon Pokagon, and,
                    if necessary, to re-evaluate his literary contributions.
            Unrestrained but honest emotion is perhaps the dominant characteristic of Pokagon's work as
                    a whole. He is sorely troubled by the social and economic difficulties confronting the Indians of
                    his generation. He is deeply sensitive to the romantic virtues and beauties of unexploited nature;
                    and in Queen of the Woods his affection for his ill-starred family is poignant and
                    personal. But stylistically it is obvious that Pokagon's English phrases and figures merely
                    echo the polite literary conventions of his day ("the woodland choir,"
                    "the happy hunting-ground," "our pale-faced neighbours,"
                    "sweet little rosebud," "naked innocence," "bloom of
                    youth," "all nature slept," "the dark clouds rolled
                    away," and so on). This emulation of the popular and often trite phraseology of the
                    romantic-sentimental tradition weakens the vigor of his English style and disappoints a modern
                    reader. One feels that he is not speaking with the spontaneous voice of his own primeval culture,
                    but rather is borrowing the white man's nineteenth-century clich$eAs.
                    Nonetheless, his intrinsic subject—to the extent that it may be distinguished from its
                    verbal form—is original and fresh; and Queen of the Woods is a unique
                    document from a genuine Indian source, an emotional and at times lyrical remembrance of things past
                    rather than a synthetic, sterile exercise such as Hiawatha.
            
            It may be gratuitous to point out, also, that in putting Queen of the Woods and his
                    other manuscripts in order for the publisher, Pokagon doubtless had considerable editorial
                    assistance. His handwritten letters which remain show a certain unconcern for the niceties of
                    spelling and punctuation; and the syntax of some of his published work is not beyond reproach.
                    Evidence of his own unpolished style may be found

                        I take pleasure in presenting you a copy of my "Red Mans Greeting"
                                    printed on birch bark which I wrote in the year of the Worlds fair—
                        Perhaps you will recall I rode on the Float of 1812 on

                                    it is sent I remain yours truly

            But many otherwise able authors have shown some deficiency in verbal mechanics; and in view of the
                    unusual background from which Pokagon wrote, any syntactical criticism here would be picayune. O-Gi-Maw-Kwe Mit-I-Gwa-Ki (Queen of the Woods) is not a masterpiece of world
                    literature, it is true. It is indeed rare in its genre, a literary oddity. But the reader may
                    overlook its sentimentalities and eccentricities in view of the novelty of its contents and depth of
                    its feeling; and if he reads sympathetically his emotions may be touched. Too, this book vivifies a
                    segment of our national past which often is conveniently forgotten. But perhaps its ultimate worth
                    lies in the candid self-portrait of a son of the now-vanished forest. His prose style may have been
                    vitiated by his superficial and uncritical contacts with English literature; but his integrity as an
                    individual was not destroyed by the white man's culture. A member of a mistreated minority
                    group, he was able to face his changing and difficult environment courageously.

            Turning now to a more specific investigation of Simon Pokagon's writings, we find that his
                        Queen of the Woods is the central document. The events here related were
                    derived directly from Pokagon's private life, and the book itself is the best exemplar of
                    his literary style. Concerning this work the biographer of Chief Leopold Pokagon, Simon's
                    father, comments thus effusively: 
                        His Queen of the Woods has the tang, the zest, and the woodsy flavor of
                            life. It is pulsing with sympathy, heartfelt emotion, and sensitive feeling; a quaint
                            mixture of information, fact, history, pathos, romance, and poetry combined; a plaintive,
                            yet uncomplaining plea for justice and an eloquent and stirring plea for temperance. Lofty
                            sentiments, wise philosophical thoughts, and serious reflection temper and vivify all his
                                writings.9
                  
                    
            
            This tale (written first in his native tongue and then translated into English by the author) begins
                    at the time of Pokagon's return to his people after his years of white schooling. It is
                    narrated in the first person, and in spite of romantic overtones is largely a factual account. His
                    friend and publisher, C. H. Engle, of 
                  Hartford,
                            Michigan
               , referred to it as
                    "the historical sketch" of Pokagon's life, and labeled it a
                    "real romance of Indian life." "Nearly all the persons mentioned in the
                    narrative bear their real names, and were personally known to many yet living."10
            
            Some unusual aspects of the book immediately become apparent. The most obvious is the inclusion of
                    many Algonquin-Algaic11 terms, following which Pokagon gives the English
                    translation in parentheses. This intrusion of unfamiliar and difficult Indian expressions results in
                    a bumpy awkwardness which at first seems to break the flow of his English style. Careful reading
                    indicates, however, that these interpolated words have a strong rhythm of their own. Most of these
                    are single nouns or brief phrases, but in the latter part of the tale the author often inserts
                    complete sentences. He defends this odd bilingual practice: 
                        In consideration of the fact that the language of the great Algonquin family, which once was
                            spoken by hundreds of thousands throughout more than half of North America, is fast passing
                            away, I have retained such Indian words and expressions as appear in "Queen of the

                            the reader in after-generations, that such a language as ours was once spoken throughout
                            this loved land of my fathers.12
                  
                    
            
            "The Algonquin Language," a prefatory treatise of thirteen pages, presents in a
                    technical and succinct form the basic data of the speech system. Far from being a "sort of
                    `gibberish,'" according to Pokagon, Algaic contains some twenty thousand root
                    words on which numerous variations may be built. The seventeen letters of the alphabet include only
                    four vowels, of unchanging pronunciation, plus several diphthongs. Nine parts of speech are
                    distinguishable. Peculiarities of the language include great liberty in transposing word order; a
                    very involved use of different particles depending on gender and function of accompanying words; a
                    clipping or shortening of words when grouped in phrases; and a comprehensive body of agglutinative
                    terms to express family relationships. The basic structure of the sentence hinges on the verb, and
                    "nearly all the words in our language can be transformed into verbs." His own view
                    of the effectiveness and beauty of the Algonquin language is implicit in his apology that in
                    translating his manuscript into English in many places he lost the "force and
                    euphony" of the original.13
            
            A second obvious feature of Queen of the Woods is its semi-poetic form. Although
                    the story begins in ordinary prose, it soon shifts to comparatively regular iambics so that, had the
                    author chosen, much of the tale might have been printed as blank verse. This style (no doubt derived
                    from Pokagon's reading of the English poets) might have seemed to him also to reflect the
                    patterns of his own speech. One undeniable echo is that of the King James version of the Bible. The
                    resulting regular "beat" occasionally becomes obtrusive, but there is
                    unquestionably more variety than in the insistent rhythms of Hiawatha, for
                    example; and the highly sentimental-emotional-mystical mood occasionally reached in the tale might
                    justify a "poetic" line.
            The vital framework is the factual account of Pokagon's courtship, marriage, idyllic family
                    life, and subsequent deep tragedy. To this are added many marginal notes on the natural scene and
                    Indian domestic arts (more trustworthy and persuasive than Longfellow's eclectic data). But
                    Pokagon's

                     chief concern is with the ethereal character of Lonidaw, the
                    Indian princess who gently dominates the tale.
            His initial joy in returning to his native haunts is reflected in an early rhythmical passage: 
                        Just as "gi-siss" (the sun) was going down, we reached our landing-place.
                            The shore on either side was fringed with rushes, flags, and golden-rod, and grasses tall
                            between; and scattered here and there wild roses breathed their rich perfume, scenting the
                            evening air.14
                  
                    
            
            Off for a pre-dawn hunt, he sketches the scene: 
                        It was a beautiful quiet morning. All nature slept.… Just as the sun tinged the
                            topmost branches of the highland trees, a white fog-cloud appeared above the winding river
                            as far as eye could reach. It looked as though the stream had risen from its ancient bed,
                            and was floating in mid-air.15
                  
                    Returning with a buck over his shoulder, he surprised his mother, who took hold of the
                    arrows still fast in the flesh, praised him for his unforgotten skill, and exclaimed: "
                    `Kwaw-notch, kwaw-notch maw-mawsh-kay-she (beautiful, beautiful deer)! How could you have o-daw (the
                    heart) to take nin bim-á-dis-win (his life)?' "16
            
            Pokagon's first view of Lonidaw, his future bride, with "raven tresses floating in
                    the breeze," was on the further side of a stream where she was imitating the songs of wild
                    pigeons and bobolinks as a snow-white deer gamboled about her. Pokagon thought that such creatures
                    as she must be discovered only in the happy hunting ground beyond.17
            
            An old 
                        Ottawa
                     trapper, who had once given shelter to Lonidaw's mother on her flight from the
                    forced tribal migration in the 1830's, appears and tells Pokagon of Lonidaw's
                    birth in a swamp while her mother was hiding from the 
                        United States
                     troops and of the child's being carried by her starving mother for fifty miles
                    over rough country to his wigwam. Nature had taught her the language of the beasts and birds; and,
                    he added in a practical mood, " `if she would make use of her wonderful min-i-gowin
                    (gifts), she could nish-iwe min-a-wa (kill more) game than a dozen old hunters.'

            Away at school again after his vacation, Pokagon realized his inescapable love for Lonidaw, so when
                    springtime came he went in search of her. Young love at first was inarticulate, and even after his
                    declaration she protested that his white education had spoiled him for the simple life: "
                    `I am but pa-gwag ab-i-not ji mit-tig (a wild child of the woods), wild as ben-ish ig (the birds)
                    that gather round.… but should we wed, I fear you soon would tire of my native woodland
                    ways, and crush this childish o-daw nin (heart of mine).' "19
                    But when the moon of flowers came and mating birds were moving north, young Pokagon and his beloved
                    Lonidaw were united, without benefit of priest or formal ceremony. On an inland lake where wild rice
                    was plentiful he built their wigwam home; and on his return from hunting trips he always hailed her,
                    " `Hoi (Hallo), o-gi-maw-kwe mit-i-gwa-ki (queen of the woods).' "20
            
            After two years Olondaw, their son, was born; then Hazeleye, their little girl. The children grew up
                    happily, little Olondaw learning to make and handle a bow, and his sister playing with her Indian
                    doll. A white priest offered to pay the expenses if Olondaw were sent away to school. Pokagon
                    agreed, hoping that his son, now twelve years old, would become "learned, great, and good,
                    and thereby be of great service to our race." But Lonidaw was fearful of the future; and on
                    the eve of Olondaw's departure she dreamed that by the trail she found two young robins
                    which were drawn hypnotically toward a monstrous snake. As she tried to grasp a club, it struck its
                    victim; and in her dream "the snake within its jaws held fast, not the bird, but the living
                    skeleton of her son, struggling to escape."21
            
            This premonition proved tragically true, for after three years at the white man's school
                    Olondaw graduated from bottle-hunting in the back alleys of the town to an ineradicable craving for
                    the familiar firewater. Pokagon lowers the final curtain abruptly: "I do not wish to bleed
                    my own heart, or sadden yours; suffice it to say, as darkness succeeds the meteor's sudden
                    glare, so his young life went out and left us in the midnight of despair."22
            
            But this was only the first act in the tragedy. "Dear little Hazeleye alone was left us
                    then; that sweet rosebud,

                     just opening into maidenhood…." But one day
                    while Pokagon was absent and Hazeleye was fishing on the lake, two drunken white fishermen rammed
                    their boat into her bark canoe, which capsized and threw her into the water. Lonidaw, on shore,
                    screamed for help, but the drunken men made no effort to save the child. The mother plunged
                    desperately to the rescue, but almost strangling was herself pulled to safety by Zowan, the faithful
                    family dog. Lonidaw lingered briefly, partly in delirium, until one evening she said: "
                    `Pokagon, see ke-sus (the sun) is sinking low; while it is going down, I shall pass into manito
                    aukee we-de (the spirit land beyond). You have always been kind to me, yet I must bid you farewell
                    until we meet beyond tchi-be-gam-mig (the grave)….' "23 Soon a simple procession of mourning, white-blanketed Indian friends bore her body to a
                    beautiful headland overlooking the lake; white water-lilies were laid gently on her grave.24
            
            The brief remainder of the book is made up of a sincere but disjointed temperance tract, inspired by
                    the dying wish of Lonidaw that Pokagon should speak out against the source of the great triple
                    tragedy in their own family circle.
            Three short but unique publications by Pokagon also merit comment. The only other work listed on the
                    title page of Queen of the Woods is Red Man's Greeting
                    (originally—and more aptly—entitled Red Man's
                        Rebuke).
               25 This attracted some notice in the press, and a reviewer in
                    1893 commented: 
                        Printed upon white birch bark in its natural state is an account of the cruel betrayal of
                            this hunted race, dating from the advent of the white man to these shores up to the present
                            time. One reads with unutterable sadness this voicing of the outraged spirit of a race,
                            eloquent in its pathos, yet entirely free from wild vindictiveness.26
                  
                    Another critic for a newspaper in 
                        Chicago
                    , the home of the Columbian Exposition, also responded to this booklet's
                    appeal: "No words of mine can tell the pathos of this tiny book.… It is told
                    simply, and yet with a force that leaves an indelible

                    and mood may be suggested by part of Pokagon's dedication: "To the memory of
                    William Penn, Roger Williams, the late lamented Helen Hunt Jackson, and many others now in Heaven,
                    Who conceived that Noble spirit of Justice Which recognizes the Brotherhood of the Red

            Two other birchbark booklets remain as collectors' items: Pottawatamie Book of
                        Genesis—Legends of the Creation of Man,
               28 and Algonquin Legends of South Haven.
               29 The first recounts an old
                    tradition that the Great Spirit was dissatisfied with his lower animal creations and determined to
                    make man who should possess superior intelligence. Some of the Spirit Chiefs who already held
                    dominion over the earth resolved in a secret powwow to frustrate the plans of How-wan-tuck, the Almighty. The act of creation occurred by a beautiful inland lake in a
                    great wilderness: 
                        As he stood upon the shores thereof in the presence of them all, His eyes flashed waw-saw
                            mo-win (lightning)! The lake became boiling water! The earth trembled! He then spake in the
                            voice of thunder: "Come forth, ye Lords of Au-kee (the world)!" The ground
                            opened. And from out of the red clay that lined the lake came forth au-ne-ne gaie ik-we (man
                            and woman).… The bride and groom then each other fondly kissed as hand in hand
                            they stood, in naked innocence, in the full bloom of youth.… They looked all
                            about them in wonder and surprise.30
                  
                    But when the evil Spirit Chiefs saw divinity shining in the faces of the newly created
                    beings, they were stung by the wasps of jealousy and resolved to make man miserable. So ever
                    afterwards man's life has been alternately controlled by good and evil forces.
            Pokagon's retelling of Algonquin Legends of South Haven is most noteworthy
                    for an Indian version of the rainbow tale, supposedly coming to the Potawatomi from the aboriginal
                        Mash-ko-de or 
                        Prairie
                     Tribe. After Ki-ja Man-i-to (the Great Spirit) had located his throne

                     on the shore of Lake Mi-shi-gan, he planted
                    beautiful woodland flowers and filled the trees with birds.
            
                    He also made a great mit-ig-wab (bow) at least two arrow flights in length, and placed it along
                        the shore. He then painted it from end to end in beautiful lines.… While thus at work
                        a cyclone from the setting sun swept across the great lake! Waw-saw-mo-win (lightning) flashed
                        across waw-kwi (the heavens)! An-a-mi-ka (thunder) in concert with ti-gow-og (the roaring waves)
                        rolled their awful burden on the land!…
                    At length the dark clouds rolled away and the setting sun lit up the gloom. He then picked up the
                        giant bow that he had made, bent it across mi-ka-tik (his knee), then with his breath blew a
                        blast that swept it eastward between the sunshine and the clouds.…
                    As He gazed upon its beauty and grandeur arching the departing storm, He shouted in triumph above
                        the roaring waves in thunder tones, saying, "Kaw-kaw-naw in-in-i nash-ke nin wab sa
                        aw-ni-quod (All men behold my bow in the cloud.) See, it has no mit-ig bim-i-na-kwan ke-ma
                        pin-de-wan (arrow, string, or quiver). It is the bow of peace. Tell it to your
                        children's children that Ki-ja Man-i-to made it… that they might know He
                        loved peace and hated war."31
               
                
            From this perspective of Pokagon's literary contributions we might now glance briefly
                    backward at the tribal environment from which he had emerged. Of the competitive cultural forces at
                    work within him, the central drive was certainly to maintain and defend his own native values, with
                    only a collateral concern for the veneer of white literary culture.
            Simon Pokagon had succeeded his two older brothers in the tribal leadership handed down from their
                    father, Chief Leopold Pokagon. For the forty years prior to his death in 1841, Leopold had been the
                    head of the Pokagon band of the Potawatomi Indians, an offshoot of the larger Algonquin family.32 Simon, the youngest of Chief Leopold's numerous children, was born
                    in 1830 during the clan's annual migration north to their sugar-maple camps and cornfields
                    across the 
                        Michigan
                     border. Most of Simon's first eight years were spent, however, in the old
                    Pokagon village in the St. Joseph River Valley in northeastern Indiana. Here he
                    acquired his

                     32 The "Pokagon band" is sometimes referred to as
                            the 
                                St. Joseph
                             Potawatomi. At the time of their maximum development in 1820 the entire tribe
                            numbered about thirty-four hundred persons in some fifty villages in northern 
                                Illinois
                             and Indiana and southwestern

            This carefree chapter of his youth was terminated suddenly by the removal of most of the Potawatomi
                    from their tribal lands.34 A monument erected at Twin Lakes, Indiana, bears a
                    succinct inscription:

                             reported to Governor David Wallace: "It may be the opinion of those
                            not well informed upon the subject, that the expedition was uncalled for, but I feel
                            confident that nothing but the presence of an armed force, for the protection of the
                            citizens of the State, and to punish the insolence of the Indians, could have prevented
                            bloodshed.… I did not feel authorized to drive these poor degraded beings from
                            our State, but to remove them from the reserve, and to give peace and security to our own
                            citizens." Robertson and Riker,

                     later incorporated the event as one of the most moving
                    sequences of his Queen of the Woods. His immediate family had not been involved,
                    but the parents of Lonidaw, the girl he was to marry, were living at that time in
                    Menominee's village. Thus Lonidaw's mother gives her version of the story
                    concerning the arrival of the soldiers, the assembling of the Indians at the wigwam church, and the
                    immediate eviction and march toward the setting sun. Although her husband was forced to accompany
                    the migrants, she herself managed to escape northward.36
            
            Chief Leopold Pokagon was more fortunate than most. He apparently had realized the inevitability of
                    the treaty demands—which had been formalized by a Grand Council five years
                    previously—so about a year before this crisis he had migrated with his immediate clan to
                    his own property of some seven hundred acres on Long Lake, 
                        Michigan
                    , which was not included in the ceded areas.37
            
            When Simon was a youth of fourteen, some six years after this shattering of the Potawatomi patterns
                    in Indiana, he was sent by his father to the Notre Dame preparatory school in 
                        South Bend
                    . Then, according to his close friend, C. H. Engle, who later published Queen of the Woods, "returning home fired with zeal for a good English education,
                    he succeeded through his own efforts, aided by his mother, in going to Oberlin College, 
                        Ohio
                    ."38 One year's work at Oberlin, apparently with
                    private tutors or on the preparatory level,39 was followed by two more at the
                    Twinsburg Institute near 
                  Cleveland, Ohio
               , an organization which offered free

                     38 Engle's educational data, based on oral statements by
                            Pokagon, are included in his "A Brief Sketch of Chief Simon Pokagon's
                            Life," prefixed to Queen of the Woods, 5–6.
                            Instruction at the University of Notre Dame was begun in 1842; and in 1844 two charters were
                            issued, one to authorize the founding of the university and the other to establish a
                            "trade or manual labor school," which was distinct from the preparatory
                            department of the university. Pokagon presumably attended the trade school. "It is
                            even possible that Simon was sent by his father to the Notre Dame Preparatory School in 
                                South Bend
                             to perform errands, but Father Hope is almost convinced that Simon Pokagon did
                            not enroll in the school itself.… None of this can be verified by records, since
                            all records were destroyed in the great fires of the 1870's." Leo M.
                            Corbaci, administrative assistant, University of Notre Dame, to the author, March 16, 1961.
                  
                     39 Oberlin officials report: "We have searched our records
                            [under the variant spelling Pokagon, Pokegon, Pocagin, and Pugegun], but have been unable to
                            find that the Indian Simon Pokagon was ever enrolled in Oberlin
               
                     tuition, board, and lodging to the several Indians then among
                    its three hundred students. In this school "all necessary opportunities were afforded to prepare students for college."40 This phrase
                    clearly indicates the secondary level of instruction, so the assumption that Pokagon was college
                    trained is erroneous. Nevertheless, he profited from some instruction in the classics and music, for
                    a later visitor recalled that Pokagon came to his cabin door with an open Greek testament in his
                        hand.41 For several years Pokagon played the piano or reed organ in Indian
                    churches, especially that at Rush Lake, 
                        Michigan
                    , where he also translated many sermons from English into Algaic.42
            
            Pokagon's autobiographical romance, as we have seen, presents details of his life with
                    Lonidaw, daughter of Chief Sinagaw of the Rush Lake band (who had been able to rejoin his family
                    after the tribal relocation). But after the death of their two children and of Lonidaw herself at
                    the age of only thirty-five, Pokagon devoted himself to the welfare of his small tribal group and of
                    the Potawatomi as a whole. He visited Lincoln in the White House shortly after his inauguration to
                    plead the Indian cause, and again just before the President's death; and in 1874 he
                    interviewed General Grant. Finally, in 1894 Pokagon succeeded in arranging the payment of
                    $104,000 by the government to the Potawatomi in compensation for the harsh terms of the
                    original cession of their lands (at the price of about fifty cents per acre), and for various
                    annuities previously withheld.43 He also aided 
                  College." Robert R. Barr, acting secretary, Oberlin College, to the author,
                            November 4, 1959. Pokagon's own explicit statement concerning his education is
                            this: "About this time my dear father died; and, soon after, my mother, on the
                            advice of one of the Catholic Fathers, sent me to Notre Dame School, near 
                                South Bend
                            , Indiana, where I remained four or five years. But, desiring a more liberal
                            education than I was likely to get there, I sought out my old missionary friend Coles, and
                            laid before him my great anxiety to go to school at Oberlin, 
                                Ohio
                            , where race and color were disregarded. The good man finally persuaded my
                            mother to send me to that school." Pokagon, "Indian Superstitions and

                            "Our band received several annuities from the Government prior to 1860, at which
                            time we received thirty-nine thousand dollars, partial payment of moneys due.…
                            Last autumn we received the final payment of one hundred and fifty thousand

                        Kansas
                    , where his own children by a second marriage and his grandchildren were sent. He
                    likewise encouraged the production and sale of local Indian craft materials.44
            
            In an address delivered, appropriately enough, to a lodge meeting of the Order of Red Men the year
                    before he died, Pokagon reviewed his long career: 
                        I have stood all my life as a peacemaker between the white people and my own people. Without
                            gun or bow I have stood between the two contending armies, receiving a thousand wounds from
                            your people and my own. I have continued to pray the great father at 
                                Washington
                             to deal justly… and have said to my own people, when they were
                            bitterly wronged, and felt mortally offended, "Wait and pray for justice; the
                            war-path will but lead you to the grave."45
                  
                    
            
            A 
                        Chicago
                     paper in an obituary notice touched a eulogistic note: 
                        The poet chief managed with consummate ability and skill the often conflicting and delicate
                            interests and affairs of the band of three hundred Pottawattamie Indians scattered over the
                            State of 
                                Michigan
                            . Gifted with a fine education, and inspired by enlightened views, he was an
                            instrument of far-reaching good to all his people.46
                  
                    
            
            Chief Simon Pokagon lived simply and died simply, as a brief letter from his only surviving son to

                        My father's last work "Queen of the Woods" is now ready
                                    for delivery. My father left but little means outside of the prospective value of
                                    his literary work. I therefore thought you might get a few copies for your library.

            So it seems fitting that Pokagon State Park should bear his name, and that on
                    the timbers of the great hall in the Potawatomi Inn should be engraved the legend:
                    "O-Gi-Maw-Kwe Mit-I-Gwa-Ki Queen of the Woods," to remind us of a past which is
                    now beyond recall.

            The flow of immigrants into the West had quickened during the beginning of the second decade of the
                    nineteenth century, and not even continued Indian troubles and the War of 1812 could do more than
                    slow it somewhat. With the coming of peace, the westward movement became a veritable flood, and in
                    the five years from 1816 to 1821 five new western states were added to the Union. The author of the
                    letter reproduced here apparently did not wait for news of the end of the War of 1812, which came
                    early in 1815, to begin his journey to 
                        Vincennes
                    , Indiana.1

                     region. He probably was an Easterner—perhaps from 
                        Connecticut
                    —who had been acquainted with Oliver Wolcott and who stopped in the 
                        New York
                     vicinity to see this former resident of 
                        Connecticut
                    . Townes probably went up the Hudson Valley, west through the
                        Mohawk Valley to see one of the Wolcott relatives, and then, by the route
                    he describes, across Lake Erie, overland to 
                        Waterford
                    , and down French Creek past present Meadville, 
                        Franklin
                    , and Kittanning to 
                        Pittsburgh
                    . After a stay of several days and a side trip at 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , he proceeded via the Ohio River to 
                        Louisville
                    , and then went overland, perhaps by the Buffalo Trace, to 
                        Vincennes
                    . Many before, and more afterwards, traveled the same route.
            Townes' letter addressed to Oliver Wolcott and George Gibbs2 was mailed
                    to Wolcott in 
                        New York
                     City. It indicates that Townes was an intelligent person, that he was very probably a
                    person with some resources, that his "plans"

                            George Gibbs, 1776–1833, mineralogist and horticulturist, loaned his famous
                                mineral collection to Yale for many years and then sold it to that university in 1825.
                                The courtesy "Colonel," owner of the

                     involved more than "grubbing" a mere
                    subsistence from the soil, and that he might have made a fine promoter of the West. He certainly was
                    a booster: the fish were almost incredibly large, wheat production fantastically high, fertile land
                    everywhere in abundance, and the West an "inconceivably important
                    section." It should be remembered that in 1815 there were many—especially
                    in the East—who still thought of the West as an area that would remain in permanent
                    subordination to the older sections of the county and felt that the 
                        Mississippi
                     was an appropriate western boundary of the

                                             a little below the present town of Geneseo. He raised corn,
                                            produced and manufactured hemp, kept herds of cattle, bred mules, and

                                            largest landowners of cultivated areas, he was interested in political

                                    visit— Imagine to yourselves one of the most extensive and well conducted

                                    necessary for the prosecution of my plans and the most confirming proofs of the

                                    through this country was highly interesting—as was that up Lake Erie,
                                    which was effected in a castel schooner of 100 tons burthen to Presque isle;3 from this I went over a turnpike road of 15 miles to

                                    the Waters of the Lake and those of the southern Country—after this I
                                    found them all the way down to the falls of

                        I took my passage [from 
                                        Waterford
                                    ] in an ark or flatt boat covered in on all sides and at top about 30
                                    feet long & 15 broad—loaded with peltry & furs from
                                        Mackinaw6—this mode of travelling was quite new
                                    to me—passing through le bauf—and french creek, our passage
                                    was very narrow and much obstructed by trees & brush—but our
                                    Company composed of one young lady of very respectable deportment under care of two
                                    gentlemen—six sailors from Com⋆⋆⋆r Perrys7 ship and three soldiers; making
                                    the best of our situation and means, we had a tolerable agreeable passage &

                                        Pittsburgh
                                     in good condition and ready for the change—
                        The thriving state of this place is too well known to require description but no one
                                    can imagine how excessively disagreeable the numerous columns of smoak issuing from
                                    the furnaces—glass works—and other manufacturies as well as
                                    from every chimney in the place make it to those who are not accustomed to Coal
                                    fires— After visiting the Harmony settlement under George Rapp at
                                        Beaver,8 and staying about a week at this place, I left Pitt
                                    in a Keel—a long boat much resembling the inland boats of the delaware,
                                    except that they have the addition of a board covering—much resembling a

                                            the strategic points in the Old Northwest. The French fort on the south side
                                            of the strait between Lake Huron and Lake 
                                                Michigan
                                             was constructed in 1712 and surrendered in 1761 to the British,
                                            who held it for thirteen years after the Treaty of 
                                                Paris
                                             of 1783. This fort fell to the British in 1812 but, along with
                                            the island of the same name, was restored to the 
                                                United States
                                             in July, 1815.

                                            on September 10, 1813. His promotion to captain was back-dated to that day.

                                            the spring of 1815, soon after Townes had visited it, the colony was moved

                                            third Rappite settlement was made, in 1825, at Economy, Pa., about eighteen

                                    through the Country— Marietta is a decent place; but being liable to the
                                    annual overflowing of the

                                    to expect.
                        Here I first saw those unaccountable Monuments of Antiquity—the
                                    Mounds—Walls—elevated plains—squares—
                                    circles—parralels &c.— We arrived at

                                    —a place that will unquestionably become a very important
                                    place of trade and manufactures—having every facility added to one of the
                                    most interesting Countries for agriculture and the Arts, perhaps in the
                                    world—here also are other specimens of those Monuments of
                                    antiquity— But the most extraordinary that I have met with are at the
                                    Mouth of the Miami, about 15 miles below, on the ground of Gen⋆⋆⋆1 Harrison,9 near
                                    his residence at North bend—on the high ground between that river

                                        Ohio
                                    —are erected a regular Work and Mound—covering 16
                                    acres—the ridge is about 200 feet high and about 600 feet wide, but comes
                                    to a point of about 100: on the extre[me] point is a Mound; the base supported by a
                                    Wall of Stones of about 2 feet wide of lime stone, evidently obtained from the
                                    vicinity laid together very neatly but without Cement or the appearance of a hammer
                                    on any of the stones—which are generally of from 2 to 4 inches thick and
                                    from one to 2 feet wide[—] the form of the inclosure is nearly like the
                                    sketch on this paper; with two regular bastions on the North end: the whole
                                    supported by a stone wall as before described, within and without—the
                                    earthen wall is 30 feet at the base about 14 feet high from the bottom of the stone
                                    wall; 6 feet on the top and communicating with the mound at the point as follows10
                        
                        What all these Monuments could ever have been constructed for I am utterly at a loss
                                    to imagine—this certainly gives the idea of a regular
                                    fortification—but the mounds which are numerous over this western Country
                                    I am totally at a loss to find the motive—

                                            261–263, 266–267. There were several types of mounds:
                                            sacrifice, temple, burial, defense, signal or observation, and effigy or

                                    others measured by pacing the circumference of several; two of which were, to the
                                    best of our judgment, 300 yards round—11 Thus we have
                                    satisfactory evidence of this Country having experienced three different states of
                                    occupancy— First, By the Marine World: second, by a numerous population
                                    of the human family— But whether they were ever advanced to that state of
                                    society we designate by the term `Cultivated," I am, I confess, at a loss
                                    to decide— I have seen instances of neat pottery, a considerable quantity
                                    of which has been discovered in & near some Mounds near Saline on the

                                     near its mouth; but nothing that I can learn that gives us reason to
                                    believe that they have ever possessed the Arts or Sciences in the perfection we have
                                    known them to be in our history. But unquestionably this part of the World has
                                    sustained a very large population— but what has carried them off so

                                 12 The Indian Chute was the northernmost and principal
                                            of three channels used by boats in descending the falls. This chute, as well

                                            water was high, the rocky spires in the Indian Chute were hidden, thus
                                            making passage more dangerous than ever. It was, then, usable with
                                            comparative safety only when the river was at the middle stages. H.

                                    company with an officer of the Rangers,14 and immediately
                                    entered the Wilderness, not meeting with but three houses—and but a few

                                    along pretty well; experiencing but few privations more than we expected, therefore
                                    we did not find much fault— The first & second days travel about
                                    60 miles was through Beach Wood &c—the number or rather quantity
                                    of Pidgeons were beyond all credibility—a place, called emphatically, the

                                    from the severity of the Northern Winters, cannot be described—nor obtain

                                    totally stripped of their limbs—many of the trees of a foot diameter
                                    actually broken down to the ground by the the [sic] numbers and
                                    weight of the Pigeons—the destruction of timber is inconceivable; and it
                                    is very extraordinary that they every winter retire here and
                                    vicinity—making a havock in the timber that cannot be credited and
                                    covering the ground with their droppings from 12 to 18 inches deep. They drive off
                                    in immense flocks through the Beach Woods for an immense extent and sweep up all the

                                     the native vegetation yields to every thing that is introduced— although for Miles you cannot

                                    on—every view of the country & circumstances confirm the opinions
                                    I held whilst with you—the Soil and Climate so far as I have seen is in a
                                    Word delightful [—] I never passed so beautiful a winter any

                                    are not sensible to anything you can call Cold—but a

                                    for this great, this important blessing— I had intended saying something
                                    of the Indians—they have been troublesome29—they are weak—they are pitiable if not contemptable

                                             area in 1815. Among them were the Kickapoo, Piankashaw, and
                                            Ouiatanon; among those farther north of

                                             were the

                                             in April, 1815. On numerous occasions from early March to the
                                            middle of May, 1815, deaths and captures were reported both south and north

                                            "outlaw" bands of Indians. By March 25, 1815, the Rangers
                                            were in pursuit of the Indians to the south of

            The development of historical writing in the 
                        United States
                     has long needed a new interpreter—an individual who could see and comprehend
                    the various and divergent attempts made by Americans to bring meaning to their heritage. The
                    historiographer's task has not been easy, for both Old World traditions and New World
                    novelties have influenced him. In addition, he frequently was caught between the forces of
                    parochialism and nationalism. And his point of view altered as the country changed. The product from
                    the pen of the trained historian differed, both in philosophy and in method, from that of the
                    annalist, the antiquarian, the chauvinistic chronicler. Yet the fabric of written history is woven
                    from all these strange strands and multicolored threads.
            Mr. Van Tassel seeks to pick away each of the braids, to hold them to the light of scrutiny, to
                    explain the origin and the impact of the inkles of popular history, documania, local narrative, and
                    national history. His contribution starts with three chapters devoted to the colonial origins of
                    local history (1607–1776), in which is stressed the fact that "the first impetus
                    to historical writing in colonial America came of the desire to promote settlement and investment in
                    particular colonies, to defend or explain colonial administration, and to answer the demand for
                    information about the new world" (p. 9). Then follow five chapters which set forth the
                    roots of national historical writing, discuss the new role of local history, trace the rise of
                    societies, treat of the creation of national heroes, and examine efforts to promote a Republican
                    view of national history.
            The struggle between nationalism and localism began with the close of the War of 1812 and terminated
                    in 1850. In presenting this theme, the author, in addition to describing a growing appetite for the
                    "materials of history," weighs the labors of the romantic nationalists such as
                    Bancroft, Irving, and Parkman. He assesses the work of local historians imbued with the critical
                    spirit, including individuals such as John Gilmary Shea. A final section, in five chapters,
                    demonstrates the effect of the Civil War upon historical writing, the place that local history
                    played during the war years, considers the "reunion" of the national past,
                    emphasizes the culmination of the critical spirit, and terminates with the year 1884 and with what
                    the author conceives to be the triumph of national history.
            "Thus in the waning days of the old year [1884]," writes Mr. Van Tassel,
                    "as Grover 
                        Cleveland
                     and the victorious Democrats made preparations to assume control of the new national
                    state, the professional historians prepared to assume the task of recording America's past.
                    The long age of the amateur historian had ended." There is, no  doubt, more than a sliver of substance in this hallelujah. Yet one
                    wonders if, indeed, the day of the amateur historian had come to a close and if "local
                    historians henceforth would defer to the professional" (p. 179).
            All in all, Recording America's Past is marked by careful research, balanced judgment, and
                    sound interpretation. No doubt not all historians would agree with all the conclusions, but this is
                    only natural, and many controversial questions hang on the delicate scale of semantics. One could
                    wish that the bibliography had included at least a few references to the inception and maturing of
                    foreign historical societies and scholarly associations, for it is surprising, as the author makes
                    apparent, how organizations in the 
                        United States
                     leaned upon across-the-Atlantic counterparts. Such titles as Joan Evans, A
                        History of the Society of Antiquaries, or the volume edited by Levi Fox, English Historical Scholarship in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, might have
                    provided stimulating background. But Mr. Van Tassel makes perfectly clear that his bibliography is
                    selective. The Appendix, a list of historical societies arranged chronologically according to date
                    of founding, provides a handy and valuable check list. Professional historians, graduate students,
                    and innumerable amateur historians should, indeed, be grateful for this handbook.

            Historians are constantly applying the correctives of fact and logic to the romanticism, dubious
                    legends, and downright hoaxes which clutter the annals of all countries, including 
                        Canada
                     and the 
                        United States
                    . In this tradition, Father Steck's work, a summary of his earlier and
                    voluminous writings, exposes what he considers to be the exaggerations and fabrications in the
                    accepted accounts of the career of Jacques Marquette.
            The author's major points are his contentions that Marquette probably did not accompany
                    Jolliet on the famous exploration of the 
                        Mississippi
                     in 1673 and was not the founder of the famous 
                        Kaskaskia
                     Mission. He was, rather, a humble missionary whose undistinguished career was falsely
                    inflated into importance by his superior and others to advance the interests of the Jesuits in their
                    struggle with the State for power in the West.
            Father Steck employs various evidence to establish his theses. Negatively, he points out that
                    Marquette was never officially appointed to accompany Jolliet, nor does the latter mention him in
                    the records of the expedition, surely a peculiar omission. Father Steck also seeks to establish, by
                    a critical examination of many documents, that the accounts  of
                    the exploration which do mention Marquette, or are attributed to his pen, are frauds which were
                    written or "edited" by the superior general of the Jesuit missions in 
                        Canada
                    .
            This book is a well-written and fascinating example of historical detective work through analysis and
                    criticism of documents. Several reservations must be noted, however. Because much of his argument
                    rests upon negative evidence and rationalization, it is nearly impossible for the author completely
                    to prove his central points. Father Steck, therefore, exceeds the bounds of scholarly caution when
                    he occasionally states that certain conclusions are "firmly established" or
                    inescapable. Also, he has neglected some secondary works which would help to establish his
                    contentions, notably Grace L. Nute's Caesars of the Wilderness.
            
            Otherwise, Father Steck has done a good job. His evidence is well-handled and his reasoning and
                    verdicts are generally persuasive. Henceforth, historians of seventeenth-century North America must
                    ponder his measured conclusion that "Marquette's participation in the 1673
                    expedition [is] at least seriously doubtful if not improbable" (p. 114).
            Christopher Lloyd's The Capture of Quebec is a volume in the British Battles Series of popular accounts of the causes, course, and results of
                    significant conflicts. Since Francis Parkman wrote the classic account of the siege of Quebec in his
                        Montcalm and Wolfe (1884), the story has been frequently retold without
                    essential change. Lloyd's volume follows the stereotyped presentation from the fall of
                    Louisburg and the expedition up the St. Lawrence through the futile Montmorency attack to the
                    perilous ascent from the Anse de Foulon and the climactic battle on the Plains of Abraham. Thus this
                    volume again parades the tired facts and sequence but, remarkably, imparts freshness by new patterns
                    of emphasis. For example, Lloyd stresses the often-neglected role of the navy, and occasionally dims
                    the spotlight on Wolfe and Montcalm by turning it upon the soldier in the ranks and upon such
                    secondary leaders as the brilliant French aide, Count de Bougainville.
            This volume is a generally accurate and very readable account. Professional historians may lament the
                    absence of footnotes and a complete bibliography and the neglect of some recent Canadian
                    scholarship, but the book was not written for professional historians. It is intended to be a
                    popular history and succeeds in being a good one. The publishers also deserve praise for a
                    technically excellent product.

            This is the second volume of the memoirs of a leader of the Swedish migration to 
                        Wisconsin
                     and 
                        Illinois
                     in the 1840's. Published first in Sweden in 1861 and 1862, Unonius'
                    work encouraged the continuing  emigration of his countrymen to
                    America. In the first volume the author told of the migration and pioneer experiences in the new
                    country, while this volume is mainly concerned with his own career as a priest of the Protestant
                    Episcopal Church of the 
                        United States
                    . When the Swedes came here, few of the ministers of the State church of Sweden came
                    with them, and their settlements were without spiritual leadership. If churches were established,
                    they were affiliated with the Norwegian Luthern church, or the Methodist, or Baptist. To Unonius,
                    however, the church most compatible to his own beliefs was the Episcopal church, represented in 
                        Wisconsin
                     by dedicated young missionary priests, and he decided he would prepare himself for
                    ministering to his own people.
            It was at great personal sacrifice of both money and fatherly care for his family that he attended
                    the newly founded Episcopal mission and seminary at Nashotah, where he was welcomed and encouraged
                    in his determination to study for holy orders. He had been influenced initially to take this step by
                    the founder of Nashotah House, James Lloyd Breck, and by Bishop Jackson Kemper, the indefatigable
                    director of the church's activities in the West.
            After finishing his work at Nashotah, the Rev. Mr. Unonius worked for some time among the Swedish
                    settlements in 
                        Wisconsin
                    , and finally accepted a call to 
                        Chicago
                     where he established St. Ansgarius Church in the Scandinavian neighborhood. To secure
                    funds he made an extended and successful money-raising trip to 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , where he also won the sympathy of Jenny Lind, who contributed generously to St.
                    Ansgarius. Finally, deciding that his work in America was done, he returned to Sweden.
            This is a bare-bones sketch of the "plot" of Unonius' story. The book is
                    not a collection of raw source material, but a well-integrated narrative of one man's
                    experiences, written from his own diaries and letters and other documentary material, supplemented
                    occasionally from other sources. It is not simply personal recollection from an unaided memory.
            For the general reader, as well as the social historian, there is much material on the adjustment of
                    the uprooted Swedes to conditions in a new environment; and there is particular emphasis on the
                    extremely difficult situation in 
                        Chicago
                    , where a people with a rural background had to fit into an urban environment. There are
                    also interesting chapters, not completely from first-hand knowledge, about the Swedish community at
                    Bishop's Hill in 
                        Illinois
                     and about the eighteenth-century Swedish settlement in 
                        Philadelphia
                    .
            But the paramount importance of the book is its contribution to the history of churches and religion
                    in America. There is new light on the Episcopal church on the middle western frontier; on Kemper,
                    Breck, and William Adams (associated with Breck at Nashotah House); on life at the seminary; and on
                    the controversy in the church between the Evangelicals and the Anglo-Catholics. Unonius, as would be
                    expected from a disciple of Kemper and Breck, was of the Anglo-Catholic faction. There is also much
                    information on the rivalry between the Norwegian and Swedish Lutherans, and between both and
                    Unonius' Episcopal congregations. The book is competently edited, and all persons mentioned
                    are identified.
            
            And, finally, the book is an unconscious character study of a man of God, continually wrestling with
                    his human nature, a man who had to be eternally reminding himself of his Christian obligation to be
                    charitable and loving. Although Unonius never satisfied himself, the reader knows that a lesser man
                    would have thrown in the sponge and retired from the ring if his head had been bloodied as often as
                    was that of Unonius.

               The Leopard's Spots: Scientific Attitudes Toward Race in America,
                        1815–59. By William Stanton. (

                    : University of 
                        Chicago
                     Press, 1960. Pp. ix, 244. Notes, index. $4.00.)
            While scientists work in the seclusion of the laboratory, their theories often influence history on a
                    grand scale. The discoveries of Copernicus, Newton, and Darwin shattered old beliefs and excited
                    debate in fields far removed from science. In The Leopard's Spots,
                    William Stanton revives a debate of less renown and brings to life a group of scientists known as
                    the "American School" of anthropology. This book tells the story of their theories
                    about the origin of the human species and the conflict aroused by their ideas. Impressed by the
                    differences between Indian, Negro, and White, these men concluded that each race represented a
                    separate and distinct species. The members of the American School reached this conclusion by
                    diffrent paths. Study of his large collection of human skulls convinced Samuel G. Morton, while the
                    census of 1840 and the need for a scientific defense of slavery converted Dr. Josiah Nott. Work amid
                    the pyramids of 
                        Egypt
                     persuaded George R. Gliddon of the plurality of the races, while study of the Indian
                    mounds of the Midwest led Ephraim G. Squier to this view. The mere sight of a Negro led Louis
                    Agassiz, the most famous member of the school, to conclude that the White and Negro constituted
                    separate species. Like every band of enthusiasts, this group had its charlatan and its special
                    pleader. The quackery of Gliddon contrasted with the research of Morton and the partisanship of Nott
                    with the integrity of Agassiz. All and all, they area colorful lot, vividly described by the author.
            Stanton concentrates on the impact of the American School's findings on American life,
                    without slighting either the personalities or ideas of its adherents. The eighteenth-century belief
                    in the unity of the species and the equality of man rested on the authority of science, scriptures,
                    and the writers of the Enlightenment. According to Genesis, God created man in a single act, and
                    scientists explained race pecularities as a result of climate and custom. Where the old science
                    found equality and therefore natural liberty, the new science found inequality and the
                    appropriateness of slavery. The pluralist theories of the American School excited more than a
                    scientific debate; it revived the ancient quarrel of science and religion and threatened to become
                    an issue in the slavery controversy. These theories held profound implications for a nation which
                    took its Bible seriously and was already quarreling over the validity of Negro slavery.
            
            In describing the scientific debate which resulted, the author gives the impression that all reason
                    and research were on the side of the pluralists and that their victory was complete. This
                    interpretation overlooks the fact that the pluralists' opponents included several noted
                    scientists as well as theologians who were far from defeated. The author also offers some
                    interesting explanations for the failure of the South to adopt the pluralistic theory as a defense
                    for slavery. He concludes, that with the exception of Nott, the members of the American School were
                    more anticlerical than proslavery. Stanton also argues that, faced with the dilemma of accepting
                    either the pluralist theory of the origin of the species or the scriptural account of Genesis,
                    southerners clung to the Bible and rejected the theory. While this conclusion seems correct, he
                    fails to present documentary evidence to substantiate his interpretation. All in all,

               Emotion at High Tide: Abolition as a Controversial Factor, 1830–1845.
                    By Henry H. Simms. (
                        Baltimore
                    , Md.: Moore & Co., Inc., 1960. Pp. vi, 243. Index. $5.00.)
            In his Emotion at High Tide Professor Simms, of 
                        Ohio
                     State University, says that his work "covers, with greater thoroughness, more
                    facets of the abolition question than any book on the period under consideration" (p. v).
                    The book deals with such matters as reactions in the North and South to antislavery propaganda, the
                    differences between the abolitionists and the colonizationists, and the differences within the
                    antislavery ranks between Garrisonians and anti-Garrisonians. There are also chapters which relate
                    the antislavery movement, especially the petition controversy, to the politics of the period and
                    which show how politicians prevented the major parties from becoming embroiled in the slavery
                    controversy in the elections of 1836 and 1840. Finally the author deals with the role of the
                    anti-slavery forces in the fight over the annexation of 
                        Texas
                     and with the relationship of the antislavery movement to certain aspects of
                    Anglo-American relationships.
            There is no bibliography, but there are numerous footnotes which show that Professor Simms has made
                    extensive use of antislavery literature, the publications of the American Colonization Society, the
                        Congressional Globe, the published correspondence of Birney, Weld, Tappan, and
                    the leading political figures of the period, as well as contemporary newspapers.
            
               Emotion at High Tide covers the same period as Barnes's Anti-slavery Impulse and deals with many of the same subjects. It presents details not
                    found in the earlier work, but in the opinion of this reviewer it adds little of significance to the
                    contribution made by Barnes and  others who have written on the
                    antislavery movement. In spite of its title the book does not recapture the emotional climate of the
                    period, nor does the author attempt to analyze the reasons for the intense emotions which
                    abolitionism evoked.

            This crisply and well-written little volume will not replace the more detailed histories of the
                    Confederacy, but it will rank high in the literature of that ill-fated experiment. In carefully
                    machined sentences Roland has told a clearer and more balanced story than many authors who have used
                    several times as many pages.
            The major shortcomings of the book appear to result from the limited wordage allotted to the volumes
                    in this series and are most noticeable in the first two chapters. Flashing back from the 
                        South Carolina
                     secession convention to explain the background of departure from the Union and of the
                    birth of the Confederacy, the author seems forced into certain oversimplifications and
                    generalizations that produce some distortion. His offense here, however, is not great. On the other
                    hand, it is difficult to see why one-eighth of the work should be devoted to King Cotton diplomacy.
            The desirable and undesirable characteristics and traits of the military and civilian leaders are
                    analyzed, and the strengths and weaknesses of the policies of the central government are
                    thoughtfully assessed. Occasionally, the possible results of a different course of action are
                    explored. The states' opposition to the central government on numerous issues is
                    objectively depicted, but this centrifugence is considered only one of many factors in the fall of
                    the Confederacy. (One often wonders why this opposition in the South has been viewed as a legitimate
                    and more or less expected manifestation of states' rights, while in the North comparable
                    objection to the actions of the central government has been considered copperheadism or near
                    treason.) In evaluating the causes of the Confederacy's defeat, Roland seems to subscribe
                    to the Ramsdell idea that the handling of financial problems was the weakest link in the Confederate
                    chain—but not the only weak link. Certainly, disastrous inflation seriously affected the
                        esprit de corps, and the cresting and troughing of civilian and military
                    morale is nicely related to financial and military success and failure.
            Nor would this author single out failure of leadership as being responsible for defeat: in many
                    instances the leaders performed admirably; at other times they made serious errors. The omission of
                    those errors would not have insured victory, but "failure to avoid them made defeat
                    certain" (p. 91). Roland's final conclusion on this matter is that the South
                    "could triumph only by exercising over the North 
                    sufficiently greater unity, skill, and will to compensate for the inadequacy of resources. In this
                    she failed" (p. 193). Is not the amazing thing that the will to resist was sustained as
                    long as it was?
            This interesting narrative, concerned basically with broad movements, problems, and explanations,
                    probably contains too little of the horror of the great American struggle, but it is a fine
                    recounting of the tragic splendor of those four years.

            Somehow, the fact of Northern superiority in population, resources, and control of the seas has been
                    contrasted with a myth of Union inferiority in tactics, leadership, and conduct on the
                    battlefield—a myth now being fed a daily diet by television where it seems the Yankees
                    never are able to win a battle, and most of them are scoundrels facing southern knights anyway.
                    Books such as the two under review go a long way to dispel that myth, for here are recorded great
                    deeds on the battlefield by the men in blue.
            One volume is a story of a unit, told with all the detail which one finds in the unit histories of
                    World War II, for example, but with considerably greater attention to documentation and verification
                    than one usually finds in most recent accounts. The other is an account of a campaign, told in a way
                    which captures the atmosphere of battle and its intense drama. Both will be welcomed by all students
                    of the Civil War.
            As a practicing lawyer in 
                        Indianapolis
                     who is a graduate of Indiana University (1944) and 
                        Harvard
                     Law School (1947), Alan T. Nolan, author of The Iron Brigade, would
                    be listed as an "amateur" historian, but he has been a lifelong student of the
                    Civil War, and he writes like a professional. He is a founder and past preseident of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Civil War Roundtable.
            Initially composed of the Nineteenth Indiana Volunteers and the Second, Sixth, and Seventh 
                        Wisconsin
                     Volunteers, and joined after 
                        Antietam
                     by the Twenty-fourth 
                        Michigan
                    , what came to be known as the Iron Brigade was formed on October 1, 1861, in 
                        Washington
                     as the only completely western brigade in the Army of the Potomac. Its first commander
                    was Rufus King, but it was the creation of John Gibbon, who outfitted it in its regular army grab of
                    hard black hats, frock coats, and white leggings and made of it a hard-fighting team.
            This brigade from the Old Northwest even in its first engagement at Brawner Farm, though struck by
                    surprise in the flank as it marched down the road, turned and fought and more than held its own
                    against  three times its number in spite of 33 per cent
                    casualties. At Second Bull Run it stood its ground against Stonewall Jackson's men. At
                    South Mountain, on the route to 
                        Antietam
                    , it fought so well, again in spite of heavy losses, that Hooker, in talking with
                    McClellan, referred to it as his "iron brigade." Then came the great battle at 
                        Antietam
                     where the Iron Brigade fought back and forth across the cornfield, and in one morning
                    343 of its 800 officers and men were killed and wounded.
            At 
                        Fredericksburg
                     the Iron Brigade escaped the heavy action. Then came the hurried march to 
                        Pennsylvania
                     to meet another Confederate invasion of the North. In this case the Iron Brigade was a
                    part of the engagement which turned into the furious first day of the Battle of 
                        Gettysburg
                    , and on this day it suffered 65 per cent casualties—the greatest for any
                    brigade in the whole three days of battle, but it had not taken a single step backward except on
                    orders.
            With assignment of the Hundred Sixty-seventh 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , the Iron Brigade lost its distinctive character shortly after 
                        Gettysburg
                    , and here the main story ends—the story of the brigade which suffered the
                    greatest percentage of casualties of any brigade in all the federal armies.
            For each episode, the author carefully describes the ground, provides the tactical setting, locates
                    all the relevant units. The casual reader may find the tracing of units sometimes annoying, but this
                    detail will be useful to the student. Nonetheless, the device used in the army's World War
                    II histories, which was to print all designations of enemy units in italics, might have been helpful
                    in this volume. Appendices trace the formation of regiments comprising the brigade and give
                    biographical data on the commanders.
            
               Storming of the Gateway is a well-written account of the 
                        Chattanooga
                     campaign by the author of Guns at 
                            Gettysburg
                        
                and Clash of Cavalry, as well as of a number of other works.
                    While The Iron Brigade is a story of western men in eastern battles, this is a
                    story which includes the transfer of a corps from the Army of the Potomac (and on the Confederate
                    side the transfer of Longstreet's corps from the Army of Northern 
                        Virginia
                    ), and so is in part a story of eastern men in western battles.
            Colonel Downey too is careful to describe the ground; he provides the dramatis personae, gives the
                    general strategic and logistical situation, and in one of the most valuable parts of the book,
                    describes the firearms used. He opens the scene in this way: 
                        Clouds hovered over Lookout Mountain in waning November of the year 1863. The glory of its
                            fall foliage had faded, but a hint of haze hanging in the air silvered the forests that
                            clothed it—oak and pine, sourwood and dogwood and black gum, hickory and tulip
                            trees. When that haze thickened into mists and fog, the clouds appeared to have descended to
                            robe all the mountainsides in white.
                        Massive, precipitous, the mountain seemed the boundary wall of the world to one who scanned
                            it, and in actuality for the space of those autumn days it was the border of a nation
                            divided. On it and around it were entrenched and encamped 150,000 men under arms, determined
                            to hold or to break over that mighty barrier. (p. 3)
                        Once more the mountains filled their varied roles in this campaign they dominated. As before,
                            they were barriers and natural ramparts.  Their wooded
                            sides were mighty screens until their peaks were gained. And now the gaps, which pierced
                            them and made them passable for marching armies, provided a new potential. They became
                            entrances to a trap. (p. 75)
                    
            
            Here is the story of Chickamauga, the siege of 
                        Chattanooga
                     and the opening of the "Cracker Line," the "Battle above the
                    Clouds," the incredible "charge of the mule brigade" the great, dramatic
                    battle of Missionary Ridge, climaxed by the unordered charge up the steep slopes—all in
                    full color.
            Again full appendices give further information: in this case, the steps for loading the rifle, the
                    service of the artillery piece, the order of battle for both sides, a list of all commanders that
                    includes regimental commanders, a roll of honor citations and comments, a collection of poems and
                    songs inspired by the campaign, and a catalog of the artillery now found in the Chickamauga-
                        Chattanooga
                     National Military Park.
            So long as the quality of these two volumes is maintained, the great flood of Civil War literature
                    now coming is to be welcomed.

                        Hancock
                     has been neglected." It has further been stated by the author that while
                    working on the material for his book, High Tide at 
                            Gettysburg
                        , he became so impressed with "
                        Hancock
                    's outstanding generalship on each of the three days of the battle at 
                        Gettysburg
                    " that he decided to make 
                        Hancock
                     the subject of his next book.
            It is apparent that this book is written with the express purpose of elevating 
                        Hancock
                     from the ranks of the "neglected" into the ranks of the
                    "superb." The author has amassed much evidence and presents it in a manner
                    calculated to convince the reader that 
                        Hancock
                     has been neglected too long.
            This book does not have the neat transitions or the polished style of High Tide at 
                            Gettysburg
                        . In some respects it gives the impression that it was hurried either in the
                    writing or in the publication and that  a little more care on
                    the part of the author or the publisher would have maintained the high standards established by Tucker's High Tide at 
                            Gettysburg
                        .
            
            Although the author seems to be straining to convince the reader that 
                        Hancock
                     deserves more attention than historians have been prone to give him, he does make a
                    plausible case. While the book has its weaknesses, it achieves the author's purpose of
                    elevating 
                        Hancock
                    . This book should be read by Civil War historians—particularly those who
                    have an interest in 
                        Gettysburg
                    .
            The editor of Advance and Retreat has done an excellent job of explaining the
                    shortcomings of the original narrative by Lieutenant General J. B. Hood of the Confederate army. The
                    book is not an objective narrative nor an accurate history, but was written originally as an answer
                    to some accusations which had been aimed at Hood. It is essentially an elaboration of the angry
                    report Hood turned in shortly after he resigned from the army.
            As a general, Hood does not rate among the "superb." At first glance, the reader
                    might wonder why the Indiana University Press has reprinted an account which even the editor of the
                    book admits has serious shortcomings. Hood's Advance and Retreat
                    illustrates, however, the internal problems of the Confederate army and provides additional
                    information about the fighting around 
                        Atlanta
                     and the 
                        Tennessee
                     campaign. Probably its greatest value is that it gives Hood's reply to his
                    critics and throws some light on his actions during and after the Civil War. The book must be read,
                    however, with a clear understanding that it is Hood's defense against criticisms aimed at
                    him by his enemies. If the reader uses this approach, he will find the volume useful.
            The Wearing of the Gray is a reprint of a book originally published in 1867. In the
                    editor's Introduction, an interesting account of John Esten Cooke's life is given
                    along with the observation that Cooke would have been relatively unimportant as a writer had it not
                    been for these eyewitness sketches written during and after the Civil War.
            Certainly the best parts of the book are those describing camp life and everyday incidents. Cooke
                    writes in a vivid journalistic style. While the writing is colored by his personal feelings and
                    attitudes, his report of Confederate military life is excellent. The reader should understand that
                    the book is best from the standpoints of local color and personal interest. Its statements about the
                    numbers of troops involved in battles should be compared with other sources which are perhaps more
                    accurate in their statistics than Cooke.
            The Wearing of the Gray is a book which will appeal to young students of history as
                    well as to Civil War buffs. It is certainly one of the best sources for a personal report on the
                    lives of some of the most famous Confederate generals. Particularly interesting are the accounts of
                    General Stuart and his escapades, which are graphically discussed in this book. It is a volume which
                    all Civil War readers will want on their book shelves.

            Americans seem strangely reluctant to study the history of their northern neighbor, for the bulk of
                    writing on this subject is still done by Canadians. But American scholars slowly are becoming aware
                    of research possibilities north of the border; and in these years of the Civil War centennial, it is
                    inevitable that at least one aspect of Canadian-American affairs will undergo careful scrutiny. This
                    work by Robin Winks is an extensive study of 
                        Canada
                    's relations with the 
                        United States
                     during the tension-filled Civil War years.
            By utilizing unexploited sources—especially consular correspondence—the author
                    has arrived at some unconventional conclusions that will force modification of many time-honored
                    cliches, including the traditional picture of a "century of peace" along the
                    border. From 1861 to 1865 the two countries were not good neighbors, and relations were marred by
                    several ugly incidents. Winks lights up the triangle of Anglo-American-Canadian affairs and the
                    effect of Confederate diplomacy on them. He explores Canadian enlistment in the Union army and
                    demolishes another historical myth; according to him the number was fewer than commonly supposed. He
                    also examines the attitude of the Canadian press toward the war, gives full details on the Chesapeake and St. Albans affairs, and shows the ineptness of Confederate efforts
                    to embroil 
                        England
                     in war with the North through Canadian-based raids on Union territory.
            This volume grew out of the author's doctoral study at Johns Hopkins and is subject to the
                    virtues and vices of dissertation-inspired books. Ideally all research should be publishable, but
                    the transition from thesis to book requires modification in form and content. A pruning of an
                    overladen foreword (including some ill-calculated wit), of obtrusive footnotes, extraneous text, and
                    greater attention to style (the author has a penchant for misplaced modifiers) would have made the
                    book more readable. Moreover, the work is marred by numerous factual mistakes. After an excellent
                    rundown of the literature on the Trent affair, Winks makes the elementary mistake
                    of stating that the Trent, after its release by Captain Charles Wilkes of the San Jacinto, "continued her voyage to 
                        England
                    " (p. 70). Actually the ship was a mail-packet engaged in the Caribbean area
                    and went to St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies. There is some inconsistency as to when the British
                    government seized the Laird rams; Winks gives the date incorrectly on page 125, correctly on page
                    358. Lincoln's renomination is wrongly assigned to May, 1864. Many readers will question
                    the relative importance that Winks assigns the Trent affair and the St. Albans
                    raid (in which Confederates from 
                        Canada
                     attacked a 
                        Vermont
                     town). His emphasis on the raid as a possible cause of war with Britain is not
                    convincing.
            But it is difficult to write a book and easy to find fault with one. In many ways the present volume,
                    despite the above comments, is a noteworthy effort in a neglected field. Winks has written a good
                    book, but one that easily could have been improved by careful editing. Its failings are minor, its
                    conclusions fresh and helpful to students of the Civil War years.

               The Real Abraham Lincoln: A Complete One Volume History of His Life and Times.
                    By Reinhard H. Luthin. (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1960. Pp. xviii, 778.
                    Bibliographical note, notes, index. $10.00.)
            In spite of its presumptuous title, this biography deserves the careful scrutiny of amateur and
                    professional historian alike. Laymen will enjoy its rich detail, its fresh anecdotes, its many apt
                    quotations from Lincoln's speech and writing. Professional historians will be impressed by
                    its confident generalizations based upon exhaustive research.
            Professor Luthin portrays the Great Emancipator "wart and all." Organizing his
                    material topically as well as chronologically, he presents enlightening chapters and new evidence on
                    Lincoln's backwoods beginnings, his legal career, his political fortune and misfortune, his
                    domestic life in 
                        Springfield
                     and 
                        Washington
                    , his personality, his lieutenants, his conduct of the war, his plans for reunion, and
                    his assassin.
            Lincoln's legal career is treated in more detail than one finds in most one-volume
                    biographies, and the reader gets new insight into Lincoln's relationships with his
                    partners, John T. Stuart, Stephen T. Logan, and William H. Herndon, and into his remarkable ability
                    to influence human behavior. Some no doubt will be surprised to learn that Lincoln once defended a 
                        Kentucky
                     slaveholder in a habeas corpus case involving a jailed Negro.
            Although less sympathetic to Mary Lincoln than the account of Ruth Painter Randall, The
                        Real Abraham Lincoln describes Lincoln's home life factually and realistically.
                    From the narrative, one appreciates the difficult role of a circuit-riding lawyer's wife.
                    "I hope," Mary wrote to a friend, "you may never feel as lonely as I
                    sometimes do, surrounded by much that renders life desirable" (p. 133).
            In dealing with controversial questions of interpretation, Professor Luthin meticulously marshals the
                    evidence and allows the reader to judge for himself. He relies heavily on quoted material, the
                    well-selected observations of Lincoln and his contemporaries. Seventy-six pages of helpful notes and
                    bibliography testify to his thorough canvass of available sources.
            An inspired selection of materials helps to conceal the fact that the author lacks the stylistic
                    excellence of Lord Charnwood or of Benjamin Thomas. Occasionally the writing is repetitious;
                    sometimes it needs greater coherence. At least once, it is misleading. In discussing
                    Lincoln's silence from November, 1860, until March, 1861, Luthin concludes that
                    "most of the South's leaders… did not realize how moderate a man
                    Lincoln actually was; nor did influential Southern leaders fully understand that the new
                    President… was sympathetic to their cause" (p. 266).
            Reinhard Luthin has nevertheless produced a lively biography, certainly the most detailed one-volume
                    account of the Sixteenth President.

               Lincoln's Manager: David Davis. By Willard L. King. (

            David Davis entered the mainstream of American history on three important occasions. In 1860, he
                    played a crucial, even indispensable, role in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln for the presidency;
                    in 1866, as a Supreme Court justice, he delivered the majority opinion in the case of Ex parte Milligan; and in 1877, he refused to serve on the electoral commission to
                    investigate the disputed Tilden-Hayes contest, a refusal that was interpreted by many to be the
                    cause of Tilden's defeat and Hayes's election (Davis had privately expressed his
                    belief that Hayes was entitled to the election). These three episodes marked the high points of a
                    long career of service to his home state and to his country, as circuit judge in 
                        Illinois
                    , on the Supreme Bench of the nation, and in the 
                        United States
                     Senate, where he was chosen to preside when Vice-President Arthur assumed the
                    presidency.
            For Willard King, 
                        Chicago
                     lawyer and author of an earlier successful biography of Chief Justice Melville Weston
                    Fuller, Davis' greatest contribution to American history was the part he played in
                    Lincoln's nomination. Davis and Lincoln were lifelong friends, and a large portion of this
                    book is a history of that friendship. That King regards Davis' relationship with Lincoln as
                    strong reason for this biography is clear, not only from the heavy emphasis on Lincoln in its pages
                    but also from the title. Davis was "Lincoln's Manager" for only a few
                    months out of a very long and full career. Those few months, to be sure, fixed Davis'
                    future, for his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1862 was a direct result of his close relation
                    with Lincoln. But Davis was too independent in his opinions and too honest and frank in their
                    expression to be considered an administration man on the court. He disagreed strongly with the
                    President on many basic questions: the use of patronage, the Emancipation Proclamation, and
                    especially on Lincoln's handling of civil liberties—a subject for which Davis
                    felt a deep and abiding concern. To place him too far in the dusk of Lincoln's shadow is to
                    deprive Davis of a greatness that is justifiably his own. While his management of Lincoln's
                    campaign in 1860 brought Davis wide notice, it is also true that Lincoln might not have been
                    nominated and elected had it not been for Davis' exertions. Davis' stature and
                    reputation continued to grow after Lincoln's death. His decision in the Milligan case (a
                    case he maneuvered to the Supreme Court) was truly, in the author's words, a
                    "great contribution to constitutional law" (p. 312).
            Davis was a true conservative; he could not abide radicalism before, during, or after the Civil War.
                    A native of 
                        Maryland
                    , he grew up disliking slavery and hating abolitionists. He represents the broad area of
                    middle western conservative opinion which took strong exception to the program of the Republican
                    radicals and to many of President Lincoln's wartime decisions. He was one of several close
                    friends of Lincoln who opposed the President's concessions to the radical group in the
                    party.
            King has based his book on a wide and intimate knowledge of primary sources, especially the
                    voluminous Davis collection of manuscripts. Some might argue with the author's frequent
                    quotation from  Davis' letters, but in most cases these
                    impart a contemporaneous flair to his narrative. The author is persuasive in his treatment of
                    Davis' role in the 1860 campaign and in the disputed contest of 1876, and the light he
                    casts on these episodes will be of value to the historians who will treat them hereafter. His
                    discussion, for example, of the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Indiana's
                    Caleb Smith to Lincoln's cabinet, an appointment which Davis regarded as a "great
                    mistake," is illuminating and definitive. This is a first-rate biography.

            "Dawn, September 1, 1939.
            "There was no declaration of war. Across the western borders of 
                        Poland
                     poured the first waves of Hitler's mighty war machine." This is the
                    opening of Professor Snyder's swiftly moving, very readable history of World War II. In a
                    subsequent treaty with Soviet Russia, Hitler divided the spoils. "The agonies of hell now
                    descended upon the hapless Poles, prostrate before the conquerors. In a single month 
                        Poland
                     had been crushed in one of the speediest campaigns in military history. Thus began the
                    terrible blood bath of World War II" (p. 9). In five pages the author thus gives a dramatic
                    account of the war in 
                        Poland
                    . Then he goes back to give forty-three pages to what are the usual historical
                    introductions to World War II: underlying causes after World War I; crises in Asia, Africa, and
                    Europe, 1931–1938; immediate causes, 1939. Oftentimes the writer uses this flash-back
                    approach.
            He also plays frequently with one-sentence paragraphs. Sitzkrieg, Sit-down War,
                    Bore War, War of Words, Phony War." That is the opening paragraph of the fifteen-page
                    chapter on the collapse of 
                        France
                    . "All 
                        France
                     degenerated into panic, terror, hysteria, confusion" (p. 99). There is a
                    paragraph which tells what happened. "The entire proceedings took exactly 27
                    minutes" (p. 107). 
                        France
                     had signed the armistice on June 21, 1940. Take another example, a paragraph of one
                    sentence. "It was 8:10 a.m., Hawaiian time, 1:40 p.m., Eastern Standard time, Sunday,
                    December 7, 1941." Then a new paragraph begins: "A young boy was scooting along on
                    his bike from Honolulu to Pearl Harbor.… carrying an urgent communication from 
                        Washington
                    " (p. 195). Then in the next thirty-four pages are sketched background and a
                    description of 
                        Japan
                    's progress throughout the Far East to the Battle of the Coral
                    Sea in May 9, 1942, when another one-sentence paragraph closes the account. "The
                    Battle of the Coral Sea was the Japanese high-water mark" (p. 227).
            Aside from the author's dramatic account of the war, the book's value is further
                    enhanced by thirty-two pages containing sixty-four generally well-chosen pictures, ranging from
                    Chamberlain at 
                        Berchtesgaden
                     in September, 1938, to 
                        Japan
                    's surrender in September, 1945, and covering events in 
                        Poland
                    , Holland, 
                  England, France, Italy
               , Africa, 
                    
                        Hawaii
                    , Far East, 
                        Germany
                    , and 
                        Japan
                    . Strange to say, though many are available, there are no pictures of the Russian
                    fronts. The terribleness of the war for Russia is well described by the author. By December, 1941, 
                        Germany
                     admitted the loss by death of 162,314 soldiers in Russia. Five pages are given to the
                    Stalingrad defense. "It was unadulterated slaughter. Thousands died each day. It became
                    impossible to bury the dead or even to count them" (p. 303). The Russians "lost
                    more men at the Stalingrad than the 
                        United States
                     lost in combat in all theatres of the entire war. Stalingrad was one of the great
                    turning points not only of the war but of world history" (p. 307). But no pictures from
                    Russia!
            There is, however, a copy of General MacArthur's well-publicized "I Shall
                    Return" picture, showing him and others landing through the water while others look on
                    smiling. The landing at Leyte is well described. "This was invasion in force: 600 warships,
                    250,000 men, the U.S. Seventh and Third Fleets, the U.S. Sixth Army." Said General
                    MacArthur, "I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God our forces stand again on
                    Philippine soil.…" But the writer points out that "in the classrooms at 
                        Annapolis
                     it was attributed in large part… to the 
                        United States
                     Navy" (p. 456). Six pages are given to the Battle for Leyte Gulf,
                    "the greatest sea engagement ever fought. Engaged were 166 American and approximately 70
                    Japanese warships, 1,280 American and 716 Japanese warplanes" (p. 457).
            Space does not permit much detail. The author aims to present the story of the war in concise form.
                    He does it well. He aims to eliminate much military detail in favor of a comprehensive picture of
                    broad military developments. The space allotted to the various campaigns indicates that he does this
                    well. On points where there are differences of opinion—Pearl Harbor, Battle of Leyte,
                    Hitler versus his generals in Russia, and so on—he seeks to give both sides of the
                    arguments and does well. He aims to make his story dramatic. His pictures of Rotterdam, battered 
                        London
                    , Leningrad's defense, D-Day, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Nazi concentration camps,
                    and Mussolini's and Hitler's deaths reveal his ability to do so.

               Franklin D. Roosevelt's World Order. By Willard Range. (

                        Georgia
                     Press, 1959. Pp. xiii, 219. Notes, index. $4.50.)
            Willard Range, a member of the University of 
                        Georgia
                    's Political Science Department, states that his book is a case study of the
                    international thinking of a twentieth-century political practitioner. The study, he says, attempts
                    to answer—and it does—three questions: (1) What was Roosevelt's
                    explanation for the breakdown of the world order of his time? (2) In Roosevelt's view, what
                    were the implications of that breakdown for the 
                        United States
                    ? (3) What kind of world order did Roosevelt want to replace the former order?
            Three short initial chapters deal with the first two questions; the remainder of the book discusses
                    Roosevelt's world order. In discussing  the collapse of
                    international order and its implications for the 
                        United States
                    , Range adds little that is new. As major causes for rupture of peace Roosevelt saw the
                    failure of the 
                        United States
                     to join the League, economic nationalism, governments unresponsive to problems of
                    modern society, evil leaders, the armaments race, decline in moral and spiritual fiber, and the
                    "peace at any price" theory of the thirties. His thinking on these matters is well
                    known.
            The President's ideas on a new world order did not differ much from the hopes of anyone who
                    desired world-wide peace and good will. The author believes that Roosevelt personified the ideas and
                    aspirations of a considerable portion of the American people. FDR was an optimist who believed that
                    the good neighbor concept would permeate the globe. The nations would recognize their
                    interdependence. The President had strong faith in democracy and freedom. In a world where evil
                    forces—mainly Fascist and Nazi—were eradicated and where colonialism would
                    gradually disappear, free people could make great progress. Roosevelt also envisaged a global New
                    Deal. Conservation, reclamation, economic planning would be steps toward a healthy world order. To
                    preserve the international system Roosevelt had an idea for a big power guardianship which would aim
                    not to dominate but to keep the peace.
            
               Franklin D. Roosevelt's World Order is one of the "what might
                    have been" genre—not so much what might have been had Roosevelt lived, but what
                    might have been if all the Allies' postwar aims had been similar to those of the 
                        United States
                    . Obviously they were not. For this reason one may feel that there is something futile
                    in reading about what most of us desired but did not get. Of what importance is this recapitulation?
                    The reason that Range offers is that perhaps in the long run Roosevelt was right. If pursued long
                    enough, a good neighbor approach could possibly produce a good neighbor response from all except a
                    small group of incurables. The author's optimism is commendable—and we hope
                    correct—but it is not too comforting to think that the "small group of
                    incurables" may be nearly a billion strictly regimented people who never get an accurate
                    view of our good neighborliness.
            Willard Range has used extensively printed publications concerning Roosevelt and the people about
                    him. He has also used, but to a lesser extent, materials in the Roosevelt manuscripts at Hyde Park.
                    The book is amply footnoted; the placing of the notes at the back of the book makes reading them in
                    conjunction with the text a test of one's manual dexterity.

               The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Edited by
                    William H. Gilman et al. (
                        Cambridge
                    , Mass.: Belknap Press of 
                        Harvard
                     University Press, 1960. Pp. 1, 430. Illustrations, editorial title list, alphabetical
                    title list, textual notes, index. $10.00.)
            This is the first volume of a new edition of Emerson's journals and notebooks which is
                    intended to be the "definitive" edition and, when completed, will comprise
                    approximately sixteen volumes. Older editions (published in 1914 and earlier) were prepared by
                    persons close to  Emerson and were designed to substantiate an
                    already preconceived image of the "Sage of Concord"; hence, the need for a new
                    edition—an edition to correct past editorial errors, omissions, and erroneous
                    interpretations. This volume covers the years 1819–1822, when Emerson (age 16 to 19) was
                    an undergraduate at 
                        Harvard
                    . Included are five journals, four notebooks (one college theme book, two commonplace
                    books, one quotation book), and a catalog of volumes Emerson read between the years 1819 and 1824.
                    The editors' Introduction explains the plan of publication for this series, the editorial
                    method, and the nature of the entire manuscript collection (234 items in all).
            In the Foreword to this volume, there is a partial chronology (1803–1822) of
                    Emerson's life and a list of symbols and abbreviations used by the editors. In the middle
                    of the book, there are twelve photographs of original manuscript pages; a glance at these impresses
                    one with the very difficult task the editors have undertaken. Editorial and alphabetical title
                    lists, textual notes, and an excellent index comprise the last portion of this volume.
            Often the nature of the contents belies the titles of the manuscripts—e.g., the college
                    theme book not only contains the first drafts of themes but also drafts of essays and poems,
                    quotations, and miscellaneous notes. The actual contents reveal a young 
                        Harvard
                     student who read widely and who wanted to become a writer. These writings, done during
                    Emerson's apprenticeship, illustrate how he assembled his material and how he began to
                    practice the art of writing. Emerson confided his inner thoughts—trivial and
                    profound—to these pages, and he began to build systematically a storehouse of ideas and
                    quotations for future use. His comments range from the topics of nature, religion, philosophy, and
                    drama to professors and their lectures and the usefulness of history. For a young man who was about
                    to transcend into an orbit of individualistic and high thinking, it is comforting to know that he,
                    like many more mundane mortals, was occasionally aggrieved by bad weather conditions.
            Subsequent volumes will demonstrate precisely for scholars Emerson's mental and artistic
                    maturity, his role as philosopher of Romantic democracy, and his espousal of the
                    "Over-Soul" concept in the transcendentalist movement. The high quality of
                    editorial workmanship displayed in the first volume convinces this reviewer that every feasible step
                    was taken for this volume and will be taken for future volumes to reproduce Emerson's notes
                    as he first penned them.

               Mark Twain on the Lecture Circuit. By Paul Fatout. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1960. Pp. 321. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index.
                    $6.00.)
            After years of neglect, Mark Twain, the professional lecturer, is having a revival. In 1943 William
                    Brigance omitted Twain from his History and Criticism of American Address on the
                    premise that he exerted little influence on the flow of history. To those who have listened to Hal
                    Holbrook or who have read Paul Fatout's recent study, 
                    Mr. Brigance's assumption will seem to slight the cultural significance of the humorist who
                    has moved so many for so long to laugh at their own limitations and absurdities.
            Mr. Fatout is primarily concerned with the reconstruction of the lecture circuit in the last half of
                    the nineteenth century and with the role which Twain played in it, from his first financial success
                    in 1866 with his Sandwich Islands performance to 1900 when he finally "made no more lecture
                    tours" or accepted "pay for talking."
            Under shrewd promoters like James Redpath, the once sophisticated lyceum became an immense network
                    (not unlike present-day mass media) with eastern, western, and northern circuits. The business
                    attracted an odd assortment of stars: Henry Ward Beecher, Robert Ingersoll, Anna Dickinson, Wendell
                    Phillips, Josh Billings, and Petroleum V. Naseby. This paradoxical troupe included moral uplifters,
                    free thought crusaders, rabid reformers, and crude entertainers. Twain called all of them, including
                    himself, "bandits" on a "public highway."
            With commendable thoroughness Mr. Fatout records the newspaper reactions to Twain's
                    performances, which varied from occasional blasts at his sacrilegious allusions, distortions of
                    fact, and indecent sorties to frequently favorable but seldom ecstatic reviews. Mr. Fatout states
                    that there is no clear evidence to support the contention that Twain was "ranked with the
                    select group of the most-highly paid" (p. 150).
            The author discounts the notion that Twain submitted to the ordeal of public performances solely for
                    the quick cash. He could never resist for long the pleasure he got from wrestling with a live
                    audience. Even in moods of fatigue and discouragement and while swearing he was going to retire, he
                    was busy revising lectures and analyzing audience reactions so that his next performance might be a
                    triumph.
            After the early eighties Mark Twain was one of the most popular after-dinner speakers in America, but
                    his reputation as a lecturer and public reader awaited the flood of recognition springing from his
                    world tour in 1895–1896. Although the fulfillment of his intention was shattered by the
                    death of Susy, his "hundred readings in fifty-three cities of five countries"
                    clinched Mark Twain's reputation "as the dean of American speakers" and
                    "the elder statesman of the platform" (p. 272).
            The only flaw in Mr. Fatout's book is that it ends but fails to conclude. Instead of a
                    thematic evaluation or an interpretation of the significance of the lecture circuit experience as it
                    affected Mark Twain's expression, the author slides to a stop on a biographical tangent. In
                    spite of this structural weakness, the work is substantially conceived and actively written. Those
                    interested in one of the world's most famous speakers will find Mark Twain on
                        the Lecture Circuit well worth reading.

            At first glance, the title of this volume appears to be merely descriptive, but after reading the
                    Foreword it takes on a special and  complex meaning. The author,
                    professor of history and folklore at Indiana University, commences his essay with a definition of
                    folklore. It is, he writes, "the oral traditions channeled across the centuries through
                    human mouths" (p. 2). He points out that folklore may refer to types of barns, quilts,
                    tales, songs, customs, rituals, and a variety of other phenomena. "The common
                    element" he sees in this variety is "tradition." He then states an
                    assumption upon which the entire book rests: "Since the
                    ar⋆⋆⋆e of tradition in a given culture may vary considerably from
                    country to country, it is only right that the study of folklore should follow the contours of a
                    particular civilization" (p. 2). This, in brief, is Dorson's theory of American
                    folklore, which he first presented before an audience of scholars in 1957. His book thus becomes an
                    extensive exposition of this idea.
            American folklore, the author writes, began to take form with the first colonist landings. Beliefs of
                    the Old World were grafted onto the environment of the New World. Colonial folklore centered on
                    themes of the land, savages, and the providence of God. With the coming of the eighteenth-century
                    Enlightenment, 
                        Providence
                     passed from general attention. The new turn that folklore took was
                    native—from "the odd grain of American character." Regional types, the
                    down-Easter, the crafty Yankee, the homespun southerner, and the expansive westerner, all developed.
                    Using subliterary sources, such as the Spirit of the Times, the author examines in
                    particular the development of folk humor, which, he asserts, decreased as sectional strife grew.
                    "But," he concludes, "the backwoods oral yarn found one final supreme
                    mode of expression during the Civil War holocaust, in the person of its central actor, Abraham
                    Lincoln" (p. 69).
            Mr. Dorson interrupts his chronological presentation at this point and shifts to some other aspects
                    of American folklore. He interprets the regional folk culture of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Germans, the Ozark hill folk, Spanish New Mexicans, 
                        Utah
                     Mormons, and 
                        Maine
                     Coast Yankees, all of whose traditions stand in contrast to American urban industrial
                    society. In an examination of immigrant folklore, he poses the question, "What happens to
                    the inherited traditions of European and Asiatic folk after they settle in the 
                        United States
                     and learn a new language and new ways" (pp. 135–136). Drawing
                    mainly upon his own collection of lore from the Upper Penninsula of 
                        Michigan
                    , the author concludes that tradition among immigrants lasts longer than is commonly
                    supposed. He also explores Negro folklore, which he perhaps surprisingly treats separately from that
                    of other immigrants, and concludes that its African origins should be minimized. Folk heroes also
                    receive consideration. Using the term "fakelore" that he coined in 1949 in
                    connection with deliberately manufactured folk heroes like Paul Bunyan, the author develops in
                    contrast legendary heroes like Davy Crockett and Jesse James. Returning to his chronology the author
                    ends his essay with a brief chapter on modern folklore, in which he concludes, after an examination
                    of the folklore of city folk, college students, and G.I.'s, that mass culture is not
                    traditionless. "The idea that folklore is dying out is itself a kind of folklore"
                    (p. 278).
            Some readers will be disappointed because of gaps in the illustrative material from the wide spectrum
                    of folklore that the author draws upon;  and others will find
                    weaknesses in his case. Among the former is the almost complete exclusion of folk dance, art, and
                    crafts. Among the latter, three examples will suffice. It appears that the author raises some issues
                    that ought to be pursued further. One of these is the problem of maintenance of tradition by
                    immigrants. He probably dismisses too quickly the general implications of the studies of Marvin K.
                    Opler, who reaches a conclusion in his study of the Japanese and Nisei that varies from
                    Dorson's own. More collecting and interpreting in this area is needed before a firmly held
                    conclusion should be reached. Weaknesses also appear in the chapter on folk heroes. Dorson correctly
                    designates Paul Bunyan hero-tales as "fakelore." Are, however, many of the Davy
                    Crockett tales, which were in part the products of Whig politicians and propagandists, less
                    "manufactured" than those about Bunyan? In short, the useful term,
                    "fakelore," should be applied consistently. Also, why should the author exclude
                    the leading figures in our national experience about whom tradition has woven many tales, namely
                    George 
                        Washington
                    , Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln, from his gallery of folk heroes? To qualify, must
                    a folk hero be of local significance and then become legendary through oral word and sub-literary
                    media? Must the hero be only "folksy"? Why not consistently follow the definition
                    of "tradition" as folklore if it is valid? These weaknesses, however, are minor in
                    view of Dorson's thesis.
            Professor Dorson demonstrates beyond much doubt his theory that American folklore, or at least many
                    of its aspects, follows the "contours" of American civilization. This is his great
                    achievement, for which we are grateful. Further, he uses his extensive collecting and interpreting
                    in the field of folklore skillfully and easily, making this book both a good introduction to
                    American folklore for the beginner and a stimulating interpretation for the scholar.

                    index. $7.50.)
            This book is largely the story of one member of a pioneer family of German descent which settled on
                    the untamed prairie near 
                  Bloomington, Illinois
               , in 1823, accumulated large land
                    holdings, established a well-known seed company, and has for years exerted energetic leadership in
                    scientific agriculture and in local, state, and national affairs. Its central figure, Eugene D.
                    Funk, Sr. (1867–1944), grew up during a period of rising land values and rapid
                    advancement in agriculture.
            In the auspicious first year of the present century, the Funk Brothers Seed Company was founded. Its
                    first concern was the production of better seed corn to fill a need generally felt at that time.
                    Much attention was given later, however, to other crop plants, such as alfalfa and soy beans, and to
                    the general improvement of agricultural practices.
            By the time that the groundwork was laid for the production of hybrid corn, the Funk Company had
                    established a reputation for producing good seed corn by the older methods of selection. Eugene Funk
                    had also reached the age at which he might have been content to rest  on his laurels and let a thriving business continue as it had been
                    going. But, having a vision of far better things to come from the new approach to corn breeding, he
                    saw to it that generous provision was made for continued research. The result has been a high level
                    of accomplishment in producing greatly increased yields, consistent uniformity, and resistance to
                    fungus diseases and insect pests. Funk's Research Acres, near 
                        Bloomington
                    , has become a mecca for agronomists and plant breeders from all over the world.
            Funk was a leader in the planning and support of the corn fairs, corn schools, and national corn
                    expositions which left their unique mark on American farm life during the first fifteen years of the
                    century. He also took an active part in the founding of the American Seed Trade Association and
                    served as its president in 1925. Although basically opposed to interference with free enterprise, he
                    often served as consultant and aided in studies leading toward the regulation of prices and
                    production.
            A book which resulted from the assimilation of materials from the numerous diaries, journals, and
                    other documents to which the author had access could not be expected to be entirely free from error.
                    The corn plant may be called maize or Zea mays, but never Zea
                    Maize, as on p. 161. Errors in spelling are noted on pages 93 (Kjeldahl), 396 (Gibberella,
                    Pythium), and 536 (corn borer). The description of Nilsson-Ehle's work (p. 83) would lead
                    the reader to believe that he was working with corn. It was probably wheat or some other small
                    cereal. Nowhere in the book do we find a clear, concise account of the exact steps by which hybrid
                    seed corn is produced or of the theory underlying the process. These and other amateurisms lead to
                    the impression that the author has not succeeded in getting very close to the scientific aspects of
                    the subject.
            The main fault that we find with the book is the failure to assimilate the voluminous details. What
                    might have been a moving story of a great man and a fascinating era has remained too much a
                    tabulation of unadorned facts, with little to indicate their relative values. Even the reader who is
                    pretty well acquainted with the subject often finds himself floundering in a mire of details which
                    do not lead anywhere. This makes dull reading. The book will serve as a valuable reference work,
                    but, if there was hope that it might be widely read, this could have been much better accomplished
                    by stripping away two-thirds of the detail and then weaving the remainder into a smoothly flowing
                    narrative.

            This book, which is dedicated to Paul Wallace Gates, is a comprehensive study of land use and
                    ownership in eight east central 
                        Illinois
                     counties forming the bulk of the 
                        Danville
                     Land District. This area was a rectangle which included the rich farm land now
                    extending from  U.S. Highway Thirty-six on the south to 
                        Illinois
                     Highway Seventeen on the north, and from the Indiana border on the east almost to U.S.
                    Highway Fifty-one on the west. Four chapters are devoted to the topic "The Frontier
                    Heritage in Landownership" and six chapters to "East Central 
                        Illinois
                     in Transition, 1850–1900."
            Possibly the reviewer found the book of more interest than the casual reader might because of
                    numerous relatives who lived in or near the area that was dissected. As a former supervisor and
                    member of a board of tax review in another state, he was less interested in the feuds between the
                    settlers and the speculators, the rise and fall of the cattle kings, and the struggles to deal wih
                    such perennial problems as fencing, drainage, and farm tenancy than he was with taxation, the
                    subject covered in the final chapter.
            Far too little attention has been paid even by the economic historians to the assessment of real and
                    personal property, which formed the principal source of governmental income in the nineteenth
                    century. (To this day the average citizen only casually understands handling of delinquent taxes,
                    let alone the more complicated matters of appealing apparent tax inequities and the need for
                    equalization of assessment on a county and state basis.) Mrs. Bogue reviews legislative efforts to
                    deal with these problems—problems complicated by some of the unusual features of the
                    charter given to the 
                        Illinois
                     Central Railroad. Not only were its taxes limited to 7 per cent of it gross annual
                    earnings, to be paid into the state treasury, but local levies could not be made on land grants
                    until purchasers completed payments and secured deeds from the company, a process
                    carried on in a most leisurely fashion—at least from the viewpoint of those whose lands
                    carried the full burden of local property taxes. Hence, governmental services suffered, as was
                    evidenced by the poor roads and the underpaid school teachers. The author concludes that the higher
                    taxes of the third quarter of the century encouraged large owners to dispose of unimproved land and
                    to rely heavily upon tenant operators. All landowners tended to intensify the raising of corn and
                    oats rather than devoting land to pasture.
            The author has done a tremendous amount of research which has included the usual government records,
                    newspapers, monographs, and county histories, as well as the personal papers of large landowners
                    such as Matthew T. Scott and loan agents such as Addison Goodell. Since this book is by and large a
                    statistical study, the writing can scarcely be sprightly. Nevertheless, it might have been improved
                    by reducing the length of quotations such as the ones which constitute the major portion of pages
                    37, 63, and 177, to cite the most glaring examples. Possibly some of the charts and tables might
                    have better been included in the Appendix. In contrast to the traditional thanks paid by a historian
                    to his wife, the author here reverses the tables and includes her husband among those to whom she is
                    in debt, the latter being Dr. Allen G. Bogue, chairman of the Department of History at the State
                    University of 
                        Iowa
                    . The book is well documented and is definitive for the area under consideration.

            The Agricultural Extension Service and the Farm Bureau both had their inception in the last half of
                    the decade of the 1910's and for many years followed parallel paths. In some states their
                    mutual relationship was established by law, in others by custom, and in still others the two
                    agencies cooperated informally but usually rather effectively.
            This book traces in considerable detail the struggle to effect official separation of the
                    Agricultural Extension Service and the Farm Bureau at the national, state, and local levels. The
                    author very effectively relates the pressure for separation to the rising struggle for power among
                    various agricultural leaders and the different farm organizations in an effort to influence the
                    growing network of governmental participation in agriculture.
            In the early part of this century, some of the land grant agricultural colleges had been doing
                    informal adult educational work with farmers which soon came to be known as extension work. With the
                    advent of World War I, extension service employees, both in 
                        Washington
                     and in the field, recognized that they could do their educational job most effectively
                    when "farmer-students" were organized in definite local associations. These local
                    associations came to be called "farm bureaus." Thus the Farm Bureau started, in
                    most instances, as a purely educational arm of the infant Agricultural Extension Service.
            It was inevitable that the county organizations would federate into state organizations, which was
                    precisely what happened in many states. The next step, of course, was national federation. This came
                    in November, 1919, in 
                        Chicago
                    , when the temporary organization was named "American Farm Bureau
                    Federation."
            By 1939, when this study begins, some fifteen states had formal sponsorship of county extension
                    programs through the Farm Bureau, either by legal action or by administrative agreement. Financial
                    contribution to agricultural extension work made by the Farm Bureau in those states totaled almost
                    $1,000,000 in fiscal 1939.
            In the latter part of the 1930's the national farm organizations began to go their separate
                    ways with respect to support of or opposition to important federal farm programs emanating from 
                        Washington
                    . In general, the Farm Bureau strongly favored decentralization of farm programs, with a
                    maximum amount of local control and direction. This policy was natural, since that agency's
                    major organizational strength lay in the counties and the states. The Farmers Union, on the other
                    hand, increasingly favored centralization in 
                        Washington
                     of administrative control over major farm programs. The National Grange lined up on
                    either side from issue to issue, but frequently took the side of central administration. This
                    developing situation gave added emphasis to the long-time campaign of the Farmers Union, and to a
                    lesser extent to that of the National Grange, to obtain official separation of  the Agricultural Extension Service and the Farm Bureau, especially at
                    the county and state levels.
            During the administration of Secretary of Agriculture Anderson from 1944 to 1948, attempts at
                    separation subsided markedly, at least partly because the Farm Bureau and Secretary Anderson were
                    relatively close to each other on matters affecting national agricultural policy. With the
                    appointment of Secretary Brannan in 1948, however, battle lines formed again. The Farm Bureau, from
                    a national point of view, became increasingly vulnerable to criticism because of its close
                    association with a tax supported educational program while taking such a vigorous stand relative to
                    national agricultural policy on the other hand.
            Secretary Brannan, who was perhaps more vigorously opposed by the Farm Bureau than any other
                    secretary of agriculture, did not himself see fit to issue an order forcing dissolution of official
                    ties that still existed in a few states. It remained for Secretary Benson to do this by executive
                    memorandum in the fall of 1954. But his time, official separation of the Agricultural Extension
                    Service from the Farm Bureau was supported publically by the federal extension director, the Land
                    Grant College Association, most of the state extension directors, a great majority of the state farm
                    bureaus, and, tacitly at least, by the American Farm Bureau Federation itself.
            There is no concrete evidence that dissolution of the official ties between Extension and Farm Bureau
                    enhanced the membership of either the National Grange or the Farmers Union or that it injured the
                    membership of the American Farm Bureau Federation.
            This book is strongly recommended for students of agricultural policy and for students of the
                    relationships among the agricultural pressure groups, the general farm organizations, and the
                    development of agricultural programs. In this sense the struggle for separation of Farm Bureau and
                    the Agricultural Extension Service is incidental, as indeed I believe it to be, to the broader and
                    more fundamental question of the kind of general relationship that exists between government and
                    agriculture.

               Readings in the History of American Agriculture. Edited by Wayne D. Rasmussen. (

            In view of the preponderant importance of American agriculture in the general scheme of things, it is
                    somewhat surprising that not more has been written about its history. Professor Rasmussen's
                    book is a welcome addition to the rather short list of works bearing upon the subject. As the title
                    indicates, it is a collection of readings. These are divided into eight parts, the division being
                    made largely on the basis of chronology. That is, the book starts with earliest colonial times and
                    comes down to the present. Attention is given to technology, public policy, national emergencies,
                    and other significant aspects of the development of agriculture.
            
            Parts I and II cover the period from 1607 to 1789. The contributions of the Indians to the
                    agriculture which was transplanted by settlers from Europe are treated at some length in Part I.
                    Part II deals with early national land policy and the beginnings of technological progress in
                    agriculture in this country.
            In Part III, which covers the period from 1789 to 1861, the editor presents materials dealing with
                    further technological progress and the beginnings of agricultural cooperative marketing. This period
                    saw the introduction of the mechanical reaper, the steel plow, commercial fertilizers, and improved
                    breeds of livestock.
            Part IV covers the period from 1861 to 1914 and is headed "The First American Agricultural
                    Revolution." Its main theme is rapid technological progress in American agriculture, with
                    some attention to public land policy and the rise of farmers' organizations.
            Parts V, VI, and VII deal with World War I and its aftermath with respect to American agriculture.
                    Part V is short, covering only the years from 1914 to 1919. Part VI deals with the chronic
                    agricultural depression extending from 1920 to 1932 and is concerned mainly with political efforts
                    at farm relief. Part VII has to do with the New Deal era of the 1930's, and the materials
                    are about equally divided between public policy with respect to agriculture and further
                    technological progress.
            Part VIII is headed "World War II and the Second Agricultural Revolution." It is
                    regrettably short and considerably inadequate.
            The book has numerous illustrations which are quite good, and the sections on chronology and
                    recommended readings are useful. Although the work as a whole deserves a good rating, it has some
                    serious deficiencies. For example, there is virtually nothing about the Populist movement in it, and
                    the whole subject of farmers' movements is dealt with very scantily. The farmers'
                    role in politics in this country has been much more important than these readings would indicate.
                    The book could well have been considerably longer than it is.

               The American Civil Engineer: Origins and Conflict. By Daniel Hovey Calhoun. (

                    notes, index. $5.50.)
            This book tells of the American civil engineer's rise toward professionalism. When agitation
                    for internal improvements began early in the nineteenth century, the few native technologists were
                    chiefly homespun products of experience on surveying crews; in 1816 there were only about thirty in
                    the whole country.
            Interest in canals and railroads created a technical demand partially met by the 
                        United States
                     Military Academy; by Alden Partridge's American Literary, Scientific, and
                    Military Academy, established at Norwich, 
                        Vermont
                    , in 1820; and 
                        Rensselaer
                     Polytechnic Institute, founded in 1824. By the 1830's a number of institutions
                    offered  engineering instruction: University of 
                        Virginia
                    , University of 
                  Michigan, Hanover
                College, Miami University, University of 
                        Alabama
                    , and others. The author says that when directors of internal improvements
                    "created or found a supply of engineers, every step they took to assure that supply helped
                    to fix the civil engineer as a separate occupational type in the 
                        United States
                    " (p. 54).
            Still, the civil engineer did not achieve status overnight, often being ambiguously involved on
                    public projects in a position quasi-contractual or directorial, sometimes merely advisory, and
                    frequently embroiled in state and local politics. In 1867, the founding of the American Society of
                    Civil Engineers was a long step toward the professionalism the civil engineer enjoys today. Yet the
                    author concludes that nineteenth-century experience made the engineer not an independent entity but,
                    rather, dependent upon "a corporate America that supported the engineer, sustained the
                    engineer, and quite early defined his character" (p. 199).
            The author uses many details to illuminate adventures of such engineers as Benjamin Wright, Nathan
                    Roberts, Jesse L. Williams, Benjamin H. Latrobe, and others, and reveals problems, engineering and
                    human, in the building of the Erie Canal, Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, 
                        Wabash
                     and Erie Canal, 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     Railroad, and so forth. In this volume, a great quantity of information rests on
                    copious documentation. Yet the piling up of minutiae about political and technological squabbles
                    makes hard reading, chiefly because a pedestrian style does little more than list a catalog of
                    facts. The writing calls for lift and flair. The numerous engineers, commissioners, and politicians
                    who populate these pages emerge not as living human beings but only as automatons with names; a bald
                    recital misses the drama that must have attended those ambitious construction jobs. Trite words like
                    "case," "type," "the fact that,"
                    "field," "area," "participated" make the prose
                    flat. The assembly of plentiful data merits approval for the workmanlike industry it shows, but
                    unfortunately the narration plods with heavy foot.

               Steelworkers in America: The Nonunion Era. By David Brody.

            It is remarkable that in America, despite the great natural resources and inventive genius of private
                    enterprisers, both of which are conspicuous in the steel industry, workers in the mills from
                    1870's until World War I lived a life close to slavery—with subsistence wages,
                    long hours of work, continual exposure to danger of death and injury, and a condition of servility.
                    How was this possible? Besides describing the workers' conditions, David Brody has studied
                    the economic and social forces affecting the iron and steel industry up to 1929 and offers a
                    reasoned and well-documented answer. His findings do not reflect  favorably on either the businessmen or the union leaders of this sixty-year period.
            Brody describes, first, the economic characteristics of the industry. From 1870 to 1900 unrestricted
                    competition bred overriding concern for economy. Economy brought rapid
                    technological progress, cost accounting, and technical efficiency in production. The economy of
                    Carnegie and other enterprisers included the exploitation of both engineers and
                    workmen—labor was "a commodity like anything else."
            The labor union to which the American Federation of Labor granted exclusive jurisdiction was the
                    Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, limited to skilled workmen. It reached a total of
                    twenty-four thousand members at its peak in 1891. The union never faced up to the results of
                    mechanization, neither saving its own members from displacement nor attempting to organize the
                    increasing proportion of unskilled workers. By 1914 it had only sixty-five hundred members.
            Management lured the English-speaking skilled workers away from unionism through promotion and
                    paternalism. It was the large flow of unskilled workers from eastern Europe that kept wages
                    down— ⋆⋆⋆a continually shifting group, since many
                    returned home with hard-earned savings. Southern Negroes and Mexicans played the same role in the
                    1920's. The companies dominated the steel communities. Following a ruthless antiunion
                    policy, they placed paid spies in union meetings; workers dared not even talk among themselves about
                    their grievances.
            The author also discusses the labor policy of U.S. Steel, the special situation in World War I, and
                    the ill-fated AF of L organizing drive and strike of 1918–1919.
            Steel centers in Indiana, such as 
                        Elwood
                     and Gary, played an important part in this story of steelworkers, as well as those
                    centers in 
                  Pennsylvania, Ohio
               , and

               Indiana Election Returns, 1816–1851. Compiled by Dorothy Riker and

            This volume greatly enlarges our equipment for study of government and politics in Indiana during the
                    period of the first constitution. There are 390 pages of electoral data (listing candidates for
                    offices and showing the vote received); an appendix citing acts creating the state's
                    counties and apportioning the state for Congress and general assembly. Seventeen pages of
                    introduction describe the state of Indiana's electoral records, explain how the information
                    in this volume was obtained, outline the electoral law and procedures, and relate the popularly
                    chosen officials to the total structure of government under the first constitution. And finally,
                    there is an index which shows for every person named in the book every office that he sought, the
                    year he stood for election, and whether he won or lost. Naturally it is not possible to know how
                    patiently the editors sought reliable data for the  last item,
                    nor how carefully proofreading was done; on the evidence available, this reviewer would say that
                    Dorothy Riker and Gayle Thornbrough did a truly admirable job.
            This volume is helpfully supplemented by nearly a hundred pages of tabulations compiled by Robert J.
                    Pitchell, titled Indiana Votes, and published in 1960 by the Indiana University
                    Bureau of Government Research. The Pitchell volume encompasses all elections for governor from 1852
                    to 1956 and all elections for 
                        United States
                     senator from 1914 to 1958. The tabulations show the following information by county:
                    vote for each candidate of the two leading parties, combined vote for all other candidates, the
                    percentage of the total vote and the percentage of the two-party vote which went to each major party
                    candidate. The vote for minor party candidates is omitted.
            The electoral data for 1816 to 1851 is presented in five sections of the book under review. The
                    sections pertain to: presidential electors, the 
                        United States
                     House of Representatives and Senate, governor and lieutenant governor, both chambers of
                    the general assembly, and constitutional issues (referenda on calling a convention, election of
                    delegates to the convention of 1850, and ratification of the constitution of 1851). To the extent
                    that the information could be obtained, the full names of all candidates and the vote for each
                    candidate, by counties, are given. Notably missing are names of unsuccessful candidates and the
                    county vote for members of the general assembly in elections prior to 1844, the vote by counties for
                    other offices in the 1816 election, and the vote for several seats in the 1850 constitutional
                    convention. 
                        United States
                     senators were chosen by the state legislature throughout the period, and presidential
                    electors were selected in the same way in 1816 and 1820. The vote given to each candidate for
                    senator, in successive ballots, is shown, and there are notes on the two legislative selections of
                    electors, but the division of state legislators among the candidates for senator and for
                    presidential elector is not shown. Footnotes interspersed throughout the returns indicate sources of
                    information, note discrepancies in information, and supply other useful knowledge.
            The index shows for each individual every office he sought, the year he stood, and whether he was
                    successful and therefore makes quick and easy a number of interesting little studies. For instance,
                    the reviewer finds that under the first constitution, the office of lieutenant governor was not a
                    step to the governorship as it is today. Only three men who served as lieutenant governor later
                    sought the higher office; two were elected, one was defeated. A fourth lieutenant governor later
                    served in the national House of Representatives; none of the others subsequently held an office
                    higher than the state legislature. The first two governors of Indiana (Jennings and Hendricks,
                    together serving three terms) had not previously served in the general assembly; every later
                    governor under the first constitution had seen service in that body. A check of a sample of two
                    hundred men, selected by chance, who stood for office other than the 1850 convention shows that 105
                    served in the general assembly, two of whom were also elected to the 
                        United States
                     House of Representatives; the other 95 never  won
                    an election. Of the latter group, two men each tried one time for presidential elector but did not
                    make it. At least, they won a memorial in this book which will outlast a crumbling cemetery
                    headstone.

            The literature on state and local taxation multiplies in direct proportion to the demands upon state
                    and local governments for money to meet the growing needs of an expanding population. Professor
                    Fisher's work is a broadly and ambitiously conceived study of the financial problems of the
                    state of 
                        Illinois
                    , although the author limits his analysis to an economic framework. The politics of
                    taxation, which normally dominate the formation of fiscal policy, are not dealt with at all.
            The value of this work is that it brings together in well-organized form a great deal of useful data
                    which are available in standard reference works and official governmental reports. It is regrettable
                    that Professor Fisher has made no attempt at original research in the field, some of
                    which—on such topics as business and corporate tax burdens—is indispensable
                    for an adequate analysis of the subject.
            This failure contributes to the major weakness of the study. The author shows rather easily that the
                    most relevant economic criteria prove that 
                        Illinois
                     taxpayers are well off in comparison to those of other states. He runs into much more
                    difficult and unresolved problems when his analysis turns to the distribution of the tax burden
                    among the various groups within the state. For example, business firms admittedly pay substantial
                    sales taxes on the goods they consume in their operations, but Fisher makes no effort to estimate
                    this burden in 
                        Illinois
                    . ⋆⋆⋆In the field of property taxation, the author
                    makes the elementary error of using assessment figures to measure tax burden among classes of
                    property taxpayers (except farmers) and compounds the error by failing to recognize that in most
                    states a significant proportion of personal property taxes are paid by business firms. The author
                    admits that "the data presented in this section are far too fragmentary to permit a
                    numerical estimate of the percentage of state and local taxes in 
                        Illinois
                     which is paid by business." He goes on to conclude— improperly, I
                    believe—that "they are sufficient, however, to indicate clearly that taxation of
                    business is significantly lighter in 
                        Illinois
                     than in most states" (p. 115).
            As useful as the material in this volume is, a greater contribution would have been made if more
                    effort had been expended on compiling tax burden data which are not available in standard sources.
