                <salute>FELLOW WORKERS,</salute>
                <p>We come before you as Anarchist Communists to explain our principles. We are
                    aware that the minds of many of you have been poisoned by the lies which all
                    parties have diligently spread about us. But surely the persecutions to which we
                    have been and are subjected by the governing classes of all countries should
                    open the eyes of those who love fair play. Thousands of our comrades are
                    suffering in prison or are driven homeless from one country to the other. Free
                    speech—almost the only part of British liberty that can be of any use to the
                    people—is denied to us in many instances, as the events of the last few years
                    have shown.</p>
                <p>The misery around us is increasing year by year. And yet there was never so much
                    talk about labor as there is now, labor, for the welfare of which all
                    professional politicians profess to work day and night. A very few sincere and
                    honest but impracticable reformers, in company with a multitude of mere quacks,
                    ambitious placehunters, etc., say they are able to benefit labor, if labor will
                    only follow their useless advice. All this does not lessen the misery in the
                    least: look at the unemployed, the victims of hunger and cold, who die every
                    year in the streets of our rich cities, where wealth of every description is
                    stored up.</p>
                <p>Not only do they suffer who are actually out of work and starving, but every
                    working man who is forced to go through the same dreary routine day by day—the
                    slavery and toil in the factory or workshop—the cheerless home, if the places
                    where they are forced to herd together can be called homes. Is this life worth
                    living? What becomes of the intellectual faculties, the artistic inclinations,
                    nay, the ordinary human feeling and dignity of the greater part of the workers?
                    All these are warped and wasted, without any chance of development, making the
                    wretched worker nothing but a human tool to be exploited until more profitably
                    replaced by some new invention or machine.</p>
                <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7013-002"></pb>
                <p>Is all this misery necessary? Is is not if you, the wealth producers, knew that
                    there is enough and to spare of food and of the necessaries of life for all, if
                    all would work. But now, in order to keep the rich in idleness and luxury, all
                    the workers must lead a life of perpetual misery and exploitation. As to these
                    facts we are all agreed; but as to the remedy most of you, unfortunately, have
                    not given up trust in Parliament and the State. We shall explain how the very
                    nature of the State prevents anything good coming from it. What does the State
                    do? It protects the rich and their ill‐gotten wealth; it suppresses the attempts
                    of the workers to recover their rights, if these attempts are thought dangerous
                    to the rich. Thus idle electioneering, labor politics etc. are not suppressed,
                    but any effective popular demonstration, vigorous strikes as at Featherstone and
                    Hull, Anarchist propaganda, etc., are suppressed or fought against by the vilest
                    means. Moreover, the State, pretending thereby to alleviate the sufferings of
                    the poor, grants Royal Commissions on the Sweating System, the Aged Poor, on
                    Labor in general, or Select Committees on the Unemployed—which produce heaps of
                    Blue Books, and give an opportunity to the politicians and labor leaders, “to
                    show themselves off.” And that is about all. If the workers demand more—there is
                    the workhouse; and if not satisfied with that, the truncheons of the police and
                    the bullets and bayonets of the soldiers face them:—not bread, but lead!</p>
                <p>All political promises are of the same value: either they are not kept, even if
                    it could be, or they involve social changes which can only be effected by a
                    revolution, and not by mere votes cast in Parliament. This applies to the
                    promises of Socialist candidates, even if it could be admitted that these
                    candidates could remain uncorrupted by the demoralising influence of
                    Parliament.</p>
                <p>There can be no true humanity, no true self‐respect, without self‐reliance. No
                    one can help you if you do not help yourselves. We do not promise to do anything
                    for you, we do not want anything from you, we only appeal to you to co‐operate
                    with us to bring about a state of society which will make freedom, well‐being
                    possible for all.</p>
                <p>To do this efficiently, we must all be imbued with the spirit of freedom, <choice>

                        <sic>aad</sic>
                    </choice> this—freedom, and freedom alone—is the fundamental principle of
                    Anarchy.</p>
                <p>Freedom is a necessary condition to, and the only guarantee of, the proper
                    development of mankind. Nature is most beautiful when unfettered by the
                    artificial interference of man. Wild animals are stronger and more harmoniously
                    developed than their domesticated kind, which the exploiting mind of man makes
                    mere instruments of profit by developing chiefly those parts of them which are
                    of use to him. The same<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7013-003"></pb> threatens to be the case
                    with the human victims of exploitation, if an end is not put to the system which
                    allows the rich and crafty exploiters to reduce the greater part of mankind to a
                    position resembling that of domestic animals—working machines, only fit to do
                    mechanically a certain kind of work, but becoming intellectually wrecked and
                    ruined.</p>
                <p>All who acknowledge this to be the great danger to human progress should
                    carefully ponder over it, and if they believe that it is necessary to ensure by
                    every means the free development of humanity, and to remove by all means every
                    obstacle placed in its path, they should join us and adopt the principles of
                    Anarchism.</p>
                <p>Belief in and submission to authority is the root cause of all our misery. The
                    remedy we recommend:—struggle unto death against all authority, whether it be
                    that of physical force identical with the State or that of doctrine and
                    theories, the product of ages of ignorance and superstition inculcated into the <choice>

                        <sic>workers</sic>
                    </choice> minds from their childhood—such as religion, patriotism, obedience to
                    the law, belief in the State, submission to the rich and titled, etc., generally
                    speaking, the absence of any critical spirit in face of all the humbugs who
                    victimise the workers again and again. We can only deal here briefly with all
                    these subjects, and must limit ourselves to touch only on the chief points.</p>
                <p>Economic exploitation—the result of the monopolisation of the land, raw materials
                    and means of production by the capitalists and landlords—is at the bottom of the
                    present misery. But the system which produces it would have long ago broken down
                    if it were not upheld on one hand by the State, with its armies of officials,
                    soldiers and police—the whole machinery of government, in one word; and on the
                    other hand by the workers themselves, who tamely submit to their own spoliation
                    and degradation, because they think it right, owing to a <choice>
                        <corr>superstitious</corr>
                        <sic>superstious</sic>
                    </choice> belief in a divine providence inculcated by their masters, or because
                    they desire, by sneaking means, to be exploiters themselves—an object which only
                    one in a thousand can succeed in—or because they have not lost faith in
                    political action or the capacity of the State to do for them that which they are
                    too ignorant to do for themselves. Under these protections the rich classes are
                    enjoying their spoil in safety and comfort.</p>
                <p>It is evident that this system, if to be destroyed at all, must be attacked by
                    the workers themselves, as we cannot expect those who profit by it to cut their
                    own throats, so to say.</p>
                <p>Many still consider the State a necessity. Is this so in reality? The State,
                    being only a machine for the protection and preservation of property, can only
                    obstruct freedom and free development, being bound to<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7013-004"></pb> keep up the law and every statute law is an obstacle
                    to progress and freedom.</p>
                <p>Laws are of two kinds. They are either simple formulæ, derived from the
                    observation of phenomena as the so‐called laws of nature, the phrasing of which
                    is open to revision with the progress of human knowledge and the accumulation of
                    fresh material to draw deductions from. No authority is required to enforce
                    them, they exist; and every being arranges his conduct in conformity with his
                    knowledge of their action. The phenomenon of fire burning is the result of such
                    a natural law, and all pay attention to it though there is no policeman posted
                    behind every match and fireplace. Here again Nature gives us an example of free
                    development and Anarchy, and in a free society all social facts and necessities
                    would be equally well recognised and acted upon.</p>
                <p>But there is the other kind of law. That which is the expression of the will of
                    an unscrupulous minority, who, owing to the apathy and ignorance of the
                    majority, have been able to usurp the means of power and purport to represent
                    the whole people at the time of the enaction of the laws.</p>
                <p>The fact that a great number of persons is in favor of something is evidently no
                    guarantee that it is right. Experience, on the contrary, shows that progress is
                    usually brought about by individuals. New discoveries, new lines of human
                    activity are first found and practised by a few, and only gradually adopted by
                    the many. The majority that makes the laws or abides to them will almost always
                    lag behind progress, and the laws made by it will be reactionary from the very
                    beginning. How much more so as time proceeds and new progress is made!</p>
                <p>Of course, progress itself laughs at the puny efforts of the usurpers of power to
                    stop its triumphant march. But its apostles and advocates have to suffer much
                    and severely for the enthusiasm and the hope that is within them. Prison and
                    often death itself is their doom, the penalty for having raised the standard of
                    revolt against authority and law, the embodiment of the spirit of
                    oppression.</p>
                <p>And the very makers of these laws are forced to admit that their work is useless.
                    Is not the continuous manufacture of new laws going on in the Parliaments of all
                    countries throughout the greater part of this century, and in England for many
                    centuries, a proof of the fact that the laws never satisfy anybody, not even
                    those who make them. They know, however, that their legislating is mere mockery
                    and hypocrisy, having no other object but to make the people believe that
                    something is being done for them, and that the public interest is well looked
                    after. The people obey all these laws, whilst the State, in the alleged interest
                    of all, in reality in the interest of the property owners and of its own<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7013-005"></pb> power, violates them all and commits numberless
                    crimes—which are glorified as deeds of valor committed in the interest of
                    civilisation.</p>
                <p>This principle, kept in the background in time of peace, is paraded before the
                    eyes of so‐called “rights” in some savage territory, plunders and provokes the
                    natives until they return force by force. Then the State steps in, in the
                    pretended interest of religion and civilisation, slaughters them and annexes
                    their land. The greater the slaughter, the greater the glory for these “heroic”
                    pioneers. Or it may be in a war on a greater scale with a European State, when
                    the workers of one country are let loose against those of another, to murder,
                    plunder and burn homes and villages, and perform such like patriotic deeds of
                    valor and chivalry.</p>
                <p>We Anarchists are internationalists, we acknowledge no distinction of nationality
                    or color. The workers of all countries suffer as we do here, and our comrades
                    have everywhere to fight the same battle for freedom and justice. The
                    capitalists are internationally unanimous in persecuting the defenders of
                    freedom and in fleecing the workers. Even England is brought more and more under
                    the sway of a continental police system, the dangers of which the British masses
                    do not see at present, as it is used chiefly against friendless foreign
                    refugees. They are regardless of the fact that it is but the forerunner of an
                    attack on their own liberties.</p>
                <p>The workers as a rule are filled with an unreasoning dislike to the workers of
                    other countries, whom their masters have succeeded in representing to them as
                    their natural enemies, and herein lies one of the main sources of the strength
                    of the capitalist system; a strength which has no other foundation than the
                    weakness and the helplessness of the people. It is in the interests of all
                    governments to uphold patriotism, to have their own people ready to fly at the
                    throats of their fellow workers of other nationalities whenever it suits the
                    interests of the employers to open up new markets, or draw the attention of the
                    people away from the contemplation of their own misery, which might drive them
                    to revolt.</p>
                <p>Patriotism and religion have always been the first and last refuges and
                    strongholds of scoundrels. The meek and lowly servants of the one blessing—in
                    the name of their God—the infamies committed for the sake of the other, and
                    cursing in the same name the deeds they just now blessed if committed by the
                    enemy.</p>
                <p>Religion is mankind’s greatest curse! It is absurd to expect that science, in the
                    few years that the State and the priests have left it to a certain extent
                    alone—the stake or the prison has been too often the<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7013-006"></pb> reward of its pioneers—should have discovered
                    everything. It would not be worth living in a world where everything had been
                    discovered, analysed and registered. One fact is certain: all so‐called
                    religions are the products of human ignorance, mere phantastical efforts of
                    barbarous people to reason out matters which they could not possibly understand
                    without some knowledge of science and scientific methods. The opinion of the
                    savage on the power that works a steam engine, or produces the electric light,
                    is evidently worthless and could be refuted by anyone possessing elementary
                    knowledge. In the same worthless way our forefathers, savages also, reasoned
                    about the phenomena of nature, and came to the naive conclusion that somebody
                    behind the curtains of the sky pulled the strings. This supposed individual they
                    called God and the organic force of man the soul, and endowed it with a separate
                    entity, although that organic force does not possess any more separate entity
                    than that working a clock or a steam hammer. A dim consciousness of this has
                    permeated the mind of most in spite of the fact that religion has been bolstered
                    up by all the forces of authority, because it teaches submission to the law, and
                    as a reward gives cheques drawn on the bank of heaven, which are not more likely
                    to be met than the politician’s promises of what he will do when he is returned
                    for Parliament. Religion is the most deadly enemy to human progress. It has
                    always been used to poison the mind and deaden the judgment of the young, thus
                    making grown up people accept all its absurdities because they are familiarised
                    with them in their youth.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, religion is not kept out of the labor movement. Priests and
                    parsons, who should be a horror to mankind, as their presence adds an additional
                    element of corruption, sneak into it, and labor politicians use their services
                    as the Liberals and Tories do. There is actually in existence a body of persons
                    who prostitute the noble word “Labor” by coupling it with the disgusting word
                    “Church,” forming the “Labor Church,” which is looked upon favorably by most of
                    the prominent labor leaders. Why not start a “Labor Police”?</p>
                <p>We are Atheists<ref target="#bev-anarchy-note01">*</ref> and believe that man
                    cannot be free if he does not shake off the fetters of the authority of the
                    absurd as well as those of every other authority. Authority assumes numerous
                    shapes and disguises, and it will take a long period of development under
                    freedom to get rid of all. To do this two things are wanted, to rid ourselves of
                    all <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="bev-anarchy-note01">This open
                        statement of our convictions does not imply any spirit of persecution on our
                        part against those who believe in the absurdities of the different
                        religions. Persecution is essential to authority and religion, and fatal to
                        freedom; we should destroy the basis of our own hopes and ideals, if we were
                        ever carried away by the spirit of persecution, bigotry and intolerance,
                        which is so commonly raised against us.</note><pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7013-007"></pb> superstition and to root out the stronghold of all authority, the State.</p>
                <p>We shall be asked what we intend to put in place of the State. We reply, “Nothing
                    whatever!” The State is simply an obstacle to progress; this obstacle once
                    removed we do not want to erect a fresh obstruction.</p>
                <p>In this we differ essentially from the various schools of State Socialists, who
                    either want to transform the present State into a benevolent public‐spirited
                    institution (just as easy to transform a wolf into a lamb), or to create a new
                    centralised organisation for the regulation of all production and consumption,
                    the so‐called Socialist society. In reality this is only the old State in
                    disguise, with enormously strengthened powers. It would interfere with
                    everything and would be the essence of tyranny and slavery, if it could be
                    brought about. But, thanks to the tendency of the ways and means of
                    production—which will lead to Anarchy—it cannot.</p>
                <p>But whilst State Socialism is impracticable as a system of real Socialism, it is
                    indeed possible if its advocates had their way, that all matters of general
                    interest and more and more of private interest too would pass under the control
                    of the State; whether it be a little more democratised or not, it does not
                    matter, for we reject Democracy as well as Absolutism. Authority is equally
                    hateful to us whether exercised by many, or by few, or by one. The last remnant
                    of free initiative and self‐reliance would be crushed under the heels of the
                    State, and the emancipation of the workers would be as far off as ever. State
                    Socialism has indeed strengthened the decaying faith in, and renewed the
                    prestige of, the State.</p>
                <p>All we Anarchists want is equal freedom for all. The workers to provide for their
                    own affairs by voluntary arrangements amongst themselves. This leads us to a
                    consideration of the economic basis of the state of things we desire to bring
                    about, and here we avow ourselves Communists.</p>
                <p>Everybody has different faculties and abilities for work, and different wants and
                    desires for the various necessities of life and leisure. These inclinations and
                    wants require full satisfaction, but can only receive it in a state of freedom.
                    Everybody supposing his faculties to be properly developed can best judge what
                    is best for himself. Rules and regulations would hinder and make him a fettered,
                    incomplete being who necessarily finds no pleasure in work forced upon him. But
                    under Anarchy he would associate voluntarily with others to do the work he is
                    best fitted to do, and would satisfy his wants in proportion to his needs from
                    the common stock, the result of their common labor.</p>
                <pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7013-008"></pb>
                <p>Cut‐throat competition for the bare necessities of life would be done away with,
                    leaving many matters of a more individual, private and intimate character, in
                    which the free man would find opportunity for peaceful and harmonious emulation,
                    and thereby develop his faculties in the highest possible degree.</p>
                <p>One of the stock objections against Anarchist Communism is that no one would
                    work. We reply that to‐day work is viewed with disfavor and neglected by all who
                    can possibly exist without it because it has to be carried on under the most
                    disadvantageous conditions and is, moreover, looked upon as degrading. The
                    worker earning his food by hard labor and ceaseless toil is a pariah, the
                    outcast of society, while the idler who never does an <choice>

                        <sic>hours</sic>
                    </choice> work in his life is admired and glorified, and spends his days in
                    luxurious ease amongst pleasant surroundings. We believe that under Anarchism
                    everybody would be willing to work; work being freed from the badge of dishonor
                    now associated with it will have become a labor of love, and the free man will
                    feel ashamed to eat food he has not earned. But as to some atavistic remnants of
                    modern capitalist society that would only work if forced? Well, nobody would
                    want us to retard the emancipation of the immense mass of mankind on account of
                    these few unsocial beings who may or may not exist then. Left to themselves and
                    scorned by everyone they would soon come to their senses and work.</p>
                <p>We cannot further enter here into the arguments which show the tendency of a
                    development into Free Communism, and we refer to our literature on the subject.
                    (See Kropotkin’s “Anarchism: its Basis and Principles.” Freedom Pamphlets, No.
                    4, etc.)</p>
                <p>Anarchist society will consist of a great number of groups devoted each to the
                    production of certain commodities free of access to all, and in local and
                    interlocal contact with other groups to agree and make arrangements for purposes
                    of exchange. With regard to the first necessities of life, food, clothes,
                    shelter, education, Free Communism would be carried out thoroughly. All
                    secondary matters would be left to a mutual agreement in the most varied ways.
                    There would remain in such a society full freedom for the Individualist as long
                    as he did not develop any monopolistic tendencies.</p>
                <p>These are our principles; let us consider the means to realise them.</p>
                <p>Here we are met by the cry “Dynamiters,” “Assassins,” “Fiends,” etc. Let us see
                    who chiefly utter these cries.</p>
                <p>The same people who, by colliery disasters, the ensuring of rotten ships, fires
                    in death‐trap‐houses, railway accidents caused by overwork, etc., daily massacre
                    more people than the Anarchists of all countries ever<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7013-009"></pb> killed. The same people who are ready at any moment
                    to have the natives of any country slaughtered, simply to rob them, who are
                    overjoyed at the butchery of the Chinese war, which will enable them to make
                    fresh profit, who are slowly starving and killing the millions of workers, whose
                    lives are shortened by overwork, adulterated food, and overcrowding slums. These
                    people have, in our eyes, no voice when the question of Humanity is considered.
                    They may abuse and insult us just as they like. The worst thing that could
                    happen to us, indeed, would be to win their approbation, to be petted by them as
                    the <choice>

                        <sic>repeectable</sic>
                    </choice> labor politicians are.</p>
                <p>Some well‐meaning, but rather weak‐minded people too, are misled by these cries.
                    To these we say come and study our movement and gain a knowledge of its history
                    and personalities, and you will find that every act of revolt is but a reply to
                    a hundred, nay, a thousand <choice>
                        <corr>villainous</corr>
                        <sic>villaineous</sic>
                    </choice> crimes committed by the governing classes against us and against the
                    workers in general. You will find that those who did these acts were the very
                    best, the most human, unselfish, self‐sacrificing of our comrades, who threw
                    their lives away, meeting death or imprisonment in the hope that their acts
                    would sow the seed of revolt, that they might show the way and wake an echo, by
                    their deeds of rebellion, in the victims of the present system.</p>
                <p>With the specific mode of action of anyone we have nothing to do. Anarchists
                    advocate the propagation of their ideas by all means that lead to that end, and
                    everyone is the best judge of his own actions. No one is required to do anything
                    that is against his own inclination. Experience is in this as in other matters
                    the best teacher, and the necessary experience can only be gained through entire
                    freedom of action.</p>
                <p>Thus the means which we would adopt embrace all that furthers our cause, and
                    exclude all that will damage it. The decision of what is good or harmful must be
                    left to persons or groups who choose to work together.</p>
                <p>Nothing is more contrary to the real spirit of Anarchy than uniformity and
                    intolerance. Freedom of development implies difference of development, hence
                    difference of ideas and actions. Every person is likely to be open to a
                    different kind of argument, so propaganda cannot be diversified enough if we
                    want to touch all. We want it to pervade and penetrate all the utterances of
                    life, social and political, domestic and artistic, educational and recreational.
                    There should be propaganda by word and action, the platform and the press, the
                    street corner, the workshop, and the domestic circle, acts of revolt, and the
                    example of our own lives as free men. Those who agree with each other may co‐<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7013-010"></pb> operate; otherwise they should prefer to work
                    each on his own lines to trying to persuade one the other of the superiority of
                    his own method.</p>
                <p>Organisation arises from the consciousness that, for a certain purpose, the
                    co‐operation of several forces is necessary. When this purpose is achieved the
                    necessity for co‐operation has ceased, and each force reassumes its previous
                    independence ready for other co‐operation and combination if necessary. This is
                    organisation in the Anarchist sense—ever varying, or, if necessary, continuous
                    combinations of the elements that are considered to be the most suitable for the
                    particular purpose on hand, and refers not only to the economical and industrial
                    relations between man and man, but also to the sexual relations between man and
                    woman, without which a harmonious social life is impossible.</p>
                <p>These views differ immensely from those held by the believers in authority, who
                    advocate permanent organisations with chiefs or councils elected by the
                    majority, and who put all their trust in these institutions. The more they
                    centralise these organisations and introduce stringent rules and regulations to
                    preserve order and discipline, the more they will fail to achieve their object.
                    In such organisations we see only obstacles to the free initiative and action of
                    individuals, hot‐beds of ambition, self‐seeking and rotten beliefs in authority
                    etc. That means, we see in them agents of reaction to keep the people in
                    continued ignorance of their own interests.</p>
                <p>We do not therefore discourage workingmen from organisation, but such
                    organisations could only be free groups of men and women with the same aims for
                    identical purposes, disbanding when the object in view is achieved.</p>
                <p>This brings us to the question of the advisability of Anarchists to join Trade
                    Unions, not the question of the membership of Unions which may be a necessity
                    for them as the case stands, but the question of propaganda in them. Anarchists
                    do not wish to isolate themselves and Unions may be useful as a place to meet
                    their fellow workers. But whether Unions should be formed by Anarchists is
                    entirely dependent on the particular case. For we do not consider Trades
                    Unionism as at present constituted as a serious force to overthrow the system,
                    but only as a means to get a little better provision for the workers under the
                    present conditions. Therefore they cannot be carried on without dealing with
                    immediate so‐called practical questions, which are never settled without
                    compromises, as all members are not Anarchists.</p>
                <p>In Unions the General Strike might form a proper subject to start the propaganda,
                    and such a strike, though in itself not effective as a remedy, would probably
                    bring about revolutionary situations which would advance the march of events in
                    an unprecedented way. To<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7013-011"></pb> speak plainly, we
                    advocate the General Strike as a means to set the ball rolling: who knows
                    whether it may not lead to the Social Revolution, which we all desire as the
                    only thing that can help us.</p>
                <p>The Social Revolution, as we conceive it, would consist in the paralysation of
                    all existing authoritarian institutions and organisations, the prevention of new
                    organisations of this character, the expropriation of the present exploiters of
                    labor, and in the rearrangement of relations between men on the basis of
                    voluntary agreements. This will appear to some to be rather a large program, but
                    logical thinking will convince them of the fact that every one of these points
                    is the necessary consequence of the others, and that they can only be carried
                    out altogether, or not at all. For what is really impracticable are not full
                    measures, but those half‐hearted measures—so‐called reforms—which pretend to do
                    away with a part of the existing misery, whilst the root remains intact and
                    makes the whole reform futile and useless.</p>
                <p>These then are our means of propaganda, and we trust they are manifold enough to
                    allow everybody full scope for his energies who chooses his place amongst us.
                    The leading idea of our propaganda must always be defiance and destruction of
                    the principle of authority in all its forms and disguises—full scope for
                    freedom, the basis and condition of all human development and progress.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, let us consider briefly the remedies proposed by the other
                    parties—useless as they are, as the ever‐increasing misery around us abundantly
                    shows.</p>
                <p>The State Socialist parties, apart from a few Socialists pure and simple who, if
                    they were true to the foundations of their opinions, would come over to us, have
                    of late become entirely parties for advocating political action. They believe in
                    sending the right man to Parliament, and we have the choice between the chosen
                    of the I.L.P., of the Fabians, and of the S.D.F. We do not consider their minor
                    differences: what is the principle of political action worth?—is the question we
                    ask. It is intended to bring pressure on the governing classes to effect social
                    changes. We maintain that no amount of pressure exercised through political
                    action can bring about these social changes. Some palliatives may be adopted,
                    but the system will continue to exist; for these labor parties make the workers
                    believe in constitutional means, in the leadership and worship of men; in short,
                    they will destroy their self‐reliance and self‐respect, and do for them that
                    which religion does—make them expect everything from others, nothing from
                    themselves. The history of the labor movement in Europe and America shows the
                    greater these parties become the less advanced their leaders grow and<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7013-012"></pb> the less is achieved by these bulky, cast‐iron
                    organisations with no room for freedom left in them.</p>
                <p>We have no more belief in Trades Unions as such than in political action, yet we
                    prefer those Unionists, who rely upon their own action to those who cry for
                    State help. Our propaganda might sometimes use this question as a starting
                    point.</p>
                <p>The Co‐operative movement can only benefit a few who remain unnoticed among the
                    general misery. Productive Co‐operation on a large scale would have to compete
                    with capitalism, which ruthlessly cuts down wages and gets a supply of cheap
                    labor from the unemployed. Co‐operators would have to work on similar lines,
                    those of the greatest possible exploitation of labor and that will be no remedy
                    for the needs of labor, or they would be crushed by the capitalist competition,
                    being in fact the first victims of a commercial crisis. Thus on a large scale
                    Co‐operation is impracticable, and those who take part in it in its present form
                    are only too often estranged from the general labor movement. So we consider
                    Co‐operators as workers who are no essential factor in the coming struggle.</p>
                <p>The meanest and most repulsive “friends” of the workers are the Teetotalers,
                    Malthusianists, and advocates of thrift and saving, who propound each his
                    particular crochet as an infallible remedy for poverty. They want the workers to
                    give up the small mites of, however adulterated and paltry, pleasure and
                    enjoyment that are left to them. “Hypocrisy is the compliment vice pays to
                    virtue,” the proverb says, and the other parties make at any rate promises of
                    better things, but these want to make life still more dreary and cheerless.
                    Economically they are utterly wrong. If all were content to live as Coolies do,
                    on a handful of rice per day, wages would be lowered by competition down to the
                    level of Coolie wages—a few pence per day. We want the standard of the workers’
                    living raised, not lowered, and all the things to which these “friends” object
                    belong to a real, full, human life.</p>
                <p>We need not dwell on all the cranks who have cut and dried remedies like the Free
                    Currency advocates, who ignore the principle of every society with private
                    property: “No property, no credit.” To be benefited by money cheques, it would
                    be necessary to possess some kind of portable or realisable property to be given
                    in exchange for the cheques or to have them secured on. Nothing would be altered
                    by them, they could simply perpetuate the worst evils of the present system in a
                    more aggravated form. To the worker who has no property but his labor to dispose
                    of, in times when work is slack and labor therefore not in demand, they would
                    offer no resource whatever, and he would still be obliged to suffer and to
                    starve. To make the remedy<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7013-013"></pb> proportionate to the
                    evil proposed to be cured, it would be requisite to abolish all private property
                    and make the land and all it contains, together with all the implements of
                    production, common property—that is, to introduce Communism, where money and
                    money cheques will become equally useless.</p>
                <p>As you will have seen, Anarchism does not preach anything contrary to the
                    principles which have always inspired men to strive for freedom and right. It
                    would indeed be absurd to try and impose something new upon mankind. No!
                    Anarchism is nothing but the <choice>
                        <corr>full</corr>
                        <sic>foll</sic>
                    </choice> acknowledgment of the realisation of the principle that freedom is at
                    the root of sound natural development. Nature knows no outside laws, no external
                    powers, and only follows her own inward forces of attraction or repulsion.
                    Everything is the result of the existing forces and tendencies, and this result
                    becomes again in turn the cause of the next thing following. In its childhood,
                    humanity suffered from ignorance of this cause, and suffers still by being
                    trodden under the heel of imaginary celestial and human authority (both arising
                    from the same sources—ignorance and the fear of the unknown). All progress has
                    been made by fighting and defying authority. Great men in history—men who have
                    done real work, that is, work useful for the progress of the human race by
                    breaking and defying laws and regulations apparently made for everlasting
                    time—showed mankind new roads, opened new ground. These were rebels, and the
                    last in this series—those who wish not only to be free themselves but who saw
                    that which before them men did not see so clearly, that to be free ourselves we
                    must be surrounded by free men; that the slavery of the meanest human being is
                    our own slavery. Those last rebels for freedom and progress are the Anarchists
                    of all countries, and in solidarity with them we appeal to you.</p>

                    struggle against authority and exploitation, for freedom and happiness for
