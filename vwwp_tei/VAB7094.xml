                <l><hi>YES</hi>, rosebud sister, smiling into bloom</l>
                <l>Beneath the sunshine of a happy love,</l>
                <l>I hold with you there is indeed no shame</l>
                <l>To any womanâsoul to say âI love;â</l>
                <l>But rather is she perfected therein,</l>
                <l>And sets a crown upon her womanhood,</l>
                <l>And is more high that she hath humbled herâ</l>
                <l>As they who kneel upon raised altarâsteps.</l>
                <l>You must not think because I have no smiles</l>
                <l>More warm than moonbeams on a frosty night,</l>
                <l>To thank the flattery of loveâsick prayers,</l>
                <l>I set my glory in a selfâfilled heart.</l>
                <l>Nor, Amy, do I doubt that Philip Leigh</l>
                <l>Is threefold worthy of the trust he seeksâ</l>
                <l>He must be somewhat, dearest, since you hold</l>
                <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7094-003"/>
                <l>Him only second to your peerless Frank:</l>
                <l>I prize him; but, sweet pleader, you must give</l>
                <l>Your client no delusive hopes from me.</l>
                <l>Indeed, I do not love him; and I think</l>
                <l>That he and you, as I, would hold it sin</l>
                <l>Were I to deck me with the name of wife,</l>
                <l>Being no wife in heart, or else not his.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">What, Amy, you can read my riddle now</l>
                <l>By the heart wisdom of your newâlearned lore?</l>
                <l>Last week you were to me a little child,</l>
                <l>And we were parted off by all the years</l>
                <l>That mark sixteen from graver twentyâtwo;</l>
                <l>Now you are womaned by your day of love,</l>
                <l>Too early were it not so very fair,</l>
                <l>And you can read me with a wakened sense,</l>
                <l>And with an equal eye feel into mine.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">Well, little sister, I will tell you all,</l>
                <l>Or rather, I will tell you but the end,</l>
                <l>And you must image for yourself the restâ</l>
                <l>The first low whispers, and the happy dread,</l>
                <l>The tremulous happy dread of the waked heart</l>
                <l>First following them into a fairy world;</l>
                <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7094-004"/>
                <l>The first long looks from eyes all sad with love;</l>
                <l>The first dear silences; the first sweet tears</l>
                <l>That tremble on the cheek for too much joy;</l>
                <l>The hours that seemed too full of happiness,</l>
                <l>Hours almost burdened with their happiness.</l>
                <l>I know that they are lying in my heart,</l>
                <l>As farâoff hillâtops float upon a stream,</l>
                <l>Though weary leagues stretch wide from it to them:</l>
                <l>I could recall them, even as you recall</l>
                <l>The words that were your music but this morn,</l>
                <l>But that such dreaming of a faded dream</l>
                <l>Were too unwise, and in its end must leave me</l>
                <l>Like one who, wandering on a wintry shore,</l>
                <l>Growing to feel no chillness in the blast,</l>
                <l>And learning in frostâsparkles to see beauty,</l>
                <l>Should wile himself a moment by a spell</l>
                <l>To some bright land all rich with summer breath,</l>
                <l>And, backwards thrown again, should find the snows</l>
                <l>A windingâsheet to shroud his unnerved frame.</l>

                <l>(For when our brother married Ellen Hope,</l>

                <l>You never knew himâWalter Hope I meanâ</l>
                <l>He went abroad ere the next winter came,</l>
                <l>And you have hardly heard me speak of him;</l>
                <l>But he it wasâI think he meant no wrongâ</l>
                <l>You must not blame too much, for it may be</l>
                <l>His fault in the telling takes a harsher shape</l>
                <l>Than you would judge it had you seen the whole.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">You know our brother married in the spring,</l>
                <l>The early spring, while yet the buds were hard;</l>
                <l>But I, they would not let me go, I stayed</l>
                <l>And saw the summer flush light up the earth,</l>
                <l>And plucked June roses still at Hopetoun Hall.</l>
                <l>His mother answered me, wheneâer I spake</l>
                <l>Of home, âShe would not have me leave her yet,</l>
                <l>Since I must fill her stolen Ellenâs place</l>
                <l>And be her daughter for a while at least,</l>
                <l>If not for always;â and Alice and sweet Clare</l>
                <l>Would weep and call me cruel while they smiled,</l>
                <l>âWhat need had I,â they said, âto leave their love?</l>
                <l>Not for my brotherâhe had Ellen now;</l>
                <l>Nor little Amyâshe was safe at school:</l>
                <l>What need that they should ever lose me now?â</l>

                <l>And Walterâ</l>

                <l>(For Clare and Alice had strolled out of sight,</l>
                <l>Hunting for ferns that grew in the wide caves</l>

                <l>But we sat dreamâeyed, listening to the sea,</l>
                <l>Till Walter uttered slowly, âMargaret!â</l>
                <l>How did he speak my name, the name he loved,</l>
                <l>That there shot through me that strange warning pang</l>
                <l>Of sorrowâknowledge suddenly arousedâ</l>
                <l>As when a mother, waking in the night,</l>
                <l>Hears one windâsigh wail sadder than the rest,</l>
                <l>And knows that, far away, her sailor son</l>
                <l>Breathes his long deathâgasp in the seething waves,</l>
                <l>Whose next weekâs coming was the happy thought</l>
                <l>That smiled upon her lips in her first sleep?</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">I starting as he spoke, two quiet tears,</l>
                <pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7094-007"/>
                <l>That in my trance of sad sweet sunset thoughts</l>
                <l>Had lurked among the lashes, broke their bounds,</l>
                <l>And touched my cheeks. âO Margaret, not tears!</l>
                <l>You do not know what pain they stir in me,</l>
                <l>Dreading that I some day might make you weep;</l>
                <l>But surely now I do not make you weep?â</l>
                <l>And I said, smiling, âThough you made me weep,</l>
                <l>There were no harm; for they were pleasant tears,</l>
                <l>And I should thank you for them.â But he sighed</l>
                <l>In an unwilling murmur, as of one</l>
                <l>Who loathes his forcedâout words, âI ought to wish</l>
                <l>No power to cost you sweet or bitter tears.â</l>
                <l>Then I rose angered, thinking that he spoke</l>
                <l>The momentâs rudeness of some idle pique</l>
                <l>Unworthy earnest love, and would have gone</l>
                <l>Wordlessâyet went not; for he took my hand,</l>
                <l>And, when I turned to look his boldness down</l>
                <l>With scornful eyes, his met me with such gaze</l>
                <l>Of mournful pleadings mild with loveârebukes,</l>
                <l>That mine fell shamed before it while he spoke:</l>
                <l>âO my proud Margaret, bear with me a while,</l>
                <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7094-008"/>
                <l>Until I give you meaning for my words,</l>
                <l>And do not crush me wholly with your scorn;</l>
                <l>But let me speak, you sitting by my side;</l>
                <l>And let me hold your hand, that I may feel,</l>
                <l>This first time it has lain within my clasp,</l>
                <l>Some of the noble strength that warms your nature</l>
                <l>Pulse through me from its touch.â</l>
                <l>And I obeyed,</l>
                <l>And waited for some blow I felt at hand.</l>
                <l>But he spoke of the reddening sunset clouds,</l>
                <l>And the calm clearness of the wideâbayed sea;</l>
                <l>Till I, impatient, said, âBut I stay here</l>
                <l>Because you have some sterner word to speakâ</l>
                <l><emph>That</emph> I would hear.â</l>
                <l>âYes; I will tell you all.</l>
                <l>But I would waitâwould waitâO Margaret,</l>
                <l>You will not spurn me in your haughty truth?</l>
                <l>Yet even that were something like a hopeâ</l>
                <l>My hope for you is worse despair for me.</l>
                <l>If you and I chased down a sudden slope</l>
                <l>That broke off sharply in a black abyss,</l>
                <l>And you stood highest, then my warning voice</l>
                <pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7094-009"/>
                <l>Might timely check your course, though not my own;</l>
                <l>So hear me, and despise me, Margaret.â</l>
                <l>âVague, vague,â I said; âand I would hear full truth.</l>
                <l>Walter, it is my due to hear the truth.â</l>
                <l>âWait, it is sorrowâââTherefore I would hear.â</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">And silence came between us for a while;</l>
                <l>Till he, not looking at me, tore his words</l>
                <l>Out from unwilling depths, and dashed at onceâ</l>
                <l>Like one who fears to linger, lest he lose</l>
                <l>His longâsought courage in a mist of doubtsâ</l>
                <l>Into his cruel theme.</l>
                <l>âLast year I came</l>
                <l>To spend in study here two quiet months.</l>
                <l>My mother and the girls had gone abroad;</l>
                <l>But I delayed to join them, having formed</l>
                <l>A plan to hive much learning here alone.</l>
                <l>And all a summer fortnight saw me live,</l>
                <l>As one unknowing of an outer world,</l>
                <l>Only to look on books, to think of books,</l>
                <l>To walk with books, to dream at night of books;</l>
                <l>Until my head grew dizzy with its lore,</l>
                <pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7094-010"/>
                <l>And I, all wearied with my over zeal,</l>
                <l>Lapsed sudden into languid summer moods,</l>
                <l>With no fixed bent except to have no bent,</l>
                <l>And full of lazy longings all unshaped.</l>
                <l>And so I seemed to dream, and was not glad,</l>
                <l>Nor yet unhappy, but all vaguely moved,</l>
                <l>And knew not what I would,âas though I waited</l>
                <l>Some change to bring me back my former self</l>
                <l>Or wake new being in me. Then one morn</l>
                <l>I said, âNow what is this? I lose the sense</l>
                <l>Of happy sunshine, mellow August hours,</l>
                <l>And ponder, mindless, over shapes of words,</l>
                <l>That mark no meaning to my torpid thought;</l>
                <l>And so the days are barren, and the nights</l>
                <l>Are fevered with unrest, and the sweet pride</l>
                <l>Of summerâgloried earth is lost to me.</l>
                <l>Iâll toil no more, lest I grow dead at heart.â</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âSo, rod in hand, I loitered idly forth,</l>
                <l>And followed down a little leaping stream,</l>
                <l>In all its windings, through the beechen grove,</l>
                <l>And past the slopes of wheat, and through our valley,</l>
                <l>Till it had led me many a crooked mile;</l>
                <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7094-011"/>
                <l>And when the sunset reddened on our woods,</l>
                <l>I came upon a pathway fringed with ferns,</l>
                <l>That led through brushwood to a little dell,</l>
                <l>All dreamy with its stillness âmid the hills.</l>
                <l>Through sundered crags, half clothed with tangled growth,</l>
                <l>My brook had slipped, and, with a little fall,</l>
                <l>Plashed lightly down, and stole before me there,</l>
                <l>A silver serpent, flashing back the beams</l>
                <l>That slanted eastward from the lingering sun.</l>
                <l>A knotted bridge, its rail all ivyâhung</l>
                <l>And ivyâfettered to a solemn elm,</l>
                <l>Led, low above the water, to a door</l>
                <l>Set in a grassâgrown brambleâtrailing wall,</l>
                <l>And shadowed by a feathery mountainâash,</l>
                <l>Scarlet with fiery clusters on its boughs;</l>
                <l>And, ranged behind, five spreading sycamores</l>
                <l>Made pleasant darkness on the brook, and screened</l>
                <l>All sign of home or life, save one smoke wreath,</l>
                <l>That, curling high, betrayed the hidden hearth.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">ââAnd now,â I said, âif I were but some prince,</l>

                <l>To seek my fairy fortune, here might wait</l>

                <l>Or long enchantment to be burst by love.</l>
                <l>But, woe is me, I am a common man,</l>
                <l>Fallen on common days, and I shall find</l>

                <l>That pass more oaths than Hâs; a trim wife,</l>
                <l>With stiff false curls, worn for her evening best;</l>
                <l>A troop of flatânosed brats; a greasy maid,</l>
                <l>Her broad pink cheeks, set round with pinker bows,</l>
                <l>Stretched with a vacant grin of wonderment</l>

                <l>A lady it might be, but with a touch</l>
                <l>Of overâfineness something underbredâ</l>
                <l>And what I had to ask was quickly told,</l>
                <l>A homeward road less devious than my brook</l>
                <l>Had brought me there by. âWell,â she said, âmy way</l>
                <l>Had been a winding one; she need but show</l>
                <l>A lane that led into the common highway,</l>
                <l>And I should have scarce five straight miles to go,</l>
                <l>And be at Hopetoun.â</l>
                <l>âIt was clear enough;</l>
                <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7094-015"/>
                <l>And yet I lingered, asking all once more,</l>
                <l>In hopes to see what little bird had sung,</l>
                <l>And trying to link converse with the dame,</l>
                <l>Who gave me little help till some chance word</l>
                <l>Told who I was, and then her hardâlined face</l>
                <l>Was wreathed to one great network by her smiles,</l>
                <l>The while she prayed Iâd rest me there, and called,</l>
                <l>With eager voice, âCome, Lilian.â</l>
                <l>âAnd she came,</l>
                <l>The wild dove Lilian with soft hazel eyes;</l>
                <l>And I remained that evening; and the moon</l>
                <l>Was high and yellow when it lit me home.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âHow shall I tell you, stately Margaret?</l>
                <l>I linger with my story to delay</l>
                <l>The bitter truth. Yet hear it. I <emph>must</emph> speak.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âThrough all that night a voice rang in my ears,</l>
                <l>âOh, love me! love me!â and soft hazel eyes</l>
                <l>Looked âlove me, love meââthrough that summer night,</l>
                <l>And through the day, and through the after night,</l>
                <l>And through the day and through the night again.</l>
                <l>And when the third day came, I once more passed</l>
                <l>Along the laurel walk towards her door.</l>
                <pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7094-016"/>
                <l rend="ti-1">âWe talked alone together: then I said,</l>
                <l>âThrough these three nights and days I heard and heard</l>
                <l>A seaâmaid singing, from some farâoff shore,</l>
                <l>âOh, love me! love me!â and her singing is</l>
                <l>Like yours, her eyes like yours. Oh, do you think</l>
                <l>That she would love me for my gift of love?â</l>
                <l>And on that moment love looked from her eyes,</l>
                <l>And from that moment love was ever there.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âAnd soon I grew to be a daily guestâ</l>
                <l>Her mother chid me when I doubted welcome;</l>
                <l>And Lilian Gray would wander out with meâ</l>
                <l>Her mother said sheâd trust me, but none else,</l>
                <l>To be her guardianâand our days would pass</l>
                <l>In happy loveâtalk, we two and the brook.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âYet at the first, although I thought I loved,</l>
                <l>I knew at heart I scarcely loved enoughâ</l>
                <l>You snatch away your hand? Well, it is just;</l>
                <l>And yet you might have left it to me still</l>
                <l>A little while; Margaret, a little while!</l>
                <l>Be merciful.â</l>
                <l>And so I gave it him</l>
                <pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7094-017"/>
                <l>Again in silence.</l>
                <l>He spoke on, âI grew</l>
                <l>To love her dearly in all truth. I think,</l>
                <l>Though I have learned since then a different love</l>
                <l>And deeper, yet I have scarce loved her less,</l>
                <l>Loving another more; and I so loved</l>
                <l>As one should love her whom he seeks for wife.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âBut when my father died he prayed of me</l>
                <l>Never to vex my mother with a bride</l>
                <l>Whom she was loath to welcome, and I knew</l>
                <l>That she would sorrow at my lowly choice;</l>
                <l>And so I planned that she should see her first,</l>
                <l>Not knowing of my love, and so, clearâeyed,</l>
                <l>Know her a lady in her simple grace,</l>
                <l>And come to call her daughter without pain.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âBut scarce a lady born is Lilian Gray:</l>
                <l>Her father was the pastor, selfâelect,</l>
                <l>Of a small flock that found the Churchâs fold</l>
                <l>Too narrow for their range, who, having gift</l>
                <l>To win his hearersâ hearts by eloquence,</l>
                <l>Had, half unknowing, won himself a wife</l>
                <l>Of higher birth than his and some small dower.</l>
                <pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7094-018"/>
                <l>And when he died his widow, little fain</l>
                <l>To live âmong kin who held her less than they,</l>
                <l>Had, with her Lilian, sought out other home,</l>
                <l>And often changed; until a year before,</l>
                <l>They sheltered in the little hillâset nook</l>
                <l>Where I had found them. There they lived in calm,</l>
                <l>And had not many friends, for Mistress Gray</l>
                <l>Would mix among her gossip a false tone</l>
                <l>That jarred upon her puzzled neighboursâ ears,</l>
                <l>And with her stories of her gentle kin</l>
                <l>And studied casual mention of great names</l>
                <l>Vex themâ<emph>me</emph> more, bringing me sense of shame</l>
                <l>Through her, but vexing chiefly by the thought</l>
                <l>How all my motherâs quiet dignity</l>
                <l>And keenâedged sense of fitness and of grace</l>
                <l>Would shrink revolted when she met with her,</l>
                <l>My Lilianâs, who should be my mother too.</l>
                <l>Therefore I lingered, waiting some kind chance</l>
                <l>To seize and bring my mother face to face</l>
                <l>With Lilian only, ere she dreamed of aught</l>
                <l>To make her see her with unwilling eyes.</l>
                <l>I should have been more bold, perhaps; and yet</l>
                <pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7094-019"/>
                <l>I did it for the best.</l>
                <l>âThen sudden came</l>
                <l>The crimsoning autumn passing through the woods,</l>
                <l>And broke my summer dream. And I went back</l>
                <l>To end my college days, and had not done</l>
                <l>That which I longed to do, and crowned our love</l>
                <l>With happy promise by a plighted troth.</l>
                <l>But Lilian Gray was trustful in my faith,</l>
                <l>And I in hers.</l>
                <l>âNot oft, but now and thenâ</l>
                <l>Her mother sanctioned itâsweet letters came.</l>
                <l>Her very self in them, and gladdened me,</l>
                <l>Deepening by her pure faith my faith in her.</l>
                <l>And, as my love grew prouder, I grew bold</l>
                <l>And set it in my heart that, when I came</l>
                <l>Again to Hopetoun, Lilian should be known</l>
                <l>To all who loved me she whom I loved most.</l>
                <l>But even thenâthe weeks were drawing near</l>
                <l>To my returnâthere came an undertone</l>
                <l>Of vexing meaning through her words, not like</l>
                <l>Her own, light hints of âoverâtrustfulness,â</l>
                <l>And âwasted love that women gave to men,â</l>
                <pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7094-020"/>
                <l>And that they âturned from those who loved them best</l>
                <l>To others colder, making life a blank.â</l>
                <l>I thought I heard through them her motherâs turns</l>
                <l>Of threadbare platitudes. Then there would be</l>
                <l>Mention, as though in jest, of a new friend</l>
                <l>Whose talk to her was over sweet with praise;</l>
                <l>âBut he was kind,â âher mother liked him well,â</l>
                <l>âThe richest farmer in ten parishes,</l>
                <l>And gently bred.â</l>
                <l>âAnd yet through all I felt,</l>
                <l>Though I was troubled at her altered style,</l>
                <l>That it was forced from an unwilling pen;</l>
                <l>And ever there would come some simple touch</l>
                <l>Of the old faith, that spoke through all my heart.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âYou scarce will blame me, Margaret, that my pride,</l>
                <l>Was waked within me and I would not stoop</l>
                <l>To clear me from a hinted blame, nor show</l>
                <l>I felt the change; but, thinking âwe meet soon,</l>
                <l>And all will then be shown,â made cold replies:</l>
                <l>Moreover, had I known what now I know,</l>
                <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7094-021"/>
                <l>Then only vaguely guessed, her motherâs scheme</l>
                <l>To sting me into passion with the fear</l>
                <l>Of losing Lilian by my much delay,</l>
                <l>I had just cause for anger: for should she</l>
                <l>Have yielded to it? though indeed she pleaded,</l>
                <l>With weeping pleaded her belief in me.</l>
                <l>But yet she did it. Was she free from blame?</l>
                <l>Yet, ah, my Lilian! she has suffered much;</l>
                <l>And Iâand IâOh had she not set strife</l>
                <l>Between us by that yielding! had the day</l>
                <l>Not dawned that led me to her cottage first!</l>
                <l>Or had I died before I saw you, Margaret!</l>
                <l>Oh! I to find myself dishonoured, false,</l>
                <l>Torn by two loves, unlike, yet each a crime,</l>
                <l>Being not single! Oh! to be so plunged</l>
                <l>Into dishonour, that there is for me</l>
                <l>No right unfouled with wrong, no way to truth</l>
                <l>But through a treachery! Which way to follow?</l>
                <l>Good heavens! both ways disgraced!â</l>
                <l>Then he made pause;</l>
                <l>And silence was between us like to death.</l>
                <l>I could not speak. Amy, I think I tell you</l>

                <l>Thus echoâlike almost his very words;</l>
                <l>Could I forget them? for they are the bridge</l>
                <l>Between one who was happy, with a name</l>
                <l>Like mine, a face like mine, one Margaret</l>
                <l>Glad and well loved who comes to me in dreams,</l>

                <l>Could I forget them, think you? for they rang</l>
                <l>Low in my ears, like an unceasing knell,</l>
                <l>Long, long, so long. Yet, as I heard them come,</l>

                <l>To which I listened with a deadened sense,</l>
                <l>As conscious of their import but no more,</l>
                <l>Having no power to think.</l>
                <l>And all the whileâ</l>
                <l>You scarce would think it, dearestâI had watched</l>
                <l>The changing flushes in the sky, the lights</l>
                <l>That woke and died upon the quiet sea,</l>
                <l>The deepening shadows on the sloping woods,</l>
                <l>With clear observance, as of one whose thoughts</l>
                <l>Chimed with the sunset beauty, and had heard</l>
                <l>Each whisperâvoice of eve, each little plash</l>

                <l>And in the silence then I saw the clouds,</l>

                <l>And yet I did not move, but waited still</l>
                <l>And wordless, till he spoke. I think I could</l>

                <l>Therefore I would not tell my purpose then,</l>
                <l>Thinking, âtoâmorrow will make all things clear;â</l>
                <l>And I replied, âWell, it may be, some day</l>
                <l>Weâll speak of this again. <emph>Now</emph> let it pass;</l>
                <l>And trust me, mother, you shall learn from me</l>
                <l>If I pledge faith to her or any else.â</l>
                <l>So was she fain to leave it, though I knew</l>
                <l>Her heart was heavy in her for my sake,</l>
                <l>And she was weeping when I kissed her forehead</l>
                <l>And left her to her saddened rest. And I</l>
                <l>Through the long night was torn with many fears.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âThe hour was cadenced from the village church,</l>
                <l>That I had fixed to be at Lilianâs home,</l>
                <l>And I was there, but sheâher mother said,</l>
                <l>She did but wander by the frozen brook</l>
                <l>While the noon sun was bright, she would come soon.</l>
                <l>And then she talked, and talked, and wound along</l>
                <l>A web of words all latticed to one point;</l>
                <l>âLilian,â she said, âwas pale and sometimes sad,</l>
                <l>Though young Hugh Pearce at times could make her laughâ</l>
                <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7094-026"/>
                <l>Hugh Pearce came oftenâwell, she could not say</l>
                <l>What yet might come of it, although, indeed,</l>
                <l>Her daughter did but count him as a friendâ</l>
                <l>Lilian was very young, she had not learned</l>
                <l>To know how men could love with half a heart</l>
                <l>And leave the love they took such pains to win;</l>
                <l>She had her fancies: still she had such pride</l>
                <l>As every girl with gentle blood should have,</l>
                <l>And no mock lover, were he faint or false,</l>
                <l>Could dazzle her for ever to all worth</l>
                <l>In truer suitorâLilian could love well,</l>
                <l>Perhaps too well, âtwas not for her to sayâ</l>
                <l>âYet love words were not allâfor her own part</l>
                <l>She thought young Pearce a very fitting matchâ</l>
                <l>Well, time would shew.â</l>
                <l>âThus she meandered on,</l>
                <l>While I, much inly chafed, made vague replies,</l>
                <l>As though her talk had been of gossip news</l>
                <l>Wherein I had no part, and eager watched</l>
                <l>Through the low casement oâer the whitened dell</l>
                <l>For Lilianâs coming. All the while I heard</l>
                <l>That âLove me, love me,â echo from the eve</l>
                <pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7094-027"/>
                <l>When first we met.</l>
                <l>âThrough the bared trees I saw her</l>
                <l>Crossing the rustic bridgeâand not alone!</l>
                <l>They came together to the leafless ash,</l>
                <l>Yet when she passed from out the hidden walk</l>
                <l>Behind the laurel screen, he was not there.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âI could have killed that manânay, almost her,</l>
                <l>To see those dovelike eyes, tender with tears,</l>
                <l>Look into mine so full of love and trust,</l>
                <l>And think they looked a lie, a shameless lie!</l>
                <l>I longed that looks could slay, then had I died</l>
                <l>And, dying, slain her with the scorn in mine.</l>
                <l>The scorn?âI looked in scorn, I spoke in scorn,</l>
                <l>But was there aught but maddened love in me?</l>
                <l>I would have struck the man that called her false,</l>
                <l>Though she showed doubly false. I took the hand</l>
                <l>She offered, with loose hold. âThough I have come,â</l>
                <l>I said, âto greet you after many months,</l>
                <l>I trust you have not left your morning walk</l>
                <l>Too early for my sake. âTwould be too much</l>
                <l>If I should keep you longer from your friend;</l>
                <l>I grieve that I have parted you thus long.â</l>
                <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7094-028"/>
                <l>And so I turned to go. Yet ere I went</l>
                <l>A sudden tempest rushed on me and tore</l>
                <l>My passion from my heart.</l>
                <l>ââAnd now,â I said,</l>

                <l>You could play lightly a wellâbalanced game,</l>

                <l>Yet, though he love to blindness till he die,</l>
                <l>He loves not more than I, it may be less.</l>
                <l>And now, farewell for ever, Lilian Gray!</l>
                <l>I came this morn, not having lost all trust</l>

                <l>To claim a motherâs love from mine for you:</l>

                <l>On your own lips. And know you do such sin</l>
                <l>As shames your womanânature, being won</l>
                <l>To other wooing, you that <emph>should</emph> be mineâ</l>
                <l><emph>Are</emph> mine in Heavenâs truth, as I am yours,</l>

                <l rend="ti-1">âAnd thus I left her, though I heard her cry,</l>
                <l>Like a faint deathâwail from a helpless child,</l>
                <l>A cry for mercy, for a momentâs grace;</l>
                <l>And though her motherâs voice rang shrill, behind</l>

                <l>All over, then! and yet no other changeâ</l>
                <l>It seems a dream, but such mad ghastly dreaming</l>
                <l>As is despair? I think my agony,</l>
                <l>My numb mazed agony, was such as his;</l>
                <l>And now I know why the plagueâstruck went mad,</l>

                <l>And they through evil eyes see all things ill.</l>
                <l>Scarce knowing it, I waked you. Then you seemed</l>
                <l>To love me. Yet for long I feared your love,</l>
                <l>It was as though a shadow stood between,</l>
                <l>Not seen and scarcely felt, and through your words,</l>
                <l>Despite my faith, the echo of a doubt</l>
                <l>Came to me though I would not think it came.</l>

                <l>He poured his bootless prayers in her vexed ears,</l>
                <l>In the fond hope that, though she loved not him,</l>
                <l>She might be something guarded by the thought</l>
                <l>Of his true worship from a falser suit.</l>
                <l>But she, in anxious haste, seemed scarce to hear,</l>
                <l>Yet left him lorn of hope by her few words.</l>
                <l>And so they parted sadly at the gate</l>
                <l>Where I had seen them.</l>
                <l>âBut he loved her still;</l>
                <l>And when he heard of other bride for me,</l>
                <l>He sought again to win her, ignorant</l>

                <l>How he was adding to her other grief</l>
                <l>Her motherâs daily angers. Then at last</l>
                <l>She, sad and weary, having none to help,</l>
                <l>Knelt at his feet for mercy, weeping long,</l>
                <l>And shewed him all her heart.</l>
                <l>âAnd by his tale</l>
                <l>I knew that she, too timid, had not dared</l>
                <l>To tell the beldame what that morning passed</l>
                <l>âTwixt Hugh and her on the bridge, which had that dupe</l>
                <l>Of her own scheming written me instead</l>

                <l>My sudden rage might come from seeing them;</l>
                <l>But âStuff,â she said, âhe could not see,â and took</l>
                <l>Her crooked policyâhad I learned this</l>
                <l>It had been different. Yet I might have learned,</l>
                <l>For Lilian, in those lines I gave unread</l>
                <l>To the quick flames, had truly told me all.</l>
                <l>And now what could she think but that my rage</l>
                <l>Was hugged to gloze my falseness?</l>

                <l>How, too softâsouled to wrestle with despair,</l>

                <l>I might be angered, but, if we should meet,</l>
                <l>Then he must bear her prayer that I would come</l>
                <l>To her who loved me and speak one farewell,</l>

                <l>Like a dead maiden sculptured on a tomb:</l>
                <l>But when she saw me a quick colour burned</l>
                <l>On her worn face; with a wild burst of love</l>
                <l>She clung around my neck, âO mine again;</l>
                <l>Mine, only mineâhe has come back to me,</l>

                <l>One moment, then she dropped her moistened fringe,</l>
                <l>And dreamy murmured, âIt was true. My God,</l>

                <l>Let it go now. And what have I to judge?</l>
                <l>Is there a choice? Go back to Lilian Gray,</l>
                <l>She has been yours through all, and you are hers</l>

                <l rend="ti-1">âBut you,â he trembled, scarcely breathing âyou?â</l>

                <l>Yet watching oâer me, followed to the Hall.</l>
                <l>And Clare and Alice jested when we came</l>
                <l>At our delay, and I laughed back again</l>
                <l>Their merry taunts; but Walter, pale and stern,</l>

                <l>And I went next morn,</l>
                <l>And seemed like one who, in a troubled dream,</l>
                <l>Is driven without his will on a vague bent</l>
                <l>Towards some farâoff dimlyâshadowed dread,</l>
                <l>And, though he knows he dreams, must still dream on,</l>
                <l>And finds no rest and no return.</l>
                <l>I passed</l>
                <l>By the broad highway, white with choking dust</l>
                <l>That clogged my breath, on to the brierâgrown lane</l>
                <l>That twisted to the dell. A shudder ran</l>
                <l>Throughout my frame to feel myself so near;</l>
                <l>Yet I went onwards to the quiet dell,</l>
                <l>And found the lowârailed bridge, the solemn elm,</l>
                <l>And, resting, let the echo in my heart</l>
                <l>Speak Walterâs tale again, and did not weep,</l>
                <l>But prayed.</l>
                <l>I came upon her unawares,</l>
                <l>From out the laurel walk. In a halfâsleep</l>
                <l>She lay on a low couch beneath the shade</l>
                <l>Of a bending ash. Her folded robe of white,</l>
                <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7094-044"/>
                <l>Flecked with cool shadows, did not look more pure</l>
                <l>Than her pale face. Her waves of loosened hair</l>
                <l>(One parted tress had rippled to her waist)</l>
                <l>Were scarce more dark than mine, but the long lash</l>
                <l>That drooped deep shadow from it fringe was dark,</l>
                <l>Amy, as yours. A sweet sad smile had wreathed</l>
                <l>Around her pallid lips, and lingered there.</l>
                <l>âAh me!â I thought, âI know its father thought.â</l>
                <l>I looked on her with love, for she was fair,</l>
                <l>And doveâlike, as he called herâyes with love,</l>
                <l>For she was his, and loved him.</l>
                <l>While I stood,</l>
                <l>Fearing to wake her, learning her by heart,</l>
                <l>Sudden her startled eyes flashed fire in mine,</l>
                <l>And half she rose, and cried, âWhat, are you come</l>
                <l>To take him from me? Oh, I know you well;</l>
                <l>You are that Margaret Aubrey, whom I saw</l>
                <l>That hateful morn in church, when I had come</l>
                <l>To look on his new love. You haunt my dreams</l>
                <l>Worse than his angry eyes that would not see.</l>

                <l>âYes, I am Margaret Aubrey whom you saw,</l>
                <l>But not his love, his sister now, and yours;</l>
                <l>And, if I did you wrong, I knew it not.</l>
                <l>You will forgive me, Lilian?â</l>
                <l>Then her eyes</l>
                <l>Grew large with tears.</l>
                <l>âO Lilian Gray,â I said,</l>
                <l>âI would not hold him from you if I could.</l>
                <l>Let him be yours, and be you to him all</l>
                <l>I could have beenâand more, through your sweet self</l>
                <l>Less proud, as loving. I am come to woo</l>
                <l>Your pardon for him ere I say farewellâ</l>
                <l>For him your pardon, and some love for me.â</l>
                <l>Sudden she drew me to her, as I bent,</l>
                <l>And clung to me with sobs, and kissed my cheek,</l>
                <l>Like a fond child fresh from a vanished fear.</l>
                <l>âOh, I could kneel to you for your sweet words,</l>
                <l>Like a Godâs angel are you in your love.</l>
                <l>And oh,â she cried, âwill you, so proud, so fair,</l>

                <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7094-046"/>
                <l>Oh, then you have not loved him!â</l>

                <l>âI love him: but love often asks hard things;</l>
                <l>Sometimes, for love, to part with what we love.â</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">âAlas!â she wept, âthen you will die. Oh, best</l>
                <l>That I, so frail, should die, not you.â</l>
                <l>âYet no,â</l>
                <l>I said, âthrough grief I shall not die.</l>
                <l>And though I died yet that were not more sad</l>
                <l>Than a long life vexed with anotherâs pain,</l>
                <l>And shame of him I love. But I shall learn</l>
                <l>Godâs peace on earth, and know a quiet rest.</l>
                <l>And now farewell, dear Lilian; think sometimes</l>
                <l>Kindly of Margaret Aubrey.â</l>
                <l>As our hands</l>
                <l>Lay linked in a long clasp, I saw her start:</l>
                <l><emph>Her</emph> Walter stood by us!</l>
                <l>He took my handâ</l>
                <l>One moment only so we three were linked.</l>
                <l>Then I passed on and left them.</l>
                <l>And that week</l>
                <l>I looked my last on Hopetoun Hall. But first</l>
                <pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7094-047"/>
                <l>I, by long prayers, won back his motherâs smile,</l>
                <l>And gained her blessing for his marriage bond.</l>
                <l rend="ti-1">And they were wed ere long. But Lilian sleeps</l>
                <l>By the blue sea of sunny Italy,</l>
                <l>And on his fatherâs knee her pining boy</l>
                <l>Wails for his mother in a foreign tongue.</l>
                <l>She died two years ago. And once he wrote</l>
                <l>Some words that scared me with a painful doubt,</l>
                <l>Lest he should think to knot again the tie</l>
                <l>For ever broken. Could he seem to me</l>
                <l>Ever again the great one that I dreamed?</l>
                <l>I seem more great than he, and should I wed,</l>
                <l>Holding his nature less than mine?</l>
                <l>I wrote</l>
                <l>A calm rebuke, and left his sad reply</l>
                <l>Ever unanswered.</l>
                <l>Yet my heart aches much</l>
                <l>For him so lonely. And I, too, am lone.</l>
                <l>But black between us lies the burdened past.</l>
