            <p>The first four completed chapters of the Edward A. Rumely autobiography, "The Formative
                    Years, 1882-1900," were presented in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History</hi> in March, 1970. In these chapters Rumely included an account of the events and
                    activities of his early life and his recollection of pioneer days in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He noted the successful establishment of an agricultural implement business
                    by Grandfather Meinrad Rumely, the wholesome and positive atmosphere in the Rumely home which
                    stimulated his desire to learn, his early parochial education and attendance at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Notre Dame</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1898 to 1900, and finally his decision and plans to continue his education in
                    Europe.</p>
            <p>The next four completed chapters of the Rumely autobiography, "Student Days Abroad,
                    1900-1906," were published in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> in
                    September, 1970. Rumely here described his impressions, observations, and experiences as a medical
                    student in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Of particular interest were Rumely's comments on the work-study program at
                    Ruskin Hall; his discussion of the cooperative British labor movement; his mention of correspondence
                    with Leo Tolstoy on proper diet and educational philosophy; his discussion with Rudolph Diesel, the
                    inventor and design engineer; his close friendship with Gerhart von Schulze-Gaevernitz,
                    internationally known professor of economics and government; and his reflections on German culture,
                    education, and government. In the spring of 1906 Rumely received an M.D. degree <hi rend="i">magna
                        cum laude</hi> and completed the requirements for a degree in economics at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Freiburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Rumely held a part time job at the <hi rend="i">Licht und Luft Heilandstalt</hi> (Light
                    and Air Sanitarium). One of the patients there was Julius G. Gutermann who visited the sanitarium
                    twice a week for treatment of psoriasis. A rapport developed between Gutermann and the young medical
                    student; their association proved exceptionally rewarding and developed into a lifetime friendship.
                    Rumely became a frequent weekend guest at the Villa Orehta, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In the eight years following his graduation from Freiburg Rumely saw the fulfillment of two of his
                    dreams: the building of Interlaken School for Boys and the development of the Rumely OilPull farm

                    </placeName> Years, 1906-1914," chapters 12-15 in the autobiography, is primarily concerned
                    with these two endeavors. The author describes his return to the serenity of <placeName>

                    comfortable medical practice and raise a family, but not Rumely. As he indicates in the installment
                    which follows, Rumely practiced medicine in <placeName>

                    establishing a school where he could experiment with progressive educational methods.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1907 Rumely located a suitable site in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the former private estate of S. B. Collins, to begin his boys' school. He
                    rented the estate property which included a half mile of shore line on <geogName>Clear
                    Lake</geogName>, a spacious three story brick building with thirty-five rooms and a large basement
                    adaptable for shop classes, a two story barn, and an ice house.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The school
                    opened in September, 1907, with thirteen students.</p>
            <p>Rumely made his school a model institution. He integrated the more traditional classroom subjects
                    with shop and farm activities and created an environment conducive to learning. Rumely hoped to
                    influence the entire American public school system, which he regarded as wholly inadequate for a
                    world in flux. He felt that unless innovative <list type="footnotes">

            <p>To expand Interlaken to accommodate between 125 and 150 boys Rumely needed capital. Therefore, the

                    grandfather's agricultural implement business, the M. Rumely Company. Edward assumed
                    direction of the company shortly after his return to <placeName>

                    innovation, organization, management, and salesmanship to the business. He saw the need for the
                    development of a heavy duty traction engine that would use a fuel such as kerosene for combustion.
                    Therefore, he persuaded John Alstyne Secor, inventor of a kerosene burning engine, to join the
                    corporation's engineering department. Secor came to <placeName>

            <p>It was while I was studying medicine at <placeName>

                    </placeName> and acting as sort of counsellor-companion for the Guetermann boys that my ideas about
                    the school I would found began to take expressive shape. Its basic policy centered around my own
                    educational experience "hand and muscle work as well as brain work and development of the
                    mind." Naturally I was not alone in revolt against traditional education. Many others were
                    aware of the failures of the school to equip the rising generation to meet the problems of its
                    environment. The growth of the industrial system, modern transportation and crowded cities created
                    entirely new environments and wholly unsuited to fulfill entirely the needs of healthy child growth.
                    The existing public school system of the latter half of the 19th century was shaped to meet the
                    needs of another and earlier civilization, when industry was centered in the home where they used to
                    grow their own food, spin and weave their own cloth, make their soap, dip their candles. The
                    majority of the population was agricultural. Father if he happened to be a cabinet maker or
                    blacksmith shaped his wood and forged his metal near his home within sight of his children and each
                    child was called upon while still young to share the parents' activity. It gave not only
                    insight into industrial processes of that day but the child also acquired habits of work, discipline
                    and moral training for its future occupation, and the school was properly a place to which children
                    were sent for a few hours each day to pick up the essentials of reading, writing, spelling, and
                    figuring and a little information about geography and history.</p>
            <p>The traditional school became out of date, chalk and blackboard and books, even when supplemented by

                        <hi rend="sup">1</hi> The version of the Rumely autobiography which appears below is that
                                prepared by Samuel Thurston Williamson, a family friend of the Rumelys and a
                                professional writer. The "Williamson" manuscript was produced from a
                                typescript of wire recordings provided by Edward A. Rumely and was typed, triple spaced,
                                in pica type. The present editor worked with a carbon copy of this version of the Rumely
                                autobiography on which were a number of additions and/or deletions. Since it was
                                impossible to ascertain exactly when–or by whom–the changes in the
                                "Williamson" manuscript were made, the following practices have been
                                used in preparing the autobiography for publication: words which were obviously added or
                                deleted when the original manuscript was typed have been added or deleted in this
                                reproduction; words which were marked out at a later time have been printed with a line
                                through them; handwritten additions have been reproduced in italics. Throughout the
                                manuscript there are occasional handwritten words which are illegible, repetitive, or
                                seemingly irrelevant. These have been omitted. Obvious typographical
                                errors–such as school for school, move for more, hi shop for bishop, bibical
                                for biblical–have been corrected. Otherwise, spelling, punctuation, and
                                grammar have been retained exactly as in the original. Whenever possible first names of
                                people mentioned have been added in brackets or in footnotes.</p>

                    attempt, of course, to meet the problem of changed environment was the so-called progressive school
                    movement. At that time it was as yet unborn for its great prophet John Dewey was just then beginning
                    to write.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> But the school I had in mind was not an outgrowth of this movement.</p>

                    the parochial school in LaPorte as I have already recalled all grades of students were in a single
                    room with Barney J. Kohn, the teacher. Other students recited and younger students could hear
                    recitations. This enabled me to follow the work of two or three grades ahead of me and then when I
                    went to grammar school I was able in the first year to pass through three grades–or
                    3½ grades–and a year later to enter high school. Now the one-room school house
                    is anathema to modern education but what it supplied 4e-in the way of being able to advance a pupil
                    is something that is still a problem for modern education. As much as school and college did help
                    me, it was my grandfather who had been one of my greatest teachers for he allowed me to do every
                    kind of physical work in the plant. He let me work in the foundry, the machine shop, and the
                    woodworking department, and I had experience such as few young men ever had of seeing all the
                    processes of a manufacturing plant. I knew how much that had given me and then the viewpoint that
                    was afterwards formulated by John Dewey was in my mind and I knew that that kind of experience was
                    very valuable to me. So I wanted a school where the things I had received from practical work would

                            reformers in the field of education. He suggested numerous innovations to alter the
                            traditional nature of the public school curriculum such as introducing industrial arts
                            subjects in the high schools. Dewey promoted the philosophy of pragmatism and its

                    an effort to get out of each individual all possibilities that are within him by the maximum amount

                    a low estimate upon the formalism of drill and routine that was customary in the Prussian schools.
                    The school authorities sensed that the spirit of his school movement was subversive of their mode of
                    training to obedience and submission, hence the Lietz schools suffered from serious handicaps

                    school it was already operating and assured of success.</p>
            <p>At my first visit to Glarissegg I sought out Werner Zuberbuhler but found him very short with me. He
                    almost shooed me off the place. He had been over-run with visitors and had no time to answer
                    questions. So I went. I sat down in the yard and watched the boys working. They were trying to move
                    a huge stone or boulder. The teacher would bear down on a lever once, then a couple of boys each one
                    in turn would bear down and never once haul together. The boulder remained immovable. It was evident
                    that the teacher who supervised the moving of the boulder had never tackled such a solid job before.
                    So I watched the goings on for about ten minutes, then I remembered how my grandfather would whistle
                    when he wanted to move a boiler and get everyone to move at the same time. So I took off my coat,
                    forgot myself completely and joined the group and I said "Don't do anything till I
                    tell you to start." Before long the boys began to follow my direction and they exerted
                    their effort all at the same time and we just walked the stone away to where it was to be placed.
                    Meanwhile Mr. Zuberbuhler had been watching and he sent a boy with this message
                    "I've seen that performance with the boulder and if you know how to handle
                    students that way, come and stay with us awhile." Then he came to meet me in a very cordial
                    way and made inquiry about my studies. He asked about the length of my vacation and then as I turned
                    to leave he called one of the students and said "Go with Herr Rumely to the Inn at the
                    village about a quarter of a mile off. Get his bag and belongings and place him in our guest room
                    upstairs. I wish him to be our guest as long as he will stay."</p>
            <p>I was soon acquainted with all the students in the school and the teachers. About 35 of the boys were
                    Swiss, a few Italian, a few German, and a handful from other countries like Russia. Werner
                    Zuberbuhler and I became good friends. When I left we corresponded and I visited the school
                    thereafter often. He sent school students on excursion trips to visit me at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Freiberg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I became intimately acquainted with the teachers of his school and met the woman who
                    was to become his wife. And when their marriage was to take place Mr. Zuberbuhler asked me to take
                    charge of the school and of its group of students <pb n="10" id="VAA4025-067-1-012"/> during his
                    wedding trip to Corsica. This I did and I wrote my experience in a long letter to my father and this
                    letter I later incorporated in the appendix of my Interlaken school catalogue. Here it is.</p>

            <p>I took groups of boys on bicycle trips over the Alps to <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> and made other trips with them to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>. We visited a meeting of the Cantons–one of the Swiss states–at
                    which all the 10,000 voters came together at Attppenzell in the public square to decide matters of
                    state the ensuing year. As we walked over the mountains toward this village we moved along with
                    hundreds of these voters carrying an umbrella and sword strapped together and used as sort of a
                    cane. At Appenzell the public square was fenced off guarded by soldiers and nobody was permitted to
                    enter inside as a voter unless he wore the sword. It was an old rule of the Canton that no man who
                    could not defend the country could participate in its decisions. This was an indication that
                    democracy must be maintained by universal service of men who guard their own liberty. This story I
                    told and retold in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>My contact with Zuberbuhler and with Dr. Leitz and subsequently Dr. Reddie of the Abbotsholm school
                    greatly aided me in developing my own ideas. These teachers and the literature of new school
                    movements greatly aided me in developing my own ideas. None of these schools and none of these
                    educational ideas seemed to appreciate the importance of muscle training and muscle perception.
                    There's a difference between manual training and the recognition of what muscle training
                    contributes to education, for there is more involved than merely muscular exercise and development
                    of the body. It was and still is my concept that the muscle is basic for mental development. I
                    experienced that when I returned from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. I was mentally fagged and worn out and those few days up in the mountains skiing
                    restored my mental health. Also, Dr. Gaevernitz informed me that by tiring him out by muscular work
                    or long walks that it gave him the equivalent of two more hours of mental work a day.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    sensation. The baby depends upon it almost wholly during the long period of its early life. Its
                    first education is a physical education, an education of the muscles. Its development through the
                    training of life and experience is a type of the later education that is practical. Through its
                    every muscle–above all by its hands–it drinks in the knowledge of the outside
                    world. Man dominates over all other living creatures because he has a thumb which can take hold of
                    material and because with his fingers he can measure weight resistance and inner properties of the
                    material which he cannot get through eye or nose. Man is an animal that has a highly developed hand
                    to take hold of things, for example, when one whittles wood–pine or oak
                    wood–one notices how different these materials are. He sees the color and remembers that
                    one is pine wood and the concept of that pine wood, how light it is and how easily cut is something
                    that you must experience first through your hands. As the human race went through a muscular state
                    like that in which savage people still exist today so the child goes through in epitome the history
                    of the race. But now so-called civilized man has become a new sort of cave dweller. Even in our
                    suburban home we have accepted the automatic way of apartment house life and industry has passed
                    forever from the home to the factory. Thus the old school, the traditional school, became out of
                    date and it was necessary for a new school [,] for children now need the training of their muscles
                    as well as of their minds and they need the training of their minds through the muscles. I have
                    already shown how the baby goes through the stages of the human race, but through every muscle,
                    above all the hands, man drinks in knowledge of the outside world. Nor is this importance of the
                    muscle lessened, either in later childhood or adult years. The eye, through the nerve of seeing,
                    teaches us form and color. We see iron–the gray metal–its crystals, its
                    lustre, its surface but we need to bend and break it, we need to weld and hammer it, to file it, to
                    test it and put it to the mechanical uses with our hands before we can truly know much about that
                    metal which has become the main carrier of our civilization. The hands interpret what the eyes see,
                    and the eyes become efficient alone through their muscles. The mechanism of the eye is as perfect in
                    the babe as in the grown man. Yet the babe stretches out its hand for the moon as if it were within
                    reach. In the end he learns to gauge distance and he does this through the muscles of the eye. We
                    now know that we are able to estimate distance by the eye movement that is necessary to obtain a
                    perfect focus that our whole conception of space is built not upon eye sensation but muscular
                    sensation.</p>
            <p>Indeed muscles express the most intimate sensations of the soul. The Romans made a true guess at them
                    which is preserved in our <pb n="12" id="VAA4025-067-1-014"/> word
                    "emotion"–a moving out of sensation through the muscles. Our feelings
                    are most vividly portrayed by gestures and the shifting play of expression of the facial muscles
                    give the face. See an angry man through a glass door and you need not hear a word to know his state
                    of mind and so joy, grief, love, every mood and passion have their instantly recognized physical
                    expressions. And so close is the relation between mind and muscles that the counterpart is true. Try
                    the old actors trick, mimic a man's expression and you'll have the key to his
                    thought. Assume the expression of a laugh and the sober mind will at once feel the effect. Of
                    course, play and organized sports are essential to our organized civilization, but when you use
                    tools against materials you get what organized play doesn't give you, you get muscular
                    coordination through organized play but you don't get the knowledge of the properties of
                    the material. I had much of that in my Grandmother Rumely's home. She made soap and apple
                    butter and the work activities of the home were still a tradition and it is those work activities,
                    the feeling that manual labor is as dignified as mental work [that] is one of the essentials of
                    modern civilization and an essential that in many places has been seriously neglected. For it is
                    through manual labor that one discovers that enterprise demands the cooperation of others thus one
                    learns the laws of social interdependence and becomes either a forceful leader or a patient helper
                    with reference to the requirements of common ends.</p>
            <p>These, in brief, were the fundamentals behind my plans for a new school–plans I was now
                    ready to put into effect. Although I was but 24 at the time, they had been hammered out over a
                    period of a score of years on the anvil of personal experience and trial and error in my own
                    education. And when I finally had in my hand my medical university degree, I was ready to put those
                    ideas into practice. I paid my last visits to Glarissegg and, as I have related, made my final
                    journey to <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>

                    ashore and revisited the town. After dark I headed back to the harbor and the landing stage where a
                    launch would take me back to the ship, but I lost my way. When I reached the harbor the last boat
                    had left. With some difficulty I found a fisherman about 23 years old, and a 13-year-old boy and

                    elder man stopped rowing. The boy was behind me on the end with a steering oar. He said
                    "Not two lira but twenty." I surmised that if I yielded and offered him twenty
                    lira he might just as well raise the fare to two hundred lira, so I decided the best thing was to
                    stand pat. Putting my hand as if reaching for a pistol, I said "No–two lira is
                    the bargain." The man would not move. But I heard the boy behind me move about, and not
                    wishing to be hit over the head with a steering oar I crowded up close to him so that if I should be
                    attacked I could throw the boy into the water and have only the man to deal with. Then I squeezed
                    him against the seat to force the pair to proceed. After about a minute of this the boy waved his
                    hand to his companion–I thought a sign that he had had enough of the pressure and wanted
                    him to row ahead, which the older man did. In a short time [we] were at the ship's ladder.
                    I stepped out of the boat and breathed easier, thinking that I had made a narrow escape.</p>
            <p>I walked up the companionway and watched the boatmen depart, then went down to my stateroom. I
                    reached for my purse. It was gone! I felt in my pocket for some bills. They too were gone! The only
                    money that remained was a few silver coins–about 12 German marks and some pfennig and
                    small Italian coins. Between <placeName>

                    a very famous pianist. Instead of money enough to get from <placeName>

                    Miss Michaelson.</p>
            <p>On the first day out of Naples, I saw a few passengers playing chess for money. I watched them, sized
                    up their abilities, then entered the game. At <placeName>

                    </placeName> for a period of time I had been winner in chess tournaments among other students. While
                    I had not played chess for many months, under the necessity that confronted me I put up a fairly
                    good game and won. Before long my funds had increased from twelve to forty marks and I had reason to
                    be thankful for those summer months on "C" Street in LaPorte when I played chess
                    with Father Messman and pulled at a length of binder twine which rocked the cradle of my baby sister
                    Florence, across the street.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> I raised my bets and soon had enough money to

                    Mother met me at the boat and helped me get my books and souvenirs through customs. They appeared as
                    glad to see me as I was to see them and their curiosity was as great as my certainty as to what I
                    proposed to do when I finally settled down, as they hoped, in LaPorte. Only I didn't tell
                    them–then.</p>
            <p>Arriving at LaPorte my reunion with my brothers and sisters was almost like encountering a new
                        family.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> When I had left the country nearly six years before, none of them
                    was grown up and 1 or 2 were scarcely out of the cradle. Now I had brothers and sisters who were
                    young men and women. I was in splendid physical condition, thanks to my mountain climbing and
                    skiing, but when I tried out my brothers' strength in wrestling, <del rend="strikethrough">and</del> four of them put me on my back, while with the fifth I could only maintain a tie. One
                    couldn't remain a vegetarian long at a Rumely table, so I gave up the practice I began at <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>My family received my declared intention to start a boy's school with as much bewilderment
                    as when I announced I was going to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> to study for the priesthood. I was already familiar with the previous comment
                    "We thought you went to Europe to study to be a priest, and then you decided to be a
                    doctor. And now that you have become a doctor you want to start a school."</p>
            <p>It was apparent that I would get no help from my family to realize my ambition to start a school.
                    Fortunately for my state of mind, Dr. [J. H. William] Meyer, a friend of mine from boyhood, wanted
                    to go to his ranch in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName> for a few weeks and asked me to take over his practice. He knew that I did not intend
                    to stay in medicine and therefore I would not take any patients away from him. I practiced for about
                    six weeks. Medicine fascinated me and I got on well with the patients. Had I continued medical
                    practice, I believe I would have chosen obstetrics and followed up for two or three years with the
                    care and supervision of the infants I might deliver. <list type="footnotes">

                    merely deliver babies–he could render important service in their first years of
                    development.</p>
            <p>My efforts to start a school were further retarded by conditions in M. Rumely Co. Grandfather Meinrad
                    had died two (?) <hi rend="i">1902</hi> years before.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> He had left his estate
                    to his children with major portions going to my Uncle William [N.], who had handled the mechanical
                    side of the business, and to my father [Joseph H.], who had handled sales and finance.</p>
            <p>My father's health had given out. He had alternate periods of depression when he would make
                    few decisions and periods of exaltation when he made decisions that were not wise. Will Rumely being
                    interested primarily in machinery and mechanics was habit-bound in his thinking. As a result the
                    business had become virtually stagnant.</p>
            <p>The aggregate capital of the plant was about $1 million and the company had approximately
                    5% of the total threshing machine business. Its annual turnover was around
                    $800,000 a year. The profit had shrunk to $40,000 a year.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> But this did not come from the operation of making and selling engines and threshers. That
                    activity broke even. The profit was the equivalent of the interest earned by some
                    $800,000 of farmers notes which the company owned. Here was a concern building machinery
                    whose profit came solely from interest on time payments on those machines.</p>
            <p>The threshing machine market had become saturated. While the country was opening up and expanding and
                    new lands were planted to wheat the capacity of threshing machine plants had increased but now no
                    new lands were opening up, expansion ceased and there was more plant capacity to build threshers and
                    engines than the market could consume.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the market was oversold. A threshing outfit represented $2500 or more of
                    investment. And an owner required from forty to fifty days' operations from one farm to
                    another to make a profit. But in the early 1900's so many threshing outfits were at work
                    that the average thresher had only 20 or 30 days' operation which made it difficult to earn
                    and pay for the machine. Consequently threshing outfits were sold with no cash down and from 3 to 5
                    years time to pay. This was the situation when I returned from Europe.</p>

                    I soon realized what the problems of the company were. I understood the business because as a boy
                    from ten to eighteen I had worked in the office and copied the letters and had seen all the
                    correspondence in and out, and had from that an understanding of all aspects of the business from
                    the office end; while from my grandfather's interest, enabling me to see every part of the
                    factory, I had acquired an understanding of the factory end of the business. It was two months
                    before I was put on the payroll, and then I had to put myself on for $83.33 a
                    month–$1000 a year. Without any formal assignment of authority, more and more
                    authority passed to me.</p>
            <p>Now I had a chance to develop the idea of substituting an engine for animal power
                    plowing–an idea that had been in my mind ever since that night I had drunk beer with
                    Rudolph Diesel in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Heidelberg</settlement>
                    </placeName> and that dinner in <placeName>

                    </placeName> with Professor von Schulze Gaevernitz's friends who discussed the opening up

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. I had found that in a few places in <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName> experiments were under way to adapt the steam engine to plowing.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                    But many of them had failed because of attempts to adapt the threshing engine to the plow and the
                    engine had not put its full power through gears to [a] draw bar that pulled the load. The problem
                    was to strengthen the gears so that the full power of the engine could be put into traction to draw
                    plows. The Rumely Company had developed probably before any other threshing machine concern strong
                    gears. This was after my brother Leo, who came back from a sales trip in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> to insist that the gear be widened from 3 to 5 inches. The engineers declared that this
                    was more strength than needed. "How much" asked Leo "would it cost us to
                    add a two inch width to the gears?" "Not over $15 to
                    $20" I said. "It costs me" Leo replied "about
                    $200 of sales effort to overcome doubt in farmers' minds whether these gears
                    will stand up. So why save $20 of metal and sacrifice $200 worth of sales
                    effort?" Thus it was that the Rumely engines had the easily visible gear strength to draw
                    plows all of which gave us an early start in steam plowing.</p>

                    Engines, Threshers, and Clover Haulers’ is the wording." I said "Uncle
                    William, the big end of this business is going to be plowing; and besides, how long has that bridge
                    been up there?"</p>
            <p>He said "fifteen or eighteen years."</p>
            <p>I said "You never painted anything on it and now, when I want to paint what belongs there,
                    you stop it. The wording that I gave you is the wording that is going on that sign."</p>
            <p>That marked the day when William Rumely's authority over the business passed; from that time
                    on it was under my direction, although my uncle still retained his financial interest and official
                    position as president.</p>
            <p>I begin to push the market for steam plowing in this and the Ideal Threshing Machine, which at that
                    time was just being developed, and since then became the standard machine more widely used than any
                    other in the country. And to inspire district salesmen of the Rumely Company to wear out more
                    shoe-leather and less seats of trousers and get out and get business, I took two pages in the
                    Thresherman's Review with the heading "There Must Be a Reason for the Success of
                    The Rumely Company and its Steady Growth in Volume."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> This was in
                    1907, a year of financial panic. And the activity of The Rumely Company that I had spurred up
                    greatly disturbed A. B. Farquahr of York, Penna., who had been one of my grandfather's best
                        friends.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> He telephoned me to meet him in <placeName>

                    try to do more business you will fail and incur great expense. I know that your grandfather would
                    want me to advise you thus. I expect the Farquahr Co. will only do 65% of its normal
                    volume of business."</p>
            <p>But Mr. Farquahr's business was serving the agricultural market of the East; they were not

                    $40,000 were $140,000. The time was right for settlement of new land of the

                    had bought steam plowing engines to break this tough prairie land–some of it with
                    undergrowth so dense that it was impossible to use horses.</p>
            <p>The steam engine, however, had great disadvantages. It consumed a ton to a ton and a half of coal a
                    day and eight times as much water. In districts where the ground water was alkaline it was
                    impossible to keep the engine boiler in condition. I realized that what these men needed was a new
                    dependable tractor power which was not then on the market. We gathered reports from salesmen from
                    all parts of the country and our branch managers made a study which convinced me that the time for
                    plowing by the internal combustion engine had arrived. A study of the fuel situation showed that
                    gasoline was scarce and increased demand for it would increase its scarcity and price. On the other
                    hand, kerosene was plentiful and cheap. This was before discovery of the
                    "cracking" process by which crude oil was subjected to fractional distillation; at
                    one temperature crude oil yielded its gasoline, at another its kerosene was drawn off, and the more
                    gasoline was distilled, the more comparatively unwanted kerosene resulted.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly I outlined a policy of building a kerosene engine instead of a gasoline one. The dream I
                    had since my meeting with Diesel was becoming realized. At the same time another dream of mine was
                    approaching realization. I had hired the old Collins estate for $1000 and had sent out
                    circulars announcing the opening in the fall of 1908 of Interlaken School. My adventures in this
                    educational pioneering require separate chapters. I was living at the school but spending most of my
                    working days at the Rumely plant.</p>
            <p>M. Rumely Company engineers worked with steam and designed for steam; their only acquaintance with
                    the internal combustion engine was with the occasional automobile of which up to that time only
                    150,000 had been built but there was some talk that a man named Henry Ford had bought land to build
                    a huge plant in Highland Park, <placeName>

                    at a Fair in the East John A. Secor who had an idea for an oil-burning engine and might be the man I
                    was looking for.</p>
            <p>We sent for Secor who came to LaPorte and explained that his grandfather had designed the steam
                    engine for one of the first steamboats on the <geogName>Hudson [River]</geogName> and that since

                            Atwood in 1892 and soon spread throughout the petroleum industry. The yield of kerosene was
                            increased approximately 25 per cent because of this process of fractional distillation. For

                    for about 15 months and we became close friends. All of our financial dealings were on the basis of
                    absolute trust. On a verbal agreement, Secor surrendered his entire patent rights except in the
                    marine field in return for $212,000 of M. Rumely Company stock.</p>
            <p>Secor believed the problem of a plowing engine was similar to that of an ocean boat in that both had
                    to have great reserve strength. The plowing engine to surmount a hill or negotiate more difficult
                    and tough spots in the soil would have to have reserve power. On this basis we started designing the
                    Oil Pull tractor. In about six months Secor and his draughtsmen had worked the design for the engine
                    out and four months later the first test machine was completed. Within a short time it was operating
                    satisfactorily.</p>
            <p>Our kerosene tractor had virtually the same traction mechanism though half the weight [of] the Rumely
                    steam tractor which had proved so sturdy under the severest conditions. It replaced steam engine and
                    boiler with a light but strongly made internal combustion engine driven by kerosene broken into a
                    fog of fine globules. On light loads, only kerosene was drawn into the carburetor; on heavy loads as
                    much water as kerosene was fed into the mixture. Two to three <hi rend="i">2½ to 4</hi>
                    gallons of kerosene were required to plow one acre.</p>
            <p>Exhaust and a boxlike cooling system were attached to the chassis over the front wheels. Instead of
                    water the cooling medium was oil which had several advantages over water. Oil has a higher boiling
                    point. It does not rust the system's parts nor does oil deposit sediment. As a result the
                    life of an Oil Pull radiator was as long as that of the tractor itself. As time went on the tractor
                    was improved; it became lighter as well as more powerful but its basic operation was the same as in
                    the first model. Many of these tractors were used 30 years or longer.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meantime, spring and the plowing season had arrived. Our great test had come. About ten one
                    morning we moved the engine out to a 40 acre field south of LaPorte. Immediately after luncheon we
                    were to see it plow for the first time. A number of the executives in the business and I sat under a
                    tree eating our lunch. Across the field was the tractor and we saw a man climbing over it. I asked
                    who he was, and test crewmen said they did not know. Shortly after the stranger walked towards his
                    car. I told Arthur Cromwell, my chauffeur, to follow him and tell me where he went. Meanwhile a
                    two-hours test of the engine surpassed our rosiest expectations.</p>

            <p>Agricultural history was being made that afternoon on the 40 acre field south of LaPorte. For what we
                    were witnessing was the end of an epoch which began, far back beyond recorded history, when man
                    first drew a forked stick through the soil. More human labor was spent for plowing than for any
                    other daily need. We were witnessing certain proof of a new epoch which opened the world's
                    last great power market to mechanical motors. Other internal combustion tractors would follow, but
                    with our first successful one, we had a head start.</p>
            <p>Not only was power plowing to open new territory but by doing away or eliminating the necessity of 18
                    million horses on our farms that liberated one acre in every five heretofore required for animal
                    subsistence. The estimated 50 million acres no longer needed for the feed of farm horses, slightly
                    more than the combined cultivated area of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>

            <p>About five o'clock, Arthur turned up at the office. "What do you mean," I
                    said, "taking us out to the field, and then leaving us." He said "I did

                    <hi rend="i">10</hi> months to build a tractor, then take it out to test it; and before we have a

            <p>He said: "Our company furnishes lubricating oil for tractors and we just wanted to see what
                    kind of oil yours would use. I had instructions from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> to follow what you are doing." He wouldn't tell me how he knew when
                    we were to test the tractor but I found that a telephone call had been made from near our factory to <placeName>

                    </placeName> on the forenoon of the test. One of the test crew was a Standard Oil employee and had

                    because trade papers announced that you were experimenting with a kerosene-burning engine we were
                    interested, and Guilfoyle carried out our instructions very efficiently. We meant no harm to
                    you–in fact, we meant to encourage, because we have already tried to get friends of ours
                    to bring out a kerosene-burning engine. There is a shortage of gasoline, and to make gasoline for
                    automobiles we would have to make a lot of kerosene that we can't sell. Therefore the
                    market for kerosene is keen–we would be very much interested."</p>

            <p>Up to now we had never thought of a suitable name for this tractor. Some of the boys in the
                    shop–a few of them being twice my age–had their own name: "Kerosene
                    Annie." One day I said to my secretary, Charlie Beal, "Charlie, don't let
                    me go home any night until I have put down two or three names for the tractor."</p>
            <p>We set down about 50 names. Two stood out–one was "Oil Pull" and the
                    other I have never mentioned in the belief that some day I might use it in another tractor
                    development. We protected the "Oil Pull" name quickly by registering it as a
                    trade-mark which we put on the tractor. We also had made a dimunutive of the trade-mark which we put
                    on a typewriter key so that it stood out prominently in a letter and was easily read. This
                    trade-mark was used in all our advertising at the time and emphasized that we were pioneers in power
                    plowing. The result was that the word "oil pull plowing" was picked up to
                    designate power plowing and before long our patent attorneys advised us that they were having
                    trouble in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> because officials there contended that oil pull plowing was a generic term for power
                    plowing and that we could no longer copyright it for ourselves. We had considerable difficulty and
                    several trips had to be made to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to prove to the patent people that we had coined and projected the word "Oil

                </p>
            <p>Of all my varied occupations and endeavors none has been closer to my heart than Interlaken School.
                    In the ten years of its life we received and taught some 1200 boys, and after that experience I have
                    often thought that the world might be a better place if it was run for a time by schoolboys of
                    between 8 and 16. Then ideals are the cleanest. Then loyalties are the deepest. Then enthusiasms are
                    the strongest. And then impressions are the clearest.</p>
            <p>One of the great joys of my life has been to witness the development of young men from their studies
                    to achievement in life. Generally I was able to recognize among the boys the ten percent destined
                    for real leadership. I studied the students. I knew their backgrounds and in many cases their family
                    histories, and I bought books for many a student in order to stimulate his interest in [a] direction
                    in which I felt he was fitted to go. Many a former Interlaken boy told me in later life that these
                    books had headed him on the road to success.</p>
            <p>Most of our boys did well. One is the head of a great mercantile establishment in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Another is in charge of a great railway operation. A third manages a huge industrial

            <p>The school was a great stimulus to me. It needed $25,000 to $35,000 a year more
                    than expenses and I had to hustle to earn that amount of money to make up the difference. In all,

                    million dollars of my first earnings. Several times when the school was in need I turned to business
                    deals which made larger amounts than were required at that time for the school.</p>
            <p>From the time it started until the summer of 1918, I was never free from thought of the school. All
                    my financial and business plans, all my vacations and travel were regulated in its interest. The
                    school gave me breadth and contact, a motive and satisfaction in life. I have never cared for money
                    and its possession, but the school gave me something to spend my money for, something to make the
                    money worth the trouble of earning it, and this was a great spur to my business activities.</p>
            <p>It was more than a year after my return to LaPorte that I was able to see a beginning to my cherished
                    ambition. Because of my father's health and the condition of the Rumely Company, I had to
                    turn to and help out in the office and sales management. My father refused to help me start the
                    school and I had no money of my own. But out of my $83 a month pay from the M. Rumely
                    Company I managed to save some $400 by the spring of 1907. From where I worked in the
                    Rumely Company office I could look north across <geogName>Clear Lake</geogName> to a rise in the
                    land where stood a large brick building with a French mansard roof. It was a former sanitarium,
                    three stories high, 35 rooms with about 20 fireplaces and a large basement. It had been built
                    originally by "Doctor" Collins, one of LaPorte's colorful characters of
                    early days. He had been a hodcarrier and then developed an opium cure which he had sold far and wide
                    around the world. He said he had carried bricks for hundreds of other people's homes and
                    that this time people were going to carry bricks for his home. So he built the place with brick
                    walls fourteen inches thick. Today the building still stands surrounded by a newer facade comprising
                    the LaPorte General Hospital <hi rend="i">Fairview Hospital.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for my purposes the place was ideally suited for the school. The rooms were spacious and well
                    lighted. There was plenty of hot and cold water and with a basement story well-suited for our shop
                    work. There was a two story barn, a storeroom for vegetables, and an ice house on the shore of
                        <geogName>Clear Lake</geogName>. The estate was surrounded by trees, shrubs and vines and had a
                    half mile of water front on <geogName>Clear Lake</geogName>. A short distance away was
                        <geogName>Stone Lake</geogName> with its clear sandy beach, densely wooded bluffs, and crystal
                    waters, and connected by a channel with <geogName>Stone Lake</geogName> was <geogName>Pine
                    Lake</geogName> one of the most beautiful of Indiana's inland lakes.</p>
            <p>In this setting between lakes there was no question about a name for the
                    school–Interlaken.</p>
            <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-067-1-030"/>
            <p>This place I rented for $1000 a year and since my salary was $83 a month it can
                    be seen that I was figuring my expenses quite closely. I moved out to the Collins place and lived
                    there during the late spring and summer of 1907. Meanwhile I looked up Dr. Frank O'Hara who
                    had been a student with me at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Notre Dame</settlement>
                    </placeName> and induced him to come to LaPorte and join with me in beginning the school. He, too,
                    had a little capital. I wrote the catalogue in the evenings of the spring, after spending the day at
                    the factory office. Then I sent it off to the printer. His bill was $400. O'Hara
                    complained "you might at least have saved out enough postage to mail the catalogue
                    out." And then he put up the necessary money for stamps.</p>
            <p>I had little difficulty in writing out the catalogue because by that time my ideas had been well
                    formulated and almost daily talked out with anyone who would listen. I was certain that once the
                    catalogue stated the idea those ideas would attract people and I would be able in one way or another
                    to earn enough money to get the school going. We issued the catalogue in late May of 1907, inserted
                    an advertisement in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Tribune, then began to get inquiries.</p>
            <p>In September 1907 when we opened with 13 students, three of them I took on scholarship, ten of them
                    paid the regular tuition of $600 per year. During the first year the number increased to
                    27. The second year we opened with about 40 boys. The third year with 65, and the fourth year our
                    number had increased to 120.</p>
            <p>Interlaken differed from other boarding schools in that work, purposeful work was an essential part
                    of the course of study. Each boy devoted several hours a day to work in the shop–wood
                    shop, copper shop of the school.</p>

            <p>As superintendent of the school and assistant to me, I engaged Dr. William N. Hailmann,<hi rend="sup">26</hi> who had been superintendent of schools at <placeName>

                    I imported from Baden, he too failed. Next before we got in the war I tried a man named Elert to
                    introduce drill and elements of military training at the school when the preparedness movement was
                    becoming strong. He, too, failed because of his inability to handle American boys. The other German

            <p>One of my problems was to get teachers willing to combine practical manual work of craftmanship with
                    schoolroom work. Many a teacher who was good in the classroom like a boy disliked manual work. So I
                    had written into the contract of every teacher that he had to participate in all practical work of
                    the school and I had all applicants read the catalogue so that they would have clearly in mind what
                    confronted them. But one of our early Latin teachers abhorred garden work. He couldn't get
                    over the notion that there was something wrong in manual work. And one day I happened to watch from
                    the window. He had a group of boys digging up sweet potatoes that we had planted. A little chap from <placeName>

                    sent me down here to learn something." And the Latin teacher felt just as the boy did, as I
                    watched his feeble effort in digging along with work detail of boys.</p>

                    backgrounds and remembered what the farm had given them as young men. In this way two of our
                    staunchest friends were James A. Patton,<hi rend="sup">30</hi> who came from a farm in Sandwich,
                    111. and Henry Ford, who felt that his farm background had been valuable to him and this aspect of
                    the school interested him.</p>
            <p>The school, of course, gave me many contacts. One of the earliest was Luther H. Gulick, who was one
                    of the American pioneers in physical training and at that time was the founder and director of the
                    Child Hygiene Department of the Russell Sage Foundation.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Earlier as director
                    of physical education of the YMCA he had made a study of human instincts which are the basis of
                    men's play activities. He outlined the experience of primitive men running after game or
                    being chased fleeing from game or chasing them, striking with clubs, throwing with stones, teaming
                    up in a group to overcome an animal. All this had been the work of man for thousands of years
                    through the stone age. And these primitive instincts had become the basis of play activities of our
                    time. He went on to outline football and baseball as descendants of these early instincts and that
                    knowing these facts it would be possible to lay down the rules of a new game and with that and
                    another athletic director he devised and wrote out the rules of basketball. I looked up Gulick in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> and found that he had become overworked and was nervous and not sleeping well. The same
                    state that I found a few years earlier [in] Professor von Gaevernitz. I induced Gulick to pack his
                    bag and come west with me that afternoon. He spent six weeks at the school. Arrived there the school
                    assigned him at once to a job of pulling one end of a crosscut saw with a boy at the other. This
                    unusual task and his desire to make a good showing before the boys caused him to tire himself out
                    completely. As I expected, the next morning he told me <list type="footnotes">

                    planned it so he would be drawn into the work activities of the school and put in the position where
                    his pride would cause him to exert great muscular effort to hold up his end of the effort. The boys
                    took Gulick on trips and gave him a great deal of outdoor muscular work. At that time he was
                    planning the Campfire Girls and John Collier was writing the poetry that went into the ritual of
                    that group. He had made fair progress during his stay at Interlaken but needed $25,000 to
                    $30,000 to start him off. At that moment–and simply at that
                    moment–I had a little more money than Interlaken needed so I contributed $5000
                    to the start of the Campfire Girls and was in some way connected with the work in its formative
                    period. Gulick introduced much to the school's athletic standards. Another visitor who also

            <p>One Sunday, when a group of boys returned from a weekend hike, Gerald Lambkin, nicknamed
                    "Happy" because he always woke up in the morning with a broad smile, came to me.
                    "Doctor," he said, "you told us that some day you wanted to move the
                    school to the country. I know the place. We camped out at a lake just beyond Rolling <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it's a fine lake with a nice sandy beach for swimming. You go out and buy
                    all the farms around that lake and you'll have a fine place for the new Interlaken School.</p>
            <p>The next Sunday, I drove out eight miles to Rolling <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>

                    exactly as Happy Lambkin had described. I thereupon engaged a real estate man to get an option on
                    the farms around the lake. He secured immediately option on all but one. Eventually Interlaken
                    acquired the hold-out property. Then it owned the entire shoreline and under the laws of Indiana had
                    complete control of <geogName>Silver Lake</geogName>. Including 180 acres of lake, we had some 700
                    acres of woods, water and farmland.</p>
            <p>A group of boys went out early in the spring and laid the foundation and erected a dining hall in
                    eight weeks. Plans for this building had been made in the drafting room of the old school on the
                    edge of <geogName>Clear Lake</geogName> as part of the work of the drawing class. Constructed of
                    cypress lumber was an extremely attractive building with a large stained glass window at one end

                    They lived in tents, got up at 5 in the morning, worked through the day and many times when a roof
                    or some definite project had to be completed a volunteer group labored through the whole night by
                    lantern light.</p>
            <p>For the main building we bought 50,000 linear feet of 30 and 40 foot logs. The building was u-shaped,
                    about 350 feet long and 250 feet wide and next to Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone Park it was said
                    to be the largest log building in the world.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> At one end was a gymnasium large
                    enough for a basketball game and to accomodate 700 or 800 people. On the other end of the wing there
                    were about 30 rooms, classrooms and offices. These were on the ground floor and on the upper floor
                    were 30 student rooms. The whole structure was put up with <hi rend="i">85%</hi> of
                    Interlaken boy labor. Some boys became such expert axmen that they could notch logs as skillfully as
                    pioneer woodsmen. They had a big crane that lifted the logs to place them and this was run by a full
                    grown man, and one or two carpenters, but the remainder of the work was done by some 35 boys. So
                    quickly did these boys develop skills they operated as efficiently as adults. Many 16 to 18 year old
                    boys moved with such agility and speed that except on difficult fitting jobs expert carpenters could
                    do no better. The younger boys or the less able ones were assigned to leaders who had skill in the
                    jobs that they performed. Generally five to six or eight boys under one leader. We found that this
                    system of leadership gave a smooth operation and much greater output. The leaders developed <hi rend="i">in skill and they returned year after year to the school, and some of them chose to
                        remain a year longer as guides in charge of work</hi> groups on the job.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the school enrollment shot up more than expected. By the end of June in the year which we
                    acquired the Rolling <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> site we saw that we'd have fifty boys more than we had provided space for,
                    whereupon we wired that we had room for 50 more boys to be in tents. Those who had their parents
                    consent and who applied first would be given the opportunity of living in tents. As the result we
                    had more applications for tent accomodations than for the dormitories.</p>

            <p>When the students arrived the next fall we had a carload of cypress lumber and blueprint plans for
                    floors and walls running up to three feet to be covered by a tent about 20 feet long and 12 and 14
                    feet wide. The top of the tent had an extra flap to keep snow away from the warm inner canvas. Each
                    tent had a stove and a metal insulation where the stove pipe passed up through the canvas, to
                    prevent burning.</p>
            <p>For nearly three years about 60 boys preferred to sleep winter and summer in the tent camp at
                    Interlaken School. Sometimes the snow lay three feet deep outside. There was one central log
                    building in this camp containing showers. The boys hustled with bare feet in pajamas or in
                    nightgowns–for those were still the days of nightshirts–through snow in winter
                    each morning. Each tent, of course, had a wood floor and the boys gathered their own firewood from
                    the wind fallen timber across the lake when coal was not supplied.</p>
            <p>There were two boys to each tent. For the second time we ordered another carload of cypress lumber
                    and told all that wished to to substitute lumber for the tents that they might do so. So when the
                    boys returned after a summer vacation very quickly some of the more expert ones pitched in and built
                    for themselves cypress cabins. That encouraged others and soon, within two weeks, all the tents had
                    been transformed into cabins that lasted through the remainder of the school's existence
                    and today a generation later these cabins <del rend="strikethrough">comprise a tourist camp. These
                        cabins</del> were moved a few miles east of the school site, where they now comprise a tourist
                    camp.</p>
            <p>If there has been greater exhibit of school spirit, or greater manual accomplishment by school boys
                    most of whose families were prosperous and wealthy, I have yet to hear of it. Nor have I yet to hear
                    of where more fundamental democracy was practiced. It made no difference from where the boy came.
                    Some of the wealthiest ones had the hardest row to hoe. My greatest satisfaction is that such a
                    large proportion of them made good in after life.</p>

                    rebates on new machines. Thus the net cost of our experimentation to the company was reduced to
                    probably $40,000 or $50,000 and we gained a year's advance over our
                    competitors and had the ability immediately to put our Oil-Pull plant to maximum production. This
                    initiative and courage in driving ahead was a big factor in giving the Rumely Company the lead that
                    it held uninterruptedly over all other farm tractor companies.</p>
            <p>Plant and business expanded so rapidly that we were hard put for additional skilled labor. The
                    booming automobile industry was attracting the best mechanics and our advertisements for skilled

                    supervisors and hiring foremen this type of advertisement brought scores of replies. We then put
                    through home building developments in North LaPorte and around the plant.</p>

                    owner who imported numbers of immigrants from the various European countries. Barker was an old
                    friend of Grandfather's.</p>
            <p>That Monday afternoon my uncle William Rumely answered his telephone, listened a moment, then winced
                    in pain. Putting his hand over the receiver he said to me, "You started this. You finish
                    it. John Barker is on the phone." So I got on the wire and this is what I heard:
                    "You little brat! The last time I saw you you were trailing along on your
                    Grandfather's apron strings; now you're raiding on my labor market …
                    Goddam you!" "Mr. Barker," I said "if you feel that strongly,
                    I'll drive over and see you."</p>
            <p>When I reached the car works, the factory manager met me. "Doctor," he said
                    "you're going to have a session with the boss, but don't lose your
                    temper; bear in mind that he's been performing on us all day long for letting you raid our
                    labor."</p>
            <p>Barker was a small man. He sat at a huge table which he hit with a terrific blow of his fist and then
                    went to work on me. "Who <list type="footnotes">

            <p>After about twenty minutes of the same, he stopped and asked, "What do you need all the
                    workers for?" We're selling more tractors than we can make," I said,
                    "and we haven't men enough in LaPorte to make them."</p>
            <p>He said: "Where did you get all the money to put up your big building?"</p>
            <p>I said: "I haven't all that I need. I want to build a foundry costing two hundred
                    twenty-five thousand dollars, and I haven't got the money."</p>
            <p>I had heard that John Barker was in trouble with the state tax people for not reporting Indiana
                    assets enough to correspond with the wealth he was supposed to have. "We could use
                    $200,000," I said.</p>
            <p>"What do you give for the $200,000?" he asked.</p>
            <p>I said "6% preferred stock."</p>
            <p>He said: "I never in my life paid par for 6% preferred stock in a new
                    thing."</p>
            <p>"I'll sell it to you at 92," I said.</p>
            <p>As suddenly as he had gone into the tirade when I walked in, he reached for his checkbook and said:
                    "That's $184,000." "Yes, for 2000 shares."</p>
            <p>Barker needed immediate delivery of the certificates because he wanted to make a statement that he
                    owned the $200,000 investment in Indiana stock–more than he had done so up to
                    that moment. When I got back to LaPorte, I asked my uncle to come down to the office and make out
                    certificates for 2000 shares. And he said "That's foolish."
                    "John Barker is in a mood where you can't sell him anything," and I
                    couldn't convince him until he saw the check. After that, Barker remained an interested
                    friend.</p>
            <p>We started building our foundry. At the same time we knew we'd have difficulty getting
                    workers for it. With the high demand for less arduous labor, Americans were reluctant to go into
                    foundry work. We needed Polish immigrants. The Federal law prohibiting employers from importing
                    foreign labor, the law which Barker had gotten around, would not prohibit a parish priest from
                    trying to increase his congregation by having his church members write to relatives in the old
                    country and urging them to come to LaPorte. A. J. Rumely [Edward's uncle] got Grandmother
                    to give $1000 towards building a Polish church, then he called on the bishop and told him
                    that this might be a starting point, that we would pledge to give jobs to Polish workers, whereupon
                    the bishop opened a parish in East <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-067-1-040"/> LaPorte where a Poli<del rend="strikethrough">cy</del>
               <hi rend="i">sh</hi> colony developed within a couple of years.
                    When the Poles got jobs and bought homes, they too wrote their friends in <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName> and urged them to join them.</p>
            <p>While our tractor development was in progress, I would work at the Rumely Company office then go out
                    to the school in late afternoon for a swim in <geogName>Stone Lake</geogName> with the boys. One
                    afternoon I arrived and saw a stranger mingling with the boys assembling for the swim hour. A boy
                    from Evanston, William Warren, whose father was an architect, said to me"You know who that
                    man is?"</p>
            <p>"No," I said. "He's Mayor of our town and a member of the school
                    board." I went over greeted the stranger and asked, "Anything I can do?"
                    "Yes," he said, "my wife heard that this school might be a good place for
                    my son who's giving me a lot of trouble. He keeps running away from school and since
                    I'm head of the school board, it doesn't look good to get a note ‘Your
                    son Tom has been truant two days, or three days.’"</p>
            <p>"What does Tom do when he quits school?" I asked.</p>
            <p>"He just stays in my barn and garage with my chauffeurs all day long." </p>
            <p>"How many chauffeurs have you?" </p>
            <p>"Three; one for my wife, one for my daughter, and one for me." </p>
            <p>I had heard about the Evanston High School of those days. Its teachers could be hired away easily
                    because their salaries were so low. So, I asked "What do you pay your chauffeurs?"</p>
            <p>"The fellow who drives me gets $2400 and his house, and milk and garden stuff and
                    chickens from the farm." </p>
            <p>"Well," I said "that's about $3400." The man
                    who drove his wife got a little less and the one who drove his daughter was unmarried and got
                    $2200 or $2300. "That's a total of about $7000 a
                    year," I said "and the boy has the time of these three men to himself. What do you
                    pay your high school teachers?"</p>
            <p>"From $1400 to $1600." </p>
            <p>"So," I said, "Tom has about one-thirtieth of a teacher, or about
                    $50 worth of time against what costs you $7000 or $8000."</p>
            <p>"I never thought of it that way," said the Evanston man, and forty years later,
                    neither have many others.</p>
            <p>Our visitor spent the night at the school and the next morning said he would send his boy to us.
                    "If Tom needs anything, buy it and put it on my bill. Don't write me about [it]
                    and ask permission. Buy him a suit if he needs it. The other day Cyrus McCormick came in and asked
                    me to give some money for the YMCA. ‘Yes,’ I said ‘I'll
                    give you $10,000.’ Then McCormick sat down and talked to me for an hour while
                    the wheat market (pit?) was open. Wheat was moving and I could have made $30,000 or
                    $40,000 except for that interruption <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-067-1-041"/> So
                    don't trouble me; if Tom needs anything, use your judgment and get it."</p>
            <p>That was my introduction to James A. Patten.</p>
            <p>Instead of discouraging young Tom Patten's strong mechanical inclinations that were
                    unsatisfied by book learning, I allowed him to go out and work with Secor's experimental
                    tractor. Tom had a wonderful time because the crew of Italians who pulled up the stumps and cleared
                    the way for the tractor cooked a common meal. Out of one huge kettle everyone dished out a bowl of
                    soup. Tom had never seen anything like that.</p>
            <p>Later that fall while we were test plowing in fields near the school, Mr. and Mrs. Patten paid us a
                    week-end visit. When they arrived Tom was out handling the plows behind the tractor. Mr. Patten went
                    out to see him and was so fascinated by seeing eight furrows turned behind the tractor that he
                    stayed with his son on the plow platforms all day. It was the first time he had seen power plowing.
                    "What's that tractor going to do?" he asked.</p>
            <p>"It's going to take 10c' or more out of the cost of raising a bushel of
                    wheat." I said.</p>
            <p>"Can you prove that?" he demanded.</p>
            <p>"Yes," I said.</p>

            <p>Some weeks later, I called on Patten at the Grain Exchange <hi rend="i">Bartlett Frazer offer.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
               </hi> He examined my statistics and cost figures with the minuteness of a
                    watchmaker and put me through a stiff questioning. Finally he asked, "Have you got all the
                    money you need for your development?"</p>
            <p>"No," I said, "I'm short of money now."</p>
            <p>"How much is the stock?" he asked.</p>
            <p>I said "$250 a share."</p>
            <p>"I'll be damned!" Patten exploded. "I never paid more than
                    $100 a share for any speculative thing."</p>
            <p>Then I exploded. The Rumely Company wasn't a speculative thing but an old established
                    concern. Until then its stock had never been increased and every share had $150 farm
                    notes besides a hundred dollars in assets.</p>
            <p>Patten pushed a button and called in his secretary and said "Bring me my check
                    book." He started filling out a check, then raised his pen and asked
                    "What's the name of the company?"</p>
            <p>"M. Rumely Company." </p>
            <p>Patten signed the check and handed it to me. I looked at it and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Later I interested John D. Larkin owner of the Larkin Soap Company of Buffalo<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
                    who took a half million dollars interest in the company. Subsequently as the business grew we were
                    obliged to extend larger amounts of credit to the farmers and Messrs. Patten, Warren and Larkin all
                    directly and through banks associated with them purchased farmers notes in large quantities. These
                    men made their investments in the company through negotiations with me. I'd come to know
                    each of them as a personal friend. Patten and Larkin stuck by me through the entire period of
                    success and profit and didn't desert me when things went the other way. The remainder of
                    their lives they became my three staunchest business friends.</p>

                    during the entire period of his association with the Rumely Company. His whole contact consisted of
                    an occasional letter and visits from me to him. In spite of repeated invitations he didn't
                    come even in 1912, and the first part of 1913 when his investment in stocks and notes had grown to a
                    million and a half dollars, and when the banks with which he was associated held some $2
                    million of notes. All in all I secured for the Rumely Company some $38 million of working
                    capital. Patten had invested up to $700,000 or $800,000 in the Rumely Company;

            <p>The banana peel was bankers. Like other manufacturers in the same line, The Rumely Company sold most
                    of its threshing machines in spring and summer, and the loans made by banks financing that
                    season's business were paid in full in the fall. But whereas threshers performed in summer
                    harvest, the chief demand for Rumely Oil-Pull Tractors was for spring plowing. Financing such an
                    operation meant a different time for maturing loans. The banks could not see the difference, an
                    astigmatism which competing implement companies saw no reason to correct. Instead of carrying
                    tractor loans until spring, the banks, particularly the First National Bank of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    like thresher loans in November and December.</p>

            <p>"We could sell twice as many, but the banks won't finance us." </p>
            <p>Drake told me to stand by while he talked with John D. Archbold, Standard Oil's

            <p>I arrived in the lobby of the office about 12:07. Mr. Drake chatted with me and in a few minutes down
                    came Mr. Archbold, with a black stovepipe hat and Prince Albert. Mr. Drake said: "This is
                    my friend, Dr. Rumely from LaPorte, about whom I've spoken to you."</p>
            <p>We started off; I said nothing–wishing to hear what was on Mr. Archbold's mind.
                    We went up Broad Street to Wall Street, with not a word between us. As we turned to approach the
                    National City Bank, Mr. Archbold spoke. "Who was it you saw at the bank?" he
                    asked. "Mr. Simonsen," I said.</p>
            <p>"I know him very well," Archbold said. "When we get into the bank I wish
                    you wouldn't say a word until I'm gone except to acknowledge the
                    introduction."</p>
            <p>We walked up to the desk of Mr. Simonson. Mr. Archbold said: "Mr. Simonson, I want to
                    introduce to you Mr. Edward Rumely, who is making a tractor in which we are very much interested. It
                    burns kerosene, and we have the kerosene to sell. We have followed the machine and we know that it
                    works, and I just want you two gentlemen to know each other." Mr. Archbold then bowed and
                    went out. Simonson turned to me and said: "How much money do you need to carry you through
                    the winter?"</p>
            <p>I told him $250,000. He pushed across the table signature cards and a note for
                    $250,000 maturing the next April or May. I told him we did not need the money
                    immediately; that our notes in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> still had sixty days to run. He said: "You might just as well pay them off at
                    once, drawing a check on us to pay them, and then the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    the McCormick and Deering, and several others.</p>

            <p>Assistant Attorney General [Edwin Prescott] Grosvenor who conducted the suit to break up the
                    Harvester Company subpoenaed me as a witness–assuming that Rumely Company as a competitor
                    in the implement business would be hostile to Harvester–and requested me to meet him at
                    breakfast on the day of my testimony.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> He began by telling me, "The
                    trouble with your company is that the Harvester Company comes into a town gets the first best dealer
                    for the McCormick line, the next best for the Deering line and the third and fourth best for other
                    Harvester lines and when you go there you can get only the fifth rate dealer for your
                    business."</p>
            <p>That was news to me so I listened. He then asked "What is the difference between the reaper
                    which the Harvester Company sells and the thresher which you people make?"</p>
            <p>I explained as elementally as I could the difference between reaping and threshing and that a reaper
                    reaps and a thresher threshes. Mr. Grosvenor seemed grateful. "You know," he said
                    "it's pretty difficult to keep track. One month we have bathtub people in court,
                    the next tobacco, and now implements to deal with." Then he added: "One problem
                    that concerns me is if I win the suit shall I break the Harvester Company into two or three or more
                    separate companies."</p>
            <p>As I listened I was amazed that a man with so little insight into the fundamentals of the implement
                    business could be making decisions to dismember and move about the life's work of men who
                    had made the greatest contribution to agriculture–shifting labor from human to animal and
                    mechanical power–that had been made since biblical days.</p>
            <p>I listened to get his viewpoint and his presentation seemed to be intended to guide me in my adverse
                    testimony. When I got on the stand he again said "The great difficulty with local agents,
                    Mr. Rumely, is that you find it difficult after the Harvester Company has taken the best to find
                    good local agents."</p>
            <p>I replied "No, that is not our difficulty. We have threshers that can be sold only at
                    harvest time from June to September and then our local branch house salesmen spent four to eight
                    weeks collecting and for the remaining six or seven months of the year we have nothing for them to
                    sell. We can't release them and rehire them and therefore our burden of sales expense is
                    very high.</p>

                            and Grosvenor was instrumental in bringing suits against DuPont. He also became well known

            <p>A few other questions I answered in accordance with the facts and not in accordance with the assumed
                    antagonism to the Harvester Company. He then dropped me as a witness suggesting that I be excused.
                    E. A. Bancroft, chief counsel for Harvester, took over and said "We had better adjourn for
                    luncheon because I expect to hold this government witness several hours." He did and got
                    from me and into the record factual details confronting efficient agricultural implement operation.
                    I had never met him before, but I was told that this testimony of mine had pivotal importance. The
                    Harvester Company was not dismembered, and the ideas I had unfolded led me to attempt further
                    consolidation of the implement business.</p>

                    which to live are adequately acquainted with the distinguished career of Richard Lieber, architect
                    of the state park system of Indiana. Lieber was born in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1869 and emigrated to the Hoosier State in 1891. He later became a most energetic
                    advocate of conservation and preservation of Indiana's beautiful forest and wild life
                    resources and served as the first director of the Indiana Department of Conservation from 1919 to
                        1933.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> He brought an enthusiasm and dedication to his task which influenced
                    his colleagues and associates and ultimately gained him national recognition, including assignments
                    in the crusade to preserve America's national resources as well as those of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    himself most energetically to the preservation of Indiana's natural resources and beauty.
                    The idea of establishing a system of state parks probably had its origin not long after
                    Lieber's first visit to Brown County on September 24, 1910, when the Liebers were guests at
                    the cabin of Fred Hetherington. Lieber may already have had in mind, too, that the establishment of
                    a state park system might be a suitable project for the celebration of Indiana's centennial
                    in 1916. He remarked: "This whole county [Brown] ought to be bought up by the state and
                    then made into a State Park, so that all of the people of Indiana could enjoy this beauty
                        spot."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Lieber's activities in behalf of conservation continued unabated, and in October, 1912, he

            <p>As the result of discussions with Governor Samuel M. Ralston concerning a suitable celebration of the
                    state's centennial, Lieber was invited in 1916 to serve as chairman of the Committee on the
                    Indiana State Centennial Memorial of the Indiana Historical Commission. As Emma Lieber describes the
                    committee: "It was organized especially for the purpose of establishing the foundation of a
                    ‘System of State Parks’ as a permanent feature of the Hoosier Centennial
                    Celebration. Each county was to be organized and committees were to be appointed from the Indiana
                    Federation of Clubs, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Hoosier State Motor Club, and
                    other civic organizations, and last but not least the press was asked for its
                        cooperation."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> It was hoped that three tracts of land could be
                    acquired for state parks during the centennial year. Since contributions from private citizens were
                    to be solicited, Governor Ralston set aside the week of April 24, 1916, for collecting "
                    subscriptions to the fund to be used in acquiring scenic tracts and historic spots."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Success was almost immediate. Within a very short time the state acquired

                    and documents relative to Indiana history. Among them is the following report which Lieber made as
                    chairman of the Indiana State Centennial Memorial Committee. Not only does it describe the way in
                    which the state of Indiana acquired <placeName>

                    remarkable man had for nature's beauty and his untiring zeal in endeavoring to preserve it
                    for posterity. In a time when preservation of a suitable natural environment has become one of the
                    greatest challenges of modern life, it is appropriate to recall the efforts of the tireless Lieber
                    and to redouble present efforts as his accomplishment serves as an inspiration. Generations of
                    Hoosiers and Americans yet unborn owe Lieber a never ending debt of gratitude.</p>

                                            was to plan a suitable centennial celebration for the state in 1916. Lieber
                                            was the chairman of a special committee set up by Governor Ralston and the
                                            Indiana Historical Commission to be known as the Committee on the Indiana
                                            State Centennial Memorial. It was also known as the "Park
                                            Committee" as its purpose was to begin a state park system for
                                            Indiana as a phase of the centennial celebration. Governor Ralston appointed
                                            the committee in March, 1916. Its members were Richard Lieber, chairman; Dr.

                                    purpose of making contributions to the State Park Fund. This resulted in the

                                    the facts and circumstances in connection with the Park movement, adequate funds can
                                    still be raised throughout the State.</p>

                                    </placeName> Run, the Committee became a bidder and continued to bid until it came
                                    to the conclusion that it was useless to compete with a commercial bidder. As a
                                    result the property was sold to the Hoosier Veneer Co., of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> for $30,200. The Committee, however, did not allow this
                                    disappointment to curb its activity and then and there determined to acquire <placeName>

                                    </placeName> Run notwithstanding its apparent failure. Negotiations with the Hoosier
                                    Veneer Co. continued all summer and fall and finally on the 11th day of November,
                                    the property was purchased for the sum of $40,200. Figuring taxes and
                                    interest charges the profit of the Hoosier Veneer Co. was approximately
                                    $9,000. On the other hand, the Committee after making very careful
                                    investigations of timber and land values, concluded that the property was worth all
                                    they had paid for it.</p>

                                    </placeName>'s State Parks is in Door County, including 3,800 acres. The
                                    acquisition of five or six thousand acres of forest around
                                        <geogName>Devil's Lake</geogName> is under way and the Dells of the
                                        <geogName>Wisconsin River</geogName>, and another tract of some 2,700 acres
                                    along the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> are to be added to the
                                    State's system.</p>
                        <p>In all of these States, as it would be in Indiana, the chief purpose of State Parks
                                    is to refresh and strengthen and renew tired people, and fit them for the common
                                    round of daily life.</p>
                        <p>Other States, as doubtless will Indiana, have found that there is also a cash value
                                    in scenery, an income to be derived from excursionists, <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-067-1-057"/> from special commercial privileges and concessions, and
                                    from fish and game, an income that can be turned toward the cost of maintenance.</p>

                                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                                    </placeName>'s elaborate Metropolitan Park system is an example of
                                    possibilities within the reach of Indiana cities which they might follow on a small
                                    scale. The <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                                    </placeName> system includes its own and that of thirty-seven surrounding cities,
                                    the system having established both parks and connecting parkways, and highways for
                                    motor and other traffic. The <geogName>Blue Hills</geogName> reservation, twelve
                                    miles from the statehouse, has 4,700 acres; Middlesex Falls, five miles from the
                                    statehouse, contains 3,200 acres, this park being bordered by five cities;
                                        <geogName>Mystic Valley</geogName> Parkway, along Lake and river of the same
                                    name, is a third of the larger areas in the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                                    </placeName> system. Many miles of rocky and wooded tracts are included, as well as
                                    great stretches of seashore. About $7,000,000 has been spent for lands
                                    for this system and as much more is going into development, the money being raised
                                    by state, city and town taxation.</p>
                        <p>Density of population in Europe does not permit the creation of extensive parks. But
                                    every scenic spot, large or small, has been beautified, giving whole provinces the
                                    aspect of one large park in which are nestled villages, towns, and even cities
                                    themselves.</p>
                        <p>The European long ago learned the material value of scenery. The ubiquitous red
                                    Baedecker is an eloquent testimonial thereof.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Take little <placeName>

                                    "Tartarin on the Alps"<hi rend="sup">9</hi> to know that it is the
                                    most superbly ordered and highest dividend paying scenery in the world. It is well
                                    enough to speak of Nature's hygenic value, of its recuperative and
                                    recreative strength, but when one reflects for a moment that Americans
                                    alone,– not to mention all the other nations–have left
                                    annually $50,000,000 in that little country, it is realized that scenery
                                    has an inherent cash value and that the so-called "Lungs" of a
                                    people have from a given view point a most convincing resemblance to a fat purse.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I hope and trust that the small beginning we have made will have laid
                                    the foundation for a comprehensive system of State Parks which will not only stand
                                    forever as a token of the past but which will bring health, wealth and happiness to
                                    our own generation and the many that will come after us.</p>

            <p>Oscar Osburn Winther, Indiana's most distinguished student of western history and since 1937
                    a leading member of Indiana University's faculty, died at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> on May 22, 1970, at the age of sixty-six. This is a simple, if regrettable, statement
                    of fact. But to the hundreds who knew Oscar Winther as a warm friend, and to the thousands who have
                    read or will read the dozens of books and articles that were his legacy, he will live for
                    generations to come. Oscar Winther was too fine a person and too good a historian ever to be
                    forgotten.</p>
            <p>His career spanned the years that gave birth to modern <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName>. Born at Weeping Water, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, on December 22, 1903, of parents who had migrated from <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName> eight years before, he spent most of his boyhood on an <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> dairy farm where the endless round of chores and milking made schooling a positive
                    pleasure. By the time he entered the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> a few gifted high school instructors had sparked his interest in history; when he
                    graduated in 1925, he was so determined on an academic career that he endured a stint of high school
                    teaching to earn enough money to enroll in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s graduate school. There he earned his masters degree in 1928, but so
                    exhausted his savings that he was driven back to secondary school classrooms to recoup his modest
                    fortunes. Two years later <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> beckoned, and there under the guidance of Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson, Oscar
                    Winther not only completed his dissertation on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> stagecoaching but began his enduring love affair with western history. Jobs were few in
                    1934; for a time he worked as assistant curator of the Wells, Fargo and Company History Collection,
                    as Danish translator for the Hoover War Library, as teacher at the San Jose Adult Education Center.
                    When Indiana University offered him an instructorship in 1937, he had found his true haven, and
                    there he was to spend his remaining years.</p>
            <p>What fruitful years those were! To the cause of education, to the university, and to the world of
                    history Oscar Winther gave himself unstintingly. He served as consultant and advisor to public
                    schools throughout Indiana, was coauthor of a leading junior high school textbook, a longtime member
                    and onetime president of the Indiana State History Teachers Association, and active in the Indiana
                    Historical Society. He was a member of countless departmental and university committees and for
                    almost a decade acted as assistant or associate dean of the graduate school-a post that brought his
                    schol arly <list type="footnotes">

                    associational commitments elevated him to a front rank among historians. He was a prominent member
                    of the Organization of American Historians and for three self-sacrificing years edited its important
                        <hi rend="i">Journal of American History.</hi> He helped found the Western History Association
                    and was honored by election to the presidency and to honorary membership by that lusty young
                    society. At the time of his death he was president of the Oral History Association.</p>
            <p>These activities meant acclaim from the academic community. Oscar Winther held fellowships from the
                    Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the Fulbright Commission, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Huntington</region>
                    </placeName> and Newberry libraries, the Library of Congress, and the Social Science Research
                    Council. He was invited to visiting professorships at such divergent spots as the universities of

                    made University Professor in 1965 in fitting recognition of his eminence on the world scene.</p>
            <p>Oscar Winther took particular pride in the students whom he trained, but his fame rested more on the
                    scholarly publications that issued from his pen. Most of these were directed to a common theme; his
                    purpose was to tell the complete story of land transportation in the West prior to the age of steam,
                    and this he accomplished in a succession of books that are properly viewed as classics. They were
                    touched with greatness partly because Oscar Winther subjected each problem not only to exhaustive
                    research but to systematic and detailed analysis, partly because his own excitement permeated his
                    narratives. "Research," he wrote shortly before his death, "can be as
                    much fun as it is compulsive." Oscar Winther's books are fun to read because he
                    had fun writing them.</p>
            <p>Yet those who knew him only through his publications could never appreciate the true measure of the
                    man. This was a privilege reserved for his wide circle of friends. To them Oscar Winther was as warm
                    and generous as he was witty and gay. They saw him as uniquely vital, endowed with perennial youth
                    and a zestful enthusiasm that was infectious. To know the best of life was to hear Oscar Winther
                    recounting an anecdote to a small group of compatriots, his eyes sparkling, his laughter bubbling,
                    his words enhanced with gestures that showed the stamp of the born actor. He will be missed by his
                    legion of friends no less than by the academic world that has benefited so greatly from his
                    scholarship.</p>

                    History</head>
            <p>All nominations must be made on the "Awards Nomination Form" and <hi rend="i">postmarked by not later than May 15, 1971.</hi> Each nominator must include a supporting letter
                    which is explicit in indicating why the award or certificate seems merited. Each nominator is also
                    responsible for making certain that at least two or three other persons send similar statements <hi rend="i">directly to the state chairman.</hi> Finally, each nominator should send relevant
                    supporting material such as pamphlets, newspaper clippings, programs, scripts, and books. The views
                    and evaluations of various persons will be considered regarding each nomination.</p>
            <p>1. <hi rend="i">Certificate of Commendation.</hi> The Certificate of Commendation is given for
                    outstanding achievement by an individual or an organization in the field of state, provincial, and
                    local history, but with that achievement judged in the light of local limiting circumstances rather
                    than on a basis of overall excellence in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> as a whole. This is an award of encouragement and commendation to a person or group
                    which by great effort has accomplished something that is really outstanding within its own area. The
                    certificate is a pat on the back and says to the individual or organization that receives it:
                    "We think, you are doing a wonderful job in your area, and we want to recognize you for
                    it."</p>
            <p>2. <hi rend="i">The Award of Merit.</hi> This was the original award of the American Association for
                    State and Local History and is still the backbone of its competition. It is given for excellence of
                    accomplishment or program in the field of state, provincial, and local history and is in no way
                    judged relative to local limiting circumstances. The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as
                    saying to everyone: "This is public acknowledgement by the American Association for State
                    and Local History that this accomplishment or this program, in comparison with all similar
                    accomplishments and programs in North <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>

            <p>As part of the Intersession program at Indiana University, a course in Museology (A305), sponsored by
                    the University Committee on Historic Preservation and the Indiana University Museum, will be offered
                    June 8-June 23, 1971, for three credit hours.</p>
            <p>Scheduled are approximately thirty hours of seminars in the history, organization, and administration
                    of museums, in addition to methods of acquisition, record keeping, storage, preservation, and
                    exhibition of specimens. Another thirty hours will include laboratory sessions involving practical
                    work projects and methods of application of theories and principles.</p>
            <p>This course is recommended for volunteer workers and students wishing to pursue a museum career.

            <p>The museum training clinic described above is sponsored by the Indiana University Committee on
                    Historic Preservation in response to various indications that such a program is needed and desired.
                    It should be of particular interest to both personnel and prospective personnel in the growing
                    number of local museums within Indiana.</p>
            <p>This basic instruction in museum work may be taken on a non-credit basis as well as for credit.
                    Inasmuch as enrollment must be limited in size in order to consider individual needs and situations,
                    early application is recommended.</p>
            <p>The enrollment fee for Indiana residents is $81 and for out of state residents,
                    $186 (whether taking the course for credit or non-credit). Persons wanting information

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Empirical Studies of Indiana Politics</hi> includes a series of articles which presents
                    statistical analyses of political behavior in Indiana, principally in relation to the state
                    legislature. More explicitly, these articles deal mainly with aspects of legislative behavior,
                    interactions and patterns of influence in the legislature, the recruitment of political leadership,
                    and political career building. Other articles suggest analytical methods that may be used in
                    investigating legislative behavior. The volume has a scholarly format which includes sundry tables
                    and figures, two technical appendices, explanatory and source footnotes, a lengthy bibliography, and
                    a reliable index.</p>
            <p>Data based studies which relate to a brief moment in time and to peculiar circumstances have limited
                    utility. Such studies do not provide an accurate description of political behavior over an extended
                    time period. The substantive articles in this book reflect this limitation. They are based upon data
                    collected during the early 1960s. Their conclusions are valid only for the unique circumstances that
                    existed when the information was obtained, <hi rend="i">e.g.,</hi> during the 1961 or 1963 Indiana
                    General Assembly session. The authors, of course, are quite aware of this fact. Indeed, one of the
                    objectives of the book is to encourage research which will yield broader based conclusions about
                    political behavior in state government than are offered in this volume. In order to promote this
                    kind of research the author of each substantive article describes the methods that he used in making
                    his findings and proposes additional avenues of inquiry. An appendix contains an extensive
                    questionaire which the authors used in gathering data and which others are encouraged to use for
                    similar purposes. The approaches described in the book can be used repeatedly over an extended
                    period of time. The replication of such investigation would produce data on political behavior
                    during a significant time span, <hi rend="i">e.g.,</hi> one including several legislative sessions.
                    The value of this volume may lie less in its substance than in the methods it proposes. A
                    statistical analysis of political behavior in Indiana over time has not been made. This book, should
                    it attract students interested in data based studies, may encourage research upon which such an
                    analysis could be made.</p>

            <p>Fishbaugh's <hi rend="i">From Paddle Wheels to Propellers</hi> is another book on
                    steamboating on the <geogName>western rivers</geogName>. The book is, however, unique in one
                    respect. While other efforts have related the story of steam-boating, Fishbaugh's work is
                    the first attempt, to this reviewer's knowledge, at putting down the story of building
                    steamboats.</p>
            <p>According to Fishbaugh <hi rend="i">From Paddle Wheels to Propellers</hi> is "concentrated
                    on the story of the Howard Ship Yards as they reflect the economic history of steam navigation of
                    the <geogName>Western Rivers</geogName>" (p. vi). The book accomplishes its objective
                    reasonably well. It offers along the way numerous interesting and testable hypotheses about
                    developments in steamboating on inland rivers. Of special interest to business and economic
                    historians are some of the data which Fishbaugh has gathered and presented, much of which was
                    integrated from a large collection of over 265,000 manuscripts on the Howard Ship Yards and Dock
                    Company and appears for the first time in published form.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">From Paddle Wheels to Propellers</hi> does have some flaws. For one, the book is too
                    superficial. The author spends too much effort developing the story of steamboating on the western
                    rivers and not enough effort on the story of the Howard Ship Yards. The story of steamboating has
                    long been skillfully documented and analyzed by others, such as Louis C. Hunter in <hi rend="i">Steamboats on the <geogName>Western Rivers</geogName>
               </hi> (1949). Consequently, Fishbaugh, who
                    relies heavily on Hunter's work, offers nothing new in the way of major findings. There is
                    still a need, however, for a study on the economics of steamboat construction on the firm level, and
                    this is where Fishbaugh might have made a major contribution with the remarkably large collection of
                    manuscripts which he had on hand.</p>
            <p>In some sections of the book incomplete research leads the author to draw conclusions which are not
                    fully supported by his evidence. For example, Fishbaugh argues that the Howard Ship Yards prospered
                    between 1834 and 1850 because it could build better hulls than its numerous competitors (p. 33). As
                    evidence for this assertion he points out that steamboats on the western rivers had an average
                    lifespan of five years while boats built by the Howard Ship Yards had a seven year life expectancy.
                    This assertion may not be warranted. In a recent unpublished dissertation at Purdue University, "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> Transportation, 1810-1860" (1969),
                    Erik <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-067-1-069"/> Haites calculates the lifespans of steamboats between 1810
                    and 1860 using the "Lytle List." Haites found that the averages for <hi rend="i">all</hi> western steamboats ranged between 4.9 and 5.0 for the years 1830-1849. On the other
                    hand steamboats which operated between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> had lifespans of 5.3 to 6.5 years for the same decades. Haites concluded that it was
                    safer to operate a steamboat on the lower <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> than on the
                    shallower tributary rivers. From Appendix A of Fishbaugh's book it appears that most of the
                    boats built by the Howard Ship Yards operated on the lower <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and hence could be expected to have longer life expectancies. Therefore, while the
                    Howard Ship Yards might well have produced better steamboats than its competitors,
                    Fishbaugh's evidence for such an assertion is somewhat insufficient.</p>

            <p>Two books more dissimilar in purpose, format, scope, and value than the two listed above are
                    difficult to imagine. Their common feature is the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie Canal, although it is not central to either and no new information about the
                    canal itself is offered by either. The Wilcox volume is quite clearly a vehicle for eighty-odd
                    sketches, drawings, and water color paintings made by the late artist-author several years ago. The
                    paintings are remarkably handsome and vibrant, and all depict <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> canal scenes; some are recreations of the days of bustling activity at a canal lock or
                    port; others are more contemporary evocations of neglected locks and sites. Historians are indeed
                    fortunate to have the Wilcox paintings, some of which are now in private collections, reproduced and
                    made generally available. A leading member of the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> School," Wilcox taught at that city's Art Institute for many years.
                    This and a previous publication reveal not only his fondness for rural <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName> but also his extraordinary talent as a watercolorist.</p>
            <p>Readers who come to this book, however, expecting something resembling a history of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> canals, which served primarily as early and vital links between Lake Erie and the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, will be <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-067-1-070"/> disappointed.
                    Wilcox' writing abilities were considerable, and he left a manuscript distinguished by
                    charmingly graceful and haunting descriptions of how the canals must have looked, what the color
                    harmonics must have been to the contemporary observer (the clear blue canal, the brassy green lock
                    water, the Indian red lock gates, the green shuttered houses nearby), and how the canals and canal
                    barges were built and operated. Yet the text in general is an unworthy companion of the
                    illustrations. Wilcox understood, as few do today, such complexities as the geographical
                    determinants of canal location, the technical difficulties of the engineers and contractors, and the
                    day to day problems of operation; but his account of individual canals in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> system–five of the nine chapters–is dated, incomplete,
                    unreliable, and often no more than sheer antiquarianism. Furthermore, many of the illustrations and
                    sketches, some obviously not intended by Wilcox for publication, are uncaptioned, there are no
                    footnotes to the text, and the most recent book listed in the bibliography was published in 1943,
                    the most recent article in 1947. One can understand Professor McGill's reluctance to tamper
                    with the Wilcox manuscript, but many revisions and updatings, particularly in the light of recent,
                    significant scholarship on the topic, were required. For a sound history of the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> canals could, after 1843, also journey into Indiana by way of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie Canal, a waterway which eventually stretched all the way from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toledo</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The first major city they would encounter along that route in Indiana was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it is a thesis of Professor Poinsatte's, amply demonstrated in his book,
                    that the canal was the key to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s development during the "middle period." But his study is
                    of the city, not the canal; and his chief undertaking is to examine some of the generalizations
                    about the West, particularly urban development in the West, in the light of one community's
                    experiences. He does this quite successfully, capably bridging the gap between the general and the
                    particular. This is a good example of the type of study needed to support new syntheses in urban and
                    regional history. Poinsatte's command of the primary sources is excellent, and he has
                    uncovered some choice new material for urban history in scattered, little used collections.</p>
            <p>The study dates from the closing of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "frontier phase" to the beginning of its railroad era.
                    After a fine, brief summary of the city's origins as both a military and trading center on
                    the ancient Maumee-<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> portage, Poinsatte describes the new impetus to growth, after loss of the Indian
                    agency, provided by the prospects of the canal. He then analyzes population growth, immigration, <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-067-1-071"/> and the contributions of newcomers to the city. The most
                    valuable sections of the book follow. The author discusses clearly and comprehensively economic and
                    political development as well as social and cultural patterns. He establishes a close relationship
                    between institutional religion and the various reform movements sweeping the country, especially
                    temperance and abolitionism. On the latter point the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> experience confirms the existence of an apparent contradiction (although, as the author
                    notes, a similar contradiction exists today): northerners could be strongly antislavery and racist,
                    or anti-Negro, at the same time. The slow progress in establishing a public school system and
                    adequate governmental institutions is also detailed here, and there are interesting sections on such
                    diverse topics as home architecture and plank roads, the establishment of the various denominational
                    churches, and the raw returns of the 1850 census on Allen County industry. Particularly noteworthy
                    are Poin-satte's careful descriptions of the actual pattern–as opposed to the
                    legislative pattern–of land disposal and of the systematic mistreatment of the Indians
                    regarding their land, their annuities, and their ultimate removal in 1847.</p>
            <p>This is, in short, a good and useful book. If it does not add to an understanding of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie Canal (the data here are taken from Benton's 1903 classic and a 1925
                    master's thesis at Indiana University), it does contribute to an understanding of urban
                    community growth in the West. The writing, although uninspiring, is careful and factual. Despite too
                    many long quotations (four chapters, including the last, end this way) and no bibliography, this
                    work is a worthy addition to its series.</p>

            <p>In this new volume in the <hi rend="i">Histories of the American Frontier</hi> series Reginald
                    Horsman has effectively synthesized extensive primary material and current historical scholarship.
                    To the task of elaborating American frontier history in the decisive years between the Revolution
                    and the War of 1812, Horsman brings considerable expertise. The author of four earlier studies on
                    this period (on American Indian policy, on British Indian agent Matthew Elliott, and two on the War
                    of 1812), he has an experienced feel for patterns of frontier development and the sources which
                    substantiate them.</p>
            <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-067-1-072"/>
            <p>Horsman's frontier covers the widespread territory from the backcountry of the original
                    thirteen states to the early trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> settlements in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. He goes beyond the Turnerian conception of the frontier as the cutting edge of
                    settlement and gives full treatment to more permanently established areas which had passed beyond
                    the initial stages of development. He emphasizes the diversity of the frontier
                    experience–a diversity stemming from variations in such things as terrain, fertility,
                    water supply, access to transportation, and Indian resistance. The traditional story of migration to
                    northern and southern frontiers is here, but so also are such essential topics as governmental
                    organization, Indian policy, frontier culture and society, western economic development, and foreign
                    policy.</p>
            <p>A number of unifying, interpretive themes run through the book and add to its overall impact and
                    utility. For example, the constant conflict between land speculators and frontier settlers had a
                    shaping influence on western development. Seeking immediate returns from one of its few resources,
                    the federal government sold tremendous frontier tracts at bargain prices to individual speculators
                    and land companies while the provisions of land laws worked against pioneer farmers. Widespread
                    squatting resulted, as well as a politically oriented drive for liberalized land laws. The less well
                    known struggle between settlers and territorial government forms a second theme of the book. The
                    Northwest Ordinance of 1787, a model applied throughout the West, established a colonial type
                    framework for territorial government and vested excessive powers in an appointive governor and
                    judges. In the second stage of territorial government frontier legislatures had difficulty in
                    bringing governors under popular control. However, the constitution making process in western
                    states, which often pitted frontier farmers against frontier aristocrats, resulted in partial
                    democratic victories in the form of liberalized provisions on voting, office holding, and
                    legislative apportionment.</p>
            <p>Woven through the book is an awareness of the importance of urban development in the West, a subject
                    first detailed by Bayrd Still in 1941 and more recently developed by Richard Wade in <hi rend="i">The Urban Frontier</hi> (1959). While Horsman avoids Wade's thesis that frontier towns
                    "spearheaded" the westward movement, he emphasizes the economic and cultural
                    significance of western cities once the hinterland was permanently settled. Other themes emerge in
                    the book as well, particularly conflict between Indian and American cultures and the international
                    complications stemming from the American presence in the West.</p>
            <p>Based upon a wide variety of primary materials (travel accounts, <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-067-1-073"/>
                    territorial papers, state documents, and the publications of state and local historical societies)
                    and the latest monographs, this is an able and well written study that admirably accomplishes its
                    goal of synthesis. Full documentation, an extensive bibliography, a workable index, and numerous
                    maps and illustrations further recommend the volume to general readers and scholars alike.</p>

            <p>For over two decades Ray Allen Billington's <hi rend="i">Westward Expansion</hi> has been
                    the mainstay of the university western history course. That fine work has now been supplemented by
                        <hi rend="i">America's Frontier Story,</hi> a chronicle of the westward movement as
                    recorded by its participants. The story is important, the editors note, "because it speaks
                    of the frontier spirit, the spirit of daring, of enterprise, of hope, that has become a part of the
                    American tradition–and has not been completely weathered away by the substitution of an
                    industrial-urban environment in the twentieth century" (p. vi).</p>
            <p>Although it can stand on its own merits, <hi rend="i">America's Frontier Story</hi> is
                    evidently intended for use as a companion to <hi rend="i">Westward Expansion</hi> and should be
                    welcomed by students and instructors alike. Indeed, the chapters in each work follow a similar
                    pattern, tracing the course of expansion from the arrival of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the Americas into the twentieth century. The readings, however, are confined almost
                    entirely to the traditional story of the westward movement. Except for photographs, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>
                    </placeName> and Alaska go unnoticed, and there is almost a total absence of material on minority
                    groups other than the Indian. This is somewhat surprising since the textbook contains a chapter on
                    slavery in the West. To help make the study of western history more relevant in this era of student
                    activism it would have been appropriate to include documents about the role of the Chinese, the
                    Mexican-American, and the Negro in the frontier story.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">America's Frontier Story</hi> surpasses the textbook in the magnificent
                    portfolio of some fifty photographs which in themselves document the camera's westward
                    movement. The large number of pictures also no doubt accounts for the high cost of this paperbound
                    book. Nevertheless, here Alaska and the minority groups are well represented, with pictures of Negro
                    homesteaders in <placeName>

            <p>The story of Governor John Evans is well known in western history. In many respects the most
                    interesting of all the famous names connected with <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName> Territory, Evans was a curious combination of dreamer, promoter, and man of action. In
                    an age of political spoilsmen and unscrupulous businessmen Evans was an anomaly, notwithstanding his
                    occasional surrender to expediency and vindictiveness. This biography by Harry E. Kelsey, which
                    supplements and, in many ways, revises the early study (1924) by Edgar C. McMechen, is welcome.</p>
            <p>A physician, founder of universities, humanitarian, businessman, railroad builder, and politician,
                    Evans attained prominence in three states–Indiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName>. He combined a religious commitment to the betterment of society with an ambition for
                    worldly place and fortune. He launched a successful movement for the establishment of the first
                    mental hospital in Indiana, took a leading part in the founding of Northwestern University, invested
                    in real estate in both <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evanston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and became the director of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad, foreshadowing his great railroad achievements in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Throughout his life Evans had an amazing ability to shut out the immediate past and move to new
                    adventure. In 1862 he journeyed from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName> where he served as territorial governor and where he made a fortune in real estate and
                    railroad construction. Although his term as chief executive was short lived and complicated by his
                    handling of Indian relations, his achievements were relatively impressive considering the
                    vacillating governmental policies and meddling Indian Bureau politicians. The author concludes that
                    Evans was removed from office in 1865 because of political pressure in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> rather than from his inability to handle the Indian problem. <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-067-1-075"/> Although Evans remained active in Republican party politics, his
                    primary concerns were the economic development of <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName> and the attainment of economic self-interests. His business ability and prestige were
                    determining factors in bringing railroad facilities to the state. Evans organized and built three
                    main railroads, including the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> that eventually gave <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName> an outlet to the Gulf of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>. His boundless energy also found expression in the building of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in the creation of the <placeName>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Frontier Capitalist</hi> makes especially useful contributions toward interpreting the
                    nineteenth century business rationale and filling some of the enormous lacunae in our knowledge of
                    the economic growth and development of the American West. The book is also a worthwhile study of
                    capitalism at work on the frontier. It reveals how, through the ambitious dreams of one man and the
                    instrumentality of agents, capital, and the products of capital investments– especially
                    railroads–contributed measurably toward booming <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a small mountain town, into a city of metropolitan proportions during the last quarter
                    of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Kelsey has written a critical but not unsympathetic biography. He develops his subject by exposition
                    rather than by interpretation, and he is objective in presentation, no easy task in some of the
                    complicated and controversial events he encounters. Not all, however, will agree with the author
                    that Evans refrained from the manipulation of men and money in the advancement of his schemes for
                    wealth or that he received the appointment as territorial governor because of his prominence in the
                    Republican party and widespread experience in politics prior to 1862. Nevertheless, none will deny
                    that Evans was worthy of a new biography, and most will agree that this study is in most respects a
                    thoroughly satisfactory account.</p>
            <p>Originally written as a doctoral dissertation, Kelsey's volume contains copious footnotes
                    and an impressive bibliography which are evidences of thorough research. However, the writing is
                    frequently heavy and pedantic as insignificant details sometimes interrupt the flow of events. Had
                    the author limited the requirement to document virtually every statement, the study could have been
                    turned into an exciting biography. The footnotes–totaling 1,442–which in this
                    volume should have been at the bottom of the page, have been relegated to the back of the book.
                    Although this format is economical for the publisher, it definitely annoys the reader.</p>

            <p>This is a collection of eighteen background papers written by political scientists, law teachers, and
                    lawyers to stimulate independent thinking by the delegates to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Constitutional Convention which convened in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> on December 8, 1969. The book's purpose obviously is not to prepare a proposed
                    draft of a new constitution but to furnish 1970 ideas and guidelines to delegates seeking to replace
                    the document produced by the last successful effort in 1870.</p>
            <p>To review each paper separately would be of little value. The net result of the collection is the
                    presentation of a broad range of historical facts, methods, and policy considerations. Inevitably
                    there is some repetition, but that does not detract from the value of the collection. For example,
                    the paper on the legislative article would be incomplete without consideration of the consequences
                    of the executive veto power. However, the paper on the executive article would be equally incomplete
                    if no consideration was given to the executive veto. The paper on urban problems necessarily
                    includes a discussion on public finance and the legal aspects of revenue although both of these
                    topics are properly allotted their separate papers.</p>
            <p>The first paper quite appropriately deals with the nature and purpose of the state constitution in
                    general, making a case for brevity and the enunciation of principles and for leaving many details to
                    the more flexible direction of the legislature. Even though a separate paper deals exclusively with
                    a state Bill of Rights, the introductory paper points out that such a section may protect more
                    strongly than the first eight amendments to the federal Constitution, in which the rights guaranteed
                    have gradually been extended to state action under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
            <p>The paper on the General Assembly discusses the unique <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> method of electing members to the House of Representatives under the present
                    constitution. In each of fifty-nine districts one senator and three representatives are elected. In
                    electing members of the House each voter has three votes. Instead of voting for three candidates,
                    however, he may cast his three votes for only one. The result of this cumulative voting system has
                    been to make the typical party division in the House a very close thing.</p>
            <p>The remaining papers cover a broad variety of topics. In one, the problems of guaranteeing civil
                    rights are carefully explored, and the historical background, both federal and state, is reviewed.
                    In <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-067-1-077"/> another the various aspects of the right of
                    suffrage–such as age, citizenship, residence, and literacy–are surveyed, and
                    comparisons with requirements in other states are noted. In a third the method of judicial selection
                    and removal and the organization of the courts are discussed, and some recommendations are
                    suggested. Local government outside Cook County (<placeName>

                    constitution should do about them receives major attention. The controversial issue of how much
                    "home rule" local government should have is thoughtfully presented. Of course all
                    these problems are inextricably intertwined with the methods of public finance and the legal aspects
                    of revenue and the methods of taxation and exemption therefrom. The discussions on these topics
                    produce more problems than answers.</p>
            <p>Three papers deal with regulation of business, namely, corporations, banks and warehouses, and
                    transportation. The paper on regulation of transportation points out the problems raised by any

                    constitutional article on education and criticizes some of the content of the article in the present
                    constitution. The dilemma seems really to be over which elements of the problem are so fundamental
                    that they should be set out in the constitution and which should be left to the legislature. The
                    final paper deals with the amending process.</p>

            <p>From the pulpit, the bar, the commencement platform, and the stump, two generations of speakers
                    captivated audiences on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> frontier with their colorful metaphors, earthy humor, and homely illustrations.
                    Utilizing the thesis that "the process of testing and popularizing ideas of democracy is
                    most clearly traced in the rhetoric of the frontier speaker" (p. xi), Frances McCurdy
                    analyzes a significant number of formal and informal speeches delivered between 1803 and 1850.
                    Noting the assumptions, reasoning, strategems, <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-067-1-078"/> and language
                    favored by Missourians to persuade their listeners, she concludes that "the sovereign power
                    of the people, the mobility of classes, the glorious future of the West, and the virtue of
                    landholding were no more questioned … than was reverence due to motherhood, God, and
                    country" (p. 186).</p>
            <p>Using a topical organization, McCurdy tests her thesis by examining the rhetoric of six disparate
                    types of speakers. By preaching that all men (save black men) were equal in the sight of God,
                    frontier ministers promoted Jacksonian democracy as well as decency and morality. Although they
                    fought against popular control of judicial processes, lawyers often proclaimed the merits of
                    democracy in their courtroom pleas. The candidate for public office was forced to repeat his love
                    for republican principles since to be accused of despising the common man was worse than to be
                    charged with hog stealing. Once elected, public officials had to explain their votes on
                    controversial questions to their constituents. Even the addresses of student orators echoed
                    Jacksonian ideals. Seeing themselves as a people chosen by God to inhabit the best governed country
                    in the world, they predicted for themselves a future filled with promise. On ceremonial occasions
                    speakers repeated encomiums to the common man's wisdom and virtue, praised democratic
                    principles, and encouraged optimism about the growth and development of the country.</p>
            <p>Ten years of research support McCurdy's conclusions. She has examined a considerable number
                    of often hard to find speech manuscripts and newspaper accounts of speechmaking activities. Her
                    narrative is generally well organized, and a dry humor adds to the readability of the book. The
                    reader may be disappointed that, although the narrative covers a fifty year period, McCurdy makes
                    little or no effort to trace the development of ideas or to show changes in persuasive techniques.
                    She treats ceremonial addresses, courtroom pleadings, and antislavery sermons statically, rather
                    than attempting to show their development over the years or to explain their lack of change. McCurdy
                    also has a slight tendency to overgeneralize from her data. Thus she will use a plural subject,
                    "speakers," but will note only one speech (pp. 37, 39). This reviewer has the
                    feeling that she could cite many other examples of the same type, but she does not.</p>
            <p>Despite such shortcomings McCurdy's selection of speeches and anecdotes vividly recreates
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> frontier. The reader relives a time when the common man, in speeches at least, reigned
                    supreme, when legal arguments were worth listening to, and when students debating the question:
                    "Is the mind of man superior to that of woman?" quickly decided in the
                    affirmative.</p>

            <p>Many reform movements are remembered only for their eccentricities and failures; their positive
                    contributions remain buried. In this book Louise Noun does a thorough job of uncovering the
                    accomplishments and disappointments of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> suffragists during Reconstruction and the years that immediately followed. The
                    author's purposes in selecting one state for a comprehensive study are to show how a
                    women's suffrage movement developed within a state and to examine what effects the
                    personalities and actions of nationally known leaders had upon a young regional organization.</p>
            <p>The emergence of the women's suffrage movement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, says the author, "was a direct outgrowth of agitation in the early
                    1840's for amelioration of the legal disabilities" (p. 57). From 1840-1860 the
                    rights of women were increased; yet many concerned women's rights advocates could cite
                    numerous laws which unjustly discriminated against women. Convinced that the only true way to alter
                    their unequal position in society was through voting, suffragists in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> after the Civil War urged their state congressmen to pass an amendment granting women
                    the ballot. The women, however, were warned not to impede the drive for Negro suffrage with demands
                    for their own enfranchisement. " ‘This is the Negro's Hour, they were
                    told. The Negro once safe, woman comes next,’ was the catch phrase of the
                    moment" (p. 36). Hopeful that suffrage would be granted their sex after the ratification of
                    the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, suffragists for the second time in five years introduced a bill to
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> legislature. While the amendment was passed by the state congress in 1870, it was
                    defeated by the legislature of 1872. The author blames the defeat of this bill on several factors:
                    the "scolding" rhetoric of the women, the rampant dissension that plagued both the
                    state and national movement, and the unfavorable publicity the suffrage movement received by having
                    in its ranks Victoria Woodhull, a notorious free love advocate (p. 221). Only twice after the
                    General Assembly first approved a women's suffrage amendment in 1870 did the legislature
                    again approve such an amendment, and in intervening years the measure was killed in the House or
                    Senate by one or two unexpected votes. In spite of the persistent efforts and the dedicated
                    leadership of such outstanding suffrage personalities as Amelia Bloomer, Annie Savery, Jane
                    Swisshelm, and Carrie Chapman Catt, a suffrage amendment was not ratified in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> until June 2, 1919.</p>
            <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-067-1-080"/>
            <p>Unlike many overzealous authors who write on women's suffrage, Noun presents the entire
                    movement in a scholarly detached manner. Because she has done an exhaustive job researching this
                    subject, she adds much new information to the history of both the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> and national women's suffrage movements. Her personality sketches of the
                    suffragists are colorful and informative, and the illustrations and drawings she includes in the
                    text add flavor to her story.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the major flaw of this book is that it fails to emphasize adequately the role played by
                    liquor interests in defeating suffrage proposals. The author should have emphasized that suffrage
                    was defeated many times partially if not primarily because of the liquor industries' strong
                    opposition. While the author does make two illusions to this factor, the concept is never fully
                    developed. In spite of this slight deficiency Noun is to be commended for what should prove a
                    significant contribution to the knowledge of the women's suffrage movement in the <placeName>

            <p>This collection of scholarly articles is an outgrowth of the Twentieth Conference on Early American
                    History held at Rutgers University in October, 1966, at which time Richard S. Dunn, Stanley N. Katz,
                    David Alan Williams, and Richael Kammen delivered papers, here published, on the theme of
                    Anglo-colonial political relations in the century preceding the American Revolution. For the purpose
                    of this volume the editors solicited additional articles from David S. Lovejoy, Thomas C. Barrow,
                    and John Shy and a bibliographical essay by Joseph E. Illick. The editors themselves contributed
                    introductory essays: Olson summarizes the studies and points out future lines of inquiry while Brown
                    places them within a behavioral, analytical framework. The essays by Kammen, Dunn, Katz, and Barrow
                    have been preempted by their subsequent fuller publications, either in book or article form. In
                    themselves the contributions by the other authors are valuable for their particular content. The
                    bibliographical piece by Illick shows an admirable grasp of the recent literature, but given the
                    limitations of space it cannot do justice to the monographs discussed. It is nonetheless a good
                    introduction for students who wish to delve further into the field. In her introductory essay
                    Professor Olson is perhaps too quick to accept conclusions from limited <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-067-1-081"/> evidence and study. Citing the work of Katz to the effect that the Duke
                    of Newcastle's appointments in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> were "abysmal" she suggests that a comparison of his appointees with
                    those of the Marquis of Halifax, usually considered a superb administrator, would show that there
                    was little difference between the governors nominated by the two ministers. But surely this is too
                    limited a sample. Moreover whatever the quality of Newcastle's appointments for <placeName>

            <p>Taken together these essays implicitly attack the notion that for most of the century there were
                    American as distinct from imperial or English interests and that colonial political developments
                    were institutional or ideological, occurring within the local rather than the imperial framework.
                    They demonstrate further the extent to which American politicians sought to use English connections
                    to advance their particular interests. In this respect the studies diverge from the imperial
                    "school" which sees a pattern in the rise of the provincial legislatures at the
                    expense of imperial and executive authority. Olson attempts to bridge this gap, but this reviewer is
                    not convinced that there did indeed develop in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> during the last two decades preceding the American Revolution pressure groups which
                    reduced the chances for compromise and accommodation, or that separate English and American interest
                    groups self-consciously began to develop by the middle of the century and so broke down the
                    Anglo-colonial connection. The research done by Katz on the period before the outset of the Seven
                    Years' War indeed goes far to confirm such a connection, but it can hardly be used to
                    sustain an argument for developments after 1753. Nor does the work of Kammen on the years after
                    1755, published here and elsewhere, sustain the thesis as the operations of a host of agents, land
                    speculators, office seekers, and merchants testify.</p>

            <p>Hannibal Hamlin was a respectable public mediocrity of the mid nineteenth century, a man for neither
                    the best nor worst of times, a man of neither the best talents nor the worst incapacities. He was
                    popular with his <placeName>

                    which was the prerogative of a senator, he assiduously kept his political fences mended. Indeed, <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-067-1-082"/> one of his two chief complaints about the vice presidency was
                    that it rendered him unable to help his friends who, failing to understand that the prestige of his
                    office carried no power with it, might mistake his inability to provide for them with an
                    unwillingness to do so. His second complaint was the more traditional one of the futility of serving
                    as a spare life–of having no responsibility, no influence on decisions, few duties, and
                    those chiefly ceremonial and altogether boring. His attendance as presiding officer of the Senate,
                    for example, was much inferior to his attendance record as a senator. In the latter position he had
                    been able to participate in activities as a "working senator"; in the former he,
                    and therefore others, regarded his presence as superfluous.</p>
            <p>During Hamlin's early years as a politician he was a conscientious worker and a loyal party
                    man for the Democracy, but by the late 1840s his opposition to the extension of slavery made him
                    feel uncomfortable within his own party. Endorsement of the <placeName>

                    the Republicans. In 1856 he campaigned energetically for John Charles Frémont and for

                    </placeName> Senate, and the rest was inevitable. As a former Democrat and a resident of an area
                    complementary to the western locality of the presidential candidate, Hamlin was nominated to the
                    ticket with Abraham Lincoln in 1860. By 1864 he had decided that another four years of idleness was
                    preferable to challenging his old rival in <placeName>

                    the appeal of the administration by adding a southerner and a War Democrat to it. In spite of
                    disappointment Hamlin campaigned faithfully and was rewarded with the collectorship of <placeName>

                    brought him a "portion of patronage loaves and fishes [that] satisfied even his hearty
                    appetite" (p. 209). Hamlin closed his political career as ambassador to <placeName>

            <p>The book is an exceptionally thorough and a particularly well reasoned political biography. Apart
                    from a few irritatingly clever thumbnail sketches the author writes both forcefully and

                    the reader.</p>

                    </placeName>: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1969. Pp. x, 107. Frontispiece, notes, index.
                    $5.95.)</head>
            <p>In this brief, overpriced volume Robert Divine offers four carefully reasoned essays in which he
                    attempts "to reappraise Roosevelt's policy in regard to World War II" (p.
                    x). This material was originally presented as the Albert Shaw Lectures in Diplomatic History at the
                    Johns Hopkins University in April of 1968.</p>
            <p>Divine differs sharply with the standard interpretation of Franklin Roosevelt as a Wilsonian
                    internationalist who was forced to play a semiisolationist role in the 1930s in order to appease a
                    vociferous isolationist majority. Not so at all says Divine; Roosevelt really was an isolationist,
                    not out of political expediency but out of "genuine conviction" (p. 7). Not until
                    the end of 1938, in the aftermath of the Munich crisis, did Roosevelt move in the direction of
                    internationalism.</p>
            <p>As for Roosevelt's alleged belief in Wilsonian notions of collective security, the author
                    contends that Roosevelt steadily shifted away from the collective security beliefs he had professed
                    up to 1920. Thus, Divine sees Roosevelt's disavowal of the League of Nations in 1932 not so
                    much as an expedient surrender to the demands of William Randolph Hearst but as "the
                    culmination of Roosevelt's gradual disenchantment" with the League (p. 56).
                    Disillusioned by the League's failure to act effectively in the 1930s, Roosevelt envisioned
                    that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Britain, Russia, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> would be the policemen of the postwar world. In light of the failure of the United
                    Nations to keep the peace in the postwar years it is increasingly difficult to fault
                    Roosevelt's judgment.</p>
            <p>Neither right nor left–old or new versions–will like Divine's
                    interpretation of Roosevelt's wartime relations with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-ur">Soviet Union</country>
                    </placeName>. In the author's view, FDR was not a naive egotistical American politician who
                    thought he could charm Joseph Stalin into submission but a calculating pragmatist who throughout the
                    war fought valiantly to preserve allied unity for the peace that was to come. Admittedly, Roosevelt
                    failed to achieve this, but Divine maintains that Roosevelt's efforts "threw the
                    onus for the Cold War squarely upon Stalin" (p. 98).</p>
            <p>This reviewer finds Divine least persuasive when he says that Roosevelt was an isolationist in the
                    1930s. Even a cursory reading <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-067-1-084"/> of Edgar Nixon's three
                    volumes, <hi rend="i">Franklin D. Roosevelt and Foreign Affairs</hi> (1969), reveals that Roosevelt
                    had a very deep interest in foreign affairs even in the earliest years of the New Deal and that as
                    early as 1934 he was greatly troubled by the growing belligerence of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. His replies to the alarm filled letters of Ambassador William E. Dodd indicate that he
                    felt helplessly stymied by the great isolationist strength in <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName>. Roosevelt's letters reveal a curious mixture of reluctant isolationism and
                    timid internationalism. The evidence is far from conclusive, and one can still make a very strong
                    case à la Basil Rauch that Roosevelt was a most reluctant isolationist. On balance, this
                    interpretation continues to be more plausible to this reviewer. Nevertheless, this is a stimulating
                    little book that can be read with much profit by both Roosevelt's admirers and his
                    detractors.</p>

            <p>This is a disappointing book, primarily because the author has attempted the difficult, if not
                    impossible, task of combining detailed historical narrative with a description and analysis of the
                    current plight of the American railroads. Roughly one half the book is a chronological account of
                    the geographical diffusion of the railroad in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from the time the first track was laid to the present. The remainder is concerned with
                    the two main problems facing the railroads: diminishing demand for passenger service (Chapters 7 and
                    8) and vigorous competition for freight traffic (Chapter 9). The author reserves the final chapter
                    to speculate on the future of the railway industry. There is not likely to be any quarrel with his
                    conclusion: "American railroads are still viable today. Tomorrow's <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName> will still have many transportation chores which can most efficiently be performed by
                    railroads" (p. 293).</p>
            <p>John Stover, who is professor of history at Purdue University, is more successful in setting out the
                    historical narrative than he is in diagnosing and prescribing for the chronically sick railroads.
                    The critical weakness of his diagnosis of current railway ills is the lack of any framework of
                    economic analysis within which to place these problems and by which to evaluate their significance.
                    He recites all of the reasons that have been put forward to explain the disappearance of the
                    railroad passenger coach in the sixties: featherbedding practices of labor, competition from road
                    and air transport, bungling administration by the regulatory agencies, but he gives no hint how <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-067-1-085"/> these various causes should be evaluated. Nor does he provide
                    the hard evidence which would allow the reader to do it for himself. Perhaps the most glaring gap in
                    Stover's historical account of the role played by the railroad in American economic
                    development is his failure to mention the distinguished contributions of Albert Fishlow and Robert
                    Fogle, two young American economic historians who have done much to pump some new life into this old
                    and tarnished subject.</p>
            <p>The book has many organizational weaknesses which were probably inevitable considering the nature of
                    the two different tasks the author undertook. The first four chapters pursue the story of the
                    railroad down to the present. The narrative is abruptly broken off in Chapter 5 by a very brief
                    history of the rise of the railroad's greatest competitors: the electric interurban, the
                    automobile and truck, the airplane, the pipeline, and barge and tow freight traffic. The author then
                    returns in Chapter 6 to a detailed description of the development of the railroad during and between
                    both world wars. Fully two thirds of this chapter dwells on the twenty-six months of federal control
                    during and immediately after World War I. Three pages are devoted to the interwar years!</p>
            <p>Perhaps the occasion for the book explains the duality of the author's purpose.
                    Stover's work is a contribution to the celebration of the centennial year (1969) of
                    transcontinental railroading.</p>

            <p>This is no mere biography. The stuff of biography is here: the relationships of William H. Prescott
                    to his clan, to individual members of the family, and to his multitude of relatives and friends are
                    so carefully elaborated that the reader emerges thoroughly familiar with them all. William was so
                    completely a Prescott that this aspect of his life cannot be divorced from his career as a writer.
                    Gardiner has admirably woven Prescott's family, social, business, and meager political life
                    into his story in such a way that, in spite of the quantity of space it occupies in the biography,
                    it does not in the slightest detract from the central theme: Prescott the intellectual.</p>
            <p>Above all, Gardiner's book is an intellectual journey, the kind of book Prescott with his
                    peculiar family orientation might have written about himself if he had known and attempted to ape <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry</region>
                    </placeName> Adam's <hi rend="i">Education.</hi> Throughout his study Gardiner has kept
                    himself in the <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-067-1-086"/> background. But he is too capable a historian to
                    produce an uncritical puff. Fortunately for his biographer, Prescott was aware of most of his
                    weaknesses, and whenever Gardiner wishes to level criticism at his subject with respect to such
                    characteristics as procrastination and frequent indecision, quotations from Prescott are introduced
                    which suffice. In his own estimations of Prescott's work Gardiner is detached and honest.
                    He is at his best in elaborating the influence of the heroic epic on Prescott's conception
                    of history.</p>
            <p>Given the proportions of this review it would be wholly unfair to introduce the reviewer's
                    minor disagreements and reservations. In the main only one question which Gardiner does not answer
                    occurs: why did Prescott not go to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> on his second–and last–trip to Europe? As biography and an
                    intellectual history the work is superb. Gardiner, it seems, is the latest in the multitude of
                    gifted men who have loyally and ably served William H. Prescott.</p>

            <p>Blues, in this little book which he calls an essay, discusses most of the materials relevant to his
                    topic, although he concentrates on the novel which is pivotal to any critic's assessment of
                    Mark Twain– <hi rend="i">A <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>

                    because Mark Twain's attitude toward the stable world of societal values was ambiguous, his
                    early boy heroes triumph over the community without being expelled from it. Just as he allows Tom
                    Sawyer to "fetch" St. Petersburg, which even lionizes his duplicities and
                    transgressions, so does he transform a larger society in <hi rend="i">Huckleberry Finn</hi>
                    "to grant Huck his triumph over it without really threatening

                    creator's views on technological progress as opposed to mindless medievalism,
                    "breaks with the community, attempts to destroy it, and ends his life in isolation and
                    despair" (p. 38). The delicate balance between the individual and the community, once
                    shattered in this novel, disappears completely in Mark Twain's later work with the use of
                    the "old-man" narrator, the cynical tutor who teaches that society is utterly
                    contemptible, self-delusive, and dangerous.</p>

                    the critics' difficulty with late Mark Twain lies, of course, in the heavy handed
                    conception of his truth tellers as only pieces of "machinery." Even
                    Blues' admirable reading of "The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg" cannot
                    make that story better than the moralistic bore it is.</p>
            <p>Although his general conclusions about both the progressively bitter views of Mark Twain and the
                    mixed success of his fiction offer nothing significantly new, Blues' imaginatively
                    sustained and substantiated thesis does. And in going against the practice of even the best
                    scholars, he is to be praised for insisting on the use of the full <hi rend="i">Mark Twain</hi>

            <p>This is an amateur, popular history of the role some Poles have played in American history, with
                    heavy emphasis upon the activities of individuals–some well known (such as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pulaski</region>

                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>. It is filled with a marvelous variety of information, some relevant and some not. It
                    breathes a patriotic spirit not fashionable these days, even among Americans of Polish origin, and
                    it has an old fashioned reverence toward the old heroes, such as Kosciuszko, to whom twenty-six
                    pages are devoted. It is remarkably fair and objective in its treatment of Russian rule over <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName> and of the conflict between Irish Catholics and Polish Catholics in this country. The
                    brief treatment of the Polish National Catholic Church is also remarkably objective.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Poles in American History and Tradition</hi> is the product of an unskilled but devoted
                    historian. It is badly organized and lacks coherence except for the concentration upon military
                    conflict. It provides almost no political or social analysis, and it concentrates upon outstanding
                    or prominent individuals such as Mojeska, Sophie Tucker, and Barney Balaban. It confuses the history
                    of the Poles who remained under foreign rule with those who immigrated to the United <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-067-1-088"/> States. Thus, Krasinski, Chopin, Sienkiewicz, and Paderewski are
                    treated as though they were Americans. The bibliography is alphabetical and uncritical; it lumps
                    together books of all kinds with journal articles and newspaper articles, and it is by no means
                    complete.</p>
            <p>In short, this is an unsatisfactory volume even for the popularization function for which it was
                    designed.</p>

                    large role in organizing the national banking system during the Civil War and later served as
                    secretary of the treasury under Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, and James A. Garfield. This volume
                    gives major attention to topics regarding banking and federal finances, but much is also said about
                    political, cultural, and social matters. Though a Republican, McCulloch was a vigorous critic of his
                    party's high tariff following the Civil War. Here is a volume which merits augmented

                    available Owen's two messages to Congress early in 1825 and his Fourth of July address at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1826. In his congressional addresses Owen discussed his plans for his new society

                    </placeName>. On the Fourth of July he stressed the need for acquiring mental liberty as the
                    greatest of all blessings. The commentary about Owen and his addresses, however, should be examined
                    with care since Johnson is at times overzealous in his interpretations. For instance, it may well be
                    that William E. Wilson's presentation of Owen's views concerning slavery and his
                    attitudes toward Negroes is vulnerable, but, if so, Johnson's rebuttal is lame and
                    inadequate to support his contrary views (pp. 12-13).</p>

                    "A family to show a Secretary of State, two ministers abroad, a senator, a major general,
                    three authors, two governors and four representatives in Congress distributed among five brothers,
                    gives proof of a power of success above other families" (p. 5). Actually there were seven
                    Washburn brothers, all born at The Norlands, <placeName>

                    brothers: <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. All three were successful politicians; one in addition was a military man. All three
                    became wealthy, and all were influential contributors to the society in which they lived. Originally
                    published in 1925, Hunt's volume leaves much to be desired in the way of editing. Footnotes
                    are sparse, locations of letters are not given, editing procedure is not explained. But the three
                    brothers, their continuing devotion to family and birthplace, their active interest and
                    participation in national and state affairs, and their importance to American history are vividly
                    revealed. <hi rend="i">Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    materials gathered during the Campaigns … [of the Civil War], and from the
                    writer's personal recollections" (Preface). Knox comments on varied topics, from
                    battles–mostly in the western theatre–to northern and southern sentiment
                    concerning the war. He covers many important non-military aspects of the conflict: the attitudes and
                    influence of southern women, characteristics of the Negroes, the journalists' role in the
                    war, Indians and trappers in the Northwest, the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> and its
                    peculiarities. Knox also leased a southern cotton plantation in one of the occupied areas, a
                    practice frequently employed to produce cotton and to care for Negroes crowding into northern lines,
                    and he records his reactions to this unique experience. Written in a nineteenth century journalistic
                    style, <hi rend="i">Camp-Fire and Cotton-Field</hi> contributes little to specific knowledge of the
                    Civil War. It does, however, provide interesting sidelights on people and incidents during the
                    conflict–not the least interesting of which concern Knox himself. <hi rend="i">Lorna

                    respectively. In the preface to <hi rend="i">The Mystery of Metropolisville</hi> Eggleston states
                    his belief that the purpose of his fiction is "as a contribution to the history <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-067-1-094"/> of civilization in <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. 7). For present day readers Eggleston's value resides in the
                    fact that he attained his goal and "portrayed correctly certain forms of American life and
                    manners" <hi rend="i">(Mystery of Metropolisville,</hi> p. 7). <hi rend="i">Roxy</hi>
                    belongs to a series of the Gregg Press conceived to make available such nineteenth century works of
                    fiction "important to the study of American folklore, culture and literary
                    history" (endpaper). Both of these Eggleston novels portray the Midwest: <hi rend="i">Roxy</hi> is a realistic treatment of frontier life in Indiana; <hi rend="i">The Mystery of
                        Metropolisville</hi> is more of a melodrama set in <placeName>

                    for this reprint, but there is no explanation or publication history to explain the selection. With
                        <hi rend="i">Roxy</hi> it is not clear what edition has been used. Both works are presumably
                    photographically reproduced and retain the original illustrations, interesting and typical of
                    nineteenth and early twentieth century publications. The ready availability of out of print works
                    makes such reprints a worthwhile contribution to the general and educational book markets. <hi rend="i">Pamela J. Bennett, Indiana University, <placeName>

            <p>The recently organized Hendricks County Historical Society is interested in receiving any documents
                    related to either Central Normal or Canterbury colleges. Such contributions would be cataloged and
                    kept in the Danville Public Library. The Society hopes to develop a permanent collection of related
                    institutional materials, and the library would provide a secure centralized location for them.
                    Inquiries and materials should be addressed to Miss Ina B. Shaw, Librarian, Danville Public Library,
                    Danville, Indiana 46122.</p>
            <p>Walden S. Freeman, associate professor of history at William Woods College, is doing research on the
                    political activities of Will H. Hays, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName> Republican leader, chairman of the Indiana State Republican Central Committee
                    (1914-1918), chairman of the Indiana State Council of Defense (1917-1918), chairman of the
                    Republican National Committee (1918-1921), and Postmaster General (1921-1922). From 1922 through the
                    1940s, Hays was best known for his work as president of the Motion Picture Producers and
                    Distributors of America (the "Hays Office"), but he continued to participate in
                    political activities in an informal way. Freeman's primary concern is Hays'
                    interest in international organization: the League of Nations, the United Nations, and international
                    religious and motion picture associations. Information on all aspects of Hays' life prior
                    to 1919 is also desired inasmuch as the Hays Papers in the Indiana State Library are far from
                    complete for this period. Please address all correspondence to Walden S. Freeman, Department of
                    History, William Woods College, <placeName>
