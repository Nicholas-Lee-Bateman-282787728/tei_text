                ACT I
                HALL OF WYNNSTAY HOUSE.
                Twelve o’clock, Sunday morning, end of June. With the rising of
                    the Curtain, enter the BUTLER. As he is going, with majestic port, to answer the
                    door L., enter briskly from the garden, by lower French window, LADY JOHN
                    WYNNSTAY, flushed, and flapping a garden hat to fan herself. She is a
                    pink?cheeked woman of fifty?four, who has plainly been a beauty, keeps her
                    complexion, but is “gone to fat.”
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Has Miss Levering come down yet?
                
                
                    BUTLER
                    (pausing C.).
                    I haven’t seen her, m’lady.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (almost sharply as BUTLER turns L.).
                    I won’t have her disturbed if she’s resting. (To herself as
                            she goes to writing?table.) She certainly needs it.
                
                
                    BUTLER.
                    Yes, m’lady.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (sitting at writing?table, her back to front door).
                    But I want her to know the moment she comes down that the new plans arrived
                        by morning post.
                
                
                    BUTLER
                    (pausing nearly at the door).
                    Plans, m’la—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    She’ll understand. There they are.
                        (Glancing at the clock.) It’s very important she
                        should have them in time to look over them before she goes— (BUTLER opens the door L.)
                        (Over her shoulder.) Is that Miss Levering?
                
                
                    BUTLER.
                    No, m’lady. Mr. Farnborough.
                
                [Exit BUTLER.
                (Enter the HON. R. FARNBOROUGH. He is twenty?six; reddish hair,
                    high?coloured, sanguine, self?important.)
                
                    FARNBOROUGH.
                    I’m afraid I’m scandalously early. It didn’t take me nearly as long to motor
                        over as Lord John said.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (shaking hands).
                    I’m afraid my husband is no authority on motoring—and he’s not home yet from
                        church.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    It’s the greatest luck finding you. I thought Miss Levering was
                        the only person under this roof who was ever allowed to observe Sunday as a
                        real Day of Rest.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    If you’ve come to see Miss Levering—
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Is she here? I give you my word I did’t know it.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (unconvinced).
                    Oh?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Does she come every week?end?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Whenever we can get her to. But we’ve only known her a couple of months.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    And I have only known her three weeks! Lady John, I’ve come to ask you to
                        help me.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (quickly).
                    With Miss Levering? I can’t do it!
                
                
                    FARN.
                    No, no—all that’s no good. She only laughs.
                
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (relieved).
                    Ah!—she looks upon you as a boy.
                
                
                    FARN
                    (firing up).
                    Such rot! What do you think she said to me in London the other day?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    That she was four years older than you?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Oh, I knew that. No. She said she knew she was all the charming things I’d
                        been saying, but there was only one way to prove it—and that was to marry
                        some one young enough to be her son. She’d noticed that was what the
                            most attractive women did—and she named names.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (laughing).
                    You were too old!
                
                
                    FARN.
                    (nods).
                    Her future husband, she said, was probably just entering Eton.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Just like her!
                
                
                    FARN.
                    (waving the subject away).
                    No. I wanted to see you about the Secretaryship.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    You didn’t get it then?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    No. It’s the grief of my life.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Oh, if you don’t get one you’ll get another.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    But there is only one.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Only one vacancy?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Only one man I’d give my ears to work for.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (smiling).
                    I remember.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    (quickly).
                    Do I always talk about Stonor? Well, it’s a habit people have got into.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    I forget, do you know Mr. Stonor personally, or (smiling) are you just dazzled from afar?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Oh, I know him. The trouble is he doesn’t know me. If he did he’d realise he
                        can’t be sure of winning his election without my valuable services.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Geoffrey Stonor’s re?election is always a foregone conclusion.
                
                
                
                    FARN.
                    That the great man shares that opinion is precisely his weak point. (Smiling.) His only one.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    You think because the Liberals swept the country the last time—
                
                
                    FARN.
                    How can we be sure any Conservative seat is safe after— (As
                            LADY JOHN smiles and turns to her papers.) Forgive me, I know
                        you’re not interested in politics qua
                        politics. But this concerns Geoffrey Stonor.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    And you count on my being interested in him like all the rest of my sex.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    (leans forward).
                    Lady John, I’ve heard the news.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    What news?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    That your little niece—the Scotch heiress—is going to become Mrs. Geoffrey
                        Stonor.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Who told you that?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Please don’t mind my knowing.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (visibly perturbed).
                    She had set her heart upon having a few days with just her family in the
                        secret, before the flood of congratulations breaks loose.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Oh, that’s all right. I always hear things before other people.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Well, I must ask you to be good enough to be very circumspect. I wouldn’t
                        have my niece think that I—
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Oh, of course not.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    She will be here in an hour.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    (jumping up delighted).
                    What? To?day? The future Mrs. Stonor!
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (harassed).
                    Yes. Unfortunately we had one or two people already asked for the
                        week?end—
                
                
                
                    FARN.
                    And I go and invite myself to luncheon! Lady John, you can buy me off. I’ll
                        promise to remove myself in five minutes if you’ll—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    No, the penalty is you shall stay and keep the others amused between church
                        and luncheon, and so leave me free. (Takes up the
                            plan.) Only remember—
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Wild horses won’t get a hint out of me! I only mentioned it to you
                        because—since we’ve come back to live in this part of the world you’ve been
                        so awfully kind—I thought, I hoped maybe you—you’d put in a word for me.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    With—?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    With your nephew that is to be. Though I’m not the slavish
                        satellite people make out, you can’t doubt—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Oh, I don’t doubt. But you know Mr. Stonor inspires a similar enthusiasm in a
                        good many young—
                
                
                    FARN.
                    They haven’t studied the situation as I have. They don’t know what’s at
                        stake. They don’t go to that hole Dutfield as I did just to hear his Friday
                        speech.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Ah! But you were rewarded. Jean—my niece—wrote me it was “glorious.”
                
                
                    FARN.
                    (judicially).
                    Well, you know, I was disappointed. He’s too content just to
                        criticise, just to make his delicate pungent fun of the men who are
                        grappling—very inadequately, of course—still grappling with the
                        big questions. There’s a carrying power (gets up and faces
                            an imaginary audience) —some of Stonor’s friends ought to point
                        it out—there’s a driving power in the poorest constructive policy that makes
                        the most brilliant criticism look barren.
                
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (with good?humoured malice).
                    Who told you that?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    You think there’s nothing in it because I say it. But now that
                        he’s coming into the family, Lord John or somebody really ought to point
                        out—Stonor’s overdoing his rôle of magnificent security.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    I don’t see even Lord John offering to instruct Mr. Stonor.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Believe me, that’s just Stonor’s danger! Nobody saying a word, everybody
                        hoping he’s on the point of adopting some definite line, something strong
                        and original that’s going to fire the public imagination and bring the
                        Tories back into power.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    So he will.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    (hotly).
                    Not if he disappoints meetings—goes calmly up to town—and leaves the field to
                        the Liberals.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    When did he do anything like that?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Yesterday! (With a harassed air.) And now that he’s
                        got this other preoccupation—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    You mean—
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Yes, your niece—that spoilt child of Fortune. Of course! (Stopping suddenly.) She kept him from the meeting last night.
                        Well! (sits down) if that’s the effect she’s going
                        to have it’s pretty serious!
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (smiling).
                    You are!
                
                
                    FARN.
                    I can assure you the election agent’s more so. He’s simply tearing his
                        hair.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (more gravely and coming nearer).
                    How do you know?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    He told me so himself—yesterday. I scraped acquaintance with the agent just
                        to see if—if—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    It’s not only here that you manœuvre for that Secretaryship!
                
                
                
                    FARN.
                    (confidentially).
                    You can never tell when your chance might come! That election chap’s promised
                        to keep me posted.
                
                (The door flies open and JEAN DUNBARTON rushes in.)
                
                    JEAN.
                    Aunt Ellen—here I—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (astonished).
                    My dear child!
                
                (They embrace. Enter LORD JOHN from the garden—a benevolent,
                    silver?haired despot of sixty?two.)
                
                    LORD JOHN.
                    I thought that was you running up the avenue.
                
                (JEAN greets her uncle warmly, but all the time she and her aunt
                    talk together. “How did you get here so early?” “I knew you’d be
                    surprised—wasn’t it clever of me to manage it? I don’t deserve all the credit.”
                    “But there isn’t any train between—” “Yes, wait till I tell you.” “You walked in
                    the broiling sun—” “No, no.” “You must be dead. Why didn’t you telegraph? I
                    ordered the carriage to meet the 1.10. Didn’t you say the 1.10? Yes, I’m sure
                    you did—here’s your letter.”)
                
                    LORD J.
                    (has shaken hands with FARNBOROUGH and speaks through the
                        torrent).
                    Now they’ll tell each other for ten minutes that she’s an hour earlier that
                        we expected.
                
                (LORD JOHN leads FARNBOROUGH towards the garden.)
                
                    FARN.
                    The Freddy Tunbridges said they were coming to you this
                        week.
                
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    Yes, they’re dawdling through the park with the Church Brigade.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Oh! (With a glance back at JEAN.) I’ll go and meet
                        them.
                
                [Exit FARNBOROUGH.
                
                    LORD J.
                    (as he turns back).
                    That discreet young man will get on.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (to JEAN).
                    But how did you get here?
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (breathless).
                    “He” motored me down.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Geoffrey Stonor? (JEAN nods.) Why, where is he,
                        then?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    He dropped me at the end of the avenue and went on to see a supporter about
                        something.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    You let him go off like that without—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (taking JEAN’S two hands).
                    Just tell me, my child, is it all right?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    My engagement? (Radiantly.) Yes, absolutely.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Geoffrey Stonor isn’t going to be—a little too old for you?
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (laughing).
                    Bless me, am I such a chicken?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Twenty?four used not to be so young—but it’s become so.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Yes, we don’t grow up so quick. (Gaily.) But on the
                        other hand we stay up longer.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    You’ve got what’s vulgarly called “looks,” my dear, and that will help to
                            keep you up!
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (smiling).
                    I know what Uncle John’s thinking. But I’m not the only girl who’s been left
                        “what’s vulgarly called” money.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    You’re the only one of our immediate circle who’s been left so beautifully
                        much.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Ah, but remember Geoffrey could—everybody knows he could have
                        married any one in England.
                
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (faintly ironic).
                    I’m afraid everybody does know it—not excepting Mr. Stonor.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    Well, how spoilt is the great man?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Not the least bit in the world. You’ll see! He wants so to know my best?loved
                        relations better. (Another embrace.) An orphan has
                        so few belongings, she has to make the most of them.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (smiling).
                    Let us hope he’ll approve of us on more intimate acquaintance.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (firmly).
                    He will. He’s an angel. Why, he gets on with my grandfather!
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Does he? (Teasing.) You mean to say
                        Mr. Geoffrey Stonor isn’t just a tiny bit—“superior” about Dissenters.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (stoutly).
                    Not half as much as Uncle John and all the rest of you! My grandfather’s been
                        ill again, you know, and rather difficult—bless him! (Radiantly.) But Geoffrey— (Clasps her
                            hands.)
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    He must have powers of persuasion!— to get that old Covenanter to let you
                        come in an abhorred motor?car—on Sunday too!
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (half whispering).
                    Grandfather didn’t know!
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Didn’t know?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    I honestly meant to come by train. Geoffrey met me on my way to the station.
                        We had the most glorious run. Oh, Aunt Ellen, we’re so happy! (Embracing her.) I’ve so looked forward to having you
                        to myself the whole day just to talk to you about—
                
                
                    LORD J.

                    Oh, very well—

                    (catches him affectionately by the arm).
                    You’d find it dreffly dull to hear me talk about
                        Geoffrey the whole blessed day!

                    I only meant it was odd he should be here. Naturally at my grandfather’s—
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    It’s all right, my child. Of course we expect now that you’ll begin to think
                        like Geoffrey Stonor, and to feel like Geoffrey Stonor, and to talk like
                        Geoffrey Stonor. And quite proper too.

                    (smiling).
                    Well, if I do think with my husband and feel with him—as, of course, I
                        shall—it will surprise me if I ever find myself talking a tenth as well—

                    Philanthropy in a woman like Miss Levering is a form of restlessness. But
                        she’s a nice creature; all she needs is to get some “nice”
                        fella to marry her.

                    JEAN.
                    How do you do? (They shake hands.)

                    I’m sure you agree with me.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    About Miss Levering being too—
                
                
                
                    GREAT.

                    MISS L.
                    What a pity you’ve exhausted the more eloquent adjectives.
                
                
                    GREAT.

                    MISS L.
                    Well, you can’t say to me as you did to Mrs. Freddy: “You’re too young and
                        too happily married—and too— (Glances round smiling at
                            MRS. FREDDY, who, oblivious, is laughing and talking to her husband and
                            MRS. HERIOT.)
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    For what was Mrs. Freddy too happily married and all the rest?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (lightly).
                    Mr. Greatorex was repudiating the horrid rumour the Mrs. Freddy had been
                        speaking in public; about Women’s Trade Unions—wasn’t that what you said,
                        Mrs. Heriot?
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (chuckling).
                    Yes, it isn’t made up as carefully as your aunt’s parties usually are. Here
                        we’ve got Greatorex (takes his arm) who hates
                        political women, and we’ve got in that mild and inoffensive looking little
                        lady— (Motion over his shoulder towards MRS.

                        win seats.

                    Mr. Greatorex objects only to the unsexed creatures who—a—

                    JEAN.
                    You mean that rowdy scene in the House of Commons?
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    Yes. No decent woman will be able to say “Suffrage” without blushing for

                    Oh? I understood that so little I almost imagined people were more stirred up
                        about it than they’d ever been before.

                    LORD J.
                    She’s saying that only to get a rise out of you.
                
                
                    GREAT.
                    Ah, yes, your frocks aren’t serious enough.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I’m told it’s an exploded notion that the Suffrage women are all dowdy and
                        dull.
                
                
                    GREAT.
                    Don’t you believe it!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Well, of course we know you’ve been an authority on the subject for—let’s
                        see, how many years is it you’ve kept the House in roars whenever Woman’s
                        Rights are mentioned?
                
                
                    GREAT.
                    (flattered but not entirely comfortable).
                    Oh, as long as I’ve known anything about politics there have been a few
                        discontented old maids and hungry widows—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    “A Few!” That’s really rather forbearing of you, Mr. Greatorex. I’m afraid
                        the number of the discontented and the
                        hungry was 96,000—among the mill operatives alone. (Hastily.) At least the papers said so, didn’t they?
                
                
                    GREAT.
                    Oh, don’t ask me; that kind of woman doesn’t interest me, I’m afraid. Only I
                        am able to point out to the people who lose their heads and seem inclined to
                        treat the phenomenon seriously that there’s absolutely nothing new in it.
                        There have been women for the last forty years who haven’t had anything more
                        pressing to do than petition Parliament.

                    (as though she has just recalled the circumstances).
                    Oh, yes, I remember. I thought at the time, in my modest way, it was nothing
                        short of heroic of them to go asking audience of their arch opponent.

                    (stoutly).
                    It didn’t come off.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (innocently).
                    Oh! I thought they insisted on bearding the lion in his den.
                
                
                    GREAT.
                    Of course I wasn’t going to be bothered with a lot of—
                
                
                    MISS L.

                        think of bothering,” he said. “I’ve looked over the lot,” he said, “and

                    (on divan C., aside to MISS LEVERING).
                    Too “wonderful” to waste your time on the wrong people.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I shall waste less of my time after this.
                
                
                    GREAT.
                    I’m relieved to hear it. I can’t see you wheedling money for shelters and rot
                        of that sort out of retired grocers.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You see, you call it rot. We couldn’t have got £8,000 out of
                        you.
                
                
                    GREAT.
                    (very low).
                    I’m not sure.
                
                (MISS LEVERING looks at him.)
                
                    GREAT.
                    If I gave you that much—for your little projects—what would you give me?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (speaking quietly).
                    Soper didn’t ask that.
                
                
                    GREAT.
                    (horrified).
                    Soper! I should think not!
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (turning to MISS LEVERING).
                    Soper? You two still talking Soper? How flattered the old beggar’d be!
                
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (lower).
                    Did you hear what Mrs. Heriot said about him? “So kind: so munificent—so
                            vulgar, poor soul, we could’t know him in London—but
                            we shall meet him in heaven.”
                
                (GREATOREX and LORD JOHN go off laughing.)
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (to Miss Levering).
                    Sit over there, my dear. (Indicating chair in front of
                            writing?table.) You needn’t stay, Jean. This won’t interest
                        you.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (in the tone of one agreeing).
                    It’s only an effort to meet the greatest evil in the world?
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (pausing as she’s following the others).
                    What do you call the greatest evil in the world?
                
                (Looks pass between MRS. HERIOT and LADY JOHN.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    (without emphasis).
                    The helplessness of women.
                
                (JEAN stands still.)
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (rising and putting her arm about the girl’s
                        shoulder).
                    Jean, darling, I know you can think of nothing but (aside)
                        him—so just go and—
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (brightly).
                    Indeed, indeed, I can think of everything better than I ever did before. He
                        has lit up everything for me—made everything vivider, more—more
                        significant.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (turning around).
                    Who has?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Oh, yes, I don’t care about other things less but a thousand times more.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    You are in love.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Oh, that’s it! (Smiling at JEAN.) I congratulate
                        you.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (returning to the outspread plan).
                    Well—this, you see, obviates the difficulty you raised.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes, quite.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    But it’s going to cost a great deal more.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    It’s worth it.
                
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    We’ll have nothing left for the organ at St. Pilgrim’s.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    My dear Lydia, we’re putting the organ aside.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (with asperity).
                    We can’t afford to “put aside” the elevating effect of music.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    What we must make for, first, is the cheap and humanely conducted
                        lodging?house.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    There are several of those already, but poor St. Pilgrim’s—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    There are none for the poorest women.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    No, even the excellent Soper was for multiplying Rowton Houses. You can never
                        get men to realise—you can’t always get women—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    It’s the work least able to wait.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    I don’t agree with you, and I happen to have spent a great deal of my life in
                        works of charity.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Ah, then you’ll be interested in the girl I saw dying in a Tramp Ward a
                        little while ago. Glad her cough was worse—only she mustn’t die
                        before her father. Two reasons. Nobody but her to keep the old man out of
                        the workhouse—and “father is so proud.” If she died first, he would starve;
                        worst of all he might hear what had happened up in London to his girl.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    She didn’t say, I suppose, how she happened to fall so low.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes, she had been in service. She lost the train back one Sunday night and
                        was too terrified of her employer to dare ring him up after hours. The wrong
                        person found her crying on the platform.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    She should have gone to one of the Friendly Societies.
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    At eleven at night?
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    And there are the Rescue Leagues. I myself have been connected with one for
                        twenty years—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (reflectively).
                    “Twenty years!” Always arriving “after the train’s gone”—after the girl and
                        the Wrong Person have got to the journey’s end.
                
                (MRS. HERIOT’s eyes flash.)
                
                    JEAN.
                    Where is she now?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Never mind.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Two nights ago she was waiting at a street corner in the rain.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    Near a public?house, I suppose.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes, a sort of “public?house.” She was plainly dying—she was told she
                        shouldn’t be out in the rain. “I musn’t go in yet,” she said.
                            “This is what he gave me,” and she began to cry. In her
                        hand were two pennies silvered over to look like half?crowns.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    I don’t believe that story. It’s just the sort of thing some sensation?monger
                        trumps up—now, who tells you such—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Several credible people. I didn’t believe them till—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Till—?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Till last week I saw for myself.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Saw? Where?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    In a low lodging?house not a hundred yards from the church you want a new
                        organ for.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    How did you happen to be there?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I was on a pilgrimage.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    A pilgrimage?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Into the Underworld.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    You went?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    How could you?
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I put on an old gown and a tawdry hat— (Turns to LADY
                            JOHN.) You’ll never know how many things are hidden from a woman
                        in good clothes. The bold, free look of a man at a woman he believes to be
                        destitute—you must feel that look on you before you can
                        understand—a good half of history.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (rises).
                    Jean!—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    But where did you go—dressed like that?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Down among the homeless women—on a wet night looking for shelter.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (hastily).
                    No wonder you’ve been ill.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (under breath).
                    And it’s like that?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    No.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    No?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    It’s so much worse I dare not tell about it—even if you weren’t here I
                        couldn’t.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (to JEAN).
                    You needn’t suppose, darling, that those wretched creatures felt it as we
                        would.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    The girls who need shelter and work aren’t all serving?maids.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (with an involuntary flash).
                    We know that all the women who—make mistakes aren’t.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (steadily).
                    That is why every woman ought to take an interest in this—every
                        girl too.

                    LADY JOHN
                    No. This is a matter for us older—
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (with an air of sly challenge).
                    Or for a person who has some special knowledge. (Significantly.)
                        We can’t pretend to have access to such sources of information
                        as Miss Levering.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (meeting MRS. HERIOT’S eye steadily).
                    Yes, for I can give you access. As you seem to think, I have some first?hand
                        knowledge about homeless girls.
                
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (cheerfully turning it aside).
                    Well, my dear, it will all come in convenient. (Tapping the
                            plan.)
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    It once happened to me to take offence at an ugly thing that was going on
                        under my father’s roof. Oh, years ago! I was an impulsive girl.
                        I turned my back on my father’s house—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (for JEAN’S benefit).
                    That was ill?advised.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    Of course, if a girl does that—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    That was what all my relations said (with a glance at
                            JEAN), and I couldn’t explain.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Not to your mother?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    She was dead. I went to London to a small hotel and tried to find employment.
                        I wandered about all day and every day from agency to agency. I was supposed
                        to be educated. I’d been brought up partly in Paris; I could play several
                        instruments, and sing little songs in different tongues. (Slight pause.)
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Did nobody want you to teach French or sing the little songs?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    The heads of schools thought me too young. There were people ready to listen
                        to my singing, but the terms—they were too hard. Soon my money was gone. I
                        began to pawn my trinkets. They went.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    And still no work?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    No; but by that time I had some real education—an unpaid hotel bill, and not
                        a shilling in the world. (Slight pause.) Some
                        girls think it hardship to have to earn their living. The horror is not to
                        be allowed to—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    (bending forward).
                    What happened?
                
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (rises).
                    My dear (to MISS LEVERING), have your things been
                        sent down? Are you quite ready?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes, all but my hat.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Well?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Well, by chance I met a friend of my family.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    That was lucky.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I thought so. He was nearly ten years older than I. He said he wanted to help
                        me. (Pause.)
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    And didn’t he?
                
                (LADY JOHN lays her hand on MISS LEVERING’S shoulder.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    Perhaps after all he did. (With sudden change of
                            tone.) Why do I waste time over myself? I belonged to the little
                        class of armed women. My body wasn’t born weak, and my spirit wasn’t broken
                        by the habit of slavery. But, as Mrs. Heriot was kind enough to
                        hint, I do know something about the possible fate of homeless girls. I found
                        there were pleasant parks, museums, free libraries in our great rich
                        London—and not one single place where destitute women can be sure of work
                        that isn’t killing or food that isn’t worse than prison fare. That’s why
                        women ought not to sleep o’ nights till this Shelter stands spreading out
                        wide arms.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    No, no—
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (gathering up her gloves, fan, prayer?book, &c.).
                    Even when it’s built—you’ll see! Many of those creatures will prefer the life
                        they lead. They like it.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    A woman told me—one of the sort that
                        knows—told me many of them “like it” so much that they are indifferent to
                        the risk of being sent to prison. “It gives them a rest,” she
                        said.

                    A rest!

                    upstairs.)

                    covertly talking.)

                    I have a quite special reason for wanting not to be ignorant.
                            (Impulsively). I’ll go to town to?morrow, if
                        you’ll come and lunch with me.

                    Thank you—I (catches MRS. HERIOT’S eye) —I must go

                        I found her horribly ill in a lonely Welsh farmhouse. We had taken the Manor
                        for that August. THE farmer’s wife was frightened, and begged me to go and
                        see what I thought. I soon saw how it was—I thought she was dying.

                    MRS. H.
                    I got no more out of her than the farmer’s wife did. She had had no letters.
                        There had been no one to see her except a man down from London, a shady?looking doctor—nameless, of course. And
                        then this result. The farmer and his wife, highly respectable people, were
                        incensed. They were for turning the girl out.

                    Yes. Pitiless some of these people are! I insisted they should treat the girl
                        humanely, and we because friends . . . that is, “sort of.” In spite of all I
                        did for her—

                    But you’ve been telling me!
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    That was my duty—and I never had her full confidence.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Wasn’t it natural she—
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    Well, all things considered, she might have wanted to tell me who was
                        responsible.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Oh! Aunt Lydia!
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    All she ever said was that she was ashamed— (losing her
                            temper and her fine feeling for the innocence of her auditor)
                        —ashamed that she “hadn’t had the courage to resist”—not the original
                        temptation but the pressure brought to bear on her “not to go through with
                        it,” as she said.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (wrinkling her brows).
                    You are being so delicate—I’m not sure I understand.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (irritably).
                    The only thing you need to understand is that she’s not a desirable companion
                        for a young girl.
                
                (Pause.)
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    When did you see her after—after—
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (with a slight grimace).
                    I met her last winter at the Bishop’s. (Hurriedly.)
                        She’s a connection of his wife’s. They’d got her to help with some of their
                        work. Then she took hold of ours. Your aunt and uncle are quite foolish
                        about her, and I’m debarred from taking any steps, at least till the Shelter
                        is out of hand.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    I do rather wonder she can bring herself to talk about—the unfortunate women
                        of the world.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    The effrontery of it!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Or . . . The courage! (Puts her hand up to her throat as if
                            the sentence had caught there.)
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    Even presumes to set me right! Of course I don’t
                            mind in the least, poor soul . . . But I feel I owe it to
                        your dead mother to tell you about her, especially as you’re old enough now
                        to know something about life—
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (slowly)
                    —and since a girl needn’t be very old to suffer for her ignorance. (Moves a little away.) I felt she was
                        rather wonderful.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    
                        Wonderful!
                    
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (pausing)
                    . . . To have lived through that when she was . . . how old?
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (rising).
                    Oh, nineteen or thereabouts.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Five years younger than I. To be abandoned and to come out of it like
                        this!
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (laying her hand on the girl’s shoulder).
                    It was too bad to have tell you Such a sordid story to?day of all days.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    It is a very terrible story, but this wasn’t a bad time. I feel very sorry
                        to?day for women who aren’t happy. (Motor horn heard
                            faintly.)(Jumping up.) That’s
                        Geoffrey!
                
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    Mr. Stonor! What makes you think . . . ?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Yes, yes. I’m sure, I’m sure—
                
                (Checks herself as she is flying off. Turns and sees LORD JOHN
                    entering from the garden.)
                (Motor horn louder.)
                
                    LORD J.
                    Who do you think is motoring up the drive?
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (catching hold of him).
                    Oh, dear! How am I ever going to be able to behave like a girl who isn’t
                        engaged to the only man in the world worth marrying?
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    You were expecting Mr. Stonor all the time!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    He promised he’d come to luncheon if it was humanly possible; but I was
                        afraid to tell you for fear he’d be prevented.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (laughing as he crosses to the lobby).
                    You felt we couldn’t have borne the disappointment.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    I felt I couldn’t.
                
                (The lobby door opens. LADY JOHN appears radiant, followed by a
                    tall figure in a dustcoat, &c., no goggles. He has straight, firm features,
                    a little blunt; fair skin, high?coloured; fine, straight hair, very fair; grey
                    eyes, set somewhat prominently and heavy when not interested; lips full, but
                    firmly moulded. GEOFFREY STONOR is heavier than a man of forty should be, but
                    otherwise in the pink of physical condition. The FOOTMAN stands waiting to help
                    him off with his motor coat.)
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Here’s an agreeable surprise!
                
                (JEAN has gone forward only a step, and stands smiling at the
                    approaching figure.)
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    How do you do? (As he comes between them and briskly shakes
                            hands with STONOR.)

                        gigantic luck!
                
                (Those outside crane and glance, and then elaborately turn their

                    STONOR.

                    hers outstretched. He crosses to JEAN, who meets him half way; they shake hands,
                    smiling into each other’s eyes.)
                
                    JEAN.
                    Such a long time since we met!
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (to STONOR).
                    You’re growing very enterprising. I could hardly believe my ears when I heard
                        you motored all the way from town to see a supporter on Sunday.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I don’t know how we covered the ground in the old days. (To
                            LADY JOHN.) It’s no use to stand for your borough any more. The
                        American, you know, he “runs” for Congress. By and by we shall all be flying
                        after the things we want. (Smiles at JEAN.)

                    Sh! (Smiles and then glances over her shoulder and speaks
                            low.) All sorts of irrelevant people here.

                    (unable to resist the temptation, comes forward).
                    How do you do, Mr. Stonor?
                
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Oh—how d’you do.

                    Some of them were arguing in the smoking?room last night whether it didn’t
                        hurt a man’s chances going about in a motor.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    Yes, we’ve been hearing a lot of stories about the unpopularity of
                        motor?cars—among the class that hasn’t got ’em, of course. What do you
                        say?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    I’m sure you gain more votes by being able to reach so many more of your
                        constituency than we used—
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Well, I don’t know—I’ve sometimes wondered whether the charm of our presence
                        wasn’t counterbalanced by the way we tear about smothering our fellow?beings
                        in dust and running down their pigs and chickens, not to speak of their
                        children.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (anxiously).
                    What on the whole are the prospects?
                
                (FARNBOROUGH cranes forward.)
                
                    STONOR
                    (gravely).
                    We shall have to work harder than we realised.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Ah! (Retires towards group.)
                
                
                    JEAN

                        smiles at GEOFFREY).
                    He says he believes I’ll be able to make a real difference to his chances.
                        Isn’t it angelic of him?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (in a jocular tone).
                    Angelic? Macchiavelian. I pin all my hopes on your being able to counteract
                        the pernicious influence of my opponent’s glib wife.

                    You want me to have a real share in it all, don’t you

                    (smiling into her eyes).
                    Of course I do.
                
                (FARNBOROUGH drops down again on pretence of talking to MRS.

                    LORD J.
                    I don’t gather you’re altogether sanguine. Any complication?
                
                (JEAN and LADY JOHN stand close together (C.), the girl radiant,
                    following STONOR with her eyes and whispering to the sympathetic elder

                    STONOR.
                    Well (taking Sunday paper out of pocket), there’s
                        this agitation about the Woman Question. Oddly enough, it seems likely to
                        affect the issue.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    Why should it? Can’t you do what the other four hundred have done?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (laughs).
                    Easily. But, you see, the mere fact that four hundred and twenty members have
                        been worried into promising support—and then once in the House have let the

                    It’s true what that old cynic says. The scene in the House has put back the
                        reform a generation.

                    MRS. F.
                    I was.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Oh, was it like the papers said?
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    Worse. I’ve never been so moved in public. No tragedy, no great opera ever
                        gripped an audience as the situation in the House did that night. There we
                        all sat breathless—with everything more favourable to us than it had been
                        within the memory of women. Another five minutes and the Resolution would
                        have passed. Then . . . all in a moment—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (to MRS. HERIOT).
                    Listen—they’re talking about the female hooligans.

                    (excitedly).
                    All in a moment a horrible dingy little flag was poked through the grille of
                        the Woman’s Gallery—cries—insults—scuffling—the police—the ignominious
                        turning out of the women—us as well as the— Oh, I can’t
                            think of it without— (Jumps up and walks
                            to and fro.)
                        (Pauses.) Then the next morning! The people
                        gloating. Our friends antagonised—people who were wavering—nearly won
                        over—all thrown back—heart breaking! Even my husband! Freddy’s been an angel
                        about letting me take my share when I felt I must—but of course I’ve always
                        known he doesn’t really like it. It makes him shy. I’m sure it gives him a
                        horrid twist inside when he sees my name among the speakers on the placards.
                        But he’s always been an angel about it before this. After the disgraceful
                        scene he said, “It just shows how unfit women are for any sort of coherent
                        thinking or concerted action.”
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    To think that it should be women who’ve given the Cause the worst blow it
                        ever had!
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    The work of forty years destroyed in five minutes!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    They must have felt pretty sick when they woke up the next morning—the
                        Suffragettes.
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    I don’t waste any sympathy on them. I’m thinking of the penalty
                            all women have to pay because a handful of hysterical—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Still I think I’m sorry for them. It must be dreadful to find you’ve done
                        such a lot of harm to the thing you care most about in the world.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Do you picture the Suffragettes sitting in sackcloth?
                
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    Well, they can’t help realising now what they’ve done.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (quietly).
                    Isn’t it just possible that they realise they’ve waked up interest in the
                        Woman Question so that it’s advertised in every paper and discussed in every
                        house from Land’s End to John o’Groats? Don’t you think they
                        know there’s been more said and written about it in these ten days since the
                        scene, than in the ten years before it?
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    You aren’t saying you think it was a good way to get what they wanted?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (shrugs).
                    I’m only pointing out that it seems not such a bad way to get it known they
                            do want something—and (smiling)
                        “want it bad.”
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (getting up).
                    Didn’t Mr. Greatorex say women had been politely petitioning Parliament for
                        forty years?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    And men have only laughed.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    But they’d come round. (She looks from one to the
                            other.) Mrs. Tunbridge says, before that horrid scene,
                        everything was favourable at last.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    At last? Hadn’t it just been just as “favourable” before?
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    No. We’d never had so many members pledged to our side.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I thought I’d heard somebody say the Bill had got as far as that, time and
                        time again.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Oh no. Surely not—
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    (reluctantly).
                    Y?yes. This was only a Resolution. The Bill passed a second reading seven
                        years ago.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (with wide eyes).
                    And what difference did it make?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    The men laughed rather louder.
                
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    Oh, it’s got as far as a second reading several times—but we never had so
                        many friends in the House before—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (with a faint smile).
                    “Friends!”
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Why do you say it like that?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Perhaps because I was thinking of a funny story—he said it was funny—a
                        Liberal Whip told me the other day. A Radical Member went out of the House
                        after his speech in favour of the Woman’s Bill, and as he came back half an
                        hour later, he heard some Members talking in the Lobby about the astonishing
                        number who were going to vote for the measure. And the Friend of Woman
                        dropped his jaw and clutched the man next to him : “My God!” he said, “you
                        don’t mean to say they’re going to give it to them!”
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Oh!
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    You don’t think all men in Parliament are like that!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I don’t think all men are burglars, but I lock my doors.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (below her breath).
                    You think that night of the scene— you think the men didn’t mean
                        to play fair? 
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (her coolness in contrast to the excitement of the
                        others).
                    Didn’t the women sit quiet till ten minutes to closing time?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Ten minutes to settle a question like that!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (quietly to MRS. FREDDY)
                    Couldn’t you see the men were at their old game?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (coming forward).
                    You think they were just putting off the issue till it was too late?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (in a detached tone).
                    I wasn’t there, but I haven’t heard anybody deny that the women
                        waited till ten minutes to eleven. Then they discovered the policeman who’d been sent up at the psychological
                        moment to the back of the gallery. Then, I’m told, when the women saw they
                        were betrayed once more, they utilised the few minutes left, to impress on
                        the country at large the fact of their demands—did it in the only way left
                        to them. (Sits leaning forward reflectively smiling, chin
                            in hand.) It does rather look to the outsider as if the
                        well?behaved women had worked for forty years and made less impression on
                        the world then those fiery young women made in five minutes.
                
                
                    MRS. F.
                    Oh, come, be fair!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Well, you must admit that, next day, every newspaper reader in Europe and
                        America knew there were women in England in such dead earnest about the
                        Suffrage that the men had stopped laughing at last, and turned them out of
                        the House. Men even advertised how little they appreciated the fun by
                        sending the women to gaol in pretty sober earnest. And all the world was
                        talking about it.
                
                (MRS> HERIOT lays down the “Church Times” and joins the
                    others.)
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    I have noticed, whenever the men aren’t there, the women sit and discuss that
                        scene.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (cheerfully).
                    I shan’t have to wait till the men are gone. (Leans over LADY JOHN’S shoulder and says half aside) He’s in
                        sympathy.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    How do you know?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    He told the interrupting women so.
                
                (MRS. FREDDY looks mystified. The others smile.)
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Oh!
                
                (MR. FREDDY and LORD JOHN appear by the door they went out of.
                    They stop to talk.)
                
                    MRS. F.
                    Here’s Freddy! (Lower, hastily to MISS LEVERING.)
                        You’re judging from the outside. Those of us who have been working for years
                        . . . we all realise it was a perfectly lunatic proceeding. Why,
                            think! The only chance of our getting what we want is by
                            winning over the men. (Her watchful eye,
                            leaving her husband for a moment, catches MISS LEVERING’S little
                            involuntary gesture.) What’s the matter?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    “Winning over the men” has been the woman’s way for centuries. Do you think
                        the result should make us proud of our policy? Yes? Then go and walk in
                        Piccadilly at midnight. (The older women glance at
                            JEAN.) No, I forgot—
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (with majesty).
                    Yes, it’s not the first time you’ve forgotten.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I forgot the magistrate’s ruling. He said no decent woman had any business to
                        be in London’s main thoroughfare at night unless she has a man with
                            her. I heard that in Nine Elms, too. “You’re obliged to take up
                        with a chap!“ was what the woman said.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    (rising).
                    JEAN! Come!
                
                (She takes JEAN by her arm and draws her to the window, where she
                    signals GREATOREX and FARNBOROUGH. MRS. FREDDY joins her husband and LORD
                    JOHN.)
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (kindly, aside to MISS LEVERING).
                    My dear, I think Lydia Heriot’s right. We oughtn’t to do anything or
                            say anything to encourage this ferment of feminism, and
                        I’ll tell you why: it’s likely to bring a very terrible thing in its
                        train.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    What terrible thing?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Sex antagonism.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (rising).
                    It’s here.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (very gravely).
                    Don’t say that.
                
                (JEAN has quietly disengaged herself from MRS. HERIOT, and the
                    group at the window returns and stands behind LADY JOHN, looking up into MISS
                    LEVERING’S face.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    (to LADY JOHN).
                    You’re so conscious it’s here, you’re afraid to have it mentioned.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (turning and seeing JEAN. Rising hastily).
                    If it’s here, it is the fault of those women agitators.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (gently).
                    No woman begins that way. (Leans forward with
                            clasped hands looking into vacancy.) Every woman’s in a state of
                        natural subjection (smiles at JEAN) —no, I’d
                        rather say allegiance to her idea of romance and her hope of motherhood.
                        They’re embodied for her in man. They’re the strongest things in life—till
                        man kills them. (Rousing herself and looking into LADY
                            JOHN’S face.) Let’s be fair. Each woman knows why that
                        allegiance died.
                
                (LADY JOHN turns hastily, sees LORD JOHN coming down with MR.
                    FREDDY and meets them at the foot of the stairs. MISS LEVERING has turned to the table looking for her gloves,
                    &c., among the papers; unconsciously drops the handkerchief she had in her
                    little book.)
                
                    JEAN
                    (in a low voice to MISS LEVERING).
                    All this talk against the wicked Suffragettes—it makes me want to go and hear
                        what they’ve got to say for themselves.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (smiling with a non?committal air as she finds the veil she’s
                        been searching for).
                    Well, they’re holding a meeting in Trafalgar Square at three o’clock.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    This afternoon? But that’s no use to people out of town— Unless I could
                        invent some excuse . . .
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (benevolently).
                    Still talking over the Shelter plans?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    No. We left the Shelter some time ago.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (to JEAN).
                    Then what’s all the chatterment about?
                
                (JEAN, a little confused, looks at MISS LEVERING.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    The latest thing in veils. (Ties hers round her
                            hat.)
                
                
                    GREAT.
                    The invincible frivolity of woman!
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (genially).
                    Don’t scold them. It’s a very proper topic.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (whimsically).
                    Oh, I was afraid you’d despise us for it.
                
                
                    BOTH MEN
                    (with condescension).
                    Not at all—not at all.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (to MISS LEVERING as FOOTMAN appears).
                    Oh, they’re coming for you. Don’t forget your book. (FOOTMAN holds out a salver with a telegram on it for JEAN.)
                        Why, it’s for me!
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    But it’s time I was—
                
                (Crosses to table.)
                
                    JEAN
                    (opening the telegram).
                    May I? (Reads, and glances over the paper at MISS
                            LEVERING.) I’ve got your book. (Crosses to
                            MISS LEVERING, and, looking at the back of the volume) Dante!
                        Where?abouts are you? (Opening at the marker.) Oh,
                        the “Inferno.”
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    No; I’m in a worse place.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    I didn’t know there was a worse.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes; it’s worse with the Vigliacchi.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    I forget. Were they Guelf or Ghibelline?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (smiling).
                    They weren’t either, and that was why Dante couldn’t stand them. (More gravely.) He said there was no place in Heaven
                        nor in Purgatory—not even a corner in Hell—for the souls who had stood aloof
                        from strife. (Looking steadily into the girl’s
                            eyes.) He called them “wretches who never lived,” Dante did,
                        because they’d never felt the pangs of partizanship. And so they wander
                        homeless on the skirts of limbo among the abortions and off?scourings of
                        Creation.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (a long breath after a long look. When MISS LEVERING has
                        turned away to make her leisurely adieux JEAN’S eyes fall on the open
                        telegram).
                    Aunt Ellen, I’ve got to go to London.
                
                STONOR, re?entering, hears this, but pretends to talk to MR.
                    FREDDY, &c.)
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    My dear child!
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    Nonsense! Is your grandfather worse?
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (folding the telegram).
                    No?o. I don’t think so. But it’s necessary I should go, all the same.
                
                
                    MRS. H.
                    Go away when Mr. Stonor—
                
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    He said he’d have to leave directly after luncheon.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    I’ll just see Miss Levering off, and then I’ll come back and talk about
                        it.
                
                
                    LORD J.
                    (to MISS LEVERING).
                    Why are you saying goodbye as if you were never coming back?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (smiling).
                    One never knows. Maybe I shan’t come back. (To
                            STONOR.) Goodbye.
                
                (STONOR bows ceremoniously. The others go up laughing. STONOR
                    comes down.)
                
                    JEAN
                    (impulsively). 
                    There mayn’t be another train! Miss Levering—
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (standing in front of her).
                    What if there isn’t? I’ll take you back in the motor.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (rapturously).
                    Will you? (Inadvertently drops the
                            telegram.) I must be there by three!
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (picks up the telegram and a handkerchief lying near, glances
                        at the message).
                    Why, it’s only an invitation to dine—Wednesday!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Sh! (Takes the telegram and puts it in her
                        pocket.)
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Oh, I see! (Lower, smiling.) It’s rather dear of
                        you to arrange our going off like that. You are a clever little
                        girl!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    It’s not that I was arranging. I want to hear those women in Trafalgar
                        Square—the Suffragettes.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (incredulous, but smiling).
                    How perfectly absurd! (Looking after LADY JOHN.)
                        Besides, I expect she wouldn’t like my carrying you off like that.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Then she’ll have to make an excuse and come too.
                
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Ah, it wouldn’t be quite the same—
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (rapidly thinking it out).
                    We could get back here in time for dinner.
                
                (GEOFFREY STONOR glances down at the handkerchief still in his
                    hand, and turns it half mechanically from corner to corner.)
                
                    JEAN
                    (absent?mindedly).
                    Mine?

                CURTAIN.
            
            
            
                ACT II
                SCENE: The north side of the Nelson Column in Trafalgar Square.
                    The Curtain rises on an uproar. The crowd, which momentarily increases, is
                    composed chiefly of weedy youths and wastrel old men. There are a few decent
                    artisans; three or four “beery” out?o’?works; three or four young women of the
                    domestic servant or Strand restaurant cashier class; one aged woman in rusty
                    black peering with faded, wondering eyes, consulting the faces of the men and
                    laughing nervously and apologetically from time to time; one or two
                    quiet?looking, business?like women, thirty to forty; two middle?class men, who
                    stare and whisper and smile. A quiet old man with a lot of unsold Sunday papers
                    under one arm stands in an attitude of rapt attention, with the free hand round
                    his deaf ear. A brisk?looking woman of forty?five or so, wearing pince?nez, goes
                    round with a pile of propagandist literature on her arm. Many of the men smoking
                    cigarettes—the old ones pipes. On the outskirts of this crowd, of several
                    hundred, a couple of smart men in tall shining hats hover a few moments, single
                    eyeglasses up, and then saunter off. Against the middle of the Column, where it
                    rises above the stone platform, is a great red banner, one supporting pole
                    upheld by a grimy sandwichman, the other by a
                    small, dirty boy of eight. If practicable only the lower portion of the banner
                    need be seen, bearing the final words of the legend—“VOTES FOR WOMEN!” in
                    immense white letters. It will be well to get, to the full, the effect of the
                    height above the crowd of the straggling group of speakers on the pedestal
                    platform. These are, as the Curtain rises, a working?class woman who is waving
                    her arms and talking very earnestly, her voice for the moment blurred in the
                    uproar. She is dressed in brown serge and looks pinched and sallow. At her side
                    is the CHAIRMAN urging that she be given a fair hearing. ALLEN TRENT is a tall,
                    slim, brown?haired man of twenty?eight, with a slight stoop, an agreeable
                    aspect, well?bred voice, and the gleaming brown eye of the visionary. Behind
                    these two, looking on or talking among themselves, are several other carelessly
                    dressed women; one, better turned out than the rest, is quite young, very slight
                    and gracefully built, with round, very pink cheeks, full, scarlet lips,
                    naturally waving brown hair, and an air of childish gravity. She looks at the
                    unruly mob with imperturbable calm. The CHAIRMAN’s voice is drowned.)

                            (In laughter the noise dies.) People ’ave been sayin’ this is a middle?class

                        workin’ men would be found turnin’ over their wyges to their wives. No! Wot’s the reason thousands do—and the
                        best and the soberest? Because the workin’ man knows that wot’s a pound to
                            ’im is twenty shillin’s to ’is wife. And she’ll myke every

                        the ’omes is like w’ere the men don’t let the women manage. Well, the Poor

                        tried to do the national ’ousekeepin’ without the women. (Roars.) But, like I told you before, it’s a libel to say it’s
                        only the well?off women wot’s wantin’ the vote. Wot about the 96,000 textile
                        workers? Wot about the Yorkshire tailoresses? I can tell you wot plenty o’
                        the poor women think about it. I’m one of them, and I can tell you we see
                        there’s reforms needed. We ought to ’ave the vote

                    N?naw. Not fur a woman.
                
                
                    CHAIRMAN
                    (speaking through this last).
                    Miss Ernestine Blunt will now address you.
                
                (Applause, chiefly ironic, laughter, a general moving closer and
                    knitting up of attention. ERNESTINE BLUNT is about twenty?four, but looks
                    younger. She is very downright, not to say pugnacious—the something amusing and
                    attractive about her is there, as it were, against her will, and the more
                    fetching for that. She has no conventional gestures, and none of any sort at
                    first. As she warms to her work she uses her slim hands to enforce her emphasis,
                    but as though unconsciously. Her manner of speech is less monotonous than that
                    of the average woman?speaker, but she, too, has a fashion of leaning all her
                    weight on the end of the sentence. She brings out the final word or two with an
                    effort of underscoring, and makes a forward motion of the slim body as if the
                    better to drive the last nail in. She evidently
                    means to be immensely practical—the kind who is pleased to think she hasn’t a
                    grain of sentimentality in her composition, and whose feeling, when it does all
                    but master her, communicates itself magnetically to others.)
                
                    MISS ERNESTINE BLUNT.
                    Perhaps I’d better begin by explaining a little about our “tactics.” (Cries of “Tactics! We know!” “Mykin’ trouble!” “Public
                            scandal!”) To make you understand what we’ve done, I must remind
                        you of what others have done. Perhaps you don’t know that women first
                        petitioned Parliament for the Franchise as long ago as 1866.

                    How do you know?

                    attack.)

                    You wasn’t there!

                    That was the trouble. Haw! haw!
                
                
                    MISS E.B.
                    And the petition was presented—

                    MISS E.B.
                    —presented to the House of Commons by that great Liberal, John Stuart Mill.

                        Bills or Resolutions have been before the House on and off for the last
                        thirty?six years. That, roughly, is our history. We found ourselves, towards
                        the close of the year 1905, with no assurance that if we went on in the same
                        way any girl born into the world in this generation would live to exercise
                        the rights of citizenship, though she lived to be a hundred. So we said all
                        this has been in vain. We must try some
                        other way. How did the working man get the Suffrage, we asked ourselves?
                        Well, we turned up the records, and we saw—

                    MISS E.B.
                    But we don’t want to follow such a violent example. We would
                        much rather not—but if that’s the only way we can make the
                        country see we’re in earnest, we are prepared to show them.

                    MISS E.B.
                    Don’t think that going to prison has any fears for us. We’d go for
                            life if by doing that we could get freedom for the rest of the
                        women.
                
                
                    VOICES.

                    MISS E.B.
                    Here’s some one asking why the men don’t help. It’s partly they don’t
                        understand yet—they will before we’ve done! (Laughter.) Partly they don’t understand yet what’s at
                        stake—
                
                
                    RESPECTABLE OLD MAN
                    (chuckling).
                    Lord, they’re a ’educatin’ of us!
                
                
                    VOICE.
                    Wot next?
                
                
                    MISS E.B.
                    —and partly that the bravest man is afraid of ridicule. Oh, yes; we’ve heard
                        a great deal all our lives about the timidity and the sensitiveness of
                        women. And it’s true. We are sensitive. But I tell you,
                        ridicule crumples a man up. It steels a woman. We’ve come to know the value
                        of ridicule. We’ve educated ourselves so that we welcome ridicule. We owe
                        our sincerest thanks to the comic writers.
                        The cartoonist is our unconscious friend. Who cartoons people who are of no
                        importance? What advertisement is so sure of being remembered?
                
                
                    POETIC YOUNG MAN.
                    I admit that.
                
                
                    MISS E.B.
                    If we didn’t know it by any other sign, the comic papers would tell us
                            we’ve arrived! But our greatest debt of gratitude we owe,
                        to the man who called us female hooligans. (The crowd
                            bursts into laughter.) We aren’t hooligans, but we hope the fact
                        will be overlooked. If everybody said we were nice, well?behaved women,
                        who’d come to hear us? Not the men.
                        (Roars.) Men tell us it isn’t womanly for us to
                        care about politics. How do they know what’s womanly? It’s for women to
                        decide that. Let the men attend to being manly. It will take them all their
                        time.

                    Are we down?’earted? Oh no!
                
                
                    MISS E.B.
                    And they say it would be dreadful if we got the vote, because then we’d be
                        pitted against men in the economic struggle. But that’s come about already.
                        Do you know that out of every hundred women in this country eighty?two are
                        wage?earning women? It used to be thought unfeminine for women to be
                        students and to aspire to the arts—that bring fame and fortune. But nobody
                        has ever said it was unfeminine for women to do the heavy drudgery that’s
                        badly paid. That kind of work had to be done by somebody—and
                        the men didn’t hanker after it. Oh, no.
                
                (Laughter and interruption.)
                
                    A MAN ON THE OUTER FRINGE.
                    She can talk—the little one can.
                
                
                
                    ANOTHER.
                    Oh, they can all “talk.”
                
                
                    A BEERY, DIRTY FELLOW OF FIFTY.
                    I wouldn’t like to be ’er ’usban’. Think o’ comin’ ’ome to
                        that!
                
                
                    HIS PAL.
                    I’d soon learn ’er!
                
                
                    MISS E.B.
                    (speaking through the noise).
                    Oh, no! Let the women scrub and cook and wash. That’s all right!
                        But if they want to try their hand at the better paid work of the liberal
                        professions—oh, very unfeminine indeed! Then there’s another thing. Now I
                        want you to listen to this, because it’s very> important.
                        Men say if we persist in competing with them for the bigger prizes, they’re
                        dreadfully afraid we’d lose the beautiful protesting chivalry that—Yes, I
                        don’t wonder you laugh. We laugh. (Bending
                            forward with lit eyes.) But the women I found at the Ferry Tin
                        Works working for five shillings a week—I didn’t see them laughing. The
                        beautiful chivalry of the employers of women doesn’t prevent them from
                        paying women tenpence a day for sorting coal and loading and unloading
                        carts—doesn’t prevent them from forcing women to earn bread in ways worse
                        still. So we won’t talk about chivalry. It’s being over?;sarcastic. We’ll
                        just let this poor ghost of chivalry go—in exchange for a little plain
                        justice.

                    (smiling).
                    Well, you know, some people say the whole trouble about us is that we
                            do fight. But it is only hard necessity makes us do that.
                        We don’t want to fight—as men seem to—just for fighting’s sake.
                        Women are for peace.
                
                
                    VOICE.
                    Hear, hear.
                
                
                    MISS E.B.
                    And when we have a share in public affairs there’ll be less likelihood of
                        war. But that’s not to say women can’t fight. The Boer women did. The
                        Russian women face conflicts worse than any battlefield can show. (Her voice shakes a little, and the eyes fill, but she
                            controls her emotion gallantly, and dashes on.) But we women
                        know all that is evil, and we’re for peace. Our part—we’re proud to remember
                        it—our part has been to go about after you men in war?time, and pick
                            up the pieces!
                        (A great shout.) Yes—seems a bit funny, doesn’t
                        it? You men blow them to bits, and then we come along and put them together
                        again. If you know anything about military nursing, you know a good deal of
                        our work has been done in the face of danger—but it’s always been
                            done.

                    That’os so. That’s so.
                
                
                    MISS E.B.
                    You complain that more and more we’re taking away from you men the work
                        that’s always been yours. You can’t any longer keep women out of the
                        industries. The only question is upon what terms shall she continue to be
                        in? As long as she’s in on bad terms, she’s not only hurting herself—she’s
                        hurting you. But if you’re feeling discouraged about our competing with you,
                        we’re willing to leave you your trade in war. Let the men take
                        life! We give life! (Her voice is once more
                            moved and proud.) No one will pretend ours isn’t one of the
                        dangerous trades either. I won’t say any more to you now, because we’e got
                        others to speak to you, and a new woman?helper that I want you to hear.

                            in the hiatus with laughter.) There was a man at ’Ammersmith,
                        too, talkin’ about women’s sphere bein’ ’ome. ’Ome do you call
                        it? You’ve got a kennel w’ere you can munch your tommy. You’ve got a corner

                        man, there’s too many of you ain’t able to give the women
                        ’omes—fit to live in, too many of you in that fix fur you to go on jawin’ at

                        because she knows I ain’t much use round the ’ouse, and she’s
                        ’opin’ I can talk to some purpose. Maybe she’s mistaken. Any’ow, here I am
                        to vote for her and all the other women. (“Hear! hear!”

                        see when women ’as the share in public affairs they ought to

                    love?making goes on during the next few sentences. Interruption. One voice
                    insistent but not clear. The speaker waits only a second and then resumes. “Yes,
                    if the women,” but he cannot instantly make himself heard. The boyish CHAIRMAN

                        Does the Government want to punish all women because they don’t
                        like the manners of a handful? Perhaps that’s you men’s notion of justice.

                        the vote, as you know. Well, we’d agree to be disfranchised all our lives,

                    You’re told the case will be at two o’clock, and it’s really called for
                        eleven. Well, I took a great deal of trouble, and I didn’t believe what I
                        was told— (Warming a little to her task.) Yes,
                        that’s almost the first thing we have to learn—to get over our touching
                        faith that, because a man tells us something, it’s true. I got to the right
                        court, and I was so anxious not to be late, I was too early. The case before
                        the Women’s was just coming on. I heard a noise. At the door I saw the
                        helmets of two policemen, and I said to myself: “What sort of crime shall I
                        have to sit and hear about? Is this a burglar coming along between the two
                        big policemen, or will it be a murderer? What sort of felon is to stand in
                        the dock before the women whose crime is they ask for the vote?” But, try as
                        I would, I couldn’t see the prisoner. My heart misgave me. Is it a woman, I
                        wondered? Then the policemen got nearer, and I saw—(she
                            waits an instant)—a little, thin, half?starved boy. What do you
                        think he was charged with? Stealing. What had he been stealing—that small
                        criminal? Milk. It seemed to me as I sat there looking on, that
                        the men who had the affairs of the world in their hands from the beginning,
                        and who’ve made so poor a business of it—

                    MISS L.
                    —so poor a business of it as to have the poor and the unemployed in the
                        condition they’re in to?day—when your only remedy for a starving child is to hale him off to the
                        police?court—because he had managed to get a little milk—well, I
                            did wonder that the men refuse to be helped with a problem
                        they’ve so notoriously failed at. I began to say to myself: “Isn’t it time
                        the women lent a hand?”

                        like to ask in return: Since when was human society held to exist for its

                        are built—homes are kept going, and babies are born. The world goes on!
                            (bending over the crowd) It goes on by
                            virtue of its common people.

                    I am not concerned that you should think we women can paint great pictures,
                        or compose immortal music, or write good books. I am content that we should
                        be classed with the common people—who keep the world going. But (staightening up and taking a fresh start), I’d like
                        the world to go a great deal better. We were talking about justice. I have
                        been inquiring into the kind of lodging the poorest class of homeless women
                        can get in this town of London. I find that only the men of that class are
                        provided for. Some measure to establish Rowton Houses for women has been
                        before the London County Council. They looked into the question “very
                        carefully,” so their apologists say. And what did they decide? They decided
                        that they could do nothing.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (having forced her way to STONOR’S side).
                    Is that true?
                
                
                    STONOR

                    I don’t know.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Why could that great, all?powerful body do nothing? Because, if these cheap
                        and decent houses were opened, they said, the homeless women in the streets
                        would make use of them! You’ll think I’m not in earnest. But that was
                        actually the decision and the reason given for it. Women that the bitter
                        struggle for existence has forced into a life of horror—

                    You think this is the kind of thing— (A motion of the head

                    —the outcast women might take advantage of the shelter these decent, cheap
                        places offered. But the men, I said! Are all who avail
                        themselves of the Lord Rowton’s hostels, are they all angels?
                        Or does wrong?doing in a man not matter? Yet women are recommended to depend
                        on the chivalry of men.

                        police?court news—(I have begun only lately to do that)—but you’ve seen the
                        accounts of the girl who’s been tried in Manchester lately for the murder of
                        her child. Not pleasant reading. Even if we’d noticed it, we wouldn’t speak
                        of it in my world. A few months ago I should have turned away my eyes and
                        forgotten even the headline as quickly as I could. But since that morning in
                        the police?court, I read these things. This, as you’ll remember, was about a
                        little working girl—an orphan of eighteen—who crawled with the dead body of her new?born child to her master’s
                        back?door, and left the baby there. She dragged herself a little way off and
                        fainted. A few days later she found herself in court, being tried for the
                        murder of her child. Her master—a married man—had of course reported the
                        “find” at his back?door to the police, and he had been summoned to give
                        evidence. The girl cried out to him in the open court, “You are the father!”
                        He couldn’t deny it. The Coroner at the jury’s request censured the man, and
                        regretted that the law didn’t make him responsible. But he went scot?free.
                        And that girl is now serving her sentence in Strangeways Gaol.

                    Men make boast that an English citizen is tried by his peers. What woman is
                        tried by hers? (A sombre passion strengthens her voice and
                            hurries her on.) A woman is arrested by a man, brought before a
                        man judge, tried by a jury of men, condemned by men, taken to prison by a
                        man, and by a man she’s hanged! Where in all this were her
                        “peers”? Why did men so long ago insist on trial by “a jury of their peers”?
                        So that justice shouldn’t miscarry—wasn’t it? A man’s peers would best understand his
                        circumstances, his temptation, the degree of his guilt. Yet there’s no such
                        unlikeness between different classes of men as exists between man and woman.
                        What man has the knowledge that makes him a fit judge of a woman’s deeds at
                        that time of anguish—that hour— (lowers her voice and
                            bends over the crowd) —that hour that some woman struggled
                        through to put each man here into the world. I noticed when a previous
                        speaker quoted the Labour Party you applauded. Some of you here—I
                        gather—call yourselves Labour men. Every woman who has borne a child is a
                        Labour woman. No man among you can judge what she goes through in her hour
                        of darkness—

                    —in that great agony when, even under the best conditions that money and
                        devotion can buy, many a woman falls into temporary mania, and not a few go
                        down to death. In the case of this poor little abandoned working girl, what
                        man can be the fit judge of her deeds in that awful moment of half?crazed
                        temptation? Women know of these things as those know burning who have walked
                        through fire. (STONOR makes a motion towards JEAN and she
                            turns away fronting the audience. Her hands go to her throat as though

                        here, it’s not enough to be sorry for these
                        our unfortunate sisters. We must get the conditions of life made fairer. We
                        women must organise. We must learn to work together. We have all (rich and
                        poor, happy and unhappy) worked so long and so exclusively for
                            men, we hardly know how to work for one another. But we
                        must learn. Those who can, may give money—

                    You won’t get many men.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (with fire).
                    Then it’s to the women I appeal! (She is about to retire
                            when, with a sudden gleam in her lit eyes, she turns for the last time
                            to the crowd, silencing the general murmur and holding the people by the
                            sudden concentration of passion in her face.) I don’t mean to
                        say it wouldn’t be better if men and women did this work together—shoulder
                        to shoulder. But the mass of men won’t have
                        it so. I only hope they’ll realise in time the good they’ve renounced and
                        the spirit they’ve aroused. For I know as well as any man could tell me, it
                        would be a bad day for England if all women felt about all men as I
                            do.
                
                (She retires in a tumult. The others on the platform close about
                    her. The CHAIRMAN tries in vain to get a hearing from the excited
                    crowd.)
                (JEAN tries to make her way through the knot of people surging
                    around her.)
                
                    STONOR
                    (calls).
                    Here!—Follow me!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    No—no—I—
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You’re going the wrong way.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    This is the way I must go.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You can get out quicker on this side.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    I don’t want to get out.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    What! Where are you going?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    To ask that woman to let me have the honour of working with her.
                
                (She disappears in the crowd.)
                CURTAIN.
            
            
            
                ACT III
                SCENE: The drawing?room at old MR. DUNBARTON’S house in Eaton
                    Square. Six o’clock the same evening. As the Curtain rises the door (L.) opens
                    and JEAN appears on the threshold. She looks back into her own sitting?room,
                    then crosses the drawing?room, treading softly on the parquet spaces between the
                    rugs. She goes to the window and is in the act of parting the lace curtains when
                    the folding doors (C.) are opened by the BUTLER.
                
                    JEAN
                    (to the Servant).
                    Sh! (She goes softly back to the door she has left open and
                            closes it carefully. When she turns, the BUTLER has stepped aside to
                            admit GEOFFREY STONOR, and departed, shutting the folding doors. STONOR
                            comes rapidly forward.)
                        (Before he gets a word out.) Speak low please.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (angrily).
                    I waited about a whole hour for you to come back. (JEAN
                            turns away as though vaguely looking for the nearest chair.) If you didn’t mind leaving me
                        like that, you might have considered Lady John.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (pausing).
                    Is she here with you?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    No. My place was nearer than this, and she was very tired. I left her to get
                        some tea. We couldn’t tell whether you’d be here, or what had
                        become of you.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Mr. Trent got us a hansom.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Trent?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    The Chairman of the meeting.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    “Got us—”?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Miss Levering and me.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (incensed).
                    MISS L—
                
                
                    BUTLER
                    (opens the door and announces)
                    Mr. Farnborough.
                
                (Enter MR. RICHARD FARNBOROUGH—more flurried than ever.)
                
                    FARN.
                    (seeing STONOR).
                    At last! You’ll forgive this incursion, Miss Dunbarton, when you hear— (Turns abruptly back to STONOR.) They’ve been
                        telegraphing you all over London. In despair they set me on your track.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Who did? What’s up?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    (lays down his hat and fumbles agitatedly in his
                        breast?pocket).
                    There was the devil to pay at Dutfield last night. The Liberal chap tore down
                        from London and took over your meeting!
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Oh?—Nothing about it in the Sunday paper I saw.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Wait till you see the Press to?morrow morning! There was a great rally and
                        the beggar made a rousing speech.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    What about?
                
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Abolition of the Upper House—
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    They were at that when I was at Eton!
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Yes. But this new man has got a way of putting things!—the people went mad.
                            (Pompously.) The Liberal platform as defined
                        at Dutfield is going to make a big difference.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (drily).
                    You think so.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Well, your agent says as much. (Opens
                        telegram.)

                    (pointing).
                    —“tremendous effect of last night’s Liberal manifesto ought to be
                        counteracted in tomorrow’s papers.” (Very
                            earnestly.) You see, Mr. Stonor, it’us a battle?cry we want.
                
                
                    STONOR

                    (a little dashed).
                    Well, they’ve been saying we have nothing to offer but personal popularity.
                        No practical reform. No—
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    No truckling to the masses, I suppose. (Walks impatiently
                            away.)

                    Well, in these democratic days—(Turns to JEAN for
                            countenance.) I hope you’ll forgive my bursting in like this.
                            (Struck by her face.) But I can see you
                        realise the gravity— (Lowering his voice with an air of
                            speaking for her ear alone.) It isn’t as if he were going to be
                        a mere private member. Everybody knows he’ll be in the Cabinet.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (drily).
                    It may be a Liberal Cabinet.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Nobody thought so up to last night. Why, even your brother—but I am afraid
                        I’m seeming officious. (Takes up his hat.)
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (coldly).
                    What about my brother?
                
                
                
                    FARN.
                    I met Lord Windlesham as I rushed out of the Carlton.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Did he say anything?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    I told him the Dutfield news.
                
                
                    STONOR

                    Well?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    He said it only confirmed his fears.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (half under his breath).
                    Said that, did he?
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Yes. Defeat is inevitable, he thinks, unless— (Pause.)

                            hands by way of dismissing FARNBOROUGH.) I’ll see what can be

                    (faintly amused).
                    You don’t understand, my young friend. Moves of this kind are not rushed at
                        by responsible politicians. I must have time for consideration.

                            (Watch in hand) I tell you. (To JEAN.) I’ll find out what time the newspapers go to press
                        on Sunday. Goodbye. (To STONOR.) I’ll be at the

                    If I decide on a counterblast I shall simply telegraph to headquarters.
                        Goodbye.
                
                
                    FARN.
                    Oh—a—g?goodbye. (A gesture of “The country’s going to the
                            dogs.”)
                
                (JEAN rings the bell. Exit FARNBOROUGH.)
                
                    STONOR
                    (studying the carpet).
                    “Political dynamite,” eh? (Pause.) After all . . .
                        women are much more conservative than men—aren’t they? (JEAN looks straight in front of her, making no attempt to
                            reply.) Especially the women the property qualification would
                        bring in. (He glances at JEAN as though for the first time
                            conscious of her silence.) You see now (he
                            throws himself into the chair by the table) one reason why I’ve
                        encouraged you to take an interest in public affairs. Because people like us
                        don’t go screaming about it, is no sign we don’t (some of us) see what’s on
                        the way. However little they want to, women of our class will have to come
                        into line. All the best things in the world—everything that civilisation has
                        won will be in danger if—when this change comes—the only women who have
                        practical political training are the women of the lower classes. Women of
                        the lower classes, and (his brows knit heavily)
                        —women inoculated by the Socialist virus.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Geoffrey.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (draws the telegraph form towards him).
                    Let us see, how we shall put it—when the
                        time comes—shall we? (He detaches a pencil from his watch
                            chain and bends over the paper, writing.)
                
                (JEAN opens her lips to speak, moves a shade nearer the table and
                    then falls back upon her silent, half?incredulous misery.)
                
                    STONOR
                    (holds the paper off, smiling).
                    Enough dynamite in that! Rather too much, isn’t there, little girl?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Geoffrey, I know her story.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Whose story?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Miss Levering’s.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    
                        Whose?
                    
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Vida Levering’s. (STONOR stares speechless. Slight
                            pause.)
                        (The words escaping from her in a miserable cry)
                        Why did you desert her?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (staggered.)
                    I? I?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Oh, why did you do it?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (bewildered).
                    What in the name of— What has she been saying to you?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Some one else told me part. Then the way you looked when you saw her at Aunt
                        Ellen’s—Miss Levering’s saying you didn’t know her—then your letting out
                        that you knew even the curious name on the handkerchief— Oh, I pieced it
                        together—
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (with recovered self?possession).
                    Your ingenuity is undeniable!
                
                
                    JEAN
                    —and then, when she said that at the meeting about “the dark hour” and I
                        looked at your face—it flashed over me— Oh, why did you desert
                        her?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I didn’t desert her.
                
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Ah?h! (Puts her hands before her eyes.)
                        (STONOR makes a passionate motion towards her, is checked
                            by her muffled voice saying) I’m glad—I’m glad! (He stares bewildered. JEAN drops her hands in her lap and
                            steadies her voice.) She went away from you, then?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You don’t expect me to enter into—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    She went away from you?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (with a look of almost uncontrollable anger).
                    Yes!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Was that because you wouldn’t marry her?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I couldn’t marry her—and she knew it.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Did you want to?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (an instant’s angry scrutiny and then turning away his
                        eyes).
                    I thought I did—then. It’s a long time ago.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    And why “couldn’t” you?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (a movement of strong irritation cut short).
                    Why are you catechising me? It’s a matter that concerns another woman.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    If you’re saying that it doesn’t concern me, you’re saying— (her lip trembles) —that you don’t concern me.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (commanding his temper with difficulty).
                    In those days I—I was absolutely dependent on my father.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Why, you must have been thirty, Geoffrey.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (slight pause).
                    What? Oh—thereabouts.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    And everybody says you’re so clever.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Well, everybody’s mistaken.
                
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (drawing nearer).
                    It must have been terribly hard— (STONOR turns toward
                            her.) for you both— (He arrests his movement
                            and stands stonily.) that a man like you shouldn’t have had the
                        freedom that even the lowest seem to have.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Freedom?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    To marry the woman they choose.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    She didn’t break off our relations because I couldn’t marry her.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Why was it, then?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You’re too young to discuss such a story. (Half turns
                            away.)
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    I’m not so young as she was when—
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (wheeling upon her).
                    Very well, then, if you will have it! The truth is, it didn’t seem to weigh
                        upon her, as it seems to on you, that I wasn’t able to marry her.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Why are you so sure of that?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Because she didn’t so much as hint such a thing when she wrote that she meant
                        to break off the—the—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    What made her write like that?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (with suppressed rage).
                    Why will you go on talking of what’s so long over and ended?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    What reason did she give?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    If your curiosity has so got the upper hand—ask her.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (her eyes upon him).
                    You’re afraid to tell me.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (putting pressure on himself to answer quietly).
                    I still hoped—at that time—to win my father over. She blamed me
                        because (goes to window
                            and looks blindly out and speaks in a low tone) if the child had
                        lived it wouldn’t have been possible to get my father to—to overlook it.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (faintly).
                    You wanted it overlooked? I don’t underst—
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (turning passionately back to her).
                    Of course you don’t. (He seizes her hand and tries to draw
                            her to him.) If you did, you wouldn’t be the beautiful, tender,
                        innocent child you are—
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (has withdrawn her hand and shrunk from him with an
                        impulse—slight as is its expression—so tragically eloquent, that fear for
                        the first time catches hold of him).
                    I am glad you didn’t mean to desert her, Geoffrey. It wasn’t your fault after
                        all—only some misunderstanding that can be cleared up.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    
                        Cleared up?
                    
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Yes. Cleared up.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (aghast).
                    You aren’t thinking that this miserable old affair I’d as good as
                        forgotten—
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (in a horror?struck whisper, with a glance at the door which
                        he doesn’t see).
                    
                        Forgotten!
                    
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    No, no. I don’t mean exactly forgotten. But you’re torturing me so I don’t
                        know what I’m saying. (He goes closer.) You
                        aren’t—Jean! you—you aren’t going to let it come between you and me!
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (presses her handkerchief to her lips, and then, taking it
                        away, answers steadily).
                    I can’t make or unmake what’s past. But I’m glad, at least, that you didn’t
                            mean to desert her in her trouble. You’ll remind her of
                        that first of all, won’t you? (Moves to the door,
                            L.)
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Where are you going? (Raising his voice.) Why
                        should I remind anybody of what I want only to forget?
                
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (finger on lip).
                    Sh!
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (with eyes on the door).
                    You don’t mean that she’s—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Yes. I left her to get a little rest. (He recoils in an
                            access of uncontrollable rage. She follows him. Speechless, he goes down
                            R. to get his hat.) Geoffrey, don’t go before you hear me. I
                        don’t know if what I think matters to you now—but I hope it does. (With tears.) You can still make me think of you
                        without shrinking—if you will.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (fixes her a moment with his eyes. Then sternly).
                    What is it you are asking of me?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    To make amends, Geoffrey.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (with an outburst).
                    You poor little innocent!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    I’m poor enough. But (locking her hands together)
                        I’m not so innocent but what I know you must right that old wrong now, if
                        you’re ever to right it.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You aren’t insane enough to think I would turn round in these few hours and
                        go back to something that ten years ago was ended for ever! Why, it’s stark,
                        staring madness!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    No. (Catching on his arm.) What you did ten years
                            ago—that was mad. This is paying a debt.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Look here, Jean, you’re dreadfully wrought up and excited—tired too—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    No, not tired—though I’ve travelled so far to?day. I know you smile at sudden
                        conversions. You think they’re hysterical—worse—vulgar. But people must get
                        their revelations how they can. And, Geoffrey, if I can’t make you see this
                        one of mine—I shall know your love could
                        never mean strength to me. Only weakness. And I shall be afraid. So afraid
                        I’ll never dare to give you the chance of making me loathe
                        myself. I shall never see you again.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    How right I was to be afraid of that vein of fanaticism in you.
                            (Moves towards the door.)
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Certainly you couldn’t make a greater mistake than to go away now and think
                        it any good ever to come back. (He turns.) Even if
                        I came to feel different, I couldn’t do anything different. I
                        should know all this couldn’t be forgotten. I should know that it would
                        poison my life in the end. Yours too.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (with suppressed fury).
                    She has made good use of her time! (With a sudden
                            thought.) What has changed her? Has she been seeing
                        visions too?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    What do you mean?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Why is she intriguing to get hold of a man that, ten years ago, she flatly
                        refused to see, or hold any communication with?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    “Intriguing to get hold of?” She hasn’t mentioned you!
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    What! Then how in the name of Heaven do you know—that she
                        wants—what you ask?
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (firmly).
                    There can’t be any doubt about that.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (with immense relief).
                    You absurd, ridiculous child! Then all this is just your own unaided
                        invention. Well—I could thank God! (Falls into the nearest
                            chair and passes his handkerchief over his face.)
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (perplexed, uneasy).
                    For what are you thanking God?
                
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (trying to think out his plan of action).
                    Suppose—(I’m not going to risk it)—but suppose— (He looks
                            up and at the sight of JEAN’S face a new tenderness comes into his own.
                            He rises suddenly.) Whether I deserve to suffer or not—it’s
                        quite certain you don’t Don’t cry, dear one. It never was the
                        real thing. I had to wait till I knew you before I understood.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (lifts her eyes brimming).
                    Oh, it that true? (Checks her movement towards
                            him.) Loving you has made things clear to me I didn’t dream of
                        before. If I could think that because of me you were able to do this—
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (seizes her by the shoulders and says hoarsely).
                    Look here! Do you seriously ask me to give up the girl I love—to go and offer
                        to marry a woman that even to think of—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    You cared for her once. You’ll care about her again. She is beautiful and
                        brilliant—everything. I’ve heard she could win any man she set herself
                        to—
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (pushing JEAN from him).
                    She’s bewitched you!
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Geoffrey, Geoffrey, you aren’t going away 
                            like
                            lik
                         that. This isn’t the end!
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (darkly—hesitating).
                    I suppose even if she refused me, you’d—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    She won’t refuse you.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    She did once.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    She didn’t refuse to marry you—
                
                (JEAN is going to the door.)
                
                    STONOR
                    (catches her by the arm)
                    Wait!—a— (Hunting for some means of gaining time.)
                        Lady John is waiting all this while for the
                        car to go back with a message.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    That’s not a matter of life and death—
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    All the same—I’ll go down and give the order.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (stopping quite still on a sudden).
                    Very well. (Sits C.) You’ll come back if you’re the
                        man I pray you are. (Breaks into a flood of silent tears,
                            her elbows on the table (C.) her face in her hands.)
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (returns, bends over her, about to take her in his
                        arms).
                    Dearest of all the world—
                
                (Door L. opens softly and VIDA LEVERING appears. She is arrested
                    at the sight of STONOR, and is in the act of drawing back when, upon the slight
                    noise, STONOR looks round. His face darkens, he stands staring at her and then
                    with a look of speechless anger goes silently out C. JEAN, hearing him shut the
                    door, drops her head on the table with a sob. VIDA LEVERING crosses slowly to
                    her and stands a moment silent at the girl’s side.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    What is the matter?
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (lifting her head and drying her eyes).
                    I—I’ve been seeing Geoffrey.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (with an attempt at lightness).
                    Is this the effect seeing Geoffrey has?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    You see, I know now (as MISS LEVERING looks quite
                            uncomprehending) —how he (drops her
                            eyes) —how he spoiled some one else’s life.

                    Who tells you that?
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Several people have told me.
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Well, you should be very careful how you believe what you hear.
                
                
                    JEAN

                    MISS L.
                    I know that it’s possible to be mistaken.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    I see! You’re trying to shield him—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Why should I—what is it to me?

                    MISS L.

                    What’s the use of your going on denying it? MISS LEVERING,

                        Geoffrey doesn’t

                    You would be impertinent (softening) if you weren’t

                    But there’s something you can do—
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    What?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Bring him to the point where he recognises that he’s in our debt.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    In our debt?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    In debt to women. He can’t repay the one he robbed—
                
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (wincing and rising from her knees).
                    Yes, yes.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (sternly).
                    No, he can’t repay the dead. But there are the living. There are the
                        thousands with hope still in their hearts and youth in their blood. Let him
                        help them. Let him be a Friend to Women.
                
                
                    JEAN
                    (rising on a wave of enthusiasm).
                    Yes, yes—I understand. That too!
                
                (The door opens. As STONOR enters with LADY JOHN, he makes a
                    slight gesture towards the two as much as to say, “You see.”)
                
                    JEAN
                    (catching sight of him).
                    Thank you!
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (in a clear, commonplace tone to JEAN).
                    Well, you rather gave us the slip. Vida, I believe Mr. Stonor wants to see
                        you for a few minutes (glances at watch)—but I’d
                        like a word with you first, as I must get back. (To
                            STONOR.) Do you think the car—your man said something about
                        re?charging.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (hastily).
                    Oh, did he?—I’ll see about it.
                
                (As STONOR is going out he encounters the BUTLER. Exit
                    STONOR.)
                
                    BUTLER.
                    Mr. Trent has called, Miss, to take Miss Levering to the meeting.
                
                
                    JEAN.
                    Bring Mr. Trent into my sitting?room. I’ll tell him—you can’t go
                        to?night.
                
                [Exeunt BUTLER C., JEAN L.
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (hurriedly).
                    I know, my dear, you’re not aware of what that impulsive girl
                        wants to insist on.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes, I am aware of it.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    But it isn’t with your sanction, surely, that she goes on making this
                        extraordinary demand.
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (slowly).
                    I didn’t sanction it at first, but I’ve been thinking it over.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Then all I can say is I am greatly disappointed in you. You threw this man
                        over years ago for reasons—whatever they were—that seemed to you good and
                        sufficient. And now you come between him and a younger woman—just to play
                        Nemesis, so far as I can make out!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Is that what he says?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    He says nothing that isn’t fair and considerate.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I can see he’s changed.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    And you’re unchanged—is that it?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I’ve changed more than he.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    But (pity and annoyance blended in her tone)—you
                        care about him still, Vida?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    No.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    I see. It’s just that you wish to marry somebody—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Oh, Lady John, there are no men listening.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (surprised).
                    No, I didn’t suppose there were.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Then why keep up that old pretence?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    What pre—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    That to marry at all costs is every woman’s dearest ambition
                        till the grave closes over her. You and I know it isn’t
                        true.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Well, but— Oh! it was just the unexpected sight of him bringing it back—
                            That was what fired you this afternoon! (With an honest attempt at sympathetic understanding.) Of
                        course. The memory of a thing like that can never die—can never even be
                            dimmed—for the woman.
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I mean her to think so.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (bewildered).
                    Jean!
                
                (MISS LEVERING nods.)
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    And it isn’t so?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You don’t seriously believe a woman with anything else to think about, comes
                        to the end of ten years still absorbed in a memory of that
                        sort?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (astonished).
                    You’ve got over it, then!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    If the newspapers didn’t remind me I shouldn’t remember once a twelvemonth
                        that there was ever such a person as Geoffrey Stonor in the world.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (with unconscious rapture).
                    Oh, I’m so glad!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (smiles grimly).
                    Yes, I’m glad too.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    And if Geoffrey Stonor offered you—what’s called “reparation”—you’d refuse
                        it?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (smiles a little contemptuously).
                    Geoffrey Stonor! For me he’s simply one of the far?back links in a chain of
                        evidence. It’s certain I think a hundred times of other women’s present
                        unhappiness, to once that I remember that old unhappiness of mine that’s
                        past. I think of the nail and chain makers of Cradley Heath. The sweated
                        girls of the slums. I think of the army of ill?used women whose very
                        existence I mustn’t mention—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (interrupting hurriedly).
                    Then why in Heaven’s name do you let poor Jean imagine—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (bending forward).
                    Look—I’ll trust you, Lady John. I don’t suffer from that old wrong as Jean
                        thinks I do, but I shall coin her sympathy into gold for a greater cause
                        than mine.
                
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    I don’t understand you.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Jean isn’t old enough to be able to care as much about a principle as about a
                        person. But if my half?forgotten pain can turn her generosity into the
                        common treasury—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    What do you propose she shall do, poor child?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Use her hold over Geoffrey Stonor to make him help us!
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Help you?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    The man who served one woman—God knows how many more—very ill, shall serve
                        hundreds of thousands well. Geoffrey Stonor shall make it harder for his
                        son, harder still for his grandson, to treat any woman as he treated me.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    How will he do that?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    By putting an end to the helplessness of women.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (ironically).
                    You must think he has a great deal of power—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Power? Yes, men have too much over penniless and frightened women.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (impatiently).
                    What nonsense! You talk as though the women hadn’t their share of human
                        nature. We aren’t made of ice any more than the men.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    No, but all the same we have more self?control.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Than men?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You know we have.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (shrewdly).
                    I know we mustn’t admit it.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    For fear they’d call us fishes!
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (evasively).
                    They talk of our lack of self?control—but
                        it’s the last thing they want women to have.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Oh, we know what they want us to have. So we make shift to have it. If we
                        don’t, we go without hope—sometimes we go without bread.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (shocked).
                    Vida—do you mean to say that you—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I mean to say that men’s vanity won’t let them see it, but the thing’s
                        largely a question of economics.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (shocked).
                    You never loved him, then!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Oh, yes, I loved him—once. It was my helplessness turned the
                        best thing life can bring, into a curse for both of us.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    I don’t understand you—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Oh, being “understood!”—that’s too much to expect. When people come to know
                        I’ve joined the Union—
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    But you won’t—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    —who is there who will resist the temptation to say, “Poor Vida Levering!
                        What a pity she hasn’t got a husband and a baby to keep her quiet”? The few
                        who know about me, they’ll be equally sure that it’s not the larger view of
                        life I’ve gained—my own poor little story is responsible for my new
                        departure. (Leans forward and looks into LADY JOHN’S
                            face.) My best friend, she will be surest of all, that it’s a
                        private sense of loss, or, lower yet, a grudge—! But I tell you the only
                        difference between me and thousands of women with husbands and babies is
                        that I’m free to say what I think. They aren’t.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (rising and looking at her watch).
                    I must get back—my poor ill?used guests.
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (rising).
                    I won’t ring. I think you’ll find Mr. Stonor downstairs waiting for you.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (embarrassed).
                    Oh—a—he will have left word about the car in any case.
                
                (MISS LEVERING has opened the door (C.). ALLEN TRENT is in the act
                    of saying goodbye to JEAN in the hall.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    Well, Mr. Trent, I didn’t expect to see you this evening.
                
                
                    TRENT
                    (comes and stands in the doorway).
                    Why not? Have I ever failed?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Lady John, this is one of our allies. He is good enough to squire me through
                        the rabble from time to time.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Well, I think it’s very handsome of you, after what she said to?day about
                        men. (Shakes hands.)
                
                
                    TRENT.
                    I’ve no great opinion of most men myself. I might add—or of most women.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Oh! Well, at any rate I shall go away relieved to think that Miss Levering’s
                        plain speaking hasn’t alienated all masculine regard.
                
                
                    TRENT.
                    Why should it?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    That’s right, Mr. Trent! Don’t believe all she says in the heat of
                        propaganda.
                
                
                    TRENT.
                    I do believe all she says. But I’m not cast down.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (smiling).
                    Not when she says—
                
                
                    TRENT
                    (interrupting).
                    Was there ever a mysogynist of my sex who ended by deciding to make an
                        exception?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (smiling significantly).
                    Oh, if that’s what you build on!
                
                
                
                    TRENT.
                    Well, why shouldn’t a man?hater on your side prove equally open to
                        reason?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    That part of the question doesn’t concern me. I’ve come to a place where I
                        realise that the first battles of this new campaign must be fought by women
                        alone. The only effective help men could give—amendment of the law—they
                        refuse. The rest is nothing.
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Don’t be ungrateful, Vida. Here’s Mr. Trent ready to face criticism in
                        publicly championing you.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    It’s an illusion that I as an individual need Mr. Trent. I am quite safe in
                        the crowd. Please don’t wait for me, and don’t come for me again.
                
                
                    TRENT
                    (flushes).
                    Of course if you’d rather—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    And that reminds me. I was asked to thank you and to tell you, too, that
                        they—the women of the Union—they won’t need your chairmanship any
                        more—though that, I beg you to believe, has nothing to do with any feeling
                        of mine.
                
                
                    TRENT
                    (hurt).
                    Of course, I know there must be other men ready—better known men—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    It isn’t that. It’s simply that they find a man can’t keep a rowdy meeting in
                        order as well as a woman.
                
                (He stares.)
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    You aren’t serious?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (to TRENT).
                    Haven’t you noticed that all their worst disturbances come when men are in
                        charge?
                
                
                    TRENT.
                    Well—a—(laughs a little ruefully as he moves to the
                            door) I hadn’t connected the two ideas. Goodbye.
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Goodbye.
                
                (JEAN takes him downstairs, right centre.)
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (as TRENT disappears).
                    That nice boy’s in love with you.
                
                (MISS LEVERING simply looks at her.)
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Goodbye. (They shake hands.) I wish you hadn’t been
                        so unkind to that nice boy!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Do you?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN.
                    Yes, for then I would be more certain of your telling Geoffrey Stonor that
                        intelligent women don’t nurse their wrongs and lie in wait to punish
                        them.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You are not certain?
                
                
                    LADY JOHN
                    (goes close up to VIDA).
                    Are you?
                
                (VIDA stands with her eyes on the ground, silent, motionless. LADY
                    JOHN, with a nervous glance at her watch and a gesture of extreme perturbation,
                    goes hurriedly out. VIDA shuts the door. She comes slowly back, sits down and
                    covers her face with her hands. She rises and begins to walk up and down,
                    obviously trying to master her agitation. Enter GEOFFREY STONOR.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    Well, have they primed you? Have you got your lesson (with
                            a little broken laugh)
                        by heart at last?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (looking at her from immeasurable distance).
                    I am not sure I understand you. (Pause.) However
                        unpropitious your mood may be—I shall discharge my errand. (Pause. Her silence irritates
                            him.) I have promised to offer you what I believe is called
                        “amends.”
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (quickly).
                    You’ve come to realise, then—after all these years—that you owed me
                        something?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (on the brink of protest, checks himself).
                    I am not here to deny it.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (fiercely).
                    Pay, then—pay.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (a moment’s dread as he looks at her, his lips set. Then
                        stonily).
                    I have promised that, if you exact it, I will.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Ah! If I insist you’ll “make it all good”! (Quite
                            low.) Then don’t you know you must pay me in kind?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    What do you mean.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Give me back what you took from me: my old faith. Give me that.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Oh, if you mean to make phrases— (A gesture of scant
                            patience.)
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (going closer).
                    Or give me back mere kindness—or even tolerance. Oh, I don’t mean
                            your tolerance! Give me back the power to think fairly of
                        my brothers—not as mockers—thieves.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I have not mocked you. And I have asked you—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Something you knew I should refuse! Or (her eyes
                            blaze) did you dare to be afraid I wouldn’t?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I suppose, if we set our teeth, we could—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I couldn’—not even if I set my teeth. And you wouldn’t dream of asking me, if
                        you thought there was the smallest chance.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I can do no more than make you an offer of such reparation as in my power. If
                            you don’t accept it— (He turns with an air of “That’s done.”)
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Accept it? No! . . . Go away and live in debt! Pay and pay—and find yourself
                        still in debt!—for a thing you’ll never be able to give me back. (Lower.) And when you come to die, say to yourself,
                        “I paid all creditors but one.”
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I’m rather tired, you know, of this talk of debt. If I hear that you persist
                        in it I shall have to—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    What? (she faces him).
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    No. I’ll keep my resolution. (Turning to the
                        door.)
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (intercepting him).
                    What resolution?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I came here, under considerable pressure, to speak of the future—not to
                        re?open the past.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    The Future and the Past are one.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You talk as if that old madness was mine alone. It is the woman’s way.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I know. And it’s not fair. Men suffer as well as we by the woman’s starting
                        wrong. We are taught to think the man a sort of demigod. If he tells her:
                        “go down into Hell”—down into Hell she goes.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Make no mistake. Not the woman alone. They go down together.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes, they go down together, but the man comes up alone. As a rule. It is more
                        convenient so—for him. And for the Other Woman.
                
                (The eyes of both go to JEAN’S door.)
                
                    STONOR
                    (angrily).
                    My conscience is clear. I know—and so do you—that most men in my position
                        wouldn’t have troubled themselves. I gave myself endless trouble.
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (with wondering eyes).
                    So you’ve gone about all these years feeling that you’d discharged every
                        obligation.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Not only that. I stood by you with a fidelity that was nothing short of
                        Quixotic. If, woman like, you must recall the Past—I insist on
                        your recalling it correctly.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (very low).
                    You think I don’t recall it correctly?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Not when you make—other people believe that I deserted you. (With gathering wrath.) It’s a curious enough charge when you
                        stop to consider— (Checks himself, and with a gesture of
                            impatience sweeps the whole thing out of his way.)
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Well, when we do—just for five minutes out of ten years—when we
                        do stop to consider—
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    We remember it was you who did the deserting! Since you had to
                        rake the story up, you might have had the fairness to tell the facts.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You think “the facts” would have excused you! (She
                            sits.)
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    No doubt you’ve forgotten them, since Lady John tells me you wouldn’t
                        remember my existence once a year if the newspapers didn’t—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Ah, you minded that!
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (with manly spirit).
                    I minded your giving false impressions. (She is about to
                            speak, he advances on her.) Do you deny that you returned my
                        letters unopened?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (quietly).
                    No.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Do you deny that you refused to see me—and that, when I persisted, you
                        vanished?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I don’t deny any of those things.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Why, I had no trace of you for years!
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I suppose not.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Very well, then. What could I do?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Nothing. It was too late to do anything.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    It wasn’t too late! You knew—since you “read the papers”—that my father died
                        that same year. There was no longer any barrier between us.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Oh yes, there was a barrier.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Of your own making, then.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I had my guilty share in it—but the barrier (her voice
                            trembles) —the barrier was your invention.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    It was no “invention.” If you had ever known my father—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Oh, the echoes! How often you used to say, if I “knew your father!” But you
                        said, too (lower)—you called the greatest barrier
                        by another name.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    What name?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (very low).
                    The child that was to come.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (hastily).
                    That was before my father died. While I still hoped to get his consent.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (nods).
                    How the thought of that all?powerful personage used to terrorise me! What
                        chance had a little unborn child against “the last of the great feudal
                        lords,” as you called him.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You know the child would have stood between you and me!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I know the child did stand between you and me!
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (with vague uneasiness).
                    It did stand—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Happy mothers teach their children. Mine had to teach me.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You talk as if—
                
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    —teach me that a woman may do a thing for love’s sake that shall kill
                        love.
                
                (A silence.)
                
                    STONOR
                    (fearing and putting from him fuller comprehension, rises with
                        an air of finality).
                    You certainly made it plain you had no love left for me.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I had need of it all for the child.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (stares—comes closer, speaks hurriedly and very low).
                    Do you mean then that, after all—it lived?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    No; I mean that it was sacrificed. But it showed me no barrier is so
                        impassible as the one a little child can raise.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (a light dawning).
                    Was that why you . . . was that why?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (nods, speechless a moment).
                    Day and night there it was!—between my thought of you and me. (He sits again, staring at her.) When I was most
                        unhappy I would wake, thinking I heard it cry. It was my own crying I heard,
                        but I seemed to have it in my arms. I suppose I was mad. I used to lie there
                        in that lonely farmhouse pretending to hush it. It was so I hushed
                        myself.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I never knew—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I didn’t blame you. You couldn’t risk being with me.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You agreed that for both our sakes—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes, you had to be very circumspect. You were so well known. Your autocratic
                        father—your brilliant political future—
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Be fair. Our future—as I saw it then.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes, it all hung on concealment. It must have looked quite simple to you. You
                            didn’t know that the ghost of a child
                        that had never seen the light, the frail thing you meant to sweep aside and
                            forget—have swept aside and forgotten—you didn’t know it
                        was strong enough to push you out of my life, (Lower with
                            an added intensity.) It can do more. (Leans
                            over to him and whispers.) It can push that girl out. (STONOR’S face changes.) It can do more still.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Are you threatening me?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    No, I am preparing you.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    For what?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    For the work that must be done. Either with your help—or
                            that girl’s.
                
                (STONOR lifts his eyes a moment.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    One of two things. Either her life, and all she has, given to this new
                        service—or a Ransom, if I give her up to you.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I see. A price. Well—?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (looks searchingly in his face, hesitates and shakes her
                        head).
                    Even if I could trust you to pay—no, it would be a poor bargain to give her
                        up for anything you could do.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (rising).
                    In spite of your assumption—she may not be your tool.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You are horribly afraid she is! But you are wrong. Don’t think it’s merely I
                        that have got hold of Jean Dunbarton.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (angrily).
                    Who else?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    The New Spirit that’s abroad.
                
                (STONOR turns away with an exclamation and begins to pace,
                    sentinel?like, up and down before JEAN’S door.)
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    How else should that inexperienced girl have felt the new loyalty and
                        responded as she did?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (under his breath).
                    “New” indeed—however little loyal.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Loyal above all. But no newer than electricity was when it first lit up the
                        world. It had been there since the world began—waiting to do away with the
                        dark. So has the thing you’re fighting.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (his voice held down to its lowest register).
                    The thing I’m fighting is nothing more than one person’s hold on a highly
                        sensitive imagination. I consented to this interview with the hope—(A gesture of impotence.) It only remains for me to
                        show her your true motive is revenge.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Once say that to her and you are lost!
                
                (STONOR motionless; his look is the look of a man who sees
                    happiness slipping away.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    I know what it is that men fear. It even seems as if it must be through fear
                        that your enlightenment will come. That is why I see a value in Jean
                        Dunbarton far beyond her fortune.
                
                (STONOR lifts his eyes dully and fixes them on VIDA’S
                    face.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    More than any girl I know—if I keep her from you—that gentle, inflexible
                        creature could rouse in men the old half?superstitious fear—
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    “Fear?” I believe you are mad.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    “Mad.” “Unsexed.” These are the words to?day. In the Middle Ages men cried
                        out “Witch!” and burnt her—the woman who served no man’s bed or board.
                
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You want to make that poor child believe—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    She sees for herself we’ve come to a place where we find there’s a value in
                        women apart from the value men see in them. You teach us not to look to you
                        for some of the things we need most. If women must be freed by women, we
                        have need of such as—(her eyes go to JEAN’S
                        door)—who knows? She may be the new Joan of Arc.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (aghast).
                    That she should be the sacrifice!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You have taught us to look very calmly on the sacrifice of women. Men tell us
                        in every tongue it’s “a necessary evil.”
                
                (STONOR stands rooted, staring at the ground.)
                
                    MISS L.
                    One girl’s happiness—against a thing nobler than happiness for thousands—who
                        can hesitate?—Not Jean.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Good God! Can’t you see that this crazed campaign you’d start her on—even if
                        it’s successful, it can only be so through the help of men? What excuse
                        shall you make your own soul for not going straight to the goal?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You think we wouldn’t be glad to go straight to the goal?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I do. I see you’d much rather punish me and see her revel in a morbid
                        self?sacrifice.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You say I want to punish you only because, like most men, you won’t take the
                        trouble to understand what we do want—or how determined we are to have it.
                        You can’t kill this new spirit among women. (Going
                            nearer.) And you couldn’t make a greater mistake than to think
                        it finds a home only in the exceptional, or the unhappy. It’s so strange, Geoffrey, to see a man like you as much
                        deluded as the Hyde Park loafers who say to Ernestine Blunt, “Who’s hurt
                            your feelings?” Why not realise (going
                            quite close to him) this is a thing that goes deeper than
                        personal experience? And yet (lowering her voice and
                            glancing at the door), if you take only the narrowest personal
                        view, a good deal depends on what you and I agree upon in the next five
                        minutes.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (bringing her farther away from the door).
                    You recommend my realising the larger issues. But in your ambition to attach
                        that girl to the chariot wheels of “Progress,” you quite ignore the fact
                        that people fitter for such work—the men you look to enlist in the end—are
                        ready waiting to give the thing a chance.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Men are ready! What men?
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (avoiding her eyes, picking his words).
                    Women have themselves to blame that the question has grown so delicate that
                        responsible people shrink—for the moment—from being implicated in it.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    We have seen the “shrinking.”
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Without quoting any one else, I might point out that the New Antagonism seems
                        to have blinded you to the small fact that I, for one, am not an
                        opponent.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    The phrase has a familiar ring. We have heard it from four
                        hundred and twenty others.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    I spoke, if I may say so, of some one who would count. Some one who can carry
                        his party along with him—or risk a seat in the Cabinet.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (quickly).
                    Did you mean you are ready to do that?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    An hour ago I was.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Ah! . . . an hour ago.
                
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Exactly. You don’t understand men. They can be led. They can’t be driven. Ten
                        minutes before you came into the room I was ready to say I would throw in my
                        political lot with this Reform.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    And now . . . ?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Now you block my way by an attempt at coercion. By forcing my hand you give
                        my adherence an air of bargain?driving for a personal end. Exactly the
                        mistake of the ignorant agitators of your “Union,” as you call it. You have
                        a great deal to learn. This movement will go forward, not because of the
                        agitation, but in spite of it. There are men in Parliament who would have
                        been actively serving the Reform to?day . . . as actively as so vast a
                        constitutional change—
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (smiles faintly).
                    And they haven’t done it because—
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Because it would have put a premium on breaches of decent behavior. (He takes a crumpled piece of paper out of his
                            pocket.) Look here!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (flushes with excitement as she reads the telegram).
                    This is very good. I see only one objection.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Objection!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    You haven’t sent it.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    That is your fault.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    When did you write this?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Just before you came in—when— (He glances at the
                            door.)
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Ah! It must have pleased Jean—that message. (Offers him
                            back the paper.)
                
                (STONOR astonished at her yielding it up so lightly, and
                    remembering JEAN had not so much as read it. He throws himself heavily into a
                    chair and drops his head in his hands.)
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    I could drive a hard?and?fast bargain with you, but I think I won’t. If
                            both love and ambition urge you on, perhaps— (She gazes at the slack, hopeless figure with its sudden look
                            of age—goes over silently and stands by his side.) After all,
                        life hasn’t been quite fair to you— (He raises his heavy
                            eyes.) You fall out of one ardent woman’s dreams into
                        another’s.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You may as well tell me—do you mean to—?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    To keep you and her apart? No.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (for the first time tears come into his eyes. After a moment
                        he holds out his hand).
                    What can I do for you?
                
                (MISS LEVERING shakes her head—speechless.)
                
                    STONOR.
                    For the real you. Not the Reformer, or the would?be politician—for the woman
                        I so unwillingly hurt. (As she turns away, struggling with
                            her feeling, he lays a detaining hand on her arm.) You may not
                        believe it, but now that I understand, there is almost nothing I wouldn’t do
                        to right that old wrong.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    There’s nothing to be done. You can never give me back my child.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (at the anguish in VIDA’S face his own has changed).
                    Will that ghost give you no rest?
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Yes, oh, yes. I see life is nobler than I knew. There is work to do.
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (stopping her as she goes towards the folding doors).
                    Why should you think that it’s only you, these ten years have taught
                        something to? Why not give even a man
                        credit for a willingness to learn something of life, and for being
                        sorry—profoundly sorry—for the pain his instruction has cost others? You
                        seem to think I’ve taken it all quite lightly. That’s not fair. All my life,
                        ever since you disappeared, the thought of you has hurt. I would give
                        anything I possess to know you—were happy again.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    Oh, happiness!
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (significantly).
                    Why shouldn’t you find it still.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (stares an instant).
                    I see! She couldn’t help telling about Allen Trent—Lady John couldn’t.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You’re one of the people the years have not taken from, but given more to do.
                        You are more than ever . . . You haven’t lost your beauty.
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    The gods saw it was so little effectual, it wasn’t worth taking away. (She stands looking out into the void.) One woman’s
                        mishap?—what is that? A thing as trivial to the great world as it’s sordid
                        in most eyes. But the time has come when a woman may look about her, and
                        say, “What general significance has my secret pain? Does it ‘join on’ to
                        anything?” And I find it does. I’m no longer merely a woman who has stumbled
                        on the way. I’m one (she controls with difficulty the
                            shake in her voice) who has got up bruised and bleeding, wiped
                        the dust from her face, and said to herself not merely, “Here’s one luckless
                        woman! but—here is a stone of stumbling to many. Let’s see if it can’t be
                        moved out of other women’s way.” And she calls people to come and help. No
                        mortal man, let alone a woman, by herself, can move that rock
                        of offence. But (with a sudden sombre flame of
                            enthusiasm) if many help, Geoffrey, the thing can be done.
                
                
                
                    STONOR
                    (looks at her with wondering pity).
                    Lord! how you care!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    (touched by his moved face).
                    Don’t be so sad. Shall I tell you a secret? Jean’s ardent dreams needn’t
                        frighten you, if she has a child. That—from the beginning, it
                        was not the strong arm—it was the weakest—the little, little arms that
                        subdued the fiercest of us. (STONOR puts out a pitying
                            hand uncertainly towards her. She does not take it, but speaks with
                            great gentleness.) You will have other children, Geoffrey—for me
                        there was to be only one. Well, well—(she brushes her
                            tears away)—since men alone have tried and failed to make a decent world
                            for the little children to live in—it’s as well some of us are
                            childless.(Quietly taking up her hat and
                            cloak.) Yes, we are the ones who have no excuse for
                        standing aloof from the fight.
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    Vida!
                
                
                    MISS L.
                    What?
                
                
                    STONOR.
                    You’ve forgotten something. (As she looks back he is
                            signing the message.)
                        This.
                
                (She goes out silently with the “political dynamite” in her
                    hand.)
                CURTAIN.
