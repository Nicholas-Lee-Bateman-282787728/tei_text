                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> late M. de Corbière, whom I had the honor to number among
                    my friends, in the year 1885 found himself broken in health, so that he was
                    compelled to retire from his duties at the University of Paris, and seek
                    recuperation in the quiet of some small community. Tired of Paris and the other
                    cities where he had been accustomed to spend his leisure, he migrated to a small
                    town in the south of France. There he remained for seven months, during which
                    time he lodged in an ancient stone house at the northern extremity of the town,
                    with a Madame&#151;Madame&#151;well, since I think of it, he did not
                    tell me her name. In fact, I now remember, <pb id="VAA3890-006" n="6"/> he told
                    me that he never heard it himself, and that&#151;strange as it may
                    seem&#151;the daughter of the Madame had asked him to let that part of their
                    acquaintance be omitted, and simply address them as Madame and Mademoiselle.</p>
                <p>The old stone house stood opposite a cemetery of so ancient a date that the
                    tombstones were decaying. Many years had passed since this abode of the dead
                    finally ceased to be of interest to anybody; and in a few more generations it
                    would again become a grain field, and its monuments serve as doorsteps and
                    Parisian cobblestones. On the north of the house lay a beautiful valley, where
                    flocks and herds grazed, and where my friend lay in the sunshine for hours
                    gazing at the glorious skies of southern France.</p>
                <p>The Madame of the house was a small, slender, white-haired woman of over seventy
                    years of age. Her daughter, who was the only other person in the house, passed
                    her fifty-fourth year during M. de Corbière's sojourn there. She was a woman of
                    no little intelligence; and had it not been for the ugly difference in the color
                    of her eyes, might even yet have <pb id="VAA3890-007" n="7"/> been accounted
                    beautiful. One eye&#151;the left&#151;was blue and the other black in
                    such shades as to make one instinctively turn away when both looked into one's
                    face. It soon became evident to my friend that a certain mysterious seclusion
                    hovered about these two women and their odd and ancient abode. They never had
                    any sort of intercourse with anybody; and when he had become attracted by the
                    seclusion of the house in which they lived and had inquired if he might lodge
                    there for a few months, the first question asked was, "Do you live in the town?"
                    Assured that he was an utter stranger, they welcomed him, and did everything in
                    their power to make him feel at home.</p>
                <p>He had resided in the house but a short time when he noticed that he had become
                    an object of public curiosity. He never ventured on the street but that the
                    staring eyes of the townspeople were directed upon him; and more than once he
                    noticed persons who passed him turn and look. It was a curiosity that had no
                    humor in it, but more of awe, as if he held the key to an enigma that was or
                    once had been of no small concern. One Sunday morning <pb id="VAA3890-008" n="8"
                    /> when he went to mass with the aged mother and the daughter, a sort of silent
                    consternation seized the congregation, as would come upon one at the sight of a
                    friend whom one had considered long dead. "This is the last time we shall go to
                    church," said the mother, on the way home; and while M. de Corbière lived with
                    them they did not go again. Several times tradespeople with whom he came in
                    contact asked him questions which he could not answer, and which had the ring of
                    mystery, such as, "Is not this, indeed, the daughter of the famous doctor?" "Has
                    she not the eyes of Satiani?" When he protested that he understood not whereof
                    they spoke, they began to tell him what they meant, and why they asked.</p>
                <p>The Madame seldom ventured from the house. She went to church once, for a walk
                    another time, and twice or thrice to the cemetery across the way. Beyond these
                    excursions, her steps did not venture farther than the end of the court; and if
                    any one chanced to be passing, she turned her back. She belonged to a former
                    generation; nearly always she talked <pb id="VAA3890-009" n="9"/> of events
                    twenty, thirty, and sometimes forty years past, especially those which in that
                    time go to make up the history of Paris. For fifteen years she and her daughter
                    had lived here in the stone house, where they had come to await the Madame's
                    death, which at the time of their arrival had seemed probable any day. It was
                    her last and only remaining desire to be buried in a certain spot in the
                    cemetery across the way.</p>
                <p>Beyond these facts, which M. de Corbière gathered from their conversation, from
                    them he learned nothing more. Their past and inner lives were closed and sealed.
                    Not that they were unpleasantly glum; for they were, indeed, always polite and
                    accommodating&#151;at times to a degree that was painful; they seemed
                    greatly pleased with his company; and on his departure, bade him return
                    sometime. But from the people of the town into whose confidence and friendship
                    he finally made inroads, M. de Corbière learned of a chain of events concerning
                    the stone house that had come to be a tradition, and that had not only made the
                    house famous, but had given the town <pb id="VAA3890-010" n="10"/> a sort of
                    luster in the country thereabouts.</p>
                <p>His interest in this unwritten piece of local history was not small; but being a
                    man of scientific pursuits, he had not the patience to hold a pen for any
                    considerable length of time, or, as he himself confessed, the necessary skill
                    with language to set it down in any systematic way available for reading. Having
                    delighted his scientific nature by collecting the materials&#151;statements,
                    letters, records, etc.&#151;and having no further interest, he placed the
                    matter in my hands, begging me to give it voice in my native tongue, which I
                    have endeavored to do in the following chapters.</p>

                    <p>"See who is at the door, Madeline."</p>
                    <p>"Which door, father? I did not hear any knocking."</p>
                    <p>"I thought it was the front&#151;didn't you, Doctor?"</p>
                    <p>"I was not listening."</p>
                    <p>The front door opened, and in walked a young man clad in military
                        uniform.</p>
                    <p>"Oh! it is Joseph," cried the girl, running into his arms. "But why do you
                        wear your uniform? Surely, you do not drill today. And you have not even one
                        smile for me?" she continued, roguishly looking into his face.</p>
                    <p>The young man held the girl for a moment, then releasing her, he turned to
                        the two men at the table, and was about to address them, when the father
                        interrupted.</p>
                    <p>"Come, my lad, and taste the wine <pb id="VAA3890-012" n="12"/> with us."
                        Pouring out the sparkling liquid, and turning to the other gentleman, the
                        father continued: "These young men are very cunning, Doctor. See how they
                        decorate themselves in times of peace; but it is all for the young ladies.
                        It is the principle of the peacock."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, the peacock," echoed the doctor, draining his glass.</p>
                    <p>"Lad, this is Doctor Satiani, who is now a resident of our town, and who will
                        henceforth cure us of our ills."</p>
                    <p>"I am sorry that our acquaintance must be so brief," said the young man, with
                        an expression of terror in his face; "but we must&#151;there
                        is&#151;" he stammered and stopped.</p>
                    <p>"Joseph, Joseph, what is it?" cried Madeline, growing pale at his appearance
                        and manner.</p>
                    <p>The father turned toward him, and the sharp eyes of the doctor stared
                        unpleasantly.</p>
                    <p>"There is war in Paris&#151;an outbreak&#151;'revolution,' they say;
                        and we go thither in an hour. I have come to say good by."</p>
                    <p>"You are going to join the king?" demanded <pb id="VAA3890-013" n="13"/> the
                        father, with gathering indignation and astonishment, while Madeline stood in
                        bewilderment looking at the three men, each of whose faces betrayed a
                        different emotion.</p>
                    <p>"Never, we join the People against a tyrant!"</p>
                    <p>"Give me your hand, lad; I should have known you were no traitor to the cause
                        of liberty."</p>
                    <p>At these sentiments of the father the doctor's eyes flashed, and his
                        dark-featured face clouded with wrinkles.</p>
                    <p>"Do not look so, Madeline," said the young man, trying to comfort the girl;
                        but with poor success, for his own heart was heavy. "It will all be ended
                        soon." He took her arm, and led her into the garden, but she could not
                        restrain the tears that ran down her face.</p>
                    <p>"At last the People have tome to their senses," said the father to the
                        doctor. "France must be rid of this monster. It is now fifteen years since
                        Waterloo. And during this time what have we had? Nothing but misrule and
                        conspiracy! What does this mean? It means that France must down with
                        monarchy and <pb id="VAA3890-014" n="14"/> establish a republic. We shall
                        never rest until she does!"</p>
                    <p>Doctor Satiani was silent; but his countenance showed how painfully these
                        sentences lashed him. Long necessity and bitter disappointments had taught
                        him to control his words; but could not prevent his blood, which had once
                        been of the chosen few, from rising to his temples.</p>
                    <p>"What was Louis XVIII.?" continued the father. "What is Charles X. but a
                        selfish, grinding cur? Who knows what this July, 1830, will
                        bring&#151;who knows!" and in his ecstasy he arose to his full height,
                        as if to examine his strength and convince himself that he could fight again
                        for the people of his beloved France.</p>
                    <p>With each sentence Satiani crouched more and more within himself. Each
                        sentence stung him to the quick; but he was silent, like a whipped beast. At
                        length, without ceremony, he took his hat and walked to the door.</p>
                    <p>"Do you go so soon?" inquired Monsieur Le Blanc, recovering from his,
                        temper.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-015" n="15"/>
                    <p>The doctor bowed, made an unintelligible answer, and left.</p>
                    <p>Joseph and Madeline, arm in arm, were walking in the garden.</p>
                    <p>It was summer, the month of July. The winter had lingered longer than usual,
                        so that it was really only spring. The apple and pear trees had but shed
                        their blossoms, and the flowers were just beginning to peep from their
                        winter's nest. Except the gathering of the people about the <hi rend="i"
                            >Hôtel de Ville</hi>, nothing suggested the scenes that were soon to be
                        shifted in Paris. The town, like other small communities, was always quiet
                        enough in its way; even nature here seemed more languid than elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Paris was only visited by the young men, for there were, indeed, not many old
                        men left anywhere in France. They had celebrated the beginning of the
                        century for Napoleon. Only a few had come back who had followed the little
                        Corsican in his crusades through Europe. Their tales, and the silent stories
                        of those who never returned, had bred in the hearts of the women a horror
                        for even the name of Paris.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-016" n="16"/>
                    <p>What was in poor Madeline's mind? "Don't go, Joseph," she begged.</p>
                    <p>"I shall come back sooner, perhaps, than you think. See, I have brought you
                        this, Madeline, to pledge my love again," and he placed around her neck a
                        rosary of pearls bearing a golden crucifix. "May I be remembered in your
                        prayers."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, in every one; but I pray now that you don't go."</p>
                    <p>"You would not have me stay when it is my duty to go?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, yes, I would have you stay. There is always fighting in Paris. Is Paris
                        never satisfied?"</p>
                    <p>"It is not for Paris, Madeline; it is for The People&#151;for justice and
                        for liberty."</p>
                    <p>"What shall I do when you are gone! I know you will never come back." She
                        remembered the many stories she had heard from widows and from fatherless
                        playmates of her childhood. Her heart was too heavy to say more; the words
                        would not come. She buried her face on his shoulder and began to cry.</p>
                    <p>Joseph kissed her hair: they were betrothed.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-017" n="17"/>
                    <p>The roll of distant drums signaled the time for departure.</p>
                    <p>"Let me take you into the house," said he, "I must be gone."</p>
                    <p>"No, no, I am going with you to where the company congregates."</p>
                    <p>"Shall I get your hat?"</p>
                    <p>"No, of what need is a hat!"</p>
                    <p>They hurried off in the direction of the drums. Instead of retarding Joseph's
                        steps, Madeline kept steadily by his side, holding his arm with a firm grip.
                        They reached the <hi rend="i">Hôtel de Ville</hi>, where people were saying
                        good-by, and last embraces, kisses and farewells were being given, as in the
                        days of the Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. They passed friends and were
                        passed by them, but the excitement was such that nobody knew anybody else.
                        Each one had his burden of sorrow, that after scarcely a generation of
                        peace, the human carnival was again to begin, that the blood of the sons of
                        France was again to be shed in fratricidal strife. Among others they passed
                        Doctor Satiani standing on the outskirts of the crowd.</p>
                    <p>At the ranks which were now beginning to move away, Joseph took Madeline's
                            <pb id="VAA3890-018" n="18"/> hand, looked a moment into her eyes,
                        kissed her, and said, "Good-by."</p>
                    <p>"Good-by," she called, running by his side, "Good-by!" A change had come over
                        her. She had the pallor of a marble figure, and her eyes fairly glared.</p>
                    <p>"Why," inquired her friends of one another, "what does Madeline Le Blanc
                        mean, running and calling so."</p>
                    <p>"Good-by," she called again, loud enough for hundreds to hear, "Kill the King
                        for The People!" She stopped suddenly, threw her arms into the air and sank
                        to the ground, almost at the feet of Doctor Satiani, with the words "Kill
                        the King!" on her lips.</p>
                    <p>Joseph saw nothing of what had happened, but marched on to await the
                        arbitraments of war.</p>
                    <p>The crowd gathered round Madeline and raised her from the ground.</p>
                    <p>"Who is this girl?" was the inquiry.</p>
                    <p>The question was asked Doctor Satiani.</p>
                    <p>"How should I know? I have no rebels among my friends," he growled in
                        reply.</p>
                    <p>"Rebels, Rebels!" the men and boys shouted, "He calls us rebels!" and several
                            <pb id="VAA3890-019" n="19"/> seized him, while one dealt a vicious
                        stroke on his chin.</p>
                    <p>Satiani extricated himself from the grasp of his assailants; at the same
                        moment, while some women were holding the unconscious girl, a voice shouted,
                        "It is Monsieur Le Blanc's daughter," At this the crowd turned its attention
                        toward Madeline, and Doctor Satiani disappeared.</p>
                    <p>Still unconscious, she was carried home. The father had followed the company
                        of soldiers, so that there was no one at the cottage save Madeline's mother.
                        She fell to weeping bitterly, as she caressed the white, corpse-like
                        figure.</p>
                    <p>"It was as the soldiers were marching away," said Irène, a girl with eyes and
                        hair as black as a raven's wing, who had followed the sorrowful burden from
                        the <hi rend="i">Hôtel de Ville</hi>. Everything was told the mother, but
                        she would not be comforted; the father had not yet returned, and poor
                        Madeline's face, which had never very much color, lay white and smooth like
                        the face of a wax figure, amid her curly tresses that looked all the more
                        golden by the awful contrast.</p>
                    <p>Several women of the neighborhood <pb id="VAA3890-020" n="20"/> came in, and
                        the strangers disappeared. Some began to rub her wrists; others tried to
                        comfort the mother, who was almost overcome. Madeline was her only child,
                        and had been something like an angel in a house where the father was not
                        always as gentle as he might have been. The mother, who had watched and
                        cared for her all through the uncertainties of childhood, and who was soon
                        to see her married to the noble young Joseph, could not bear up under the
                        terror of the motionless sight of what had been her greatest comfort through
                        the years of her life since she herself had grown from girlhood into the
                        meridian of maternity. "Madeline, Madeline," she cried, wringing her hands,
                        "wake up, Madeline! It is I who call you!"</p>
                    <p>But Madeline did not wake up.</p>
                    <p>Amid all the confusion, Irène thought to go in search of the father. She ran
                        after the soldiers; but they had been marching for some time, and were far
                        advanced. Her determination was as strong as her well-knit figure was able
                        to hasten along." She passed out of the main thoroughfare of the town, and
                        began to ascend <pb id="VAA3890-021" n="21"/> a hill to the south. The
                        soldiers could not be seen; they had gone down the other side, yet on she
                        sped. Presently, she caught sight of the men returning who, in their
                        enthusiasm for the cause of The People, had followed the company. One of
                        these was Monsieur Le Blanc, toward whom she directed her steps.</p>

                    <head>II.</head>
                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HILE</hi> the crowd was dispersing, Doctor Satiani stole to
                        his office, which was a short distance from the <hi rend="i">Hôtel de
                            Ville</hi>. He had not been frightened at the possibility of being
                        beaten by the men who had taken offense at his words. Fear was hardly an
                        ingredient in his character. He had had too many disappointments to care
                        much what became of him; and he had been further schooled by the sight of
                        bravery and death on more than one battle-field. Though bearing an Italian
                        name, his ancestors had been French for many generations.</p>
                    <p>Born in 1780, of noble blood, the son of a viscount, he had lived through a
                        variety of scenes not to be found in the same number of years in any other
                        period of history. At the outbreak of the Revolution he was living in the
                        manner of a prince with his parents near Versailles. <pb id="VAA3890-023"
                            n="23"/> The ambition of the father's life was that the son should
                        become important in the affairs of France; but assuredly not as a
                        republican, whose hideous voices had been for some time filling the air with
                        a miasma that choked the breath of royalty. After the storming of the
                        Bastile in July, 1789, while the coils were twining around Louis XVI.,
                        Viscount Satiani and his family fled over the frontiers with the Count of
                        Artois, the young brother of the King, and the Charles X. of a later age.
                        Before young Satiani saw France again there had been a States General, a
                        Republic, a King and Queen guillotined, a Reign of Terror, pillage and
                        massacre, a Directory, and from the ashes and smoke of desolation had risen
                        the figure of Napoleon.</p>
                    <p>The father having meanwhile died in poverty, and the mother having been
                        conveyed to an alms hospital in Coblenz, where she still lay, young Satiani
                        returned to France in 1800, under an assumed name. Under Napoleon's
                        extension of amnesty to certain classes of nobles, he had detached himself
                        from the Bourbon cause and assumed his real name, hoping to regain his
                        father's possessions under <pb id="VAA3890-024" n="24"/> the new dynasty
                        that was forming. He made claims for these; but after so many years, and
                        under so many different forms of government, they had changed hands not less
                        than twenty times; and south of Versailles, on the very spot where in his
                        boyhood stood the Château de Satiani, an old peasant had this year planted a
                        field of grain. One could never have told that a château had once stood
                        there.</p>
                    <p>Stricken with poverty, desolation and misanthropy, he had wandered afoot to
                        Paris; where, by all sorts of labor, from the most menial to the occupation
                        of copyist, he was able to keep from starvation. In 1806 he was forced into
                        the army and fought at Jena and at Auerstadt. In the latter battle he was
                        wounded in the right breast, and by a saber cut on the hip. He was taken
                        from the field, and finally, when nearer dead than alive, removed to a
                        hospital at Tours; whence they took him to Paris. After about eight months
                        he was able to move about again, and assisted in taking care of the other
                        patients; but the right lung was gone. Unfit to go back into the army, it
                        was in this way that he began the study of medicine. <pb id="VAA3890-025"
                            n="25"/> By the year 1811 he had fairly recovered; and by his
                        application to study was entitled to practise anywhere in France. In 1814,
                        at the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty, his last hope of regaining any of
                        his father's former possessions was shattered. For the next sixteen years he
                        wandered from place to place, practising his profession.</p>
                    <p>He never stayed long anywhere; and wherever he had been, there always
                        remained after his departure a sort of mysterious haze. No one knew him
                        well; yet in the small communities where he had remained for any length of
                        time, everybody knew him by sight, and respected his mysterious austerity.
                        He was now, in the year 1830, fifty years of age. In appearance, he was of
                        rough and wrinkled countenance, wore a copious gray mustache and a sharp
                        chin-beard. His small eyes&#151;one of which was blue and the other
                        black&#151;were set deep in his head, environed by coarse eyebrows and
                        fleshy creases at the base of the lids. Though years had wrenched his form
                        and features, so long as he kept his ugly eyes out of one's face, there was
                        something stately in his appearance. Whether it <pb id="VAA3890-026" n="26"
                        /> was hidden power that still abode with him, or whether it was only the
                        majestic ruins of what once had been, one could not tell by looking at him.
                        Every feature showed his consciousness of noble lineage; and the disgust he
                        manifested at anything democratic was equally innate with him; for to his
                        mind it had been just such popular fanaticism that had made France bleed and
                        Europe restless for a quarter of a century, and had dispossessed him of his
                        rightful inheritance.</p>
                    <p>He now sat in his office (three o'clock in the afternoon) writing chemical
                        formulæ on a sheet of paper that lay before him. Now and then he would go to
                        the bookshelves, finger a volume for a few moments, and then return to the
                        formulæ. Still somewhat agitated with indignation at what had happened a few
                        hours before, at the departure of the town company of soldiers, he was
                        trying to dissipate the feeling by applying himself to his science, which in
                        the years gone by had pleasantly absorbed many of his hours that might
                        otherwise have been wretched. Not infrequently, when thus at work, he would
                            <pb id="VAA3890-027" n="27"/> talk to himself. "C H C 1<hi rend="sub"
                            >3</hi> &#151;&#151;," he was just saying, "that will do it,"
                        when there came a knocking at the door.</p>
                    <p>"Come in."</p>
                    <p>Irène entered, her hair down her back, flushed and out of breath from
                        running. "Is this&#151;is this the doctor?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, Mademoiselle."</p>
                    <p>"Would you be kind enough to come at once to Monsieur Le Blanc's house?"</p>
                    <p>The pleasure he had had at seeing the pretty Irène disappeared at the name
                        "Le Blanc." "Rebels," he muttered to himself. "Who is sick?"</p>
                    <p>"Mademoiselle."</p>
                    <p>"Very sick?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, yes, indeed, she fainted at the <hi rend="i">Hôtel de Ville</hi>, as
                        the soldiers were marching away."</p>
                    <p>"These and their like," he said beneath his breath, "have bereft me of
                        everything, and yet I am to go among them like a ministering angel." Then
                        aloud, "Was it she who said, 'Kill the King'?" There was bitterness in his
                        voice.</p>
                    <p>"I do not know, monsieur&#151;doctor. She was calling aloud; but I do not
                        know what she said."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-028" n="28"/>
                    <p>He seated himself again at the chemical formulæ, indifferent to the anxiety
                        of the girl that stood before him.</p>
                    <p>"Will you be kind enough to come at once?" pleaded Irène. "Mademoiselle is
                        unconscious."</p>
                    <p>At the word "unconscious" Doctor Satiani seemed to awaken from his
                        indifference.</p>
                    <p>"Mademoiselle may die if you do not come."</p>
                    <p>After a pause, he said, without enthusiasm, "Go and say that I am
                        coming."</p>
                    <p>Irène flitted out; and the doctor, after gathering together the sheets of
                        paper he had been studying, also left.</p>
                    <p>The cottage where Madeline lived was a modest wooden structure, a story and a
                        half high, three rooms long, with a side. room to the left. It was set back
                        in a spacious garden that was generously shaded by massive oak trees, and
                        screened here and there by nooks of shrubbery and sweet-scented flowers,
                        about which curled a well-kept walk. Here she had played and read every
                        summer of her life.</p>
                    <p>The anxiety on the interior of the house was in great contrast to the calm of
                        the <pb id="VAA3890-029" n="29"/> garden. The stricken girl lay on a couch
                        in the center of the middle room. The mother had retired up-stairs, where
                        she was being attended by some neighbors. The father and the others had
                        tried everything they knew to restore Madeline, but all in vain. She lay
                        like dead; and but for a feeble pulsation of the heart, gave no sign of
                        life.</p>
                    <p>"Here comes the doctor," some one said, looking out the window.</p>
                    <p>"Thank God," whispered the father, sitting beside the couch, holding her
                        hand, and saying tender things that he had forgotten to say when she could
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>Poor Madeline!</p>
                    <p>"Well!" said Satiani under his breath, as he entered the house and saw the
                        consternation.</p>
                    <p>The father arose and gave him his hand. "What can you do for her, doctor? It
                        must be done at once&#151;or can this sort of thing continue long?"</p>
                    <p>The doctor made no reply but proceeded to examine the girl. There was that
                        silence that there is in a court of justice when the judge is about to
                        render a <pb id="VAA3890-030" n="30"/> verdict of life or death. Some of the
                        women who had seen Madeline every day of her life, and who had something of
                        the feeling of a mother for her, began to weep at the sight of this living
                        death; and when the doctor turned away from the couch, they looked
                        beseechingly at him, as if he were to decide according to his pleasure
                        whether or not Madeline should be restored.</p>
                    <p>"I shall do what I can," said Satiani, answering their looks.</p>
                    <p>"What is it?" asked the father.</p>
                    <p>"If there is anything beyond suspension of consciousness, it cannot yet be
                        told. Allow her to lie undisturbed where she is." And with these words, he
                        began to rub her forehead and wrists with a fluid that he took from his
                        medicine case. But few minutes elapsed when Doctor Satiani took his hat and
                        bade the father good evening, saying, as he went, "Send for me to-morrow if
                        she does not awaken."</p>

                    <head>III.</head>
                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> the northern limit of the town, some distance from the
                            <hi rend="i">Hôtel de Ville</hi>, where the soldiers had congregated,
                        there stood a rough story-and-a-half stone house, built probably about the
                        middle of the last century. It was the last house on the street, and looked
                        westward, toward the town cemetery across the way. Three windows on the
                        north side faced a valley that descended somewhat abruptly, forming at the
                        lower extremity a channel through which a rapid creek wound its way. So far
                        as anybody knew the house was empty, as it had been within the memory of the
                        oldest citizen. If it was regarded by anybody, it was as an old and useless
                        landmark designating the northern limit of the town, and one which should
                        have been destroyed and removed but for the fact that nobody wanted the
                        piece of ground, much less the heap of stone. If it had an owner, no one <pb
                            id="VAA3890-032" n="32"/> knew who he was; but it was generally believed
                        that the old house was a worthless something which had been left either for
                        posterity or time to demolish. It was a dark, low, squatty structure that
                        looked at the cemetery across the way through three small front windows, one
                        above and two below, shaded by large eaves that time had curled and twisted
                        out of shape. The doors were low, broad, and looked dark and heavy like
                        iron. To the front and sides of the house clung coarse vines bearing
                        scrofulous looking leaves that gave it an even more sinister appearance.
                        What little wood there was had been gnawed and rotted by rain and sunshine;
                        and the roof which once had been steep and proud lay bent and leaning. The
                        shutters opened and closed as it pleased the wind; and the silence of the
                        isolation was never broken save by the flutter of birds and the whining of
                        an occasional stray dog that sheltered there.</p>
                    <p>The section of the town in which this house was situated had fallen into
                        degeneration, and was only frequented by occasional funeral processions and
                        mourners who visited the graves of the departed. <pb id="VAA3890-033" n="33"
                        /> The cemetery was hardly more desolate than the dark and gloomy old house.
                        Thus it had lived on, almost unknown, and entirely unmolested, through the
                        many little revolutions in the town, and the greatest revolutions in the
                        history of man, from Louis XV. to Charles X. Now it was the year 1830.</p>
                    <p>At nightfall on this day, Doctor Satiani wandered in this direction; and when
                        it was dark, he entered the court and rapped lightly at the side door. It
                        was presently opened by a small, slender figure, but no light appeared, and
                        he entered. The door was quietly closed and locked after him.</p>
                    <p>"Monsieur," said the small, dark figure, "will you descend at once?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Will you have a light?"</p>
                    <p>"No." Feeling his way, he walked toward the wall between the room he had
                        entered and a smaller room behind. Here he opened a door at right angles
                        with the partition, and descended into the cellar.</p>
                    <p>Before long, some rays of light mingled with muttering, inarticulate talk and
                        odious chemical fumes ascended from below through the cracks in the old
                        floor.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-034" n="34"/>
                    <p>Presently the small figure, who had gone out at the back door of the room,
                        re-entered; and after listening for a moment with his ear to the floor, he
                        walked to the cellar door, opened it, and said, "Monsieur."</p>
                    <p>There was no answer.</p>
                    <p>"Monsieur."</p>
                    <p>"What is it?" came from below.</p>
                    <p>"Did you call?"</p>
                    <p>"No. You must be quiet."</p>
                    <p>The small figure closed the cellar door, busied himself for a time about the
                        room in the dark, and disappeared again through the rear door.</p>
                    <p>There was no change for several hours: the dim light, the chemical fumes, and
                        the mysterious muttering talk continued; the small dark person did not enter
                        again, but lay asleep on a couch in the back room; and from without, in the
                        shadow of the starless night, the old stone house looked as dark, gloomy and
                        lifeless as ever.</p>
                    <p>At about two o'clock the dwarfish person rolled on his bed, rubbed his eyes
                        and sat up, for he thought that something had awakened him. He listened, but
                            <pb id="VAA3890-035" n="35"/> could hear nothing except his own
                        breathing. "It must have been a bad dream," he said to himself, and lay down
                        again, when there came to his ear unmistaken sounds that filled him with
                        terror, that froze his thin blood, and made him shake like one facing
                        impending death. The noises were not loud, but continuous&#151;a
                        mingling of heavy steps, heaving moans, and hideous giggles.</p>
                    <p>"We are caught," he thought, springing to his feet and going to the window to
                        look out. But the night was calm and the sound came not from without. He
                        hurried to the room above the cellar. At every step he came nearer the
                        horrible sounds that became louder with every succeeding gasp. Some one was
                        choking; one by one, heavy steps came thumping up the stairs; and now and
                        then, piercing the other noises, came a shrill laugh. A heavy figure fell
                        upon the floor, knocking him against the wall; and from the throat of the
                        fallen came the words, in a strange voice, "I have found it," then all was
                        silent.</p>
                    <p>"Monsieur!" cried the dwarf, going half-way down the cellar.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-036" n="36"/>
                    <p>He almost leaped down the remaining steps, and amid suffocating odors,
                        lighted a candle. But no one was there. The smells rendered him almost
                        unconscious, as he made his way up the stairs. Flashing the candle into the
                        face of the figure on the floor, he saw the pale distorted features of an
                        unknown person&#151;but resembling Doctor Satiani.</p>
                    <p>There was at that moment a noise in the front part of the house. The
                        bewildered dwarf went stealthily in that direction, when he distinctly heard
                        keys rattling in the front door. He ran noiselessly into the half-story
                        overhead; and looking out the window, in the darkness of the night, saw a
                        man bending over the lock.</p>
                    <p>The only night officer in the town had by accident wandered in this
                        direction; and when before the stone house, about to turn back, he had been
                        attracted by the strange noises. He was trying to enter the front door; but
                        finding that impossible, he walked around the house and tried the side
                        entrance. He succeeded in prying it open, and as he stepped noiselessly into
                        the room, fell over the body on the floor. Lowering his lantern, he beheld
                        the same <pb id="VAA3890-037" n="37"/> pale and distorted visage that the
                        dwarf (now hiding in the half-story above) had seen a few moments before.
                        "Foul play," he said to himself; and thinking the man dead, he made a hasty
                        search of the lower floor. He stopped at the stairs and encountered by the
                        opinion that he would do better not to waste time, but go at once to notify
                        the other officers, who might remove the body and then assist in making a
                        systematic search for the perpetrator of the crime. He went half-way up the
                        stairs, and feeling some fear creep over him, easily convinced himself that
                        he had better notify the other officers without further delay.</p>
                    <p>In less than an hour four of them were within the court of the stone house.
                        But when they opened the side door, the body was not there, nor anywhere to
                        be found.</p>

                    <p>P<hi rend="sc">OOR</hi> Madeline hadn't changed by the next morning. She lay
                        as motionless as when first brought into the house. If there were any
                        change, it was that she was beginning to look like one who had been dead for
                        some time: heavy shadows lay under her eyes, her cheeks and temples began to
                        sink, and there was but feeble respiration. Irène had stayed up all night,
                        and with the mother had watched and prayed. The good father confessor had
                        been sent for, in the hope that, if Madeline were not to get well, she would
                        at least not depart without the ministration of extreme unction. One hour of
                        the night after the other had drawn along; but she did not awake. At
                        daybreak the mother, again overcome by bereavement and fatigue, was put to
                        bed.</p>
                    <p>"Monsieur," said Irène to the father, who sat with his forehead resting on
                            <pb id="VAA3890-039" n="39"/> Madeline's couch, "I am going for the
                        doctor. It is daybreak, and we must wait no longer."</p>
                    <p>"Very well," replied the father.</p>
                    <p>"Poor Madeline!" murmured the faithful Irène, as she kissed her silent
                        companion's face, upon which a tear dropped from her own&#151;" Poor
                        Madeline!" Irène was one of those abiding creatures who are only to be
                        found, perhaps, in her own sex, to whom vicissitude is a power that
                        strengthens devotion and love. She would have given her life for Madeline.
                        There was no red in her cheeks now as she hastened through the deserted
                        streets toward the doctor's office; the watching of the night had paled her
                        face, but had not weakened her spirit.</p>
                    <p>She soon arrived at the office, and knocked; but there came no answer. She
                        tried the door, but it was locked. Unwilling to return without that which
                        she hoped would bring help, she looked through the keyhole, hoping to find
                        the doctor, who had been somewhat sullen on her first visit, and she thought
                        might perhaps be so again. Her eyes were met by sharp eyes gleaming at her
                        from within.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-040" n="40"/>
                    <p>"Open, open," she cried in a determined voice, twisting the doorknob.</p>
                    <p>The door sprang ajar, and she was confronted by a dwarfish person of gaunt
                        and nervous countenance.</p>
                    <p>"Where is the doctor?" she asked, shrinking from the ugly sight.</p>
                    <p>"I do not know," replied the small man, trembling from head to foot, and
                        stepping back, as if in fear.</p>
                    <p>"When will he be here?"</p>
                    <p>"I do not know. Come back in an hour," he said, walking toward the open door,
                        and looking at her, as much as to plead, "Go, go at once!"</p>
                    <p>Irène stood still for a moment, then taking a chair before the table on which
                        the chemical formulæ had lain, she said, "I shall wait till he comes."</p>
                    <p>The anxiety of the dwarf grew intolerable to behold. He did not close the
                        door, and walked nervously from one side of the room to the other, pausing
                        now and then to listen or look out the window or door. His face was smooth,
                        and so thin that the cheek-bones, chin and eye-sockets protruded like the
                        knuckle on a skinny hand. When he spoke, and at <pb id="VAA3890-041" n="41"
                        /> times when silent, his chin fell, as if it were no natural part of his
                        face, but something artificially fastened on; and his voice was weak and
                        rasping. He looked like one who all his life had been imprisoned in the
                        dark, and now being turned loose in the light, did not know what to do with
                        his freedom and seemed pained by the brightness.</p>
                    <p>"Where can I find Doctor Satiani?" asked Irène.</p>
                    <p>"I do not know, I do not know."</p>
                    <p>"Are you one of his patients?" inquired the girl, beginning to sympathize
                        with the object that her innocence prevented her from greatly fearing.</p>
                    <p>He cast a glance at her, his eyes growing red and moist, and for a moment he
                        stopped pacing the floor and stood as if in reverie. He did not make any
                        verbal reply, and what his expression said was too mysterious to be
                        understood.</p>
                    <p>"I shall go to Doctor Satiani's <hi rend="i">pension</hi>, perhaps he is
                        there," said Irène, arising.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, perhaps,"</p>
                    <p>"I shall return shortly; and if he comes, tell him to wait."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-042" n="42"/>
                    <p>"Yes, I will tell him to wait," mechanically echoed the dwarf.</p>
                    <p>Irène went to a public <hi rend="i">pension</hi> where she had once seen
                        Doctor Satiani. Though he boarded there, he had not been seen that
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>"It is yet early," observed the Madame of whom inquiry was made. "Come in and
                        wait, likely he will be here soon."</p>
                    <p>Irène entered the house and waited until all the boarders had come and gone;
                        but Doctor Satiani was not among them. Although it still looked early on
                        account of a storm that was beginning to gather in the clouds, darkening the
                        morning light, Irène felt that it was growing late, and that something had
                        to be done at once.</p>
                    <p>"He has never yet missed a meal," said the Madame.</p>
                    <p>"I can wait no longer," and arising, she left instructions as to where the
                        doctor should be sent if he came for his breakfast. She was undecided
                        whether to return to the office or to the house where poor Madeline lay.
                        "What good to go back without help," she said to herself, and turned in the
                        direction of the <pb id="VAA3890-043" n="43"/> office, hoping with every
                        step that the doctor had come by this time, for it was no longer early.</p>
                    <p>The door of the office was open, but no one was within; the dwarfish person
                        had disappeared. What was to be done? Nothing but wait. So she seated
                        herself at the table and waited. After the lapse of about twenty minutes,
                        Doctor Satiani entered. He was pale, had a fresh red scar on his left cheek,
                        and looked fully ten years older.</p>
                    <p>"O doctor, come to Monsieur Le Blanc's at once! Madeline is no better. Will
                        you come now? Be so good. All night she lay without moving a muscle."</p>
                    <p>The doctor, who had removed his hat, took it from the table', and placing
                        several vials in his pocket, said, "Come, I will go with you this
                        minute."</p>
                    <p>As they left the office it grew darker. For the time of year, the early
                        morning had been close and sultry; and from the preparation the clouds,
                        winds and thunder were making, it was evident there would soon be a storm.
                        Irène walked a few steps ahead of the doctor, and turned now and then to see
                        if he were catching up, that <pb id="VAA3890-044" n="44"/> she might walk
                        more rapidly, so anxious was she to bring aid. By the time they came in
                        sight of the house, it had grown almost dark as night, and began to
                        rain.</p>
                    <p>"At last," exclaimed the father to the doctor, as they entered the house. "We
                        had given you up. She is no better."</p>
                    <p>Satiani was taciturn, avoided the father, and walked directly to the couch.
                        At length, after some examination, he turned to Monsieur Le Blanc, the few
                        neighbors who were there, and Madeline's father confessor, and said, "I must
                        be alone with her."</p>
                    <p>"What did you say?" asked the father. He had not understood, for the clatter
                        of the falling rain and the rolling thunder were deafening.</p>
                    <p>"I must be alone with her," he repeated. "When I call, I will tell you what
                        can be done."</p>
                    <p>One after another they left the room.</p>
                    <p>"Oh! make Madeline well," pleaded Irène, taking hold of the doctor's arm.</p>
                    <p>"It is with you, my friend Satiani," said Monsieur Le Blanc.</p>
                    <p>The good father confessor, who was <pb id="VAA3890-045" n="45"/> very old,
                        knelt beside the couch and prayed while the last person passed out.
                        Presently he arose, and departed. . It was as dark as night in the room. The
                        wind hurled the rain against the house and rustled the foliage of the hoary
                        trees in the garden; and at short intervals the thunder rolled and crashed.
                        "She is mine; she will die, but she will come to me," muttered Satiani to
                        himself, as his lips curled in an ugly smile. There was the expression of a
                        felon in his face; and his small, dissimilar eyes emitted the glare of a
                        beast. His shoulders bent, his neck protruded, and every step was taken with
                        an elasticity that deadened sound and caused no motion in the room. He
                        locked the doors, drew the curtains and lighted a candle at Madeline's head.
                        As he leaned over her, rubbing her gums with the contents of a phial he had
                        taken from his pocket, the speck of candle-light shone on a decrepit soul
                        that had come to the surface of his face. He chuckled to himself as a miser
                        when recounting his gold, showing yellow tushes instead of teeth, and a
                        forehead arched with sinister wrinkles. His blue and black eyes blinked
                        glassily <pb id="VAA3890-046" n="46"/> in the light, and in respiration his
                        mouth opened and closed. A monstrous uncanny shadow arose and fell on the
                        wall as he writhed at his unholy task. After a moment, while still rubbing
                        the gums of the death-like figure, there came a crash of thunder over the
                        house that nearly threw him from his feet; and like a beaten dog he skulked
                        into the dark of the room, while the candle shed its glimmer over bewildered
                        tresses amid which lay the waxen face of Madeline. Satiani, trembling in the
                        corner, fastened his ugly eyes upon the white figure. Every stroke of
                        lightning that sent its flash upon the darkened windows and every rumble of
                        thunder, struck him to the quick. He had no fear of man; but before God he
                        was a coward. It was the struggle for a soul. The white visage beneath the
                        candle he watched with the eyes of an eagle. It moved.</p>
                    <p>"I am not beaten&#151;" he muttered, as another crash of thunder choked
                        the sentence in his throat.</p>
                    <p>The lower lip began to quiver, and the knees to tremble. The
                        arms&#151;the head&#151;the body began to straighten. There was <pb
                            id="VAA3890-047" n="47"/> life! She tried to speak. Then all relapsed
                        into rest again.</p>
                    <p>"Madeline," said Satiani, leaning over her face, "Madeline."</p>
                    <p>"Joseph," she whispered, "Joseph."</p>
                    <p>"Joseph is not here."</p>
                    <p>"Where is he?"</p>
                    <p>"I do not know."</p>
                    <p>"Where am I?"</p>
                    <p>"In Paris."</p>
                    <p>The eyelids moved as if to open, and Satiani quickly laid pieces of coin upon
                        them.</p>
                    <p>"Madeline, listen," and he grasped both her hands, which he held firmly on
                        each side.</p>
                    <p>"What is this noise? I hear cannon."</p>
                    <p>"It is thunder. Listen, Madeline."</p>
                    <p>"I listen. I feel so weak."</p>
                    <p>"You must die."</p>
                    <p>"Let me live! Let me live!"</p>
                    <p>"On one consideration. Do you understand?" A pause. "Madeline."</p>
                    <p>"I cannot see."</p>
                    <p>"No, you are blind."</p>
                    <p>"Who speaks to me?"</p>
                    <p>"It does not matter. Do you understand that you are dying?"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-048" n="48"/>
                    <p>"O let me live!"</p>
                    <p>"It is in my power."</p>
                    <p>"Let me live."</p>
                    <p>"On one condition, that you give me your body; or if you refuse, you shall be
                        buried forever to-morrow, and molder in the ground as do the dead, worms
                        shall gnaw your cheeks &#151;here&#151;and your mouth shall be a
                        grinning doorway to the palace of living, creeping vermin."</p>
                    <p>"O God!"</p>
                    <p>"There is no God. Do you agree?"</p>
                    <p>"O let me live!"</p>
                    <p>"It is done," and Satiani poured the contents of a phial between her lips,
                        and at the same instant pressed a sponge over her face.</p>
                    <p>There was knocking, on the doors at which the father, priest and others had
                        gone out.</p>
                    <p>Stealthily Satiani unlocked them, and, falling on his knees by the couch,
                        cried, "O God, take this soul unto Thyself!" loud enough to be heard by the
                        impatient ears without the room. One sentence after another of this mockery
                        of prayer came from his diabolical throat; and in less than ten seconds,
                        amid the roaring of <pb id="VAA3890-049" n="49"/> thunder, the flashing of
                        lightning, the hissing rain, and the knocking at the door, there lay before
                        him what seemed to be a corpse, white, still, silent, with purple lips. All
                        the while, kneeling beside the couch, louder and louder did he pray. The
                        doors broke open; the father, priest, and others entered.</p>
                    <p>"O Madeline! "cried the father.</p>
                    <p>"She is dying," said Satiani.</p>
                    <p>The women began to cry and the priest to pray. The father ran to the wife,
                        who was lying in an up-stairs room; and Irène helped Satiani from his knees
                        and led him to a seat, where he lay seemingly exhausted. Another candle was
                        placed beside Madeline's head, and before long there was no other sound in
                        the darkened room save the prayer of her good father confessor and the
                        echoes of thunder from the vanishing storm.</p>

                    <p>The poor mother relapsed into silence. She had wept until there were no more
                        tears; and now resigned herself to what she considered the will of God. Her
                        face was that of Madeline's, but thinner, and furrowed with the cares of
                        time; and her hair, that had been once of the same golden color, was now
                        fading into a silvery gray.</p>
                    <p>"Where is Monsieur?"</p>
                    <p>"He has gone to make arrangements for the funeral," answered the heroic
                        Irène, who bore sorrow like a man. "Is there anything Madame wants?" she
                        continued, kneeling beside her.</p>
                    <p>"No, nothing," answered the mother, as she raised her hands to the head of
                        the faithful girl and pressed it against her breast.</p>
                    <p>It did not take long for the news of the death to spread over the town. A
                        good many people knew Madeline, either familiarly or at least by sight, for
                        from her earliest childhood she had gone out much with her father, holding
                        his hand when she was small, as they walked along; and when she grew older
                        she took his arm. Then Joseph succeeded the father in her affections; and by
                        the time it was known that <pb id="VAA3890-052" n="52"/> they were
                        betrothed, Madeline's beauty, simplicity and goodness had made her admired
                        by many. "Poor Madeline," everybody said, instinctively.</p>
                    <p>A number of persons was now in the front room of the house, where she lay in
                        her shroud of spotless white. The mother and father of Joseph had come; and
                        with their deep sympathy they tried to comfort those in bereavement. They
                        hardly dared to think what the news would mean to their son, who had long
                        ago confided his love to them.</p>
                    <p>"I am going to find Monsieur, and give him the letter," said Irène.</p>
                    <p>Just then Monsieur Le Blanc came, and the letter was read to him.</p>
                    <p>"The arrangements are already made. We shall bury our child this afternoon,"
                        he said. "We shall take her to the chapel at four o'clock."</p>
                    <p>"I wish Joseph could have seen her once more," said the mother of the young
                        soldier.</p>
                    <p>"It is impossible. Who knows where he is!" responded Monsieur Le Blanc.</p>
                    <p>"How are we to let him know?" asked the lad's father. "For such a journey,
                            <pb id="VAA3890-053" n="53"/> at such a time, I am too old; and it would
                        be no easy task to find him; Paris is no village."</p>
                    <p>"But it is only right that we should let our poor son know. It would kill him
                        to think that she had been dead a long time before he knew it, for I know he
                        thinks of her every hour," said the mother, bursting into tears.</p>
                    <p>"Don't weep; we will follow very soon," observed the father of the dead girl,
                        his heart softening in this great affliction. "We will send some one to tell
                        Joseph; but whom I do not know."</p>
                    <p>The mother sitting in the armchair mentioned several names. But there was
                        some objection to ask or expect any one of them to go. The young men were
                        already all in Paris; and there was an outbreak&#151;nay, a revolution,
                        expected any hour.</p>
                    <p>"Send me!" said Irène, suddenly stepping among them, her face aglow as she
                        met the eyes of Joseph's and Madeline's parents.</p>
                    <p>"<hi rend="i">You</hi>?" said the men, simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>"O Irène, you would be killed!" observed Joseph's mother.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-054" n="54"/>
                    <p>"Irène has a great spirit," whispered the other mother. "Come here, my girl,"
                        and she put her arms about her and caressed her as she was wont to do her
                        own child, now so still and cold. "No, we cannot let you go."</p>
                    <p>Irène was ready for any task. She was one of those creatures whom want had
                        taught appreciation; and was, therefore, willing at any time to undertake
                        anything that her friends wished to be done. Her father had fallen at
                        Waterloo, and her mother had died of a broken heart. Irène had been the only
                        offspring of an alliance that had been so sweet to the young mother that its
                        termination was too much for her, and before long she too had gone into the
                        eternal land, leaving this single child, who found her means of subsistence
                        in whatever haphazard way destiny saw fit. Now that she was grown, she was
                        willing to do anything for those who had been kind to her.</p>
                    <p>The parents came to no conclusion as to who should be asked to carry the
                        unhappy news to Paris. It would have been useless to send a letter, for a
                        soldier has not a permanent address, much less a rebel soldier.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-055" n="55"/>
                    <p>At four o'clock the body was followed to the chapel by a goodly number of
                        friends; among them, with bent head and saddened countenance, walked Doctor
                        Satiani. At the chapel, a few psalms, the <hi rend="i">Libera</hi>, and <hi
                            rend="i">De Profundis</hi> were chanted; for some time the holy fathers
                        continued to administer the last services to the departed soul; and for the
                        last time the friends viewed the body. From the folds of the white shroud
                        protruded the wax-like hands, folded upon the golden cross of a pearl
                        rosary.</p>
                    <p>By five o'clock the funeral line marched northward toward the cemetery. It
                        was a sad procession. It is not so melancholy a thing to follow the remains
                        of an aged person to the tomb, for however dear the departed may be, he had
                        mounted a good score of years&#151;he had fulfilled his task&#151;he
                        had lived. But to follow the bier of youth&#151;hopeful, bright,
                        ambitious youth, that was yet to flower and diffuse its fragrance; that had
                        not yet had life and experience, but was just looking out toward them with
                        the wistful eyes of innocent desire&#151;to follow such to their last
                        abode is indeed a solemn thing. "O mockery," <pb id="VAA3890-056" n="56"/>
                        one feels like crying, "what possibilities lie buried in the tombs of
                        youth!"</p>
                    <p>The first shadows of the coming night mingled with the brightness of the day,
                        as the procession came in view of the cemetery. It was a desolate, old and
                        endless place, dotted with a few bright and many darkened monuments. The
                        ancient gate through which the procession passed had long ago lost its
                        doors. The straw of withered weeds lay profusely about, and with the coarse
                        grass hid many of the only surviving testimonials of the dead and forgotten.
                        Nature here seemed ruder than elsewhere, spreading oblivion and
                        forgetfulness alike over the humblest headstones and the proudest
                        monument.</p>
                    <p>Irène had not been in the chapel, nor was she now in the cemetery; but in the
                        mother's sorrow she was not missed; and who else would think of her?</p>
                    <p>The friends gathered round a newly made grave, almost in the northwest
                        corner, between a rude fence, which divided the cemetery from the valley,
                        and a thick, brown, old monument, from which time had effaced every
                        inscription save a date early in the last century. The <pb id="VAA3890-057"
                            n="57"/> mother, sustained by the father, stood near, the grave; behind
                        them a few relatives; and all around a circle of solemn faces, as the aged
                        priest offered the last prayer, and Madeline was lowered into the earth.</p>
                    <p>The sun stood low in the western horizon, the verdure of the valley was
                        tinged with the gloaming of eventide, and the flocks and herds wandered
                        homeward, as one by one the shovelfuls of earth enclosed again in their
                        thraldom a cold and silent form of clay. Homeward moved the mourners, and
                        before long the earth was shrouded in the mystery of night. Madeline Le
                        Blanc was no more.</p>
                    <p>On a table in the cottage beside the garden lay this note, awaiting the
                        mother and father's return:&#151; <text>

                    <p>N<hi rend="sc">O</hi> sooner had the night come to its full darkness than
                        some one rapped lightly at the side door of the old stone house. For a long
                        time there was silence, then the rapping continued. Presently, the door was
                        opened by the same dwarfish creature.</p>
                    <p>"Why do you keep me waiting? Notwithstanding this is my house, our presence
                        here must be kept a secret. You keep me waiting, and everything will become
                        public&#151;what I am doing&#151;that this is my
                        house&#151;everything! Then I will have to explain what happened last
                        night."</p>
                    <p>"Oh! it is Monsieur," shrieked the creature, in a loud whisper.</p>
                    <p>"'Of course, who else? Did not I give the proper raps? or are you losing your
                        hearing? or can it be that you are unfaithful to me, and expect some one
                        else?"</p>
                    <p>"No, no, I did not expect to see Monsieur alive again."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-059" n="59"/>
                    <p>"You are losing your reason, creature."</p>
                    <p>"Who was it that came out of the cellar last night and dropped here where you
                        are now standing?" asked the dwarf.</p>
                    <p>"It was I."</p>
                    <p>"No, it was too pale and ugly a face; no, it was somebody else's visage whom
                        I never saw before," said the creature, trembling in the dark.</p>
                    <p>"It was I! and it was fortunate for me that I came to myself in time to avoid
                        the police, whom I saw come and inspect the house. You unfaithful dog, why
                        did you leave me?" hissed Satiani into the face of the dwarf.</p>
                    <p>"No, no; call me not that; I am not unfaithful. The noise you made coming out
                        of the cellar attracted a passer-by's attention; and I was too weak to carry
                        you away, Monsieur. I hid when the police entered, and when I left, I ran to
                        your office for safety, and waited until day. The face and body did not look
                        like you at all."</p>
                    <p>"I have at last made the discovery," said Satiani, feeling his way to the
                        door of the cellar.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-060" n="60"/>
                    <p>"The smell nearly choked me when I went below. What was it?"</p>
                    <p>"A fume that will produce a catalepsy like death," answered the doctor,
                        cautiously opening the door. "I tried it on myself last night. So strong was
                        the fume that I felt myself going down into a deadly sleep before I could do
                        more than ascend the stairs. My tongue cleaved stiffly to the roof of my
                        mouth, I felt my jaws lock, and consciousness dwindled to nothing save a
                        sense of terror that I had gone a step too far with myself, and a kind of
                        joy that I had at last found that for which I had searched so long. You
                        should have dragged me to the air; it was air that I was gasping for. You
                        say my face was distorted? "</p>
                    <p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>
                    <p>"Do not move from this door, and be ready to answer my call," said Satiani,
                        descending into the cellar. "It remains now to be seen whether or not I can
                        restore life from the effect of my discovery, or whether death must follow."
                        The door closed cautiously behind him, and there was absolute silence.</p>
                    <p>The light shone again through the <pb id="VAA3890-061" n="61"/> cracks in the
                        floor; and soon the chemical fumes and muttering talk began. The dwarfish
                        person lay down before the entrance to the cellar, and slept, as the hours
                        of the first half of the night wore on.</p>
                    <p>The cellar into which Doctor Satiani had descended and now sat, was a perfect
                        square of about thirteen feet, walled with unhewn stone, and pierced by
                        three openings. On two opposite sides, extending about three feet from the
                        floor, were shelves supporting bottles, jars and pots. Along the full length
                        of another side stood a table confusedly laden with papers, small packages,
                        and the candle that sent its rays through the floor of the upper room.
                        Against the remaining wall stood a clean white couch, folded up. From the
                        massive rafters of the ceiling hung dried vegetable growths, roots, herbs
                        and barks; and in the center descended an ancient iron candle rack. About
                        the middle of the floor lay two heavy rings fastened by iron bands welded
                        into the stone. Of the three narrow arches in the walls, the one beside the
                        bottles and pots led to the stairs which <pb id="VAA3890-062" n="62"/>
                        Satiani had descended; the other two, in the walls corresponding to the
                        front and back of the house, led into narrow passages that ended in arched
                        stone chambers exactly alike. An iron door closed a passage that led from
                        each of these&#151;but whither Satiani did not know. He had not had time
                        to explore. Once he had opened one of these, and found that indeed it led
                        somewhere; but it was too dark to see.</p>
                    <p>As it now approached the hour of eleven, he sat crouched before the table,
                        babbling to himself and watching the steaming and bubbling in an iron pot
                        that was perched on a tripod above the blue flame of a spirit lamp.
                        Presently he arose, walked to the stairs, and made a hissing noise.</p>
                    <p>"Yes," answered the dwarf, who was on his feet in an instant.</p>
                    <p>"Go round the house and see if all is clear." Satiani returned to the table,
                        extinguished the flame of the spirit lamp, and poured the contents of the
                        iron pot into a broad vessel. He was nervous and looked frequently at his
                        watch.</p>
                    <p>In a short time the dwarf returned, and <pb id="VAA3890-063" n="63"/> said:
                        "I have walked around the house. It is so dark that I could not see my hand
                        before my face. I listened every few minutes, and found everything
                        quiet."</p>
                    <p>"Very well," answered Satiani. "Now bring the shovel to the head of the
                        stairs." He looked at his watch once more, walked to the other side of the
                        cellar, placed the couch in the center of the floor, blew out the candle,
                        and ascended the stairs.</p>
                    <p>"Monsieur," said the dwarf, "where are you? I have the shovel."</p>
                    <p>"Here at the outer door," answered Satiani; and taking the shovel, he added,
                        abusively. "Obey me implicitly&#151;do you understand?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, Monsieur; do I not always try to ob&#151;"</p>
                    <p>"Never mind about what you always try to do. Keep your wits now, and don't be
                        a coward. I hate a coward. If you hear a shot, or a cry, somebody has
                        intercepted me, and has fallen. If you hear nothing, I shall be here in
                        thirty minutes with a body. Lie in the front of the court; and when I come,
                        go ahead and open this door. We shall enter here. If anybody approaches the
                        house, you will throw a <pb id="VAA3890-064" n="64"/> stone toward the thick
                        brown monument. You know the direction. In case anything happens to me, you
                        know my voice, and will come at once, for you do not want to live longer
                        than I&#151;do you, midget? Come."</p>
                    <p>They passed the door and stood in the outer night, which was even' of a
                        thicker darkness than that within.</p>
                    <p>"Hold! what is this? "asked Satiatti, brushing against something, after they
                        had advanced a short distance.</p>
                    <p>"The first bramble between the front door and the hedge, I think," answered
                        the dwarf.</p>
                    <p>"True, I had forgotten it. You will lie here. I shall descend into the
                        valley, and enter the cemetery from the north. Remember to throw the stone,
                        if you hear anything about the house, as I told you." So saying, he left the
                        dwarf, and started northward down the valley, the shovel on his back. After
                        descending for a distance he turned west, and walked at right angles with
                        the inclined plane. It was the difficult part of his task to know exactly
                        how far westward to go, in order not to lose the general notion of his
                        whereabouts with <pb id="VAA3890-065" n="65"/> respect to the situation of
                        the grave. He counted his steps to the number that he had calculated would
                        make about three hundred yards, and stopped to listen. Everything was as
                        silent as the dead sleeping in their tombs. He turned and ascended directly
                        toward the cemetery, which, if his calculations had been accurate, he would
                        reach about the place of the newly -made grave. If a light could have been
                        thrown into that face as it climbed the hill, there would have been seen a
                        combination of expressions, including joy and expectation, tinctured with
                        the nervous uncertainty of a criminal and the strength of something almost
                        superhuman. "Once," he was thinking, as he climbed, "I could have loved such
                        a girl. I will be good enough to her, but she shall be mine. I will enjoy
                        what was denied my youth; and the murderers of Louis XVI. shall pay me in
                        this generation. My science&#151;if it fail not! Madeline! I will teach
                        you to serve a soldier of a king," and then he called himself a fool. "Ten
                        chances to one she is dead. Can I revive her? I fear there was too much
                        carbon. My science&#151;my science!"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-066" n="66"/>
                    <p>He encountered an obstacle&#151;the fence &#151;and climbing over,
                        his hand met, as high as his own head, a smooth cold face. It was only a
                        marble figure, as dead and silent as the earth beneath his feet; but it
                        reminded him that he was still capable of fear. He was now in the cemetery;
                        and, according to his calculation, not far from the grave. But which way to
                        turn he knew not. He laid the shovel against the fence, in order not to lose
                        the knowledge of where he had entered, for by feeling along the fence he
                        might return to it at any time. Absolutely nothing could be seen except some
                        gray spots that lay scattered through the darkness. To move with any speed
                        was impossible; for the mounds and monuments were so profusely and
                        irregularly crowded that he might be at any instant precipitated to the
                        ground. Crawling on his hands and knees, never more than two steps from the
                        fence, he felt for fresh earth. The green and the withered grass and weeds
                        were wet with dew; the slabs that lay on the ground felt cold; the monuments
                        and headstones continually intercepted his progress; and an occasional <pb
                            id="VAA3890-067" n="67"/> human sentiment, that he was crawling amid the
                        bones and decayed flesh of the dead, unconsciously caused him to halt, until
                        he cursed himself for cowardice, and proceeded. There was that horrible
                        stillness that made the sound of his own creeping and breathing roar in his
                        ears like the crashing of billows on a stony beach. He thought a thousand
                        eyes were fastened upon him and that he was being followed.</p>
                    <p>Earth&#151;fresh earth! His hand sank into it, with the other he could
                        reach the fence, along which he walked to the shovel, counting his steps;
                        and in a few minutes he was back on the spot. After feeling the dimensions
                        of the mound, he began to dig. Each shovelful of earth that fell to the
                        ground roared like the discharge of a cannon between intervals of death-like
                        silence in the still night. The dead awaked in their graves; and some came
                        and stood by his side; yet he did not stop digging. A hand descended slowly
                        upon him, and when it touched his shoulder, it broke and fell to the ground,
                        he thought. The figure moved away, and the hand lay squirming like a snake
                        amid <pb id="VAA3890-068" n="68"/> his digging. "Ugh! my thoughts," he
                        muttered, half aloud, picking up the hand, but in his grasp there was
                        nothing save earth. All around, those long dead turned in their graves; the
                        later ones arose, sat on their tombs, and moved about; but none spoke or
                        smiled. Some came and watched the digging from sockets that had no eyes,
                        their bones rattling with every step. A few only had withered hearts, the
                        rest had none. A mourning sound now issued from their lips and tongueless
                        mouths. Satiani stopped, looked about, and the dead shrank back. He
                        descended into the grave, and continued to dig. Presently he struck the box,
                        which he pulled partially out of the hole, and, breaking off a board, felt
                        the folds of a shroud. "Oh, oh, oh!" echoed the dead, coming in swarms. He
                        laid the motionless form on the ground, and filled up the grave. Covered
                        with a cold perspiration, and trembling in physical exhaustion, he bore his
                        burden down the valley, across to the stone house, where at the entrance to
                        the court he was met by the dwarfish person.</p>
                    <p>"Monsieur."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-069" n="69"/>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"I thought you were never coming. You have been long," cried the
                        creature.</p>
                    <p>"No, not thirty minutes."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, you have been hours."</p>
                    <p>"Impossible,' replied Satiani. There was a tremor in his voice. "What is that
                        light yonder?" and he pointed toward the east.</p>
                    <p>"Monsieur, that is the dawn."</p>
                    <p>They hastened into the house and felt their way down into the cellar. Satiani
                        laid the body on the couch and fell exhausted to the floor. The dwarf
                        lighted a candle in the iron rack, and the glimmers fell upon two faces of
                        deadly pallor.</p>
                    <p>"Monsieur!" cried the dwarf; but there was no reply.</p>

                    <head>VII.</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the morning this conversation took place at the <hi
                            rend="i">Hôtel de Ville</hi>:&#151;</p>
                    <p>"Well, what did you see?" asked a stout man sitting behind a desk, in the
                        lower office. He was the prefect of the police.</p>
                    <p>"It was too dark a night to see anything," replied an individual, bespattered
                        with mud, standing before the desk.</p>
                    <p>"Was the house quiet? "</p>
                    <p>"No. I lay all night beneath the grating of a cellar window, on the north
                        side of the house. The window was nailed up from the inside, so that I could
                        see absolutely nothing. Until almost midnight, I could hear faint murmuring
                        sounds coming from somewhere beneath me; I think perhaps from the very room
                        in the cellar beside which I lay. Once or twice I thought I heard talking on
                        the ground floor; but being some feet below the <pb id="VAA3890-071" n="71"
                        /> ground, I could not be sure. That the house is occupied is positive."</p>
                    <p>"Did you learn nothing more?" asked the prefect.</p>
                    <p>"Yes. As I said, until about the middle of the night I heard sounds in the
                        cellar, and then for a long time everything was silent. I thought the person
                        or persons must have gone to bed. There was nothing for me to gain by
                        getting out of the hole in which I lay, so I determined to stay until
                        daylight at least. It must have been several hours before there was so much
                        as the sound of a breath. At length I heard footsteps mixed with some
                        talk&#151;from how many different persons I have no idea. It seemed that
                        but one person spoke, but per haps there were two. Presently I heard
                        something thump upon the cellar floor, and a ragged voice cried,
                        'Monsieur'&#151;that I heard clearly enough. It was perhaps half an hour
                        before there was any other sound that I could hear. Then it seemed that two
                        voices began to talk. Sometimes it sounded like only one; and again, later,
                            <hi rend="i">I thought I could hear a third</hi>."</p>
                    <p>"Do you think any of the voices could have been that of the man found on the
                            <pb id="VAA3890-072" n="72"/> floor night before last?" asked the
                        prefect.</p>
                    <p>"I could not hear them plainly enough. That man I think was dead, although,
                        as I reported, he was still warm. The voice that I heard last night say
                        'Monsieur' would not probably belong to a man of that size. It was not
                        clear, and seemed weak.&#151;But let me finish about last night."</p>
                    <p>"Certainly, go on."</p>
                    <p>"I could see from the hole in which I lay that the day was breaking.
                        Presently I heard scuffling sounds over the floor. They must have been
                        pretty loud for that kind of noise else I could not have heard them. There
                        was no conversation now, and I could only hear low monotonous sounds at
                        about the interval of one's breathing. At length the talk began again,
                        almost all coming from one voice; but I feel nearly certain that in this
                        last conversation two persons were speaking; neither voice, however, sounded
                        like the one that had called 'Monsieur' Occasionally, I heard a noise as if
                        some one were pounding or drumming on an iron door or wall; but this stopped
                        soon; and that is all I <pb id="VAA3890-073" n="73"/> heard. I crawled out
                        of the hole about daybreak."</p>
                    <p>"We are warranted now in breaking into the house; and we shall do so
                        tonight," said the prefect, dismissing the officer.</p>
                    <p>The news had come that there was fighting in Paris, that the People were
                        bombarding the city from behind ram-parts and barricades, and that the King
                        remained in retreat at Saint Cloud. In vain had Marshal Marmont sent courier
                        after courier asking the monarch to pacify the people. He did nothing. The
                        Marshal went himself. The King listened patiently, then said calmly, "Then
                        it is really a revolt?"</p>
                    <p>"No, sir," replied Marmont, "it is not a revolt, but a revolution!"</p>
                    <p>Then everything turned to confusion in the royal house.</p>
                    <p>The police officers of the town from which Joseph's company had marched were
                        supposed to be supporters of the existing <hi rend="i">régime</hi>; but in
                        their hearts they were glad that the People were tearing the royal robes.
                        Fifteen years had passed since Waterloo, and the desire for some <pb
                            id="VAA3890-074" n="74"/> kind of excitement burned in nearly every
                        Frenchman's breast. The five police who proceeded by separate paths to the
                        old stone house at nine o'clock that night, were anxious, therefore, to
                        satisfy a little of their aroused spirit by the adventure which the present
                        expedition afforded. The night was favorable. Though somewhat misty, it was
                        not as dark as the night before.</p>
                    <p>At half-past nine the officer in citizen's dress crept up the valley from the
                        north, and crawling through the wild hedges, descended into the hole of the
                        cellar window. By ten o'clock the other officers lay behind thick shrubbery
                        on every side of the house. It was their plan that no one should be
                        permitted to leave the house, and the entrance of no one was to be impeded.
                        At a low whistle from the officer in the hole, the house was to be entered
                        at every door simultaneously. The signal was to be given sufficiently long
                        after the sound of talking had ceased in the cellar to allow the inmates to
                        retire and fall asleep. So far as the officers lying about the house knew,
                        this might be at any minute. Consuming with impatience, <pb id="VAA3890-075"
                            n="75"/> they lay several hours; but no signal came, and no one tried to
                        enter the house or to leave it. Probably the situation was such that the
                        officer in the hole thought it unwise to make the attack with so small a
                        force; but they had made no provisions for retreat, and it was their
                        understanding that the house was to be entered. Could it be that their
                        fellow by the cellar window had been discovered and rendered helpless? At a
                        little after two o'clock one of the officers crept to the hole and whispered
                        his name.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, who is it?"</p>
                    <p>The first speaker crawled into the hole, and said, "Why don't you give the
                        signal?"</p>
                    <p>"The cellar is silent."</p>
                    <p>"Then it is time."</p>
                    <p>"Don't be hasty."</p>
                    <p>"How long has it been since the talking stopped?"</p>
                    <p>"I have not heard a sound all the evening."</p>
                    <p>"Then I think we should all enter at one door, for perhaps we are expected,
                        and can accomplish most by the kind of entrance that will make the least
                        possible <pb id="VAA3890-076" n="76"/> noise, which would be to open but one
                        door instead of all."</p>
                    <p>After this conversation, which was with mouth to ear, they separated.</p>
                    <p>One officer was placed before the house to watch the front and side, while
                        the other four collected at the back door. One began at once to work quietly
                        with a bunch of keys. All knew the dimensions of the house, upon which
                        knowledge they had now to depend, for it was too dark to see much. Disguised
                        as peasants or drovers, at one time or another during the day they had
                        studied the house from a distance. Presently, the lock yielded to a key, and
                        in their stocking-feet they entered. There was that dead silence that makes
                        one nervous and feel that somebody is in hiding. They proceeded into the
                        next room; while one remained, flashing his lantern about, but saw nothing
                        save a coat, some old cooking utensils, and a low wooden bench on which lay
                        a few dry crusts of bread. The next room was absolutely barren, and so the
                        next. The officers were as noiseless as the night, and as cunning as any of
                        their kind. After everything had been searched and <pb id="VAA3890-077"
                            n="77"/> nothing found, they turned toward the cellar. The door was
                        easily opened, and three descended; but the door at the bottom of the
                        stairs, which was the last between them and the cellar, was made of iron and
                        baffled every key. Thrice the officer operating with the keys made some
                        noise; and they decided that the door must be broken open. From within there
                        came no sound except the echo of their pounding. The officer who had been
                        stationed outside and the one at the head of the stairs now also descended.
                        Presently the door sprang open, and in an instant all were within. But
                        besides them no one was there.</p>
                    <p>The room was as already described; except that on the couch, which still
                        stood in the center of the floor, were a few stains of blood. The two narrow
                        arches at once attracted the officers. Two entered one, and two the other,
                        while one remained within the square room. Nothing was found in either,
                        except in the front arched chamber lay a small heap of light ashes, from the
                        edge of which protruded a piece of white satin, unburned. One of the
                        officers was working at the cross bar which <pb id="VAA3890-078" n="78"/>
                        closed the iron door that led from this room, while two others held their
                        lanterns close by. At length the door turned on its hinges, and from within
                        came a puff of suffocating odor that cut their throats like glass; and for
                        an instant their lanterns shone on the dead figure of the dwarf, crouched
                        close to the wall.</p>
                    <p>A week passed. Joseph had returned home. He had not had the heart to stay in
                        Paris and take enough interest in anything to fight for it. Irène had found
                        him almost immediately in a hazardous barricade between the Pont des Arts
                        and the Louvre. She did not return with him, but remained with a distant
                        relative in Paris. The world was dark to young Joseph. His bravery did not
                        deprive his nature of a pure emotion; and though for his age he had been
                        much among men, he had not become worldly in the sense that he could outwit
                        his purer feelings by dissipation, temporary attachments, or any other
                        device in that category, to which many another would have appealed to
                        suppress his sorrow.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-079" n="79"/>
                    <p>Tall, slender, of dark complexion, with large deep eyes that carried the
                        wistful look of a child mingled with the unconscious strength and power of
                        youth, he was that type of man that women instinctively love. Had not it
                        been for the extreme stereotyped manner in which he dealt with the people
                        about him, he might have been a hero to more than one heart. If he ever
                        showed any side of his nature, it was the majestic that appeared, and that
                        resented pressing familiarity. But before one person he had been unarmed of
                        all save the emotional youth. His fellows and Madeline's friends had thought
                        him proud, but he cared not; it was sufficient for him that one person had
                        not thought him so. He and Madeline were soon to have been married. Their
                        approach to this great event had opened a world of thought that neither
                        dreamed existed within them. But now a great shadow had settled over the
                        brightness of the vista that had lain before him. His taciturnity was of the
                        kind that carried with it a restless inner grief that made those who loved
                        him fearful of his actions.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-080" n="80"/>
                    <p>One morning his father said: "Joseph, you must try to take interest in
                        something; you must try to forget."</p>
                    <p>He made no reply. Though grateful for his father's good intentions, the
                        expression in his face showed that he knew how little his grief was
                        understood. He had never thought it possible for devotion to exist to the
                        extent that this sad event had made manifest: he had thought that Madeline
                        could get on alone easily enough without him. And to think that it had been
                        for him; and that his lack of appreciation of its intensity had put it aside
                        forever! He understood now that Madeline's love had been greater than he had
                        thought; and that she had silently restrained herself, hoping to delight him
                        with her boundless devotion in the long years that she imagined lay before
                        them. Morning after morning he walked to the cemetery, sometimes with
                        flowers, and often with a book from which in the days gone by he was wont to
                        read to her. Thus, like many another in the veering world, he worshiped
                        where there was naught save dumb earth.</p>
                    <p>"Don't go thither this morning," begged <pb id="VAA3890-081" n="81"/> his
                        mother, kissing him. "Will you not &#151;please&#151;for me?"</p>
                    <p>For her sake he did not go; but wandered down side streets toward Madeline's
                        home.</p>
                    <p>It was a summer morning as balmy as nature affords; the warm sun gently smote
                        the new-born flowers, the growing foliage of the trees thickened the shadows
                        that wavered on the grass, and the birds and bees went gaily about the
                        season's business. Beside the cottage, in the garden, sat Monsieur Le Blanc,
                        reading a newspaper; and Madame, who was somewhat recovered, went quietly
                        about her household affairs. The house was gloomy within; it was no more the
                        abode of enchantment and delight; but like a sea-beach in winter, cold,
                        dark, and linked with memories. Joseph did not enter, but sat on a
                        garden-seat near Monsieur.</p>
                    <p>"My lad, how are you?"</p>
                    <p>"Well, I thank you."</p>
                    <p>"Have you heard from Irène?"</p>
                    <p>"No."</p>
                    <p>"When do you think she will come back?"</p>
                    <p>"I do not think she will come back at <pb id="VAA3890-082" n="82"/> all. She
                        will like Paris; and the last thing she said as I asked her to return with
                        me, was, 'No; now that Madeline is gone, I have no desire.'"</p>
                    <p>"She loved our child," said Monsieur.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, she must have. As I turned away she broke into tears. It was the only
                        time I ever saw Irène cry."</p>
                    <p>Presently Madame came from the house, and sat with Joseph. She looked pale,
                        and had fallen away since their great sorrow. Her attachment to the young
                        man was not weak; and it grew stronger now that she saw how deep his
                        affection really was.</p>
                    <p>There was not much conversation. Of what should they talk? It was as if the
                        flowers had gone from the earth, the light from the sun, the soul from the
                        body. Monsieur was himself again more than either of the others. For them
                        the great veil had not yet lifted. Their words had no deep meaning, but each
                        understood the other's sorrow, and thus what was lacking in verbal
                        intercourse was supplied by a communication more subtle than that of
                        language.</p>
                    <p>"Joseph," said the mother, "will you come often?"</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-083" n="83"/>
                    <p>"Yes, Madame."</p>
                    <p>"There isn't much here to interest you now," said Monsieur; "but it will do
                        us good to have you come. Sooner or later you will forget the past, my lad;
                        life will open to you again; and other attractions will solicit and win your
                        attention. But come to see us often, since for us the sun is already in the
                        western sky, and it is backwards that we look."</p>
                    <p>It had been a long time since he had spoken with such kindness; and when he
                        had finished, he arose and kissed the pale face of his wife; but he saw not
                        her pallor, remembering only how beautiful she had been when first he had
                        pressed his lips to her cheek, long years ago.</p>
                    <p>For a time no one spoke, Monsieur was again reading his paper, and Madame and
                        Joseph were looking at the flowers in the beds near by.</p>
                    <p>"Here is some strange news," said the father, to whom the other two turned.
                        "Some secret discoveries were made about a week ago; and the police, hoping
                        to make more, have kept the matter to themselves until now."</p>
                    <p>He read the account of the finding of <pb id="VAA3890-084" n="84"/> the body
                        that disappeared from the stone house when the police had returned; also the
                        account of the discovery of the occupied cellar, and of the finding of the
                        dead dwarf, of whom a vivid description was given. Among the last paragraphs
                        of the article was the following: "In the front arched chamber of the cellar
                        was found a heap of ashes from the corner of which protruded a piece of
                        white satin."</p>
                    <p>Madame buried her face in her hands, and began to cry.</p>
                    <p>"What is it?" asked Monsieur.</p>
                    <p>He received the same answer that she had made recently so often, to similar
                        questions, when she had burst into tears by being suddenly reminded of her
                        departed child. "I was only thinking of Madeline," she said. "Her shroud was
                        white."</p>

                    <head>VIII.</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> next evening, when the night had covered the town in
                        darkness, and when each person was within his own precinct, Monsieur and
                        Madame Le Blanc sat quietly in their abode, in the second room from the
                        front. The side door, which was seldom closed in summer, save when all had
                        retired, stood open as usual; and through it the lamp on the table sent its
                        rays out into the garden.</p>
                    <p>"It is a beautiful night," said Monsieur, taking a seat in the doorway, as
                        the moon began to brighten, darkening the shadows of the trees that
                        oscillated in the evening breeze. It was as quiet as the country; only now
                        and then some distant vehicle or a coach arriving at the <hi rend="i">Hôtel
                            de Ville</hi> broke the absolute stillness. Sorrow had again joined
                        their hearts; and now they sat quietly together and alone, as they had done
                        when they were first married, before <pb id="VAA3890-086" n="86"/> Madeline
                        had come into the world. That was twenty years ago; and now, for the first
                        time, they retraced the past step by step. It was like the opening and
                        closing of a volume, each chapter having its joys and sorrow and
                        commonplaces. In all these years their greatest happiness had been the
                        little girl that grew up between them, giving them a common interest, and
                        thus binding them more closely together.</p>
                    <p>"What hour does it strike?" asked Madame, as a bell began to toll.</p>
                    <p>"Nine."</p>
                    <p>At that instant, light but rapid footsteps were heard running on the sidewalk
                        toward the house. The garden gate sprang open, and what looked like the
                        figure of a woman rushed impetuously into the yard.</p>
                    <p>"Who is this?" said Monsieur, rising in the doorway, and looking toward the
                        gate.</p>
                    <p>"Indeed, I know not," replied Madame, also rising.</p>
                    <p>The figure came running, and in an instant stood before them, in the light
                        shining through the door.</p>
                    <p>"You see it is I," she said, breathless.</p>
                    <p>"Irène!" exclaimed Monsieur.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-087" n="87"/>
                    <p>"Yes, only I, no other."</p>
                    <p>"Why have you run so? you gasp for breath," said Madame, throwing her arms
                        about her neck.</p>
                    <p>"You will also gasp in a moment. I will tell you. Let me sit down."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, come here, my child," said Madame, leading her into the house, and
                        kissing her again and again.</p>
                    <p>Irène sat down. "Give me a drink of water," she said, nervously trying to
                        fasten up her hair, which had fallen over her shoulders.</p>
                    <p>"You are not well," said Monsieur, as the water was being brought. "You look
                        so pale, and stare so. What has befallen you?"</p>
                    <p>"No, no, I am not sick; I will tell you when I get some water and my
                        breath."</p>
                    <p>"Here is water, my child."</p>
                    <p>Irène took a few swallows between breaths, and holding her sides, said, "Now
                        sit down, both of you; I have something to say."</p>
                    <p>Monsieur and Madame obeyed, looking at each other and then at the breathless,
                        pale, nervous and staring Irène. She was greatly changed.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-088" n="88"/>
                    <p>"I have come all the way from Paris today," she began. "I ran here from the
                            <hi rend="i">Hôtel de Ville</hi> where the coach stopped. It seemed as
                        though I could not get here soon enough. I should have flown, if I had had
                        wings. You know I have been living with my aunt since I went away? She is
                        not really my aunt, but then&#151;"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, we know," said Monsieur, eagerly. "Joseph told us where you were
                        staying."</p>
                    <p>"Ah! Joseph, yes&#151;where is he? she asked, staring about, as if she
                        thought that he was in hiding.</p>
                    <p>"At home, of course."answered Monsieur. "What were you going to tell us?"</p>
                    <p>Tossing her hat to the table, opening her dress at the throat and beginning
                        to fan herself, she ignored Monsieur's question, and said:
                        "Joseph&#151;he will be glad to see me and hear what I will say. Could
                        he be sent for?"</p>
                    <p>A pause.</p>
                    <p>"You can see him to-morrow."</p>
                    <p>"Yes, to-morrow; but he should know to-night. If he died meanwhile, he would
                        remain in ignorance."</p>
                    <p>"What are you talking about, child?" <pb id="VAA3890-089" n="89"/> said
                        Madame Le Blanc, trying to caress her.</p>
                    <p>"No, you must not disturb me until I have finished. I hardly know how to
                        begin. I do not want to blurt it out. You must not take it strangely."</p>
                    <p>"Well, well!" commanded Monsieur, anxiously.</p>
                    <p>"Where did I leave off?"</p>
                    <p>"About living with your aunt."</p>
                    <p>"Yes&#151;I told you with my aunt. She was very good to me; but that is
                        not what I have come to tell you. I thought I should stay with her; but I
                        had to come here first; we shall all go back to Paris
                        to-morrow&#151;Monsieur, Joseph and I&#151;to-morrow, by the first
                        stage," She paused again as if trying to collect her thoughts. Monsieur
                        arose and placed his hand on her forehead.</p>
                    <p>"No, no, I have no fever. Now listen. Take your seat, Monsieur. I will just
                        tell as it happened; I can think of no other way. Last night as we sat down
                        to supper, my aunt asked her husband to take us for a walk later in the
                        evening. ' Very well,' he said; and after we had finished our meal, the
                        three of us left the house, <pb id="VAA3890-090" n="90"/> and went toward
                        the Rue Saint Honored The streets were crowded with people. The pavements
                        were still torn up from the dreadful war. I saw the barricades where men
                        killed one another. I had never dreamed of such things in my life. My aunt
                        said that everybody seemed happy; but I thought they seemed frightened. My
                        uncle tried to explain things to me about the king and the government that I
                        could not understand. I walked between them. We turned into the Rue Saint
                        Honoré and stopped at the great market and drank from the fountain. There
                        were so many people that I had now to walk in front. The Rue Saint Honoré
                        was brilliantly lighted&#151;almost like day;&#151;for the first
                        time, my uncle said, since the soldiers had broken all the street lamps. I
                        saw many faces. I never dreamed there were so many people on
                        earth&#151;thousands! I felt bewildered. Lights, rolling carriages,
                        brilliant windows, horses, people&#151;it was like a dream. Now I come
                        to the point! [She grew almost white in the face, arose, and walked to the
                        center of the room.] As I stand here now, my aunt and uncle behind me, so we
                            <pb id="VAA3890-091" n="91"/> walked along. Presently there was a clear
                        place on the sidewalk; and from the crowd going before us&#151;God
                        forbid me from saying falsely!&#151;what do you think I saw emerge? [She
                        stares sharply into their faces.] Monsieur, Madame! what do you think I
                        saw?"</p>
                    <p>"Irène!" cried Monsieur, "what does all this mean? What" are you talking
                        about?"</p>
                    <p>"Child," said Madame, going toward her, frightened at her actions.</p>
                    <p>"No, no, sit down. You think I am beside myself. But listen! As sure as it is
                        now night, and we are three, I saw emerge from the darkness of that crowd,
                        and look into my very eyes&#151;Madeline! Madeline!"</p>
                    <p>Madame fell to weeping bitterly; and Monsieur, leading Irène to a seat, said:
                        "You would do better not to excite yourself further. It was some one else
                        you saw. Your imagination deceived you. We shall not talk of these things
                        again."</p>
                    <p>"I thought you would say something like that, Monsieur. I thought you would
                        say that I was dreaming, and that I had lost my mind. Do you think that I do
                            <pb id="VAA3890-092" n="92"/> not know Madeline when I see her? Did not
                        we grow up together? Was not I her first playmate and her last? Do you think
                        that I know not those eyes the like of which look from no other face? Will
                        the&#151;"</p>
                    <p>"Why didn't you stop her?" inter-rupted the father, hoping to bring Irène to
                        her senses.</p>
                    <p>"I could not; I fell back into my uncle's arms; my throat was choked and I
                        could not speak. It was too much for me thus to see the dead walk the
                        streets again."</p>
                    <p>It was fully an hour before Monsieur succeeded in pacifying Irène; and then
                        only after she had extracted from him a promise to return with her to Paris
                        in the morning. At eleven o'clock all retired; but for some time only Irène,
                        evercome by physical exhaustion, slept. Monsieur Le Blanc knew human nature
                        well enough to understand that such certainty and persistence are not often
                        born of illusion. "The body can be disinterred," he thought, "'that would
                        satisfy all doubt," But he could not do it himself. He did not wish to look
                        again upon the icy face of the <pb id="VAA3890-093" n="93"/> dead; he wished
                        to remember his child only as she had been in life. And then he thought
                        himself foolish for the ray of hope he was beginning to entertain that she
                        might still be among the living; for had not he seen her laid away in the
                        tomb! and with these thoughts he fell asleep.</p>
                    <p>At ten o'clock the next day Monsieur Le Blanc sat again in his garden; Madame
                        was about her work as usual; and Irène was busying herself in Madeline's old
                        room in the manner that one does who is expecting a guest. She had succeeded
                        in having Joseph sent for; she had repeated her story; and now all were
                        awaiting the return of the latter and the old sexton, who had gone to exhume
                        the remains. When Monsieur and Joseph had protested, she said, "Then I'll go
                        myself and dig." There was nothing to do but obey. It was to be done without
                        attracting any attention; and now at ten o'clock, Joseph's return was
                        awaited.</p>
                    <p>At half-past ten, the father, going into the house, was met at the door by
                        Madame, who said, "It is time Joseph had come back."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-094" n="94"/>
                    <p>"Yes, it is time; but in case he found her, he said he would go directly home
                        and come this evening. Perhaps he has not restrained himself, has looked at
                        her, and now&#151;well, who knows what effect that might not have upon
                        him. But he promised me that only the sexton should look."</p>
                    <p>There was an expression in his countenance, as he spoke these words, as if he
                        were becoming wearied of Irène's hallucinations. He walked into the room
                        facing the front of the garden and beckoned his wife to follow. When they
                        were within he closed the door and said: "Do you know what I think? Does not
                        all this seem strange to you?"</p>
                    <p>"It is strange, indeed," answered the wife.</p>
                    <p>"I believe that Irène has lost her reason."</p>
                    <p>"No!"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, I believe it. Now what are we to do with her?"</p>
                    <p>"But she says that she will be satisfied if Madeline is still in her grave."
                        There was a short pause, during which the wife walked to the window.
                        "What&#151;who is <pb id="VAA3890-095" n="95"/> this that runs so madly?
                        "she cried, looking into the garden." Joseph comes hastening down the path.
                        See, we mistake!"</p>
                    <p>"In an instant he was in the house, calling, "Monsieur! Madame!"</p>
                    <p>"Here, here," they answered, coming to him, followed by Irène from the side
                        room.</p>
                    <p>"She is gone!" cried Joseph; and for a moment the four stood like stone,
                        staring into one another's faces. Madame sank into a chair, Monsieur and
                        Joseph were speechless, Irène alone was self-possessed.</p>
                    <p>"<hi rend="i">En route tout le monde pour Paris</hi>" she called, with joy in
                        her voice. "Madeline still lives!"</p>
                    <p>At nightfall while the strange news was being told under every roof in the
                        town, Monsieur Le Blanc, Joseph and Irène were approaching Paris.</p>
                    <p>"See the lights," cried the girl, as their eyes discerned the first glimmer
                        of the city. "What is that humming noise? "</p>
                    <p>"That is everything&#151;wagons, voices, <pb id="VAA3890-096" n="96"/>
                        workshops, &#151;in short, the city breathing," answered Joseph.</p>
                    <p>Monsieur had not spoken for some time, and seemed occupied with his own
                        thoughts. Presently he said: "Listen to me a moment. What does that piece of
                        white satin found in the cellar of the old stone house have to do with
                        Madeline?"</p>
                    <p>"Her shroud was white," answered Joseph.</p>
                    <p>"What satin&#151;what cellar&#151;what stone house&#151;what do
                        you talk about?" inquired Irène.</p>
                    <p>Monsieur then related to her the discoveries of the police at the old stone
                        house, which had been made while she was in Paris, of the finding of the
                        body that had disappeared, of the heap of ashes, the piece of white satin,
                        and of the dead dwarf.</p>
                    <p>"I saw this very small, ugly person in Doctor Satiani's office the morning of
                        the day that we thought Madeline died," said Irène.</p>
                    <p>"In Satiani's office!" echoed Monsieur.</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"I have not seen Satiani since my return," observed Joseph.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA3890-097" n="97"/>
                    <p>"No, nor I," said Monsieur.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">diligence</hi> had rolled along through Fontainebleau,
                        across the Seine at Melan, through Gros-bois (where many a noble has found
                        refuge in stormy times at the metropolis) over the Marne by way of the
                        ancient bridge at Charenton, and entered Paris from the southeast. The night
                        had already come to its fullness, and it was very dark.</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>IX.</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HEY</hi> lodged in a <hi rend="i">pension</hi> in the Rue
                        Mouffetard, a few squares south of the Seine, near the Halle aux Vins. The
                        place had been recommended by the <hi rend="i">cocher</hi> who brought them
                        from Gros-bois. When they arrived it was much too dark to tell what it
                        looked like. Irène, gathering a handful of newspapers as she passed through
                        the hall, retired to her room at once. Monsieur and Joseph sat up to discuss
                        plans of procedure.</p>
                    <p>The two rooms they occupied were on the third story facing the north, and
                        commanded a magnificent view of Paris for many squares beyond the Seine.
                        Although it was late, many lights besides the rows of street lamps still
                        dotted the darkness of the night. Beyond the river the lights grew smaller,
                        but increased immensely in numbers. There seemed to be an uncommon activity
                        for the late, <pb id="VAA3890-099" n="99"/> ness of the hour; but that was
                        easily accounted for; since the public nervousness before and after short
                        and decisive revolutions always manifested itself in crowded streets of
                        staring people who wandered everywhere and nowhere.</p>
                    <p>"What is to be done now that we are here? "said Monsieur Le Blanc, looking
                        out the open window at Paris in her gala evening dress, that he had not seen
                        for years&#151;but once since he had taken away his young wife, and that
                        was when Madeline was a little girl. "Does she now flaunt somewhere amid
                        this invisible throng?" the father was asking himself.</p>
                    <p>"Don't you think we ought to notify the police?" asked Joseph, leaning on his
                        elbows at the table.</p>
                    <p>"We shall go to the prefecture to-morrow&#151;and then?" said the father,
                        looking at a light a little west of Notre Dame that was growing larger with
                        the lapse of every moment.</p>
                    <p>Joseph made no reply, but sat in deep meditation.</p>
                    <p>Presently Monsieur said: "Come here. What do you think this can be?"</p>
                    <p>"Fire&#151;perhaps revolution! Listen&#151; <pb id="VAA3890-100"
                            n="100"/> hear the clamor. Could it be Notre Dame."</p>
                    <p>"No, that is Notre Dame just to the east. It must be near the Rue St. Honoré
                        or the Rue St. Denis, if I remember the streets rightly."</p>
                    <p>They stood for some time and watched the magnificent flames in the black
                        background of the night.</p>
                    <p>"Are you making plans there at the window?" said Irène, thrusting her head
                        from behind the door that led into her room.</p>
                    <p>Both men turned.</p>
                    <p>"See what I have found&#151;here," and she handed Monsieur a
                        newspaper&#151;the morning edition of the <hi rend="i"
                        >Moniteur</hi>&#151;marked by the pressure of her finger in a lower
                        corner of the page. "Read, Monsieur, read aloud!" she demanded,
                        triumphantly.</p>
                    <p>Monsieur Le Blanc took the paper, and read:&#151;</p>
                    <p>"'The body of the unknown person who led for a few hours with such brilliancy
                        the straggling forces of the Swiss and Royal guards at the Louvre last
                        Thursday was buried today. He was seen to fall <pb id="VAA3890-101" n="101"
                        /> near the statue of Henry IV., and from that moment the vicinity of the
                        Louvre and the Palais Royal were wrenched from the tyrant's forces. The body
                        has lain in the morgue since Friday. The only document of identity found
                        upon his person was an empty envelope bearing the name Doctor Satiani, and
                        addressed to "The southwest corner of the Rue St. Honoré and the Rue du
                        Roule."'"</p>
                    <p>The first thing that Monsieur said, laying aside the paper, was, "Then it was
                        to fight for the King that Doctor Satiani came to Paris. Irène, again I say,
                        it was a vision that you saw on Rue&#151;Rue&#151;"</p>
                    <p>"St. Honoré," answered the girl, "perhaps in the very vicinity of the address
                        on the envelope. Where is the Rue du Roule?"</p>
                    <p>"I do not know," replied Monsieur.</p>
                    <p>"Nor I," said Joseph.</p>
                    <p>"Well, good night again," said Irène. "In the morning we shall find out, and
                        go thither."</p>
                    <p>They retired for the night; and owing to the fatigue of the day's journey,
                        slept soundly.</p>
                    <p>Irène was awake with the first murmurs <pb id="VAA3890-102" n="102"/> of the
                        city's business; and pounding stoutly on the door between the rooms, she
                        aroused Monsieur and Joseph, who arose immediately. They had not the
                        enthusiasm in this present business that animated Irène. Though neither
                        expressed himself, both believed that she was laboring under delusions not
                        far from unsoundness. It had been her persistence that brought them to
                        Paris; and despite their melancholy, her hope spurred them on.</p>
                    <p>After they had breakfasted she said: "Now for the Rue St. Honoré and the Rue
                        du Roule. Which way?"</p>
                    <p>Monsieur made some inquiries and they started out, passed the Halle aux Vins,
                        crossed the Seine at the Isle St. Louis by way of the Pont de la Tournelle
                        and the Pont Marie, thence north-westward until they reached the Rue St.
                        Denis at the Marche des Innocentes, where everything was astir.</p>
                    <p>"Here," said Irène, pointing to the great Marche, "is where my uncle, aunt
                        and I stopped to drink at the fountain before we passed down this way," and
                        she pointed into the Rue St. Honore. "This <pb id="VAA3890-103" n="103"/>
                        way&#151;down this way is where we saw her," she continued, almost
                        dragging Monsieur along.</p>
                    <p>Joseph asked a man who was standing near where the Rue du Roule was.</p>
                    <p>"It's all out," said the stranger, "and they are already clearing it
                        away."</p>
                    <p>The men stared at each other.</p>
                    <p>"I do not know what you are talking about," said Joseph. "Can you tell me
                        where the Rue du Roule is?"</p>
                    <p>"Certainly. Go but a short distance," replied the stranger, pointing westward
                        into the Rue St. Honore'. "I thought you were speaking of last night's
                        fire."</p>
                    <p>Irène, nervous with excitement, walked before. She stared into every face
                        that passed, and often looked around and across the street.</p>
                    <p>Monsieur shook his head.</p>
                    <p>As they proceeded the crowd became denser; until, a short distance ahead, it
                        became a great mass hovering around the corner of a street.</p>
                    <p>"See! that is the Rue du Roule, where the crowd is. The name is on the
                        building this way," cried Irène.</p>
                    <p>They approached the southward corner, <pb id="VAA3890-104" n="104"/> which
                        was surrounded by a mass of people, and, working their way forward, at
                        length they stood before heaps of ruins and ashes, which were being cleared
                        away by some workmen.</p>
                    <p>"It was in this vicinity that I saw her, and this is the address on the
                        envelope," said Irène, looking into Monsieur's face, and taking hold of his
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>"When was this fire?" asked Joseph of one next to him.</p>
                    <p>"Last night," replied the stranger.</p>
                    <p>In silence, they watched the workmen for a while, when Monsieur turned and
                        said, "What fools we are for wandering here in Paris! "</p>
                    <p>"No, no," begged Irène, gripping his hand, "we will hunt elsewhere."</p>
                    <p>"Ha, ha! <hi rend="i">Ave Maria!</hi>" cried a laborer, not far from where
                        they were standing, as he drew from the wet ashes and held high into the air
                        a pearl rosary bearing a golden crucifix. And not far away lay some
                        fragments of charred bones.</p>
                    <p>Irène sank into Monsieur's arms and was borne away from among the wondering
                        crowd; Joseph relapsed again into silence; and the father began immediately
                            <pb id="VAA3890-105" n="105"/> to busy himself with the prefecture of
                        police.</p>
                    <p>On the second day after, they started home, arriving at their native town at
                        nightfall. Monsieur wandered alone to the cottage beside the garden, where
                        there awaited one to hear what he had to tell; and Joseph walked home with
                        Irène. He had bought the rosary of the laborer, and as he was about to turn
                        away to his own abode, he gave it to her, saying: "You keep it. It can
                        remind me of nothing save what I must forget in order to live."</p>
                    <p>"I feel sorry for you, Joseph," whispered Irène, "I did what I could."</p>
                    <p>"Yes," replied the young soldier, and out of the sorrow and gratitude of his
                        heart, he bowed and kissed her hand.</p>
                    <p>Two years after, Joseph and Irène were married.</p>
                    <p>In 1870, forty years later, when nearly all the persons who figured in this
                        brief <pb id="VAA3890-106" n="106"/> episode had died, and when the old
                        stone house had sunk further into the earth and become to several
                        generations of children the abode of the evil spirit, and when fragments of
                        the foregoing narrative had become a tradition, and time had spread oblivion
                        over what once seethed and throbbed with human interest, there came to the
                        town two women: one, small, slender and white with age; the other, younger,
                        but already passed the meridian of life. They had in their possession a deed
                        to the old stone house; into which, after some repairs were made, they
                        moved. They turned a deaf ear to every admonition that the house had been
                        many years ago the abode of sinister deeds, and also baffled every effort of
                        inquisitive persons to disclose their identity.</p>
                    <p>If anybody of the town ever saw squarely into the face of the older of these
                        two women, it was never known; for with such studied care did she avoid the
                        gaze of any passer-by that nothing save her small dark figure and snow-white
                        hair were ever seen. Occasionally, she wandered in the cemetery across the
                        way; but beyond this her steps rarely went further than the hedge that <pb
                            id="VAA3890-107" n="107"/> surrounded the court of the old stone house.
                        In 1887 she died, and was interred in the ancient cemetery, near a tomb
                        bearing the name of "Joseph Collot." A few weeks later, the younger woman
                        disappeared, and was never again seen.</p>
                    <p>There was enough difference in the ages of these two women to be mother and
                        daughter; for the older at the time of her death must have been not far from
                        eighty, and the younger perhaps about sixty. In appearance they were not
                        unlike; except that the eyes of the younger woman were horribly dissimilar,
                        one being blue and the other black. And it was of her that the townspeople
                        asked M. de Corbière such questions as "Is not this, indeed, the daughter of
                        the famous doctor?" "Has not she the eyes of Satiani?"</p>
