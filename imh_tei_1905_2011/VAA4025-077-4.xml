            <p>The growth of cities was one of the most important developments in late-nineteenth-century America.
                    Between the Civil War and 1900 the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> moved much closer to becoming an urban nation. Recently historians have begun to
                    examine the process of urban growth and its effects on American society, particularly through
                    studies that employ statistical methods in an attempt to capture the experiences of the anonymous
                    people who made up the vast majority of the population. The methodology and the conclusions reached
                    with it have been both exciting and fruitful.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> At times, however, the so-called
                    new urban history has exaggerated the atomistic quality of city life. Studies of ethnic groups, for
                    instance, indicate that new urban residents sought to create communities within the cities in an
                    effort to provide order in their lives—something the new urban historians frequently
                        overlook.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Some of these historians also seem to forget that many Americans
                    continued to live in small towns rather than in large cities. Investigation of life in those towns
                    has lagged behind studies of life in the cities.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Perhaps one way to correct these oversights is to pay more attention to suburbs. Suburbanization is
                    not only a post-World War II phenomenon; it has been occurring for over a century. Moreover, as
                    historian Kenneth T. Jackson has persuasively argued, urban growth was both demographic and
                    geographic: American cities expanded in population partly because they expanded their boundaries to
                    include communities on their outskirts. In Jackson's words, "If annexation (the
                    addition of unincorporated land to the city) or consolidation (the absorption of one municipal
                    government by another, usually adjacent) had not taken place, there would now be no great cities in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the political sense of the term." The ability of cities to absorb towns on
                    what Jackson calls "the crabgrass frontier" was essential to the growth of cities
                    in the nineteenth century.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to augmenting urban growth, suburbs also contributed to the increasing social and
                    economic differentiation occurring within the cities. As cities grew, segregation of the population
                    by income level increased; people of roughly equal wealth began to live in homogeneous communities.
                    In addition, the economic use of urban space became more differentiated. Rather than having a
                    mixture of industries and residences, or even factories and stores, in the same small area, each
                    type of economic enterprise began to develop within separate parts of the city. Eventually zoning
                    was developed to plan and order the use of urban space, but initially some business concerns chose
                    to move away from the central city voluntarily in search of more land on which to build larger
                    facilities. Both the sorting out of the urban population by income level and the differentiation of
                    urban space by economic use were reflected in the growth of the crabgrass frontier.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Many communities maintained their original socioeconomic characteristics after they were incorporated
                    into the larger cities, with the once independent towns becoming identifiable and distinctive
                    neighborhoods. Certainly not all developments on the crabgrass frontier were successful: some became
                    merely failed real estate ventures. But in some suburban developments like-minded people sought to
                    build specific kinds of communities, often trying to recapture what they believed to be the virtues
                    of small town life. Suburban founders with such visions often succeeded in building towns that
                    remained distinctive long after their annexation by growing cities.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ability of groups to create distinctive communities and the consequent socioeconomic segregation
                    of urban space can be explored by examining three Gilded Age suburbs of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>. <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
               </placeName>, Brightwood, and Woodruff Place indicate the variety of ideas
                    that motivated suburban development and the types of men involved. The early histories of these
                    towns also reveal the problems founders confronted and how they tried to overcome them. In short, an
                    examination of these three suburbs of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> illustrates how various parts of cities obtained differing characters due to the
                    choices made by individuals when those areas were first laid out.</p>

               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Brightwood, and Woodruff Place were platted and incorporated between 1870 and 1876,
                    and all were located east of the city. Each town had an identifiable group of founders, and each
                    developed a character expressive of the founders' intentions. Despite the Panic of 1873 and
                    the ensuing depression, these towns became the kinds of communities envisioned by the town fathers. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> grew to be a middle-class university town; Brightwood evolved into a working-class
                    industrial suburb; and Woodruff Place developed into an upper-class residential park. The
                    differences among the groups of founders, the initial plans for the towns, and their early
                    institutions and residents combined to make these three suburbs distinctive.</p>

            <p>In August, 1872, Greenleaf organized a company "to bring capital and labor
                    together." The charter of the Greenleaf Manufacturing Company allowed employees to buy
                    stock in the firm. Greenleaf hoped that the prospect of sharing in the profits would give the
                    workers an incentive to be more productive. Of the original thirty-five stockholders, at least nine
                    were company employees, despite the requirement that initial buyers invest one thousand dollars. In
                    March, 1873, when amended articles of association were drawn up, there were seventy-six
                    shareholders, of whom thirteen were company employees and several were skilled workers for other

                    dreamed of building some type of model industrial community; his concern for helping workers improve

                    bought the company's buildings, which saved the town, but neither the railroad nor the

                    a stove foundry, which became Mothershead, Morris &amp; Company in 1875; Brightwood was the site

            <p>In 1874 the Wiles brothers and Mothershead signed an amended plat of Brightwood with thirty-four
                        others.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> It is striking how few of these individuals lived in the suburb at
                    any time during the 1870s. Of the thirty-seven signers of the plat of 1874, only four definitely
                    lived there before 1880. Most of them did retain property there, however; the tax list for 1880
                    includes the names of twenty-four of the thirty-seven persons who signed the plat of 1874. Unlike <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Brightwood was developed by absentee landlords. The occupations of thirty-two of the
                    signers can be determined. Railroads employed one third of the total (eleven of thirty-two), and of
                    that number the CCC&amp;I employed seven. Six men worked for Wiles Brothers &amp; Company.
                    In addition, there were four wholesale grocers, two manufacturers (a brass founder and Mothershead),
                    three teachers, two publishers, a restaurant owner, a real estate agent, and a lawyer. Railroad
                    employees, merchants, and manufacturers played key roles in the founding of Brightwood but not in
                    the creation of <placeName>

            <p>The Brightwood founders were not dreamers so much as hard-headed businessmen. Brightwood was a
                    convenient (and, it was hoped, profitable) place to locate factories and house workers. It was not a
                    company town, because there were several companies there and houses were individually owned.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Unfortunately, the absence of the early town records prevents learning how
                    frequently the absentee owners intervened in town affairs. Without these records and other material,
                    it cannot be determined if there was any motive directing development other than the obvious one of
                    making money.</p>
            <p>No similar problem exists in the case of Woodruff Place; one can identify a dream and a dreamer for

                    develop the area in an extravagant fashion. He envisioned an exclusive suburb bounded by a fence and
                    decorated with a number of fountains and statues.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Until he went bankrupt in
                    early 1875, work on the area proceeded swiftly; after he filed for bankruptcy, development slowed

                    lived in it the following two years. In 1876 Woodruff led the successful effort to incorporate the
                    area even though it then had only six voters.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> His declining economic fortunes
                    forced him to move from Woodruff Place in 1877, and by the next year he had left <placeName>

                    scientific expedition. Woodruff did not stay in the suburb very long, but he continued to influence
                    its development indirectly. His original plans were followed by those who came to control the land.</p>
            <p>The three groups of founders were distinctly different from each other. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> town fathers were professional men who were ready to live in and direct the growth of
                    their suburb. The Brightwood town fathers represented businessmen who saw the potential profit in
                    suburban development but were not interested in building a town in which they would live. Woodruff
                    wanted to build an upper-class enclave that would testify by its very appearance to the wealth of
                    its inhabitants. These intentions and desires are suggested by the occupations and residential
                    preferences of the founders. They are also revealed by the plans for the towns and by their major
                    institutions.</p>

                    pattern, Julian and Johnson drew in curving streets that conformed to the contours of the land, an

                    of the land. A second noticeable feature of the plat was the size of the lots. All but a very few
                    lots were over an acre in area, and most were over two acres. The size and consequent price of the
                    lots limited the potential market for them, and it was not long before subdividing took place.
                    Julian and Johnson subdivided forty-two lots between the two sets of railroad tracks in the southern
                    part of the town into 182 lots in 1873; John W. Chambers subdivided the area north of College (now
                    Audubon) Circle into 250 lots in 1872 and 1873; and Levi Ritter and James Downey redrew the
                    boundaries of other lots in subsequent years. Whether this subdividing was a concession to necessity
                    or whether the large lots had been considered temporary from the beginning cannot be determined. A
                    third obvious feature of the plat was the provision for two circular areas near the center of the
                    town. The northern circle was "designed for the use of a Female College" and the
                    southern one was "dedicated to the use and purpose of a public park" which would
                    have a statue of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> stressed grace and beauty, the accompanying covenant emphasized purpose and dedication.
                    Julian and Johnson proposed to "exclude from the town everything vicious or
                    offensive" through the inclusion of stipulations in all deeds to property in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Each buyer agreed not to allow "any distillery brewery soap factory Pork or
                    slaughter house or any other establishment offensive to the people" to be built on his
                    property. And no "stable hog pen privy or other offensive building Stall or shed"
                    could be constructed within one hundred feet of any avenue. Finally, the purchaser guaranteed that
                    he would "not sell or suffer any one to sell … any intoxicating beverages except
                    for sacramental medicinal or mechanical purposes strictly." Julian and Johnson promised to
                    abide by these same restrictions on any lots that they kept.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these stipulations Julian and Johnson did more than merely exclude anything "vicious or
                    offensive"; they bound the buyers into a community. The owners accepted the
                    founders' vision of a sober, beautiful, sweet-smelling town. They promised not only to obey
                    the restrictions themselves but also to enforce them against others. The deeds explicitly stated
                    that "the right to compel an enforcement of these conditions" rested not with
                    Julian and Johnson but rather "in all property holders and inhabitants of the
                    town." Merely by buying property in <placeName>

                    </placeName> fulfilled the desires of Julian and Johnson in the 1870s, and, given the high

                    especially with the beginning of the depression in 1873. The economic crisis threatened the survival
                    of all new real estate ventures and the prosperity of all who invested in them.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> For the founders of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. One major improvement internally was the construction and maintenance of roads. At
                    meeting after meeting, the Board of Trustees accepted petitions regarding streets, ordered the
                    grading and graveling of streets, and arranged to pay contractors for work done on streets.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> A second concern was education; few people would buy lots in the town if
                    their children had no school to attend. Perhaps more importantly, the town fathers would not have
                    wanted to attract individuals who were not concerned about education. In 1873 and 1874 the town
                    issued school bonds totaling $25,000 and built a brick schoolhouse. Enough of the
                    residents took an interest in the conduct of the school that the town split into factions over the
                    firing of a teacher in 1877. The fate of the school bonds reflected the economic problems of the
                    suburb, because in 1879 "the greatly reduced valuation of the property, both real and
                    personal" in the town prevented it from meeting its obligations. New bonds bearing a lower
                    rate of interest had to be issued.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> After 1873 the investors and residents of <placeName>

            <p>Additional investment was made in a street railway. Without reliable and frequent transportation

                    town. The suburb needed a major institution to ensure its survival. Julian and Johnson suggested
                    that a college would conform to the town's purposes by reserving land for one on the
                    original plat. The residents of <placeName>

                    the directors of Northwestern Christian University decided to move the institution from its location

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> offer of about $150,000 and twenty-five acres of land. Construction of
                    buildings began shortly thereafter, and the school opened the 1875–1876 academic year in
                    the town. In 1877 the college was renamed <placeName>

            <p>The school was not the female college for which Julian and Johnson had reserved the northern circle,
                    which the university did not receive, but it fit into the larger purposes of the town. The faculty

            <p>The plat and major institutions of Brightwood contrasted sharply with those of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The Brightwood plat is a good example of the grid pattern that efficiently uses the
                    land. In Brightwood the average lot size above Sutherland Street was 150 feet by 200 feet, a far cry
                    from the one-and two-acre lots in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In Elijah Fletcher's first addition south of Sutherland the average lot was
                    seventy-five feet by two hundred feet. After the area north of Sutherland was subdivided in 1874,
                    the average lot had a frontage of 37.5 feet while the addition of alleys reduced the depth of the
                    average lot to 185 feet. In short, the lots in Brightwood were initially smaller than those in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and they were made even smaller in a short time.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other interesting features of the Brightwood plat are the absences of any restrictions on
                    building and of any provisions for amenities. There were no restrictions written into the deeds or
                    mortgages limiting the buyer's freedom to build whatever and wherever he wished on the
                    property he purchased. Nor was there any language tying the owners or residents into a community to
                    enforce certain stipulations. Furthermore, neither the original plat nor the amended one designated
                    any lots for schools, churches, or parks. Only in Sheldon and Bennett Morris's Oak Hill
                    addition was there any provision for a public park. That park was the only major deviation from the
                    original pattern in the various additions in which lots averaged about 50 feet by 135.5 feet and
                    were laid out in a grid pattern. Deeds to lots in the additions lacked any restrictions on the
                    freedom of the buyers. In other words, the additions complemented rather than changed the design of
                    Brightwood.</p>

                    &amp; Morris, Higgins Bentwood Furniture Company, and several other manufacturing firms. Still
                    other factories were located close by. Transportation to and from <placeName>

                    institute half-hourly service.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The Panic of 1873 deflated these high
                    expectations. Greenleaf and his company failed; the stove foundry and the furniture company also had
                    financial problems. The attempt to attract Northwestern Christian University to the town and the
                    subdivision of lots suggest the magnitude of the difficulties facing the suburb and its owners. The
                    town needed a major business concern around which it could grow.</p>
            <p>The town found its salvation when the CCC&amp;I Railroad moved its shops to Brightwood. It became
                    the major institution of the suburb, much as the university was in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. And the railroad shops fit the original design of the town, which would remain a
                    manufacturing suburb. The decision to move the shops to the town seems to have been due to two
                    factors: the part men connected with the railroad had played in the early history of the town and
                    the willingness of owners of land in Brightwood to offer inducements to the railroad when the
                    opportunity arose.</p>
            <p>Seven men employed by the Bee Line were among the thirty-seven persons who signed the amended plat in
                    1874. It is not clear why these men became interested in Brightwood. None of them owned shares in
                    the Greenleaf Manufacturing Company. C. C. Gale, division superintendent of the railroad, did own
                    such stock, but he did not sign the plat. Possibly these Bee Line employees bought property in
                    Brightwood after a fire in March, 1874, destroyed the CCC&amp;I shops in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Soon after the fire there were rumors that the railroad would rebuild its facilities
                    in the suburb, and the railroad apparently bought substantial parcels of land there.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> However, it is possible that initially the Bee Line intended merely to build a
                    switching yard in the town because it was located where the CCC&amp;I would junction with the
                    proposed Belt Railroad that was to circumvent the city. For whatever reasons, employees of the Bee
                    Line took an early interest in Brightwood, and their involvement helped to attract the
                    company's shops to the town.</p>

            <p>The move of the shops was not automatic; the company expected the property owners of Brightwood to
                    offer it a sizable portion of land. Most of the owners were excited about the prospect of the shops
                    locating in their town. Mothershead believed that such facilities would cause five hundred mechanics
                    to move to Brightwood, making it a town of two thousand persons very quickly. Referring to the
                    unsuccessful effort to attract Northwestern Christian University to the town, Mothershead argued
                    that the shops would be "worth more than forty universities."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Because not all of the Brightwood owners thought that a donation of land was necessary to
                    induce the Bee Line to move its shops to the suburb, negotiations dragged on until March, 1875, when
                    the railroad accepted a half-mile stretch of land adjacent to its tracks. The land included the
                    buildings of the Greenleaf Manufacturing Company, which the Bee Line converted to its own uses. The
                    CCC&amp;I promised to build other extensive facilities as well.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bee Line proceeded to construct "the best arranged and most substantial railroad yards
                    and machine-shops in the country." The works were completed in March, 1877, and became the
                    economic center of Brightwood.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> In 1880 the town assessed the CCC&amp;I
                    property at $120,000, about one half of the town's total assessed valuation.
                    Mothershead's foundry, a wagon maker, a producer of lightning rods, and a church organ
                    manufacturer also operated in the town in 1880, but they were overshadowed as employers and as
                    taxpayers by the Bee Line.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Although the shops failed to boost the
                    town's population as much as Mothershead had predicted, they provided employment and
                    attracted individuals and investment to Brightwood.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> In addition, the
                    railroad's facilities maintained the character of the town as a suburb for factories and
                    the men who worked in them.</p>

                    subdivided. The average lot remained 80 feet by 170 feet and first sold for $6500. The

            <p>The covenant of Woodruff Place contained three significant provisions. First, Woodruff reserved a
                    two-foot strip of land on the north, east, and south sides for a fence. He planned to enclose the
                    entire eighty acres and mark it off from the city. From the beginning Woodruff wanted his
                    development to be separate, if not independent. Second, the covenant stipulated that the streets and
                    alleys were not "dedicated to public use, but only designated as such for the private use
                    of such persons as may become owners of the several Lots in this Plat." This provision
                    reinforced the exclusionary idea first suggested by the fence. Third, the strip for the fence and
                    the streets and alleys were "to be held as the private property of the owners of the
                    several Lots in the said Woodruff Place, collectively, and [were] to be perpetually held for the use
                    and benefit of the said owners, as streets, alleys, and location for fences, and not
                    otherwise." This requirement bound the property owners into a community, much as the
                    provisions in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> deeds did in that town. Those who purchased lots in Woodruff Place assumed a
                    responsibility to maintain the collectively owned land.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surprisingly, Woodruff included only one other stipulation in his deeds. He prohibited the erection
                    of any fence or other structure within twenty-five feet of the streets, a restriction that would
                    tend to make the area seem more open and more like a park. Apparently Woodruff had confidence that
                    those who built in his suburb would have enough good taste not to erect anything "vicious
                    or offensive." The first residents may have agreed to additional restrictions on building.
                    A newspaper article celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the town reported that there were
                    stringent building rules from the beginning and that the town government specifically prohibited the
                    keeping of cows and chickens.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

            <p>The nature of Woodruff Place solved some problems common to suburban developments while it left
                    others nearly un-solvable. Because only the well-to-do could afford to live in the area and because
                    it was closer to the center of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName> or Brightwood, concern over transportation was limited. Residents probably could afford
                    to own carriages to take them into the city. Education was a more difficult problem because there
                    was no room for schools within Woodruff Place itself. The only available public schools were in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and after incorporation in 1876 the town made arrangements to pay tuition to send
                    children from Woodruff Place to city schools. The suburb also contracted with the city for fire

                    </placeName>, Woodruff Place grew slowly; it had only twenty inhabitants in 1880. As business
                    improved in the 1880s and into the 1890s and the city grew, the population of Woodruff Place
                    increased as well. By 1890 it had grown to 161 persons and ten years later reached 477. Certainly

                    founder's original dream. Woodruff planned that thirty feet in the center of each of the
                    three main avenues would be decorated with statuary, fountains, shade trees, and other
                    ornamentation. In 1873 he purchased a number of statues from a firm in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>; many of the statues were of mythical figures, some of which were partially undraped
                    and caused comment in the city.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> During the 1870s these statues and fountains
                    suffered from neglect and attacks by vandals, and a compromise had to be made on the projected stone
                    fences on the north and south sides of the area.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Nevertheless, in 1900 and
                    long afterward, Woodruff Place boasted of its nine major fountains, stone fence, and numerous
                    statues. The maintenance of the basic design testifies to its appeal. Woodruffs dream had a
                    lavishness and gaudiness typical of the Gilded Age and had an allure in an era in which wealth was
                    celebrated and flaunted. What sustained Woodruff Place through hard times was not a large
                    institution but rather the snobbish desire to evidence one's wealth in physical display.</p>

                    one excludes the eight men whose occupations could not be determined, nearly two thirds of the men
                    were skilled workers. Carpenters formed the largest single group (thirty-three), followed by
                    machinists (eighteen). Thirty-six men were skilled railroad employees—engineers, firemen,
                    conductors, and brakemen. Unskilled workers constituted the next largest category: forty-five of the
                    216 men gave "laborer" as their occupation. It is likely that most of the skilled
                    and unskilled men were employees of the CCC&amp;I. Only three men listed in the census held
                    managerial positions, and all three of them worked for the Bee Line. A grocer, a minister, a
                    physician, a millwright, and a druggist completed the professional and business class of the suburb.
                    Five men held white-collar clerical jobs, while three others were students. Ten were farmers and

                    </placeName> males over sixteen years of age were skilled workers. Five of these men listed
                    themselves also as laborers, suggesting either that they were not yet master craftsmen or that there
                    was not enough work available in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> for them to be craftsmen exclusively. Forty-seven men were unskilled laborers, a
                    surprisingly high number possibly explained by the farms within the town and by the amount of
                    housing and road construction taking place. The biggest difference between the two suburbs was in
                    the number of professionals and businessmen; thirty-eight men in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> fit into this category. Twelve were teachers, while there were four clergymen, four
                    grocers, four lawyers, and four physicians. Ten men held white-collar jobs, most as clerks, and
                    nineteen were students. Thirteen farmers still worked their fields in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> men. The presence of six servants marks the importance of the upper middle class in the
                    suburb. The number of teachers and students emphasizes the role of <placeName>

            <p>The differences among these towns appear again when their ethnic and racial compositions are examined
                    (Table II). Fifty-nine of the 216 men in Brightwood were foreign born while thirty-four others were
                    first-generation Americans, having at least one parent who was born outside of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> only ten men were foreign born and only eight were first generation. In both cases

                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, a German state, Great Britain, or a British colony. The number of Irish and German
                    immigrants in Brightwood helps to explain the appearance of a Catholic mission there in 1881. In

                    </placeName>, all of whom were servants or laborers, equaled the number of foreign-born and
                    first-generation Americans there. Most of the nine blacks in Brightwood worked on farms. Apparently
                    blacks were not welcomed into the shops in Brightwood, while the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>

                    doubled as a servant. These figures are too small to make meaningful comparisons with the other two
                    suburbs. Data from the next available census (1900), although separated from the figures for

                    </placeName> by twenty years, confirm that Woodruff Place developed much as its founder had hoped.
                    Men involved in business constituted the largest proportion of residents in Woodruff Place at the
                    turn of the century. Few men who worked with their hands lived in the suburb. Over 60 percent of the
                    heads of households owned their own houses and over 50 percent of those households employed at least
                    one servant.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> The town did not have as socially distinguished a population as
                    Woodruff might have wished, but it was certainly an upper-middle-class town with strong ties to the
                    business community of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>By 1900, and probably earlier, Woodruff Place had a distinctive character both in the social
                    attributes of its residents and in its physical appearance. Well before 1900 Brightwood and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in their own ways were socially and physically distinctive; one was a working-class
                    industrial town while the other was a middle-class university suburb. In each of the three cases the
                    character of the suburb reflected its founders and their aims. None of the founders was a Utopian
                    thinker; their dreams were mundane and basically materialistic. Nevertheless, the ordinariness of
                    their visions should not obscure the crucial points that in late-nineteenth-century America certain
                    kinds of dreams could be fulfilled and that towns were sometimes the results of conscious decisions.
                    Some communities were purposeful creations of identifiable men who deserve to be recalled if urban
                    growth is to be understood. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Brightwood, and Woodruff Place, which were founded within a narrow time span and
                    limited geographic region, illustrate how varied the backgrounds and purposes of the founders of
                    suburbs could be and how different the towns themselves could become.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

            <p>Finally, the development of these three towns calls into question some generalizations about
                    suburbanization. At least in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> the founding of suburbs did not depend on the invention of the electric streetcar.
                    Unquestionably the trolley made it easier for people to move farther away from the central cities
                    and still commute to work downtown. But other transportation means existing in the 1870s allowed
                    development of the urban periphery before Frank Sprague introduced the trolley in 1888.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The history of Brightwood demonstrates that not all suburbs were for the
                    middle and upper classes. As industry expanded in the late nineteenth century it sometimes moved to
                    the crabgrass frontier, and around it arose working-class suburbs. The spatial relationship between
                    the suburbs and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> indicates that the separation of urban residents into homegeneous economic zones was
                    not a simple linear one. Woodruff Place, the most exclusive of the three suburbs, was closest to
                    downtown <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, not the most distant. However, the annexation of the suburbs to the city corresponded
                    to the economic standing of the suburbanites: Brightwood had the briefest independent history,

            <p>Most theories and models in Chicano history have been based on the experiences of Mexican Americans
                    in the Southwest. Perhaps the most enduring interpretation in this field was set forth in the 1940s
                    by Carey McWilliams, who argued that the annexation of Mexico's northern provinces in 1848
                    reduced the indigenous people of this area to a colonized status. Furthermore, the McWilliams thesis
                    relegated the large number of Mexican immigrants to the <placeName>

                    1920s. Such conditions made native and immigrant workers receptive to the union organizing efforts

                    1918 approximately ninety worked for the Inland Steel Company. During the 1919 strike Inland
                    recruited several hundred Mexicans to replace striking workers, housing and feeding them within the
                    plant gates. After the collapse of the strike many Mexicans continued to work at Inland, although
                    their numbers decreased during the recession of 1921. With recovery, the company embarked upon a
                    large expansion program; at the same time the steel industry's abandonment of the
                    twelve-hour day compounded the need for new workers. Because of the curtailment of European
                    immigration and the satisfactory experience with Mexican labor during and after the strike, Inland
                    made extensive efforts to recruit Mexicans locally employed on railroads and from states as far away

                    solid enclaves. <hi rend="i">Mexicanos</hi> were distinctly concentrated in one area, although they

            <p>Life for the Mexicans who first arrived was grim. Throughout the 1920s the ratio of Mexican men to
                    women was heavily weighted against the <hi rend="i">solos</hi> (single men). Approximately seventy
                    percent of the <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> hired by Inland Steel between 1919 and 1925 were single
                    or had left their wives in Mexico, <placeName>

                    families was compounded by the radical change of environment. The cold winters of the Calumet Region
                    required considerable adjustment for people used to the temperate climate of west central Mexico.
                    Regular Mexican food was not readily available to the early immigrants, and although merchants
                    imported some essentials of the Mexican cuisine, a great deal of improvising was necessary. For
                    example, wheat flour tortillas replaced the familiar maized-based product because American corn was
                    not suitable to prepare this staple. A pleasant surprise was the discovery that <hi rend="i">nopales</hi>, an <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Because of the preponderance of single men and the constant influx of new arrivals the area in which
                    the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> was located took on the atmosphere of a frontier town. Speakeasies and
                    bars in private homes, serving bootleg or home-brewed liquor, sprang up along the west end of Block
                    and <placeName>

                    diversion for single men in the early years of the <hi rend="i">colonia.</hi> Violence was the
                    natural result of such an environment. Fistfights, shootings, and knifings were common occurrences.
                    For the most part violence in the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> was an intra-group phenomenon, often
                    based on feuds which had their origins in Mexico. Immigrants from Michoacan, for example, continued
                    feuds that had begun in remote mountain villages thousands of miles to the south.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were, of course, more socially acceptable diversions. One was the cinema, which in its silent
                    era transcended language barriers. Many <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> patronized the city's
                    several theaters, although they were segregated in some of them. It was also possible to take a
                    train or bus into nearby South <placeName>

                    plants, were rapidly growing. The transportation system facilitated travel along the shore of
                        <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> and allowed for a great deal of interaction between the

            <p>If the social environment provided little direction and few familiar points of reference for Mexican
                    immigrants, their jobs imposed a rigid structure to which they had never been exposed. In Mexico the
                    exploitive <hi rend="i">hacienda</hi> system and agricultural village life had been based on regular
                    and natural rhythms. Each peasant went to work at the same time each day and slept at night.
                    Celebrations and religious festivals provided scant relief from the monotony of the
                    peasant's meager existence, but on these occasions everyone participated as all economic

                    unpleasant tasks became the basis for the reordering of life. Days off might be scattered throughout
                    the week and a man might be scheduled to work any of three shifts in a constantly changing pattern;
                    the familiar time structure based on night and day, Sundays and feast days, became irrelevant. In
                    contrast to the visible structure of authority in Mexico, an impersonal hierarchy of bosses existed,
                    with the Mexican worker's contact restricted to his immediate foreman. Insecurity became a
                    constant element in a worker's life: a pink slip attached to his paycheck might at any time
                    communicate the message that his labor was no longer needed. The patterns of life focused around
                    steel production schedules meant a standard of living and a variety of experiences unknown to the
                    peasant in Mexico; they also brought a radical departure from the security and order of the <hi rend="i">hacienda</hi> where generations of one family had lived, worked, and died.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The contrast was nearly as great for Mexicans who came from urban centers,

            <p>Some of the harsher aspects of life in the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> were mollified by growth and
                    adjustment in the late 1920s. Many of the men sent for their families and others for brides. With
                    families came girls of marriageable age, who, although guarded jealously by their parents, presented
                    potential matches and aroused intense competition. For the first time significant numbers of
                    educated and middle-class Mexicans arrived, partly as a result of the Cristero Counterrevolution
                    centered in Jalisco and Guanajuato. Respectable family men were no longer satisfied with the social
                    and cultural life of the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi>, which had evolved to serve the needs of a
                    society of single men. To meet the need for more sophisticated forms of cultural and social
                    activity, as well as to provide burial insurance and other benefits to members, a number of mutual
                    aid societies developed. By 1929, eleven such Mexican organizations, the most important of <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Obreros Católicos, formed in 1925, became the most prestigious mutual aid society. It
                    concerned itself with maintaining a high degree of Mexican cultural awareness, as well as promoting
                    Catholicism and love for the <hi rend="i">patria</hi> (Mexico). The Obreros organized a fund-raising
                    drive to build a Catholic church to serve the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi>, a necessity in a city where
                    an ethnic group of any considerable size had its separate parish church. The Obreros also attempted

                    From 1925 to 1930 the Obreros published a weekly newspaper, <hi rend="i">El Amigo del Hogar</hi>,
                    devoted to religion, literature, and news of events in Mexico. Indicative of the elite nature of the

                    plays that were still being performed in the Mexican capital. Further indicative of the cultural
                    sophistication of the <hi rend="i">colonia's</hi> elite was an exhibition of original works
                    by artist Alfaro Siquieros at a time when he was achieving international fame. More regularly, the
                    Obreros held poetry readings, cello concerts, and similar events which could compare favorably with

            <p>The activities of other mutual aid societies were directed toward a large segment of the <hi rend="i">colonia.</hi> The Cuauhtémoc, for example, according to a founder, was composed of
                    "rustic illiterates," while the Obreros represented the "cream of
                    society." Events staged by other groups, such as bazaars, dances, and Mexican-style
                    vaudeville, had wide appeal to <hi rend="i">mexicanos.</hi> The organization of baseball teams and
                    the building of a baseball park with night lights provided one of the most popular forms of
                    recreation. During the summer months games attracted as many as three thousand spectators. <hi rend="i">Mexicano</hi> teams achieved a semi-professional status, recruiting players from as far

                    elaborate two-day festival featured parades, dances, carnivals, and the election of a festival

                    elite, their net effect was felt throughout the <hi rend="i">colonia.</hi> By the end of the 1920s a

                    earn as much as thirty-five dollars a week, a vast improvement over the subsistence standard of
                    living prevalent in Mexico. However, even during the prosperous 1920s temporary layoffs were

                    averaged perhaps only thirty dollars a month, living conditions were poor as families crowded into
                    damp basements, shacks behind larger homes, or one-or two-room apartments. Overcrowding was
                    aggravated by the economic necessity of taking in boarders and the need to accommodate recently
                    arrived relatives. Almost 40 percent of East <placeName>

                        them.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Housing for single men was worse than that for families. In some
                    cases two or three men, assigned to different work shifts, shared the same room and bed. In 1926 a
                    social worker found seventy-five Mexican men living in a basement with a ceiling so low one could
                    not stand.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In the same year the city's police chief made a survey of

                    conditions resulted from the inability of housing construction to keep pace with the city's
                    rapid population growth; but in part they were a result of the informal but distinct pattern of
                    residential segregation that prevented Mexicans from renting in most areas in the city. Movement was

            <p>The earnings of Mexican steelworkers also provided the capital and the clientele for a small but
                    growing business community. While a few entrepreneurs had arrived in East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> with enough capital to start small businesses, most Mexican-owned enterprises were
                    financed by savings from employment in the steel industry. By 1928 there were sixty-seven Mexican
                    commercial establishments, mainly restaurants, barber shops, pool halls, and grocery stores. Only a
                    few Mexican-owned businesses were of a type requiring more than a modest outlay of capital; among
                    these were two print shops and two retail stores which dealt in clothing, typewriters, radios, and
                    phonographs. In 1926, a nationalistic appeal was made for Mexicans to invest in a movie house which
                    would exhibit Spanish-language films, and it met with at least moderate success. Generally, however,
                        <hi rend="i">mexicano</hi> businesses were small and served the special needs of the <hi rend="i">colonia.</hi> As late as 1929 only three of the more than one thousand members of the

                    business community reflected the isolation of the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> as a whole from the

            <p>From the outset relations between the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> and the rest of the community were
                    strained. Resentment against Mexicans for their role in the 1919 strike persisted for many years
                    even though most <hi rend="i">mexicano</hi> steel workers had come to East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> some years later. Hostility toward Mexicans did not derive solely from their image as
                    strikebreakers but was compounded by racial and cultural prejudices. Most East Chicagoans viewed the
                        <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> as a source of immorality and crime. The city's leading
                    newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Calumet News</hi>, reflected this view in its reporting; crimes
                    committed by Mexicans were given prominent coverage, often with headlines identifying the ethnicity
                    of the offender, while scant notice was given to the many cultural and social events of the <hi rend="i">colonia.</hi>

            <p>Animosity and prejudice were manifested in other ways: fights between Mexicans and members of other
                    ethnic groups were frequent; some movie houses maintained segregated seating for Mexican patrons;

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    </placeName> because of the city's many undesirable residents, especially Mexicans and
                    blacks. Significantly, the author of the report suggested that city officials work through leaders
                    of the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> to restrict Mexicans to one area of the city, thereby assuaging the
                    fears of other potential residents.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The response of the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> to discrimination and hostility was varied. On one hand
                    the <hi rend="i">colonia's</hi> elites frequently urged <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> to
                    conduct themselves in a way so as to gain social acceptance; on the other hand, even those urging a
                    higher standard of behavior recognized that much of the discrimination was unwarranted and supported
                    efforts to combat unfair treatment. Several times during the 1920s the Comisión
                    Honorífica Mexicana, supported by other mutual aid societies, organized boycotts of
                    theaters practicing segregation. To deal with problems with the police the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi>
                    solicited the aid of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Mexican consul, who discussed complaints of illegal searches with the chief
                    of police and arranged for a mass meeting between <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> and police officials.
                    Despite these efforts segregated seating continued until the late 1930s, and relations between the
                        <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> and the police remained hostile.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>If the Mexican experience during the 1920s reflected, in a limited way, the prosperity of the era,
                    life during the early 1930s reflected the Great Depression in its fullest severity. Between 1930 and
                    1932 steel production declined from approximately 90 percent of capacity to 15 percent nationally.
                    While no one was untouched by the resulting unemployment, <hi rend="i">mexicano</hi> steelworkers
                    were disproportionately effected. The economic gains of the 1920s were quickly wiped out. At least

                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                    </placeName> Mission, affiliated with Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. Many families combined
                    households and pooled meager resources. Such expedients, along with private and public relief,
                    allowed for a bare subsistence level of existence. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                    </placeName> Mission, for example, regularly fed several hundred Mexican families from food donated
                    by supermarkets; in most cases this was food that could not be sold, like stale bread and over-ripe
                    bananas. The necessity of using whatever food was available compelled Mexican families to survive on
                    such unfamiliar and often unpalatable fare as pumpernickel bread and canned clam chowder. On one
                    occasion the mission distributed several hundred pairs of high-heeled women's shoes that
                    had <pb n="346" id="VAA4025-077-4-048"/> been stored in a warehouse some twenty-five years. Women
                    eagerly accepted the unfashionable shoes, while young boys who wore them from necessity were more
                        reluctant.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Economic hardship also forced a severe curtailment of organized
                    cultural and social activities. Of the eleven mutual aid societies active in the 1920s only the
                    Cuauhtémoc and the Benito Juárez survived the early years of the Depression,
                    and these were dormant until after 1933. The elaborate Mexican Independence Day celebrations of the
                    1920s gave way to modest banquets and dances during the Depression, and sophisticated cultural
                    events such as the presentations of the Cuadro Dramático ceased.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Depression not only weakened the economic and social fabric of the Mexican community but also
                    precipitated a mass exodus which reduced the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> to half its pre-1930 size.
                    Depression-related Mexican repatriation began as a voluntary movement of individuals and families
                    returning to Mexico at their own expense. The initial involvement of local social agencies was on a
                    humanitarian and voluntary basis. Mexicans desiring to return to Mexico but unable to afford the
                    move were often provided with railway tickets by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                    </placeName> Mission, the Emergency Relief Association, or other agencies. At times relief
                    organizations helped avert family tragedies by arranging transportation for the families of Mexicans
                    being deported as illegal aliens. Those returning to Mexico at their own expense were far more
                    numerous than those helped to relocate by social agencies. It was not until 1932, when the
                    Depression was at its worst, that repatriation ceased to be completely voluntary and became
                    primarily a program financed by local government and involving an element of coercion.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Depression deepened, the existing hostility toward Mexicans was reinforced by a growing belief
                    that aliens were contributing to the severity of the economic crisis, either because they were on
                    relief rolls or because they displaced citizens <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Anti-alien and anti-Mexican sentiment was given concrete expression when a coalition of relief

                    </placeName> American Legion Post played a leading role in the movement for repatriation, working
                    closely with the North Township trustee's office and the Emergency Relief Association of
                    the Community Chest. The basic rationale of the organizers of repatriation was similar to that
                    expressed in cities such as <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
               </placeName>, and Gary. Unemployed Mexicans, they felt, were
                    a tremendous burden on public and private relief agencies, while those still employed indirectly
                    harmed the rest of the community by depriving citizens of jobs. As one of the leaders of the
                    repatriation effort put it, "the most effective plan of relief for this community would be
                    the removal of the nationalists [sic], especially the Mexicans."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>In September, 1931, the American Legion announced a program to combat the Depression which included
                    the repatriation of indigent aliens. The North Township trustee pledged cooperation if needed funds
                    could be secured. In a lengthy letter to William Doak, who as secretary of labor had overall control
                    of federal immigration and deportation policy, a Legion official detailed the case for repatriation.
                    High unemployment had strained relief resources to the breaking point, he wrote, but the situation
                    could be alleviated by removal of the city's Mexicans: "Here is our
                    problem—to rid this community of Mexicans…. By them leaving, our unemployment
                    problem here in this city, and in fact of almost the entire <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName> would be solved." Secretary Doak, himself an advocate of alien repatriation as
                    a means of combatting the Depression, expressed interest in the plan, but a labor department survey

                    "Repatriation Committee" now began compiling lists of repatriates. While many <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> were eager to return to Mexico, coercion was involved. As in other
                    American cities relief authorities made it easier to accept repatriation than to obtain assistance.
                    While the township trustee continued to aid many Mexican families, help was given grudgingly; at
                    times, according to a Catholic missionary active in aiding Mexicans, relief officials made
                    applicants "feel like something slimy." On other occasions relief was denied to
                    those refusing repatriation. Whatever the relative importance of coercion and voluntary
                    repatriation, by the end of May, 1932, the Repatriation Committee had compiled a large list of
                    returnees, which it submitted to the Mexican consul in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

            <p>The mass exodus of the early 1930s wrought profound changes in the demographic composition of the

                    measured by a comparison of population characteristics in 1930 and 1940. In 1930 there were
                    approximately seventy-six Mexican men in East <placeName>

                    </placeName>. By 1940 this imbalance was far less severe. The ratio of adult Mexican males to
                    females was approximately fifty-eight to forty-two, and fully half the men had wives. Further
                    indicative of the change is a higher proportion of children in the Mexican population in 1940.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> By the end of the decade social stability was more characteristic of the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> than in its earlier stages of development.

            <p>The new socialization patterns for youth that developed in the 1930s represented a further departure
                    from Mexican traditions and norms than had been the case during the 1920s. The decline of Mexican
                    cultural events and the increasing isolation of the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> from direct contact
                    with Mexico strengthened the influence of American institutions and cultural values. In contrast to
                    the 1920s, by 1940 a large proportion of Mexican students were completing high school and
                    participating in extracurricular activities such as sports. New Deal programs were likewise
                    important in exposing young <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> to the larger society. Many Mexican youths

                            Mexicans, wherever born, as a separate race; use of the 1940 census to obtain detailed
                            figures was impossible because Mexicans were classified as Caucasians. Consequently, figures
                            for 1940 are based on the city directory for that year. The 1940 directory indicates that
                            880 Spanish-surnamed male heads of household were married, while 65 male heads of household
                            were single. At the same time, this contrasts radically with the 1930 census, which showed a

                    the Civilian Conservation Corps. The cultural change that took place is exemplified by the gradual
                    shift in the musical tastes of many young Mexicans. During the 1920s dances featured Mexican-style
                    orchestra music; by the late 1930s <hi rend="i">mexicano</hi> bands were playing the popular swing

                    for example, aided many East Chicagoans but had little effect on Mexicans because few were
                    homeowners. The various WPA projects, which provided employment for about four hundred of the
                    city's jobless during most of the Depression, were of less benefit to Mexicans than to most
                    other groups. During the early years of the WPA some two dozen <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> were
                    employed, but increasing congressional restrictions on the employment of non-citizens after 1936
                    made it difficult for Mexicans to obtain WPA jobs. At the same time improved conditions in the steel
                    industry, especially after 1938, brought the reemployment of much of the working-age <hi rend="i">mexicano</hi> population. By 1940, only six of 381 WPA employees were <hi rend="i">mexicanos.</hi>

                    Mexicans would not be hired in this capacity. In addition to reducing some of the barriers to
                    advancement in the steel industry, the union movement provided other opportunities for broader
                    participation in American life. By the early 1940s Mexican steel-workers were serving as shop
                    stewards and standing as candidates for local union posts.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>Increased participation by Mexicans in community life did not imply a process of assimilation
                    involving the complete abandonment of traditional culture and values. Rather, <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi>, like other ethnic groups, gradually became involved in the affairs of the larger
                    society while retaining a strong sense of group identity and cohesion. Participation in institutions
                    of the whole community such as unions, schools, or political parties did not preclude the
                    maintenance of wholly Mexican organizations. Thus, with partial recovery from the Depression by the
                    late 1930s mutual aid societies again became important in the life of the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi>,
                    and there was a renaissance of cultural activities such as Mexican holiday celebrations. By 1940
                    there was renewed importation of music from Mexico, although American swing music continued to be an
                    important influence, especially among youth. Mexicans, like other ethnic groups, continued to
                    maintain separate Catholic and Baptist churches.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

                    been relatively isolated from the rest of the community, became active in such war-related projects
                    as bond sales drives, patriotic celebrations, Red Cross campaigns, and civil defense.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Like many of the ethnic clubs in East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mexican societies frequently issued statements stressing the importance of their group
                    to the war effort. Such statements became a regular ritual for most of the city's ethnic
                    associations, serving to assert group solidarity while at the same time affirming loyalty to the war
                    effort. In April, 1942, for example, the president of the Sociedad Cuauhtémoc took note
                    of the many <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> in the military and pledged his organization to purchase
                    $10,000 worth of defense bonds.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The war also brought changes in the
                    status of Mexican women, many of whom joined the military or labored in the steel mills.

                    war. Perhaps the accelerated pace of social change was most noticeable among those <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> who served in the armed forces. Many returning veterans began to question the
                    subordinate role to which Mexicans had been relegated and asserted themselves in community life by
                    becoming active in politics or preparing for professional occupations in education, law, or
                        medicine.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>Prejudice and discrimination remained a problem for the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi>, although by the

                    more balanced way, giving their attention to cultural, religious, and social events. The

                    grudging respect of the rest of the community. In 1944, the American Legion post that twelve years
                    earlier had promoted the nativist repatriation campaign organized a homecoming celebration for a <hi rend="i">mexicano</hi> Marine sergeant who had won several decorations for service in the

                    <hi rend="i">colonia mexicana</hi> contains several elements that appear to be generally applicable
                    to other midwestern cities. The original <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> can be traced to what Feliciano
                    Rivera and Matt Meier have termed the second wave of Mexican immigration to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, commencing with the Mexican Revolution and ending with the Great Depression. Social
                    and economic disorder in West Central Mexico arising out of the militant phases of the revolution
                    prompted a mass exodus northward. At the same time a growing demand for transportation and
                    industrial labor created employment opportunities which attracted these uprooted people. By the
                    early 1920s a geographically concentrated Mexican community had formed in East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as in a number of midwestern industrial cities. During the prosperous 1920s the <hi rend="i">colonia</hi> attracted many new Mexican immigrants, predominantly single men, from a
                    variety of social classes. The <hi rend="i">colonia</hi>, although politically and economically
                    weak, met the social and cultural needs of its inhabitants by providing Mexican-oriented
                    institutions to a population who perceived themselves as Mexican citizens temporarily living in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s <hi rend="i">colonia.</hi> Economic disruption, the end of immigration, and
                    repatriation severed the close attachment to Mexico. The Mexican population stabilized and
                    contracted as the most transient elements returned to Mexico. New socialization patterns emerged for
                    young people as the lack of new immigrants and economic hardship curtailed reinforcements of
                    traditional culture and values. New Deal programs and industrial labor organizations increased the
                    involvement of <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> with the larger society. By the end of the decade a
                    greater number of Mexican children were completing high school, the beginnings of political
                    participation were evident, and for the first time significant numbers of Mexican immigrants were
                    being naturalized. World War II intensified this process; many young <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi>
                    served in the military, while at home the war effort further involved the Mexican community with the

                    groups to this industrial center. By the end of World War II <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi>, like other
                    ethnic groups before them, participated in most aspects of East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> life. Also like earlier immigrant groups, they participated in the larger society
                    without giving up their identity or their culture. The comparison between Mexicans and other
                    immigrants, however, cannot be carried too far. For example, <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> faced a
                    form of racial discrimination to which many European immigrants were not subjected. Nor did most
                    other immigrant groups undergo an experience like the massive repatriation of the early Depression
                    years. In these respects, then, the experience of Mexican immigrants to the Midwest resembled that
                    of Mexican immigrants in the southwestern <placeName>

                    peoples in the Midwest. The experience of <hi rend="i">mexicanos</hi> between 1919 and 1945,
                    however, provided the framework within which these later communities would develop.</p>

            <p>When Republicans gathered in their national conventions in the early twentieth century and thoughts
                    turned to the vice-presidency, the name of Senator Charles <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> Fairbanks of Indiana came readily to mind. In 1904 he was Theodore Roosevelt's
                    running mate, and he spent the years 1905 to 1909 in the relative obscurity that the
                    president's energy marked out for the vice-president. When Charles Evans Hughes of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> was nominated to run against Woodrow Wilson in 1916, Fairbanks was once again selected
                    to balance the GOP ticket. Though not a candidate for the place, he "felt it my duty to
                    accept" when the second nomination came to him, although this time the Republican ticket
                    did not win.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fairbanks had a chance at the vice-presidency even earlier. In 1900 he was mentioned as a possible
                    nominee with President William McKinley and could have received the president's endorsement
                    had he expressed interest. Fairbanks pondered the matter, as he later recalled, and may have desired
                    the place. The circumstances that thrust Theodore Roosevelt into the vice-presidency in 1900,
                    however, were too powerful for anyone to overcome, and when McKinley died from the effects of an
                    assassin's bullet on September 14, 1901, it was Roosevelt who succeeded him in the White
                    House.</p>

                    convention that so affected the subsequent history of the GOP, and it is clearly the source of some
                    of the enduring anecdotes about Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
            <p>The vice-presidency became an immediate concern for McKinley in November, 1899, when the incumbent,
                    Garret A. Hobart of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, died after a long illness. Speculation immediately focused on the governor of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Theodore Roosevelt, whose youth, popularity, and geographical base made him seem an
                    ideal complement to the president. While friends such as Henry Cabot Lodge of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and Senator William E. Chandler of <placeName>

                    </placeName> advised him to be receptive, Roosevelt saw the post as a dead end that would block his
                    path to the White House. In February, 1900, he even went so far as to issue what appeared to be an
                    unequivocal public refusal. "<hi rend="i">Under no circumstances</hi>," he said,
                    "could I or would I accept the nomination for the Vice-presidency."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A number of forces worked to move Roosevelt away from this outright negative. By the spring of 1900
                    he could not bring himself to say that he would refuse the vice-presidency if it were offered to
                    him. As long as he made no Sherman-like statement, his backers continued to hope and to prod. In <placeName>

                    corporate contributors upset at Roosevelt's attempts to tax business franchises and to
                    develop a state program on the antitrust question. These industrial constituents told Platt
                    "that they would not contribute a dollar to the republican campaign fund if Roosevelt is
                    nominated for Governor."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Platt helped to keep Roosevelt's

            <p>President McKinley could not in this same period find a plausible alternative to the New Yorker. He
                    thought first of Elihu Root, his secretary of war, but decided that the cabinet officer, who had

                    there was public speculation about Secretary of the Navy John D. Long, Seth Low, Andrew D. White,
                    William Boyd Allison, and Jonathan P. Dolliver as possible nominees. None of these men could match
                    the popularity and charisma of Roosevelt. As Lodge wrote in late April, "I think the Vice

            <p>Apprehensive about Roosevelt's impetuous nature and his political reliability, the president
                    scanned the GOP leadership for another possible running mate. In such a canvass it was natural that
                    Fairbanks's name would come up. He had been a <placeName>

                    </placeName> senator for only three years but was recognized as someone very close to the president
                    both politically and personally. Fairbanks was just forty-eight on the eve of the convention. A

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, he had settled in Indiana as a young lawyer; his practice and political career
                    prospered simultaneously. In 1896 he was the keynote speaker when the Republicans nominated McKinley
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Within Indiana he used his personal fortune and control of such key newspapers as the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> to construct a political organization which made him the state's
                    leading Republican. In 1898 and 1899 he had been chairman of the Anglo-American Joint High
                    Commission, a body which dealt with such vexing problems as the Alaska boundary question. On paper
                    he would have added strength to the ticket.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Fairbanks was not an outstanding national leader, however, and those in the upper echelons of the GOP
                    knew it. To some extent it was his aloof public demeanor that limited his popularity. As Mrs. James
                    L. Slayden, the wife of a Democratic congressman, put it, "Mr. Fairbanks seems an
                    icicle." An obvious ambition for the White House put others off. Fairbanks was also very

                    the great national contest, and it was generally regarded as a foregone conclusion that he would be
                    re-elected.</p>
            <p>The only question open for debate was who should be the Vice Presidential nominee. It seemed to be
                    taken for granted that he should be some one entirely acceptable to the President. But no one seemed
                    to know his preference, if he had one. One name and then another was proposed in the general
                    discussion, but there was no agreement as to the nominee. Suggestions were made to him from time to
                    time, but he seemed to have maintained the attitude of a listener. It was understood, however, that
                    Cornelius N. Bliss<hi rend="sup">9</hi> of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, who had ably served as Secretary of the Interior, would be an agreeable associate. Mr.
                    Bliss was properly located to balance the ticket and was politically in perfect accord with his
                    former chief. When he was approached upon the subject by Senator Hanna<hi rend="sup">10</hi> he
                    declined to entertain it, particularly on account of the health of Mrs. Bliss, to whom <placeName>

            <p>Some weeks before the convention when I called to see the President upon some public business he said

            <p>Soon after the morning hour in the Senate, Senator Davis, who occupied a seat not far from me, came
                    to my desk to ask some question, whereupon I said to him: "Senator, that was very nice of
                    you." "What?" he asked with some little surprise, as I had not
                    particularized. "What you said to the President this morning," I replied.
                    "About you? About the Vice Presidency?" he inquired. "Yes," I
                    answered. "Did he tell you about it?" he asked. I nodded assent and he continued:
                    "I told him that because it is the way I feel. I think it is what the party should do and I
                    frankly told the President so; but I had no thought that it would reach your ears."
                    "Well," I said, "I have found you out." And that ended the
                    incident.</p>

                    formal declaration of party principles was quite unnecessary. Usage rather than necessity compelled
                    a declaration of policies. Upon arriving at the White House I found the President in the upper rear
                    family hall and alone, engaged with his cigar and reading the evening paper, possibly the gossip

                    while he and the Secretary engaged in conversation. I turned away that I might not overhear what was
                    said. They were not long engaged, and when the Secretary retired the President said: "The
                    Secretary wants to be nominated for Vice President," and intimated that this was
                    impracticable, though he did not say so in so many words. He then said after a few moments:
                    "Senator, they may turn to you at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>." I was somewhat at a loss to know what reply to make. In a moment I said:
                    "I thank you, Mr. President, for your confidence and kindness. As you of course know, I
                    desire to serve you whenever and wherever I can. But I do not know that what you suggest is the
                    best." Nothing further was said upon the subject. The President expressed himself as
                    believing that the convention would be a notable one. He seemed to be pleased that there was to be
                    no contest over the ticket or platform, and that there was such widespread interest being taken in
                    it. The prospect of a large and enthusiastic convention, he thought, was a good sign for the future
                    of the Republican party; and he felt that such a convention would give strength to the
                    administration. He made no comment whatever upon himself as the central figure of the historic
                    event; his whole thought seemed to be centered upon the party which had honored him and the country
                    he was serving with all of his ability and power. I assured him that I would endeavor to see that
                    the platform was in harmony with his policies and administration. I congratulated him in advance
                    upon his assured nomination and election, and with his hearty thanks and good wishes I retired,
                    leaving him alone.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                    preferment which some of my friends already had in mind; others did not think so, but felt that if I

                    States strongly urged me to be a candidate, some upon the distinct ground that with a friend in the
                    White House it would naturally put me in line for the succession, while others maintained that I
                    should accept so that the President would be assured of a Vice President in thorough accord with his
                    policies and in entire personal harmony with him.</p>
            <p>A notable banquet was given Senator Hanna and many others who were delegates to the convention by
                    some of the prominant [sic] citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the Union League Club two or three nights before the assembling of the convention. I
                    was among the number upon the favored list. The subject of the Vice Presidency was frequently
                    suggested about the table and informal remarks by several speakers pointedly asserted that I should
                    be nominated; in fact this seemed to be the only matter still unsettled. I took it all
                    good-naturedly but made no response other than to shake my head. I was embarrassed and scarcely knew
                    how to handle myself, under the circumstances. I did not wish to seem to be either obdurate or
                    covetous of something which my better jusgment [judgment] did not entirely approve. No one
                    appreciated the great honor more highly than I. I was naturally flattered by the mention of my name
                    for it [came?] from so many influential sources and with such obvious heartiness. My duty to my
                    party in Indiana was something which I could not lightly disregard; and the un-wisdom as it then
                    seemed to me of nominating some one so near to the home of the President weighed heavily with me. My
                    personal inclination was toward the nomination -I regarded it a high honor -but my deliberate, sober
                    sense of duty was against it. My personal friends understood full well how I regarded the matter.</p>
            <p>The platform engaged the larger part of my attention. I was very anxious that no false note should be
                    struck and that it should be worthy of the occasion. There were several drafts of specific
                    resolutions and two or three complete platforms had been prepared for consideration. Although I was
                    busily engaged upon the platform, I was not beyond the reach of the Vice Presidential gossip.
                    Delegates from other states were pursuing me, urging me to stand for the nomination. There was a
                    very strong and decided opposition to the nomination of Governor Roosevelt of <placeName>

                    candidate and that he would not accept a nomination if it were tendered. When it was reported to <placeName>

                    accept a nomination if tendered, he dryly observed: "Is the Governor wearing a rough rider
                    hat?" And upon being assured that he was, added: "That's an acceptance
                    hat."</p>

                    co-worker, Senator Platt, but more especially to embarrass and defeat if possible the wishes of
                    Senator Hanna, who had opposed his being seated in the Senate of the <placeName>

                    introduction of a plank which would lead to sharp division. The election of President McKinley was
                    already assured and I thought and many others agreed that we should not project into the campaign an
                    issue which would awaken sharp controversy in our own ranks.</p>
            <p>I knew that the Senator was strongly in favor of a ship subsidy declaration. He had given the
                    subject, as he gave to all questions of public moment, very thorough consideration; and I wished to
                    advise him of the drift of sentiment and to get his consent if possible to the omission of any
                    specific pledge in behalf of a subsidy. As soon as I reached his rooms I found a great crowd waiting
                    to see him. I was immediately invited to enter by his private secretary, Elmer <placeName>

                    capacity. Senator Hanna met me and we stepped to an open window where he said: "We have met
                    to consider the selection of a nominee for Vice President, and we have just decided upon you and we
                    urge you to accept." I judged from the number assembled that the various States were
                        represented.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> He then proceeded to say that Governor Roosevelt wanted the
                    nomination but "we do not want him to have it. I have just come from a conference with him;

                    At last I got hold of him and said: "Teddy, I think you owe something to President
                    McKinley, and that you should consider his wishes. Under the circumstances I feel that I have a
                    right to talk to you and talk to you plainly." Governor Roosevelt replied that he was under
                    obligations to Mr. McKinley and that the Senator could frankly talk to him. Said he:
                    "Senator, I am not a candidate for Vice President, and I don't want the
                    nomination. What I want is to be Governor of <placeName>

                    nomination?" The Governor replied that he had told them that they must not do so, and
                    reiterated his opposition to the nomination. "Then you are not a candidate?"
                    inquired Senator Hanna; "No," said Governor Roosevelt, "I am
                    not." "Then you will not be a candidate will you?" "No; I will

                    it is unnecessary that I should be. I have reflected upon the matter since my name has been

            <p>Hanna's effort to stop Roosevelt's nomination failed. On Sunday evening, June 17,
                    President McKinley refused to assist Hanna; over the phone he told the senator that "The
                    choice of the convention will be his choice; he has no advice to give." The next day
                    Roosevelt issued a statement of withdrawal, but it left open the possibility that he would accept.
                    Once again, on June 19, McKinley backed away from an anti-Roosevelt posture. "The
                    Administration wants the choice of the convention." That choice came on June 21 when
                    Roosevelt was nominated.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>Could Fairbanks have been named in the face of the pro-Roosevelt tide at the convention? Had the
                    administration and the president pushed him earlier in the spring, he could have developed some
                    strength. It is unlikely, however, that the colorless Indiana politician would have been as
                    attractive as the charismatic Roosevelt. Fairbanks's own caution and indecision settled the
                    matter. Four years later he would be the vice-presidential candidate of the GOP, but he never came
                    close to the presidency again.</p>

            <p>The ability of Hoosiers to incorporate contradictory elements into a distinctive regional culture has
                    long fascinated observers. At least since Meredith Nicholson's turn-of-the-century study,
                        <hi rend="i">The Hoosiers</hi>, every generation has attempted to place Indiana in its proper
                    contexts. Traditionally, most of these attempts have been literary in character. But recently we
                    have enjoyed a number of fresh insights made possible through the use of non-traditional methods and
                    new sources. Together they have contributed substantially to the current revival of interest in
                    American regionalism.</p>
            <p>The Hoover-Rodman volume is an intriguing example of many of the possibilities and some of the
                    problems inherent in one of these approaches, the use of the visual record. With over nine hundred
                    illustrations it attempts to capture the elusive spirit of the nineteenth state from prehistory to
                    the present. Drawing primarily upon a dozen major library and archival collections, while adding a
                    few elements from smaller private holdings, the book explores the range of Indiana's
                    pictorial record.</p>
            <p>Compelling individual illustrations abound. A group portrait of pottery workers at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cannelton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where bearded patriarchs mingle with bemused apprentices, speaks eloquently of the
                    transition in lifestyles. Photos of the 1940 and 1953 Indiana University basketball teams say more
                    than many words about the comparative impact of depression and prosperity upon youth. And stark
                    vistas of farms and crossroads allow the isolation of an earlier rural world to emerge forcefully.</p>
            <p>The dust jacket blurb presents the volume as a "family portrait," and the
                    illustrations indeed show a preference for group scenes illustrating all manner of work and play.
                    Some examples of Indiana art supplement the early chapters, and a few cartoons are interspersed
                    throughout. But this is primarily a photographic record. Perhaps for budget reasons, almost all of
                    the illustrations are in black and white: that is a bit of a disappointment, especially given the
                    promise held forth by the frontispiece, a color reproduction of Theodore Groll's famous <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> street scene. Reproduction quality is high, although in half a dozen places the
                    battered condition of an original is reflected in its copy.</p>
            <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-077-4-076"/>
            <p>Hoover complements the illustrations with a narrative text strong in economic and social commentary.
                    Some readers will quarrel with his definition (p. 64) of a Hoosier as a "rough
                    countryman," but most will enjoy his remarkable powers of description and compression.
                    Compression implies selection, and selectivity here is quite good. The most remarkable omission in
                    the text is the history of the visual record itself. By their skill, artists and photographers
                    shaped this pictorial imagery in both conscious and unconscious ways. It would be fascinating to
                    learn more of these people so that we might know how their visions of Hoosiers and the Hoosier
                    experience helped to shape our own. Knowing more of them might also help explain the curious lack of
                    portraits of women, immigrants, and minorities in several chapters.</p>
            <p>Hoover's best chapters, as well as the book's greatest emphasis, lie in the years
                    between 1880 and 1925. There, as the state moves from an agrarian to an industrial base, the author
                    offers an excellent definition of the changing sense of "place" within Indiana.
                    Surveys of this type are notoriously prone to minor errors, but (apart from advancing Charlie
                    Halleck's first congressional victory from 1935 to 1932) this book is remarkably free of
                    them. Hoover and Rodman, in short, offer an absorbing introduction to a lively topic, encouraging us
                    to reinterpret our past by viewing it once more.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $17.95.)</head>
            <p>Lew Wallace, one of the most fascinating Hoosiers, has been in need of an objective, scholarly
                    biography for a long time. The only reliable work on Wallace was Irving McKee's short,
                    undocumented biography, published in 1947. Wallace's autobiography was less than half
                    complete when he died, and his wife Susan chronicled the remaining forty-five years of his life in
                    200 pages. As with most autobiographies, Wallace's, although informative and entertaining,
                    is self-serving—an important consideration when studying the man's life.</p>
            <p>Robert Morsberger and Katharine Morsberger have attempted and for the most part succeeded in
                    producing a definitive one-volume biography of this man who played an important role in American
                    military, literary, political, diplomatic, and religious history. It is unfortunate that this book
                    cannot be given unqualified praise; however, it has some serious weaknesses. The most disturbing is
                    its lack of adequate documentation. Although the bibliography is impressive, the end notes are much
                    less so. In the first eleven chapters the authors rely exclusively on Wallace's
                    autobiography in more than half of their notes. Also, the authors depended almost entirely for their
                    primary source material on the Lew Wallace letters in the Wallace Collection of the Indiana
                    Historical Society Library. Although this is a fine collection whose use is greatly <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-077-4-078"/> simplified by an exhaustive calendar, it, like the autobiography, is
                    one-sided, and events are seen only through Wallace's eyes. The danger of overuse of such
                    sources is obvious. A flagrant example concerns the battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> in April, 1862. The authors use the autobiography to substantiate Wallace's
                    forty-year claim that he was the scapegoat for U.S. Grant's failure. The episode is by no
                    means as free of debate as the Morsbergers, with their limited source material, imply. Knowing how <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> haunted Wallace until the end of his life, they should have been more cautious in
                    accepting his views on the subject.</p>
            <p>Despite these criticisms, the book has strong points. It is well organized and very readable.
                    Although the work is arranged topically, one has little trouble following Wallace's myriad
                    and often overlapping activities. When dealing with his governorship of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="xxx">New Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>, for example, the authors manage to treat Wallace's writing of <hi rend="i">Ben Hur</hi>, a large portion of which was done in Sante Fe, without letting that topic
                    interfere with discussion of his territorial rule. <hi rend="i">Ben Hur</hi> is saved for the next
                    chapter, where the emphasis shifts from the military and politics to literature. In addition, the
                    authors give excellent critical analyses of Wallace's writings. Finally, although the book
                    is inadequately documented, a check of the sources shows it to be substantially correct in fact and
                    interpretation. In short, this biography, flawed as it is, is an improvement on McKee and more
                    reliable than Wallace's autobiography.</p>

            <p>The first half of Lee Norvelle's autobiography tells the remarkable story of a northern <placeName>

                    home helping his parents farm—and with considerable effort and much help from a number of
                    teachers at Asbury College, Taylor University, and Indiana University (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>), finished his B.A. degree in psychology ten years later. Today's reader must
                    marvel at Norvelle's persistence and willingness to work at a variety of hard jobs in those
                    harder times in order to get the education he sought as a foundation for teaching speech, coaching
                    debate, and producing theater.</p>
            <pb n="377" id="VAA4025-077-4-079"/>
            <p>The second half of the book is devoted primarily to Norvelle's struggle to establish theater
                    as a legitimate academic field at Indiana University, which now is the home of one of the
                    country's finest university theater programs, largely because of Norvelle's
                    persistence as he fought conservative administrators each step along the way.</p>
            <p>This part of Norvelle's story is disappointing, though. We get too much detail about petty
                    bureaucratic squabbles, too many amusing little anecdotes; nowhere are the author's views
                    on theater discussed. For forty years Norvelle was a pioneer in American educational theater. But
                    readers look in vain in this memoir for his views on his life's work, his field, his
                    causes. Why was he so dedicated to university theater? What sorts of theater did he especially love?
                    What did he learn about directing and teaching that he might have passed along to us?</p>
            <p>And his publisher should hire an editor; nearly every page contains an ungrammatical construction, a
                    misspelling, a punctuation error, or a typo.</p>

            <p>Charles B. Hosmer, Jr., states modestly in his introduction to <hi rend="i">Preservation Comes of
                    Age</hi> that in this work "there has been an attempt to touch much more than the surface
                    of the story" (p. 8). There can be little doubt of his success in "getting beneath
                    the surface" in chronicling the historic preservation movement during its adolescent years.
                    In this immense opus, which required over fifteen years of research, Hosmer provides a satisfying
                    account of nearly all of preservation's many facets during the second quarter of the
                    twentieth century.</p>
            <p>The book begins with John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s reconstruction of Colonial <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, probably the period's single most influential private preservation project,
                    and then describes other towns and villages "assembled" by philanthropists
                    interested in history: Henry Ford's <placeName>

                    </placeName>. At the <pb n="378" id="VAA4025-077-4-080"/> regional level, the author describes the
                    principal preservation organization during the period, the Society for the Preservation of New <placeName>

                    </placeName> serve as examples of early state leadership in preserving historic sites.</p>
            <p>Hosmer next concentrates on the involvement of the federal government (specifically the National Park
                    Service of the Department of the Interior) in historic preservation. The second volume concludes
                    with chapters on the evolution of professionalism in the preservation movement, differing schools of
                    restoration philosophy, and modifications in preservation theory during the period discussed.</p>
            <p>Beyond its obvious character as a compendium of case histories on historic preservation, <hi rend="i">Preservation Comes of Age</hi> makes other important contributions as a history of the period
                    from the 1920s to the 1940s. For instance, in using a particular organization as an example of
                    preservation practice, Hosmer sometimes furnishes the only published historical account of the
                    organization and its endeavors.</p>
            <p>In every chapter the author presents vivid biographical portraits of some especially influential
                    figures in the movement, including W.A.R. Goodwin and Kenneth Chorley of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>; Horace M. Albright, Ronald F. Lee, Charles E. Peterson, and Newton B. Drury of the
                    National Park Service; William Sumner Appleton of the SPNEA; Fiske Kimball of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Museum; and Colonel Richard Lieber, father of the Indiana state park system.</p>
            <p>Hosmer reveals Lieber as an influential figure nationally in historic preservation councils. The
                    former <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    Corydon statehouse. In the late 1930s, Lieber served on the National Park Service's
                    Advisory Board. There he exhibited a radical philosophy of preservation by opposing reconstruction
                    of historic buildings and conjectural restorations—two philosophical positions that have
                    since become established tenets of National Park Service policy.</p>
            <p>Historians may find of interest Hosmer's skillful use of taped interviews as a major primary
                    source for the book. Although he utilizes a large number of documentary sources, the author fills in
                    gaps in written information by drawing on eighty-five interviews. Document and interview are nimbly
                    interwoven throughout the text. Quotations from interviews add <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-077-4-081"/>
                    an appreciated element of authoritative commentary to the events being described.</p>
            <p>Hosmer's primary audience will surely be the preservationists of the country. They will
                    enjoy the multitude of case histories depicting preservation battles of the era, the
                    author's heavy emphasis on individual champions of preservation who influenced events, and
                    the generous use of contemporary photographs illustrating the text. Within the preservation
                    community, the book should have special appeal to preservation educators and their students. Too
                    long has the field of historic preservation lacked a textbook on its twentieth-century origins. <hi rend="i">Preservation Comes of Age</hi> has supplied that need bountifully.</p>

            <p>The subject of this study, Joseph Nicolas Nicollet (1786–1843), cartographer, explorer,

                    with that of Jean Nicolet (1598–1642), a French explorer of North America. However, with
                    the publication of Martha Coleman Bray's well-written and thoroughly researched volume on
                    Nicollet and his work, he has been rescued from this obscurity, his achievements have been
                    reemphasized, and, for the first time, his "Map of the Hydrographical Basin of the Upper

                    reader.</p>
            <p>Born in Cluses, Department of Savoy, <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, Nicollet was the son of a watch-finisher of modest means. He received training in
                    mathematics, but he achieved fame and received awards for his work in astronomy. From 1817 to 1830
                    he was secretary of the <placeName>

            <p>A few minor errors were detected in Bray's book. In the sentence "…
                    William Herschel of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the son of the famous John …" (p. 20) the names should be
                    reversed. Also, there is no page citation to William Herschel in the index and no reference to page
                    20 in the index for John Herschel. On page 26 Pierre Simon de Laplace's time of death is
                    incorrectly given as 1825, but on page 37 it is correctly stated as 1827. On page 50 Ferdinand R.
                    Hassler's first name is incorrectly given as "Frederick," and in the
                    index his last name is listed as "Hessler."</p>
            <p>The index is adequate, but more subject entries and subentries would have made it more complete and
                    useful. The illustrations are well chosen and enhance the textual matter, but some of them, such as
                    on pages 66, 150–51, and 182, might have been expanded and placed vertically on the page
                    to bring out more detail. The failure to include a bibliography is particularly regrettable because
                    the author drew upon many sources in researching and writing this book. In the footnote citations to
                    manuscripts it would have been helpful to the reader if, after the initial citation to a document,
                    the source of that document had been repeated in subsequent footnotes.</p>
            <p>Despite these few technical shortcomings, Bray has written a book that is a welcome addition to the
                    literature on western exploration, the history of the upper <geogName>Mississippi valley</geogName>,
                    and the history of science and cartography.</p>

            <p>Under the banner of <hi rend="i">Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War</hi>, Eric Foner
                    has mustered seven essays aimed at returning to center stage in American historical writing
                    "the fundamental reference point in the lives of nineteenth-century Americans,"
                    the Civil War. The book is a sort of declaration of <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-077-4-083"/> war on the
                    new social history which deals with such intimately domestic subjects over such long periods of time
                    that it leaves even as cataclysmic a political event as the Civil War unexplained and nearly
                    unnoticed.</p>
            <p>Some of the essays are rather old. The one on "The Causes of the American Civil
                    War" (1974) will remind readers how much they have assimilated from Foner over the years.
                    "Politics, Ideology, and the Origins of the American Civil War" (1975) has stood
                    the test of time less well. Foner's view that the ideological politics of the 1850s
                    replaced the non-ideological or consensus politics of the Jacksonian era is now dated. He quotes
                    political scientist Frank Sorauf on the nature of ideological politics: "The party of
                    extensive ideology develops in and reflects the society in which little consensus prevails on basic
                    social values and institutions" (p. 36). Political historians borrowed the tools to study
                    politics from political scientists like Sorauf who worked within the assumptions of the consensus or
                    "end of ideology" school. The historians used the tools to find conflict, but all
                    they found was conflict between the ethnic groups which voted for the parties. They did not find
                    ideological conflict between the parties themselves because they unconsciously absorbed the
                    political scientists' hostility to ideology. Thus they ignored the obvious ideological
                    distinctions between the development-minded but anti-expansionist Whigs and the nostalgically
                    agrarian and expansionist Democrats. Increasingly, political historians like Michael F. Holt are
                    studying party ideology, as it is clear that one major factor which caused the collapse of the
                    second American party system was the failure of the Whigs to distinguish their ideology clearly from
                    that of the Democrats in the 1850s. The kind of ideology but not ideology itself is a distinguishing
                    mark of the parties of the third American party system which Foner studies.</p>
            <p>The two essays on the antislavery movement are excellent. "Abolitionism and the Labor
                    Movement in Ante-bellum America" (1980) and "Racial Attitudes of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Free Soilers" (1965) clearly delineate the limitations of the antislavery
                    movement without at the same time losing a proper appreciation for the accomplishments of the
                    movement. These essays are balanced, fair minded, and, as always with Foner, well written.</p>
            <p>The last half of the book is less satisfactory. "Reconstruction and the Crisis of Free
                    Labor" (new in this book) is an attempt to apply Foner's proven ability for
                    brilliant synthesis to the problem of Reconstruction. He describes a subtle triangular <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-077-4-084"/> conflict among the freedmen, who ignored Adam Smith and chose to work
                    less instead of more as free men; the planters, who insisted that blacks were too lazy to work
                    without legal force; and the northern capitalists, who disliked legal force but were horrified by
                    the freedmen's desire for subsistence farms instead of commercial agriculture. The essay
                    fails because it explains Reconstruction within the states better than it does national
                    Reconstruction policy. Foner's attempt to attribute the failure of Reconstruction to the
                    Republicans' gradual abandonment of the dynamic free labor ideology of the 1850s for
                    "respectability, the Union, and business" depends mostly on the coincidence that
                    1877 marked both the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of the use of military force to end
                    labor unrest.</p>
            <p>The essay is valuable, though, as a demarcation point in Reconstruction studies. Foner notes that the
                    old Dunningite and racist views of the period are dead but that nothing equally comprehensive and
                    coherent has replaced them. It is good, too, that a scholar with his sound credentials has at last
                    said that "our preoccupation with the racial politics of Reconstruction" has
                    blinded us to other interesting aspects of the period. In his sense that Unionism better explains
                    the scalawags than anything else, Foner approaches a promising new view of Reconstruction history as
                    a problem of loyalty rather than one of race, labor, party, or constitutional rights.</p>
            <p>Foner's essay on Thaddeus Stevens (1974) is less ambitious and less interesing, and the
                    concluding article on the Irish Land League (1978), a full 25 percent of the book, is simply
                    irrelevant. It has nothing at all to do with the Civil War era.</p>
            <p>Book titles are not to be ignored. At most, only 75 percent of this book is on the subject. In a
                    sense, none of the book deals with the essential subject. Despite its title, there is not a single
                    essay on the Civil War, only articles on its coming and aftermath. The book so many hoped Foner
                    would write, the book on ideology in the Civil War itself, remains unwritten.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Woman and Temperance</hi> is an institutional history of the Woman's Christian

                    through its heyday under Frances Willard (1879 to 1898) and a few years beyond. It is the first
                    published book-length study of the Union prepared outside the WCTU. Bordin, a research affiliate of
                    the University of <placeName>

                    movement that large numbers of women were politicized, and it was through temperance that they
                    experienced wider spheres of public activity in the nineteenth century" (p. xviii).</p>

                    scholarly publication to show in some detail WCTU's growth and broadening programs under
                    Willard's leadership. The Union was eventually organized at the state level in every state
                    and at the local level in more than half the counties of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. By 1890 it published the world's largest women's newspaper, the
                    weekly <hi rend="i">Union Signal</hi>, with a circulation of nearly 100,000. Confronted with a broad
                    array of social problems associated with alcohol abuse, Willard told the Union women to "Do
                    Everything" to ameliorate them. Following this policy WCTU had developed by 1896
                    thirty-nine departments, of which twenty-five dealt with nontemperance issues like child labor, the
                    franchise, prison work, social purity, kindergartens, Sabbatarianism, and peace, along with less
                    weighty matters such as dress reform. Willard, who had won the presidency in 1879 by urging woman
                    suffrage ("the home protection ballot"), also brought the Union into a modest alliance with the
                    Knights of Labor, to the dismay of many of her followers. Willard also led the union into politics,
                    endorsing the Prohibition party in 1884 and 1888, and she attempted unsuccessfully to establish a
                    new reform party in 1892 composed of populist and prohibitionist elements.</p>
            <p>Although the general outlines of WCTU's work in this period have long been available in Mary
                    Earhart Dillon's biography of Frances Willard (1944), Bordin's book fills a need
                    for a fresh focus and detailed analysis of the Union's work. Combing <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-077-4-086"/> through the <hi rend="i">Union Signal</hi> and annual NWCTU convention
                    minutes and drawing upon unpublished studies of various state unions, Bordin portrays a vital,
                    ambitious organization developing local leaders and involving members in a wide variety of social
                    and civic programs.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Bordin's claims seem too broad: her assertion that "in the 1880s the WCTU
                    was the major organizer and supporter of organized charity in most metropolitan areas" (p.
                    14) is nowhere supported in the text. There is also something disquieting about Bordin's
                    comment that "the Union ended the century with a large proportion of its membership
                    committed to militant feminism, equal rights, and full participation in the political
                    process" (p. 116). To use the catchwords of the present-day woman's movement to
                    describe the attitudes of "the White Ribbon Army" of 1900 is surely to
                    misunderstand the latter and to evade the real problem of seeking to understand how the world and
                    the woman's movement have changed in this century.</p>
            <p>Still, Bordin is to be commended for her study. Along with Karen Blair's new work on the
                    American woman's club movement, <hi rend="i">Woman and Temperance</hi> demonstrates how
                    widespread the tenets of social feminism were in the nineteenth century and again challenges the
                    stereotype of the Victorian woman.</p>

                    Chief.</hi>" By Robert F. Karolevitz. (Yankton, S.D.: Benedictine Sisters of Sacred Heart
                    Convent, 1980. Pp. 156. Illustrations, bibliography, index. $9.45.)</head>
            <p>This is a historical biography of Martin Marty (1834–1896), one of the first pioneer
                    missionaries to the Sioux Indians. It tells the story of the Swiss-born Benedictine monk who in 1860
                    left the monastery of Maria Einsiedeln near the town of Schwyz to become, in 1871, the first abbot
                    of the then St. Meinrad monastery and seminary in Indiana (now St. Meinrad Archabbey). Eventually
                    Marty served as the first bishop of the Dakota Territory.</p>
            <p>In 1876, two weeks after the defeat of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little
                    Big Horn River, the forty-two-year-old abbot of St. Meinrad made final plans to travel to the
                    Standing Rock Indian Reservation in the Dakotas. After four years of work on the frontier, Marty was
                    consecrated <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-077-4-087"/> as bishop of the Dakota Territory on February 1,
                    1880, at St. Ferdinand Church, Ferdinand, Indiana.</p>
            <p>The book is divided into three general sections: three chapters on the early, formative years in
                    Schwyz and Einsiedeln, four chapters on the Indiana years at St. Meinrad, and five chapters on the
                    Dakota years.</p>
            <p>Liberally supported by anecdotes, the book portrays an enigmatic person: often quiet and shy but
                    dynamic and intense; warm and friendly but at the same time autocratic and forceful in leadership
                    roles; traditional but able to depart from customary procedures to meet the needs of the moment.
                    Marty's frontier travels both in Dakota and to and from Indiana by horse, paddlewheel
                    steamer, stagecoach, wagon, and steam locomotive, along with his efforts to recruit more
                    missionaries, raise funds, build churches and schools, and personally minister to the Indians and
                    homesteaders of the northern prairies are graphically portrayed. Marty's meetings in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> with Sitting Bull, the belligerent Hunkpapa medicine man; his encounters with Katherine
                    Drexel in ministering to the Indians; and his work with Indian Agent James McLaughlin also are
                    recounted.</p>
            <p>Archival resources, including photographs from the Sacred Heart Convent Archives, Yankton, have been
                    liberally utilized. The work is a generally objective and balanced rendition of frontier history.</p>

            <p>Gunther Barth believes that a unique American urban society developed in the period from 1830 to 1910
                    and forced urban dwellers to find new ways to achieve happiness, security, and identity.
                    Specifically, he argues that the apartment house, the metropolitan press, the department store, the
                    ball park, and the vaudeville house channeled the freedom and anarchy of modern cities into a
                    culture that provided "a response to major problems of metropolitan existence as perceived
                    by large groups of people: the lack of identity and the need for communication; women's
                    urge to partake in big-city life and men's search for leisure as part of the urban
                    existence; and everyone's hope to be recognized as individual in a crowd" (p. 23).
                    The culture developed by these institutions disappeared with the advent of <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-077-4-088"/> the automobile. To demonstrate his position Barth creates what he calls
                    an "intellectual construct from the empirical evidence" (p. 4).</p>
            <p>The apartment was the solution to the problem of privacy. A common feature in European cities,
                    especially <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the apartment took hold as downtown real estate prices made the cost of single family
                    housing prohibitive. Americans also rejected the boarding house with its shared kitchen and bath
                    facilities as lacking in privacy. American units differed from those in Europe by catering to one
                    economic group per unit. Inclusion of the latest conveniences such as lights and elevators aided in
                    making apartments a success.</p>
            <p>The metropolitan press, transcending the partisan politics and dull business news of earlier papers,
                    became the critical link in large cities. These newspapers reduced isolation by coining a new urban
                    shorthand common to all while presenting the diversity of the city in new features such as sports,
                    human interest, and women's columns. They instructed the uninitiated and offered
                    information on all facets of city life. Special-interest sections appealed to "people whose
                    experience of modernity taught them to live life in segments and not as a totality" (p.
                    80). The press also encouraged egalitarianism and the leveling concept of the pursuit of money, and
                    it made possible the reduction of isolation and the emergence of a recognizable urban community.</p>
            <p>The department stores also instructed. They appeared simultaneously in Europe and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, but in America they were the special province of women and, in fact, brought women to
                    the previously male-dominated downtown. Sales, advertisements, female clerks, and the variety of
                    services and goods had a leveling effect, bringing women of different classes together. The stores
                    taught women the art of fashion and allowed them to participate in urban culture.</p>
            <p>The ball park in similar fashion educated men in the ways of city life. The Social Gospel
                    movement's advocacy of recreation as a legitimate activity encouraged mass participation in
                    spectator sports. A number of sports, but especially baseball, taught about competition, efficiency,
                    excellence, and the official rules which governed both play and work.</p>
            <p>Finally, vaudeville, a fusion of several entertainment forms such as the variety show (albeit without
                    its bad reputation), served to educate by fostering new relationships between men and women and by
                    encouraging fashionable attire and the search for monetary success. Urban themes and ethnic
                    stereotypes <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-077-4-089"/> pervaded the presentations. Capturing the diversity
                    of urban life and exploring the issues faced by urban dwellers, vaudeville attracted a diverse
                    audience and provided models, manners, and an egalitarian creed.</p>
            <p>Barth's book is fascinating but reminiscent of old-fashioned social histories which provided
                    great quantities of data but never satisfactorily proved anything. His impressionistic studies whet
                    the appetite but never wrestle with the difficult problems of establishing relationships between and
                    among institutions and the people and societies they affect. Barth's cities never reflect
                    the ethnic and economic differences that existed. He never justifies his cavalier dismissal of the
                    factory, the school, the church, and political organizations. European roots of several institutions
                    are noted but lightly dismissed. Over-generalizations and contradictory statements weaken the book.
                    Finally, the unusual footnoting style, typographical errors, totally incomprehensible sentences, and
                    Barth's belief that readers should accept without adequate documentation his assurances
                    that his assertions are true impair the value of the book. Nevertheless, as a series of
                    impressionistic essays on important nineteenth-century urban institutions, the book is worth
                    reading.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $27.95.)</head>
            <p>This book will well serve local historians with an interest in nineteenth-century medicine. In fact,
                    it will perhaps be more welcome than most of the existing surveys of medical triumphs and great
                    doctors of the previous century because it so nicely recaptures the scent of day-to-day medicine in
                    "Victorian" America.</p>
            <p>John S. Haller is unconcerned with recounting such heroic accomplishments of nineteenth-century
                    medicine as the germ theory of disease, the discovery of anesthesia, the public health movement, and
                    the early achievements of modern scientific medicine in education and technology. One will find very
                    little in the book to explain innovative medical procedures and therapies, whether surgical,
                    technological, or chemotherapeutic. Also surprisingly, one finds little concerning nursing,
                    hospitals, <pb n="388" id="VAA4025-077-4-090"/> or mental institutions. A second unusual feature of
                    this survey of American medicine from 1840 to 1910 (and Haller does confine himself nicely to this
                    time span), is that little of the reader's attention is directed to the uniquely American
                    characteristics of the medical nineteenth century. Each chapter blends the experiences of American
                    and European physicians and their patients so thoroughly that the ocean between them seems to have
                    disappeared.</p>
            <p>What Haller does discuss could be described as the social climate of medical theory and practice in
                    these decades, and the topics he selects are many of the ones local historians encounter routinely
                    in fee books, doctors' journals, letters and diaries of patients, newspaper advertisements
                    or editorials, and the general medical presuppositions of literate witnesses to the rapidly changing
                    landscape of the late 1800s.</p>
            <p>The first four chapters—on the humoral theory of disease, the proper ways to let blood,
                    the most frequently used drugs of the average regular physician, and the sceptics, sectarians, and
                    religious challengers to traditional medicine—are not greatly different from many
                    available works on American medicine. They are, however, filled with interesting, entertaining
                    examples for a non-specialist audience. A glance at the notes will further instruct the reader on
                    the wide variety of materials available to reconstruct the history of medicine in this period. The
                    second four chapters—on midwives and their demise, changes in medical education, the
                    ethical codes and business practices of ordinary physicians, and the importance of Darwinian theory
                    in changing the ways doctors viewed their role in society—are so constructed as to send
                    any industrious local historian to the libraries and archives with new questions to pursue.</p>
            <p>The questions arise not directly from the book, but from the fact that Haller rarely advances any
                    sustained thesis or argument to clarify the direction of medicine in "transition."
                    The closest he comes to describing what happened in these years can be expressed well with a comment
                    of a late-nineteenth-century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> physician. Considering the achievements of Pasteur and Koch, Dr. G. Frank Lydston saw
                    them as "deranging the substratum of rational philosophy, upon which rested the entire
                    superstructure of medical science" (p. 296). Haller is essentially arguing that the
                    deranged superstructure of medicine occurs on <hi rend="i">all</hi> levels of patient and physician
                    experience, and his purpose is to suggest that one cannot possibly understand the transition in
                    medicine if inquiry is limited to progress in medical science. It is thus more <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-077-4-091"/> than an argument that social history or the patient's history
                    are important in themselves, the premise of many social histories of medicine available. Rather, one
                    cannot understand the change to a scientific medicine, to stranger treating stranger, without
                    understanding the social bankruptcy of older medical systems in early industrial America.</p>
            <p>Few physicians were displaced by the seismic social and scientific change of the late nineteenth
                    century. They clung to older therapies or practices while paying eloquent lip service to the new.
                    Day-to-day medicine, Haller reveals, "moved at a snail's pace" (p. ix).
                    In showing this, with abundant examples to hold the reader's attention, the book may
                    surprise those who have been comfortable with stories of progress in medical science or content with
                    anecdotes of the terrible trials for the patient of yesteryear. Since there are many specialized
                    studies available elsewhere, the scholar may similarly despair at Haller's refusal to draw
                    fine chronological boundaries, clear, challengeable historical theories and models, or sharply
                    defined conclusions. But the rich image he recreates of American medicine is bound to captivate the
                    general reader and stimulate interest in our common medical past.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $15.50.)</head>
            <p>This book is an ambitious undertaking, for in only 115 pages Michael J. Devine writes the biography
                    of a "man viewed by his colleagues as America's ‘first professional
                    diplomat’" (p. 5) and assesses his "contributions to the development of
                    American foreign policy during the era of imperialism" (p. 5). The thesis of the volume is
                    that John W. Foster's diplomatic record "demonstrates clearly the continuity in
                    the evolution of American foreign policy from Ulysses S. Grant to Woodrow Wilson" (p. 4),
                    and the conclusion is that Foster's "unique contribution to American diplomacy was
                    his transmission of nineteenth-century idealism, nationalism, and a sense of world mission to men
                    … who were to form and implement foreign policy in the twentieth century" (p.
                    116).</p>
            <p>The son of British immigrants who settled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Foster was a reserved young man when he attended Indiana University at age fifteen. He
                    graduated as valedictorian of his <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-077-4-092"/> class, studied law, and at
                    age twenty-one started a private practice in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By this time his personality had set—he was abrupt, humorless, moralistic,
                    opportunistic, and extremely partisan. After the Civil War his political fortunes rose with those of
                    the Republican party, and he began a diplomatic career. He was rewarded with several ministerial
                    assignments. Eventually, upon the resignation of Secretary of State James G. Blaine in 1892, Foster
                    became himself secretary of state.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is the short length of the book that has proved troublesome for the author. Many
                    assertions are not sufficiently explained. Devine's point about Foster's
                    "midwestern origins" is, for example, ambiguous. He characterizes Foster as
                    narrow, inexperienced, and unfamiliar with world affairs; yet he insists his practical and diverse
                    midwestern background served him well. Just what was so midwestern about Foster's
                    background is never made clear. The author believes that "as the decade of the nineties
                    commenced, Foster was the American diplomat most experienced in the policies and tactics necessary
                    for an expansionist foreign policy …" (p. 38). Admired by President Benjamin
                    Harrison, Foster was brought into the administration. But Devine goes too far when he suggests that
                    as Secretary of State Blaine's health declined, Harrison sought Foster's counsel
                    with such increasing frequency that by the time of Blaine's resignation Foster was already
                    acting as secretary of state. Another confusion occurs in regard to the Chilean crisis of
                    1891–1892, with the author's suggestion that "no incident more clearly
                    demonstrated the magnitude of Foster's influence…. Foster was in large measure
                    responsible for causing the crisis that developed …" (p. 44). But Foster did not
                    divert Harrison from strict neutrality during the Chilean civil war; he did not
                    "meddle" in the <hi rend="i">Itata</hi> affair; and his influence in the
                    administration was indeed limited. Devine maintains that Foster's tenure as secretary of
                    state proves he provided continuity in the Harrison administration. The nature of the continuity is
                    not clear.</p>
            <p>The book is marred by Devine's awkward prose, poor organization, citations filled with
                    typographical errors, general carelessness (for example, he refers to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> minister to <placeName>
                        <country reg="cl">Chile</country>
                    </placeName> as Thomas Egan instead of Patrick Egan and to the Chilean rebel agent as Tumbull
                    instead of Trumbull). Foster, unfortunately, burned most of his papers, and the present book is
                    constructed from other, sometimes unreliable, sources. As such it probably was difficult to write
                    with certainty about many of the diplomatic controversies that Foster touched. Still, <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-077-4-093"/> the present book's difficulties are such that some other
                    scholar must again attempt the task.</p>

            <p>This is an awesome book, an exhaustive study of folk songs dealing with life on or around railroads.
                    Norm Cohen, executive director of the John Edwards Memorial Foundation at UCLA (a major center for
                    the study of country music) and editor of its <hi rend="i">Quarterly</hi>, is also an industrial
                    chemist. The book is difficult to describe because it is so detailed, so comprehensive, so full of
                    anecdotes and information that one wonders if there is anything left to write on the topic. The
                    three brief opening chapters provide a history of railroads in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, a history of written and recorded music, and an overview of railroad songs starting
                    with one written in 1828.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the book is divided into topical sections: Heroes and Badmen, The Fatal Run, Working
                    on the Railroad, In a Boxcar around the World, and the like. Within each of the nine sections
                    anywhere from three to fifteen songs are discussed. Included are such popular tunes as
                    "John Henry," "Casey Jones," "The Wreck of the Old
                    97," "The <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Rock Island</settlement>
                    </placeName> Line," alongside such obscurities as "The Wreck of the C&amp;O
                        <hi rend="i">Sportsman</hi>" and "The Railroad Boomer." Each song is
                    discussed at length, including alternate verses and versions, historical accuracy or inaccuracy,
                    recorded history, and a list of all printed sources and recordings which could be located. It seems
                    as if the author has read every song book and listened to every record ever produced. Some items
                    have only a few references, while others have dozens and even hundreds; the listing of recordings of
                    "John Henry" runs to eleven pages.</p>
            <p>This is more than a discussion of some railroad songs. More broadly, it is a fascinating history of
                    folk music, which Cohen defines as music "the survival of which does not depend entirely on
                    commercial media. Thus a song need not be old in order to qualify, but it must outlive its vogue in
                    sheet music and records" (p. 23). Such a general definition allows him to <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-077-4-094"/> include what others might categorize as popular music, blues, and
                    hillbilly music. It is therefore not surprising to find a section entitled "I've
                    Got the Railroad Blues," with a concise discussion of the form and content of blues music.</p>
            <p>As if all this were not enough, there are also excellent photographs and other illustrations, a list
                    of recorded instrumental music relating to trains, a list of important albums, and a detailed
                    bibliography. Because railroads have played such an important role in Indiana's history,
                    much of the information Cohen has compiled will be of great interest to local historians. Railroads
                    have held a fascination for Americans since the early nineteenth century, which explains the
                    profusion and popularity of these songs. Today, as passenger service is disappearing, we need
                    reminders of the crucial role trains have played in our past. U. Utah "Bruce"
                    Phillips has written a song entitled "Daddy, What's a Train?" (which is
                    not included in <hi rend="i">Long Steel Rail)</hi>, a sad comment on their demise. If, eventually,
                    we are left with nothing else, we will always have railroad songs. And thanks to Norm Cohen, we will
                    know what they are about and where to find them. Unfortunately, the price of the book is a bit
                    steep.</p>

            <p>Although marriage across nationality lines is only one of many possible indices of immigrant
                    assimilation, the author of this small but thought-provoking monograph makes a strong case for its
                    primacy as a "measure of the success of the American melting pot" (p. xvii). Thus,
                    the purpose of the book is set forth clearly at the outset: "to shed new light on immigrant
                    assimilation by centering attention on the extent, patterns, and causes of intermarriage"
                    (p. xvi). The setting for the study is <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, and the data examined derive primarily from a sample of the state's
                    manuscript marriage registrations. Although the treatment is, of necessity, heavily quantitative,
                    the prose is clear, and the book's many tables are succinctly summarized and explained.
                    Happily, the author frequently enhances his presentation with case studies of particular <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-077-4-095"/> couples—including such notable figures as Carl and Paula
                    Sandburg and Robert and Belle Case La Follette.</p>
            <p>The book begins with an introductory essay that explores the theoretical and methodological problems
                    in the study of marital assimilation and surveys and critiques previous treatments (primarily
                    sociological) of the subject. The first chapter then sets the stage by detailing the size,
                    composition, and distribution of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s immigrant population. (In 1900, 25 percent of the state's residents
                    were foreign born, another 46 percent were native born of foreign parents; the comparable figures
                    for Indiana were 6 percent and 15 percent.) The three subsequent chapters—the heart of
                    the book—deal with the questions "how much" and "why"
                    by examining the statewide intermarriage rates of the major immigrant groups, the individual factors
                    (e.g., age, class, exposure to other cultures in childhood) that inclined immigrants toward or away
                    from exogamy, and the group factors (demographic "availability" and socioeconomic
                    "desirability") affecting the process.</p>
            <p>The results of these analyses are detailed, complex, and subject to many qualifications. The relative
                    importance of the various individual and group variables, in particular, cannot be readily
                    summarized in a brief review. Suffice it to say that many immigrants in early twentieth-century <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> did indeed marry across nationality lines, western Europeans slightly more often than
                    eastern Europeans. The author's findings seem to support his contention that
                    "recent studies stressing cultural and structural pluralism … may have
                    improperly deemphasized the assimilative side of immigrant life in America" (p. 124). More
                    studies will be needed to test that proposition, and this book likely will be an important point of
                    departure for such work. While the author's empirical findings are certainly welcome, in
                    the long run the greatest value of this careful study may well be its theoretical and methodological
                    underpinnings.</p>

                    been a military miracle, surpassed only by the ability of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to "find the leaders and staffs capable of handling these enormous masses
                    … and leading them to victory." This volume, the first comprehensive, analytical

                    </placeName> during the final year of the war, examines how leaders and staff gained their
                    objectives.</p>
            <p>But the author provides much more than a history of the supreme command and its decisions. Russell F.
                    Weigley focuses attention on the supreme command, army group, field army, and corps levels because
                    he feels that in trying to avoid the old-fashioned drum and trumpet approach practitioners of the
                    "new" military history too often have ignored combat, the ultimate reason for the
                    existence of any army. Therefore he follows the implementation of command decisions down to the
                    cutting edge of combat, examining the performance of divisions, regiments, and even smaller units in
                    battles, engagements, and small actions from Normandy to the Elbe and the Danube. And when the
                    actions of individuals affected the outcome, these too are described.</p>
            <p>Weigley aims at providing a complete picture, warts and all, noting achievements as well as
                    shortcomings. His major theme is that the U.S. Army had not developed a clear concept of warfare.
                    Its doctrine, he states, had been shaped by two conflicting legacies. From its frontier days the
                    army inherited the lessons of tactical mobility; from its Civil War experience, the value of sheer
                    massed power, demonstrated by Grant. These two legacies, never fully reconciled, affected both the
                    force structure of the army and the conduct of its operations. They provided for the most mobile
                    army ever put into the field up to 1944 but also for an army that had not yet fully understood the
                    solutions to the problems of movement and fire. American generalship, Weigley writes, "by
                    and large was competent," but it tended to prefer prosaic plans rigidly executed over
                    risk-taking improvisations, the "broad front advance" over the "single
                    thrust" approach. It was only special opportunity or dire crisis that allowed a deviant
                    like George Patton to emerge after D-Day in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. These shortcomings were shared by British commanders, only too aware that they led the
                    last British army. In the end, Weigley concludes, the American-led allies won because they could
                    call on superior resources in men and material to offset their lack of brilliance in the higher art
                    of war.</p>
            <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-077-4-097"/>
            <p>Contributing to the difficulties encountered was unexpectedly stiff resistance by the Germans, who,
                    until early 1945, proved ruthless and skillful enemies with tactical skills and weapons still
                    superior to those of the allies and with a command structure that proved resilient in adversity. At
                    the same time, American doctrine and practice still were not fully attuned to the need for the
                    integration of armor, infantry, and close tactical air support. The infantry divisions, less than
                    half the number originally called for in war plans, had too little firepower to carry out sustained
                    missions against the more experienced enemy and, suffering heavy losses, scraped the bottom of the
                    manpower pool by late 1944. And American armored divisions were still considered primarily as
                    instruments for exploiting a breakthrough; lacking machines with adequate guns, the divisions had to
                    sacrifice tanks to overcome the heavier and better armed Panthers and Tigers. Finally, although the
                    allies had clear quantitative and qualitative superiority in the air, the preoccupation of leading
                    airmen with independent strategic bombing delayed the development of truly effective close air
                    support for the ground troops.</p>
            <p>Still, the Americans learned. If in the summer of 1944 there were only a few divisions capable of
                    matching the Germans on a one-to-one basis, leadership, men, and tactics matured while, with the
                    logistic logjam broken, American industrial capacity was finally effectively translated into
                    battlefield assets. On the debit side of the ledger, however, there never were enough well-trained
                    replacements for infantry and armor.</p>
            <p>All this and much more is analyzed in a lucid and compelling narrative. To write history with such
                    scope and yet with so much detail requires magisterial knowledge, clear thinking, and considerable
                    literary skill. Weigley demonstrates that he possesses these talents. The result is one of those
                    rare works which sets a new standard for the state of the art while also providing much-needed
                    perspectives for the future. <hi rend="i">Eisenhower's Lieutenants</hi> will fascinate the
                    specialist, challenge the average reader, and provide food for thought for contemporary military
                    planners. In the aftermath of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>, it is by no means clear that the lessons learned in the two German wars have been
                    truly absorbed. This admirable book, meticulously produced by Indiana University Press, deserves the
                    widest possible audience. Not only history at its best, it also is a valuable contribution to the
                    ongoing debate about national defense.</p>
