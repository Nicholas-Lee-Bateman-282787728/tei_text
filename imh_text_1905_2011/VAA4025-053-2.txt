                        New Albany
                    's transition from pioneer village to urban community can be traced in the
                    economic developments which occurred there from 1830 to 1860. From its initial settlement in 1813
                    through the 1820's, 
                        New Albany
                     possessed the establishments common to most small frontier towns: a few general stores,
                    a mill or two, and a number of small shops where blacksmith, saddler, cobbler, and other local
                    artisans plied their trade on a limited scale.1 With the steady increase of
                    population and extension of the town's boundaries came a corresponding growth in its
                    economic activities, marked by an increase in the exchange of farm commodities, the acceleration and
                    variation of mercantile activities, the evolution of a more elaborate fiscal and banking system, and
                    at least the beginnings of a complex industrial establishment.2
            
            
               
                        New Albany
                     had its surges of prosperity during these years, but it was in no sense a boom town;
                    the more durable strands of its economic fabric were woven slowly and continuously. Yet one cannot
                    peruse the 
                        New Albany
                     papers of the pre-Civil War period without catching some of the confidence and optimism
                    that local publicists felt for their town. Consistently the opinion was expressed that 
                        New Albany
                     was building, building—that it was approaching the threshold of

                        United States
                     census reports are somewhat more sobering, but on the whole they confirm the fact of 
                        New Albany
                    's steady economic advance through these formative years.
            
               
                        New Albany
                     early gained a reputation for building fine steamboats, but its principal economic
                    activity, as in most settlements in the West, was merchandising—trading, buying, and
                    selling. The town was not endowed with a particularly rich rural neighborhood, but its position on
                    the river made it a natural rendezvous for farmers of the surrounding counties and prospective
                    buyers of their goods. A fundamental strategy of 
                        New Albany
                     merchants was the extension of the town's hinterland far beyond the confines
                    of 
                        Floyd County
                     so that its advantages as a trade center for farm produce could be fully realized.
                    Prior to 1830 the limitations of transportation had prevented this program from advancing far, but
                    road improvements and the creation of a rail connection within the next three decades enabled 
                        New Albany
                    's promoters to make their town one of the most important commercial centers on
                    the lower 
                        Ohio
                     River.
            Three basic stages of 
                        New Albany
                    's commercial development were encompassed within this thirty-year period. In
                    the early 1830's the local market house and the general store dominated the commercial
                    scene; by the late 1830's wholesaling had become noticeably important, though not yet equal
                    to retailing; and by 1860 wholesaling was the dominant enterprise.
            The first market house in 
                        New Albany
                     was probably the one constructed in 1830.3 The market house of the
                    early 1830's was a wide, open shed placed in the middle of unpaved Market Street where
                    farmers from Floyd and neighboring counties gathered twice a week to dispose of their produce. The
                    screaming of hucksters, the symphony of a dozen different barnyard voices, the atmosphere of
                    smells—some wholesome, some otherwise—the trampling through refuse and offal,
                    the scuffle to get the best bargains—all this was the market house.4
                    But there was system to the congestion. In fact, no

                            market house for $219.00. There is a reference to an "old"
                            market house in the Minutes for December 16, 1830 (I, 142).

                                 News, August 8, 1899, cited in 
                        
                                    New Albany
                                 Tribune, May 17, 1935.
               
                     feature of the young town was more carefully regulated by civic
                    officials than the market place.5
            
            About fifty stalls were leased to regular vendors for "not less than ten dollars,"
                    the remaining space being rented on the basis of sales.6 Attempts to short
                    weigh, misrepresent quality, sell tainted or damaged goods, or otherwise defraud were subject to
                    fines of five dollars. To prevent eager traders from buying up the best produce, no articles brought
                    to and usually sold in market could be sold from twilight on market eve until sounding of the market
                    bell at five o'clock the next morning. During market hours all transactions were restricted
                    to the market area, but there was little to prevent prospective sellers and buyers from meeting
                    outside the town limits to carry on their exchange uninhibited by town regulations. The marketmaster
                    was the ruler of this compact commercial domain. After market hours he might have to sweep up the
                    debris remaining from the feverish three-hour activity, but most of his duties were more dignified.
                    He leased the stalls, opened the market by ringing the courthouse bell, tried to insure fairness in
                    transactions, and generally presided over the manifold proceedings.7
            
            Market house transactions continued to play a significant role in 
                        New Albany
                     for at least the remainder of the century. Later it was not only necessary to enlarge
                    the original market house but to construct an additional one in the uptown section of the expanding
                    city as well.8 But as the town became more urbanized the public markets served
                    more as convenient retail shopping centers than as clearing points for town and country goods.
            
               
                  5 The early Minutes of the Town Council, for the year 1830ff., contain
                        many references to the local market house. The formal ordinances applying to the public market
                        can be found in the

                        also be found in Ordinances of the City of 
                                New Albany

                  8 The original market was located on Market between Pearl and State
                        streets. This, in the earlier years, was referred to as the "upper" market.
                        About 1836 the market space was extended to include the block between State and Lower (West)
                        First streets, this being termed the "lower" market. This second area is still
                        used for display and sale of farm produce. Some time later an uptown market space was laid out
                        on Upper (East) Market between Tenth and Eleventh streets. This block is now the site of a local
                        war memorial.

            The general store, though its importance waned after 1830, continued to have its place in 
                        New Albany
                    's commercial pattern. It provided the townspeople and their rural neighbors
                    many of their daily needs, ranging from sugar, tea, and coffee to teakettles, plows, and axes. By
                    1837 
                        New Albany
                     was reported to have sixty retail grocery and dry goods stores and at least fifteen
                    other stores engaged in both retail and wholesale marketing.9 Published
                    inventories of some of the concerns attest to the variety of foodstuffs, beverages, luxury items,
                    and general conveniences available to 
                        New Albany
                     purchasers. Among some one hundred commodities advertised by James Brooks and Henry B.
                    Shields in 1836 were ginger, soft-shell almonds, chocolate, mustard, Musselman's tobacco,
                    Malay "segars," Havana sugar, Shaker brooms, Java coffee, 
                        Boston
                     nails, window glass, pimentoes, tanner's oil, rose soap, smoked herring, and
                    an impressive assortment of imported rum, wines, and liqueurs.10 In 1849 John B.
                    Frentz's somewhat more limited stock included "oysters, lemons, nuts, candies of
                    all kinds, toys in large variety, fireworks, violins, accordeons [sic] and an
                    assortment of fine cutlery, and other fine articles too numerous to mention."11 Proprietors regularly replenished their stocks from wholesale markets in the larger
                    cities along the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                    , particularly in 
                        Louisville
                    , but in the more distant cities to the east and southwest as well. Calling in
                    outstanding debts for cash in order to make wholesale purchases at distant points was a seasonal
                    necessity for the local merchants.12
            
            While the local market and general store still served as the framework of 
                        New Albany
                    's commerce in the 1830's, wholesaling became relatively more
                    important in this decade. In the boom years before the Panic of 1837 merchants surprised themselves
                    by the ease with which they disposed of

                            "My Friends: You who owe me must absolutely pay me in short order. My business
                            requires money, and money I must have. You must know that I cannot wait forever for my
                            debts—I must live as well as others. I dislike, if it was in my power, to
                            personally dun everyone of you. I therefore wish everyone that owes me anything that is due
                            to consider this as a personal dun. I have indulged you as long as I can without suffering

                     their stocks, and they were thus encouraged to make augmented
                    purchases to supply retailers of the area. In 1836 the editor of the 
                  
                            New Albany
                         Gazette reminded his readers of the unprecedented prosperity: "Those
                    who have been surprised at our business heretofore will be struck with astonishment when they are
                    informed that the supplies for the present season exceed that of any other season four or five
                        fold."13 This degree of prosperity proved temporary, for in the
                    depression of the late thirties and early forties fluctuations in business continued, old
                    partnerships were dissolved, currency remained scarce, and bankruptcy was a constant threat. But
                    undoubtedly expansion continued to be the keynote, with a growing market and a larger number of
                    merchants to supply it.14
            
            The early 1850's mark the real transition from retailing to wholesaling in the 
                        New Albany
                     mercantile pattern. And so coincidental was this change with the building of the
                    town's first rail connection that the improvement in transportation must be regarded as
                    largely responsible for it.15 In September, 1852, as the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     Railroad penetrated more deeply into the rural heartland of Indiana, the editor of the 
                        New Albany
                    
                    Ledger wrote: "One year ago there was not an exclusive wholesale dry
                    goods establishment in this city. Now there are six."16 A year later he
                    reported: "We have now thirty-four houses in this city engaged in an exclusive wholesale
                    and jobbing business, embracing dry goods, groceries, hardware, queensware, notions, hats and caps,
                    boots and shoes, etc."17
            
            This increase, however phenomenal it may appear, was really a continuation of a trend that had been
                    long under way.

                     14 Because of the lack of extant local newspapers for the
                            1840's commercial data for this period are hard to secure. However, the editor of
                            the

                            Ledger in reviewing this decade strongly suggests that the commercial
                            expansion of the mid-1830's did not continue at a comparable rate in the
                            1840's.

                     As they became aware that greater profits lay with the
                    middlemen—the wholesaler and jobber—many 
                        New Albany
                     storekeepers simply dispensed with their retail departments. Not only did the wholesale
                    phase of the mercantile business come to dominate, but it was channeled into several distinct
                        branches.18 As the selection of stock increased and the volume of business
                    multiplied, 
                        New Albany
                     merchants could compete more nearly on even terms with rivals in other cities. They
                    could, in short, aim directly toward that goal which for decades had been before them: to secure for
                    themselves a proportionate share of the business that normally centered in the large river cities.
                    Rural merchants from an ever-widening area were encouraged to use the 
                        New Albany
                     market, and, as the Ledger noted, "are numbered among our
                    regular customers, thoroughly satisfied that they can do as well here as at 
                        Louisville
                     or 
                        Cincinnati
                    ."19
            
            Editors of the local papers were not alone in advertising the merits of 
                        New Albany
                     as a trading center; those in interior towns which were economically or sentimentally
                    attached to 
                        New Albany
                     occasionally promoted the cause of the river town which appeared to be transforming
                    itself into a thriving city. The comment of the Paoli Eagle is typical of many
                    which the 
                        New Albany
                     papers cited in the 1850's: 
                        We are pleased to see the efforts of late by a portion of the 
                                New Albany
                             merchants to draw the Indiana trade to their city, and we hope their efforts
                            may be successful. We find them liberally advertising in the country papers, proffering to
                            sell as good bargains as can be purchased in 
                                Louisville
                            . This we are satisfied they can do, and we hope the merchants in the interior
                            will give them a call, and if they will sell as cheap give their custom. Indianians have no
                            interest in aiding to build up by their trade cities in other States, when they have cities
                            that possess all the facilities to accommodate them that could be asked for. And the only
                            reason that our immense trade crosses the 
                                Ohio
                             is that 
                                New Albany
                             merchants let the 
                                Louisville
                             merchants overbid them for their produce and undersell them in goods. This they
                            should not allow; and as soon as they determine to compete with the 
                                Louisville
                             merchants, they will secure the Indiana trade.20

                        of dry goods, and will hereafter confine themselves to the carpet and general furnishing

                     merchants were determined to compete with those of larger out-of-state cities for the
                    southern Indiana trade, and by the middle 1850's their town was recognized as a wholesale
                    center. Though promoters declared that wholesaling "may be considered in its
                    infancy," they published these rather impressive statistics for the year 1856:

                    's role as an entrepôt for a large section of southern Indiana is
                    further evidenced in the development of two other phases of mercantile activity: the first, which
                    defies exact classification, may be termed "warehousing"; the other, a business
                    common in many river towns of this region, was hog slaughtering. The building of the 
                        New Albany
                     and

            Warehousing evolved as a distinct mercantile enterprise when the volume of farm goods pouring into 
                        New Albany
                     began to exceed the demands of the local market. Many merchants began to serve as
                    commission and forwarding agents, maintaining warehouses and charging fees for receiving, storing,
                    and shipping accumulated stores to distant river markets. As early as the mid-1830's a few
                    merchants engaged in this practice, probably as a sideline; by the 1850's

                     it was an important part of the trading picture.22 Because this form of mercantile activity was so closely associated with wholesaling,
                    and even retailing, it is difficult to isolate its significance in 
                        New Albany
                    's economy in the immediate pre-Civil War period. But it was the kind of
                    business that characterized the large river cities, and its development in 
                        New Albany
                     is further indication of the town's advanced status as a commercial center.23
            
            Hog slaughtering and meat packing, in some respects branches of the commission business, came into
                    prominence in the early fifties. Two concerns which engaged in this activity butchered thousands of
                    hogs annually and prepared meat for shipment on the river.24 Around 1850 each
                    firm killed from ten to twenty thousand hogs a year. They contracted with farmers to buy the hogs
                    outright, at about $2.50 a head, or to do the butchering and packing on a commission
                        basis.25 The

                        New Albany
                    , and during the first chilly autumn days the hogs made their appearance in the town as
                    they were driven by the hundreds through the streets from the depot.26 R.
                    Simpson and Company, the larger of the two firms, had a "large and commodious"
                    establishment along the river where the bloody rites were performed. For the curing process they

            But the added convenience of the railroad did not make 
                        New Albany
                     a major meat packing center. Even if it were inconvenient to ferry hogs from the
                    Indiana shore to 
                        Louisville
                    , and then dray barrels of pork four or five miles around the Falls for shipping south
                    on steamboats, Indiana farmers persisted in doing it.28 Too, 
                        New Albany
                     packers were confronted, as in the earlier years, not only with 
                        Louisville
                     competitors but with those in

                            Jeffersonville
               , and other river towns as

            Small businesses developed along with the large ones in the three decades preceding the Civil War. By
                    mid-century the business section along High (today's Main), State, and Pearl streets
                    boasted a fair array of small shops catering to the needs and vanities of the townspeople. Tailors,
                    confectioners, cobblers, druggists, bakers, jewelers, barbers, hatters, booksellers, insurance
                    agents, daguerrotypists, and others found sufficient patronage to maintain profitable
                        establishments.30 Newspaper advertisements show what the 
                        New Albany
                     shopper of this period was interested in and what means were used to get patronage.
                    John Lott, proprietor of the Temple of Taste and Fashions Hall, respectfully informed the gentlemen

                    heads—that they would find it much to their advantage to give him a call "as his
                    mode of shaving faces is peculiar to himself."31 The firm of Chadwick
                    and Tate gave the highest prices for human hair and kept constantly on hand "an assortment
                    of Wigs, Scalps, etc."32 Ogle and Green kept open their coffee house,
                    the Social Hall, on market nights, and they promised to do their utmost to accommodate all who felt
                    disposed to give them a call.33 L. R. Reeves advertised "watches of all

                    for sale a new cooking stove, the "Queen of the West," which was supposed to
                    combine "more useful and good qualities than any other stove ever before offered to the
                        public."34
            
            One of the most perplexing problems affecting commercial activities in 
                        New Albany
                    , as in hundreds of other western communities in this era, was the acute shortage of
                    money. There was simply not enough negotiable currency in the Northwest to keep pace with the rapid
                    expansion within the region. So long as exchanges of goods were on a relatively minor scale the
                    money shortage could be somewhat alleviated by the extensive use of barter. As late as the
                    1830's and 1840's 
                        New Albany
                     tradesmen still took a large portion of their pay in produce, especially in such
                    non-perishable items as flax and tow linen, ginseng, beeswax, feathers, and dried fruit. But by the
                    1850's the volume of trade had outmoded this practice, and transactions were almost
                    exclusively for cash.35 As barter disappeared paper money came more into
                    prominence, and the question of what was "good" and what was
                    "bad" paper plagued buyer and seller alike.
            Part of a state-wide program to bring some relief from the fiscal difficulties was the establishment
                    in 1834 of the Second State Bank of Indiana.36 The local branch of this system,
                    one of twelve, was 
                        New Albany
                    's first formal banking house. It served principally as an exchange office, but
                    its initial prosperity shortly gave it a significant place in the commercial affairs of the town.37 As was its intent, this bank doubtless fostered business and brought a kind
                    of order out of the fiscal chaos. On the other hand, the means by which it achieved its early
                    success were frequently open to criticism because much of its profit came from discounting bills
                    from interior branches of the state system. Often when a farmer or other outsider brought his own
                    currency to 
                        New Albany

                     37 This bank reportedly paid stockholders a semi-annual dividend of 4
                            per cent in May, 1836, and one of 5 per cent in January, 1837.

                        New Albany
                     branch; he was therefore obliged to exchange his money for the local currency at a
                    discount of about 2½ per cent.38 Though such practices were nowise
                    confined to 
                        New Albany
                    , they did little to enhance the town's popularity as a trading center. During
                    the depression of the late 1830's and early 1840's the bank was accused of
                    contributing to the general slowdown in business. Prevented by charter regulations from charging
                    more than 4 per cent for discounting notes, the 
                        New Albany
                     bankers were reluctant to exchange their own notes for those of other localities. As a
                    result money became tighter and local business was hampered. "Unless the Bank shall
                    discount quite liberally in a very short time," admonished the editor of the 
                  
                            New Albany
                         Argus in 1839, "the pressure in the money market will be oppressively
                        severe."39 The 
                        Jeffersonville
                    
                    Journal at the same time condemned the 
                        New Albany
                     bank for manipulating currency exchange so that it could almost double the amount it
                    "shaved off."40
            
            The dearth of capital available for local enterprises was another phase of the money problem during
                    this period. Shortly after the founding of the state bank in 1834 two other institutions, for a
                    while at least, helped to alleviate this situation. These were the Farmers' and
                    Mechanics' Savings Institution and the 
                        New Albany
                     Insurance Company.41 The former succumbed to the depression of
                    these years, but the 
                        New Albany
                     Insurance Company managed to survive. It insured against fire and accident, much of its
                    patronage coming from steamboat owners. The capital of the company was never large
                    ($200,000 in 1856), but many of the boats turned out by the local builders had at least
                    partial coverage by it.42 It made a share of its profits from exchanging

            With the overall prosperity of the 1850's came a noticeable expansion of 
                        New Albany
                    's banking facilities. As authorized by the new Indiana constitution (1851) and
                    subsequent legislation, the Third State Bank was organized in 1855 with one of its sixteen branches
                    at 
                        New Albany
                    .44 Meanwhile, the older state bank was permitted to live out its
                    chartered time.45 The establishment of a branch of the 
                        Ohio
                     Insurance Company and other concerns engaging in banking contributed to the substantial
                    increase in local capital. At the close of 1856 the banking picture in

            The Third State Bank was probably 
                        New Albany
                    's foremost banking house in the late 1850's, but it had a somewhat
                    stormy career. On one occasion, when the 
                        New Albany

            Except for the one pursuit of boatbuilding, 
                        New Albany
                     could scarcely be considered an outstanding industrial town during the decades
                    preceding the Civil War. Indiana was overwhelmingly agricultural and contained within its boundaries
                    no real manufacturing centers until the latter quarter of the century. But among the half dozen
                    places in Indiana where manufacturing was concentrated 
                        New Albany
                     did hold a leading position; in fact, from about 1830 to 1860 it competed with its
                    nearest rival, 
                        Madison
                    , for the distinction of being the most important manufacturing town in the state.49
            
            This relative importance of 
                        New Albany
                     as a manufacturing center did not mean that there had been any fundamental changes in
                    industrial activities since the 1820's. Though the number and variety of
                    "manufactories" or craft shops did increase steadily through the thirties and
                    forties, operations remained on the same restricted scale—small capital investment, few
                    hands employed, and output limited accordingly.50 Wool carding, garment making,

                            for counties rather than for cities. Because of this, as well as the lack of uniformity in
                            the presentation of statistics from one census report to another, the census reports do not
                            give the final answer as to whether 
                                New Albany
                             or

                             led in these categories. The 1860 census, which does list statistics by city as
                            well as by county, indicates that 
                                New Albany
                             was the top manufacturing center in Indiana and 67th in the nation. However,

                     manufacture, and leather processing still were prominent.51 There were several milling establishments—the 1840 census listed
                    for 
                        Floyd County
                     nine flour mills, two grist mills, an oil mill, and thirteen sawmills—but
                    there were counties in the state where milling was much more highly concentrated. 
                        New Albany
                     had the lead in soap and candle manufacture, in 1840 turning out 200,000 pounds of soap
                    and 52,000 pounds of candles. Also in the town were shops for manufacture of stoves, pianofortes,
                    and carriages.52 Particularly conspicuous in the pre-Civil War period were the
                    metal-working shops where sheet iron, tin, copper, and brassware were produced in limited
                        quantities.53 These concerns, like the foundry business, were closely allied
                    with steamboat building.
            No industries in the town up to 1850, aside from those directly associated with the building of
                    steamboats, employed a large number of hands. The 1840 census lists fifty-eight engaged in making
                    furniture, sixteen in printing and binding, eight in soapmaking, and five in the construction of
                    carriages. The largest amount of capital invested in a single industry (milling) in 1840 was
                        $30,800.54
            
            During the decade of the 1850's the beginning phases of 
                        New Albany
                    's "industrial revolution" are discernible, the value of
                    local manufactures almost doubling within this ten-year period.55 The increase
                    resulted in part from the acceleration in steamboat building, but the development of other
                    enterprises was also responsible for it. Several new establishments made their appearance, some of
                    which were on a considerably larger scale than anything seen in 
                        New Albany
                     before. The most impressive of these were the machine shops of the 
                        New Albany

                    occasionally turned out a locomotive.56
            
            An industry which appeared and disappeared in the 1850's was the manufacture of
                    straw-cutting machines. 
                        New Albany
                     might have had some future as a manufacturing center for mechanical farm equipment had
                    this enterprise been developed. By 1855 the John B. Ford Company had produced five thousand Sanford
                    Strawcutters which sold for a total of $75,000. It employed forty workers and had a
                    weekly payroll of $350.00. Agencies of the company, all of which were supplied from the 
                        New Albany
                     shop, were established in seven midwestern states. Ford and his colleagues planned to
                    add the manufacture of several other agricultural implements to the business and intended
                    "making it, if they meet proper success, one of the largest factories in the
                        west."57 The factory did not become one of the largest in the West,
                    but John B. Ford eventually took up other pursuits and became one of the nation's most
                    successful industrialists.58
            
            Another trade which reached near-factory proportions by the late 1850's was coopering, which
                    became a subsidiary enterprise of Simpson and Company, the town's leading meat packer. In
                    1858 this concern established a shop where workers built 50,000 barrels and several thousand
                    hogsheads a year. The Ledger reported that "nearly all the operations are
                    performed by machinery."59

            Since the founding of 
                        New Albany
                     it had been the conviction of civic leaders that their town had natural assets which
                    would some time make it a truly great manufacturing center. In the middle 1850's came the
                    first genuine efforts to make this belief a reality. Citizens hoped to continue the prosperity that
                    had come with an expanded boat-building program and an improved wholesale trade. They realized that

                    's position among the cities of the West could be further enhanced only if it
                    became a center for factories, large and diversified.61
            
            As an initial step in the campaign to make 
                        New Albany
                     an industrial center several leading merchants met in 1853 to form a local board of
                        trade.62 Though few if any of these men had enough capital to launch large
                    scale manufacturing on their own, many had accumulated sufficient profits from commercial ventures
                    to participate as investors. The general plan was to attract outside capital to 
                        New Albany
                     to get industries started; 
                        New Albany
                    's geographic advantages and the managerial talents of its leading citizens
                    were to do the rest. "Money is the great Archimedean lever that moves the world,"
                    wrote their spokesman in 1857, "and we need a little more of it … to move Old
                    Fogyism out of his boots, and give Young America an inward impulse. Our Yankee friends at the East
                    have enough of it and to spare, and here is the field to plant it, with the promise of a profitable
                        yield."63

            The prospectus for the campaign to attract manufacturers was embodied in a pamphlet entitled The Commercial and Manufacturing Advantages of 
                            New Albany
                        , Indiana. This booklet received many favorable contemporary reviews. It
                    deserves special attention because it represents the hopes of the people of 
                        New Albany
                     at a crucial period in their economic history. It was prefaced with this resolution:
                        
                        
                     Resolved, That a number of pamphlets be published and distributed setting
                            forth the advantages our city presents as a manufacturing point, our various communications
                            with the South and West by railroads and river, our superior Free Schools, our well paved
                            and well lighted streets, our healthy location; and in fact, everything desirable we possess
                            to induce manufacturers and mechanics to come among us.64
                  
                    
            
            Writers of the pamphlet compared 
                        New Albany
                     with other points which were already acknowledged manufacturing centers and then
                    proceeded to show how favorably 
                        New Albany
                     came out in the comparison. 
                        Pittsburgh
                     seemed to them the ideal city with which to make comparison, and the writers attempted
                    to show that 
                        New Albany
                     had most of the advantages of 
                        Pittsburgh
                     without its disadvantages. For example, 
                        New Albany
                    's river position was even better than 
                        Pittsburgh
                    's: 
                        At all times when a boat can get out of Pittsburg, 
                                New Albany
                             can reach any point by water that is accessible to our up country neighbors.
                            But very often in the course of the year, 
                                New Albany
                             enjoys an uninterrupted water navigation of 10,000 miles, while Pittsburg is as
                            completely shut out by physical impediments from these facilities as if she was cooped up in
                            the very heart of 
                                China
                            . The great difference between the two points is that one is at the head of
                            river navigation above the Falls, the other at the head of navigation below the Falls.65
                  
                    
            
            According to the promoters, 
                        New Albany
                    's access to raw materials was at least as good as 
                        Pittsburgh
                    's. Regarding the supply of timber they wrote: 
                  
                     64
                            Ibid., 1. The resolution concluded with this statement: "Whether
                            this missive will accomplish the end whereunto it is sent remains to be seen. The Good Book
                            says: `Cast thy bread upon the waters, and thou shalt find it after many
                            days.'"
                  
                     65 For the comparisons of 
                                New Albany
                             and 
                                Pittsburgh
                             see ibid., 26–27. Statistically nearby
                                    
                        Louisville, Kentucky
                     , was a more important manufacturing center
                            at this time than was 
                                Pittsburgh
                            . 
                                Nevertheless
                            , 
                                Pittsburgh
                             was chosen for purposes of comparison. See Eighth Census:
                                Statistics of the 
                                    United States
                                , xviii-xix.
               
                    
                    
                        So far as pine lumber is concerned, the Allegheny river certainly does afford to Pittsburg
                            very desirable facilities for transportation. But when it comes to timber for boat building,
                            for wagons, ploughs, and other agricultural implements, they must seek it, for most part, at
                            points below Pittsburg. And whenever that is the case, 
                                New Albany
                             possesses superior facilities for its reception, just as far as it is easier to
                            float a raft of timber downstream than it is to float it up.
                     Concerning iron they wrote: 
                        Nor has 
                                Pittsburgh
                             much the advantage of us in supplying the raw material of iron. She boasts that
                            the 
                                Ohio
                             River gives her cheap facilities for receiving the products
                            of the 
                                Tennessee
                             and 
                                Kentucky
                             furnaces… . Does not this metal pass by 
                                New Albany
                             in its transit…? And how much easier it would be to stop here.
                    
            
            The 
                        New Albany
                     publicists conceded that 
                        Pittsburgh
                     was superior to their own town in its power to run factories; but they claimed that
                    their town would be able to compete favorably in this respect too when the dream of the Scribners
                    and other pioneers had at last been realized: 
                        In the great advantage arising from cheap supply of fuel, we cheerfully yield the palm of
                            superiority to Pittsburg. But our deficiency in this respect is more than counterbalanced by
                            the immense water power that may be brought into requisition, by the judicious application
                            of a little capital, in improving the Falls.
                    
            
            The pamphlet included a list of industries for which the writers thought 
                        New Albany
                     was particularly suited. Among these was the manufacture of textiles. According to the
                    pamphlet, even 
                  Lowell, Massachusetts
               , would have to concede 
                        New Albany
                    's potentiality as a textile center: 
                        Does 
                                New Albany
                             not possess advantages equal, if not superior to 
                                Lowell
                             itself as a manufacturing point? She is certainly much nearer the point where
                            the cotton is grown than 
                                Lowell
                            , and her facilities for getting it are certainly superior… . And
                            then as a market for her goods, she is just as much nearer to it than 
                                Lowell
                             as she is that much nearer to the Great West, whither the star of Empire is
                            rapidly tending.66
                  
                    
            
            Among other enterprises proposed was an iron-rolling mill. Since fifteen thousand tons of iron were
                    used annually for repairs on Indiana railroads, three thousand on the 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     alone, the promoters saw no reason why 
                  
                     66
                            
                                New Albany
                             Board of Trade, The Commercial and Manufacturing Advantages of 
                                    New Albany
                                
                     , 16–17.
               
                     this material could not be supplied from 
                        New Albany
                    . Other suggestions were made for the establishment of a factory for making cedar
                    buckets and one for manufacturing bagging and bale rope, the latter to use the large crop of hemp
                    which was grown in the region. An invitation was extended also for industries making starch, glue,
                    edged tools, hubs and spokes, brooms, and paper, as well as "an extensive button factory
                    [which] would certainly be a god-send to many poor idle boys and girls of this city."67
            
            This elaborate presentation may sound like so much puffing by a group of "town
                    pushers," but it turned out to be more than this. In many respects it was an authentic
                    blueprint of the manufacturing development that was actually to take place within the next few
                    decades. Whether it was the catalytic effect of this pamphlet, the "natural
                    advantages" of 
                        New Albany
                     finally being recognized, or just a phase of the industrialization that was spreading
                    westward, the town was to have a golden age of industry in the years following the Civil War. The
                    people of 
                        New Albany
                     were to have their opportunity to learn firsthand of factories, mass employment, labor
                    disturbances, and entrepreneurs. Much of the old economic fabric of the earlier decades would be
                    torn away; some of it would remain in a highly modified form. Whether or not these changes were on
                    the whole good or bad for the town's future is debatable. But there was no apparent doubt
                    on the part of those who considered themselves in these years the custodians of the town's
                    destiny.
            The decades from 1830 to 1860 mark 
                        New Albany
                    's youthful, perhaps adolescent, years. The small river town was swept by the
                    events and trends, mostly uncontrollable, which were molding the state of Indiana and the Old
                    Northwest some hundred years ago. In retrospect, much of 
                        New Albany
                    's growth and economic expansion of these years was inevitable, for its
                    location at a key point on the 
                        Ohio
                     was an enviable one in a period when the river counted for so much.
            But however striking and impressive 
                        New Albany
                    's progress may have been to contemporaries—particularly the
                    town's boosters—this was in reality a period of small operations. Commercial
                    activities and opportunities were geared to a sparsely populated and relatively undeveloped
                    hinterland.

                     Local investment capital was scarce—for customarily
                    it was not the rich man who gambled on a trek to the frontier to pit his future with a youthful
                    community. Mechanization and factories, at least in this region, were almost a generation removed.
                    In these years 
                        New Albany
                     could boast that it was one of the largest "cities" in Indiana; yet
                    it had as late as 1860 only about 12,000 inhabitants. It could justly claim to be one of the
                    important emporiums of the state; yet its business was never more than a small fraction of that of
                    its cross-river neighbor, 
                        Louisville
                    . It possessed dozens of small manufacturing shops; but their total output, judged by
                    modern standards, was almost negligible. It was 
                        New Albany
                    's role to be a leader in the state of Indiana when there was not much to lead.
                    And though there was a keen desire on the part of its directing citizens to maintain this
                    pre-eminence for their city, unforeseen obstacles were to prevent these ambitions from being carried
                    out in the exact manner their holders anticipated.

            Keith S. Montgomery*
            
            As a lawyer in 
                        Columbia
                     City for thirty-three years, as governor of Indiana from 1909 to 1913, and as Vice
                    President of the 
                        United States
                     during Woodrow Wilson's two terms, Thomas Riley Marshall
                    (1854–1925) earned his livelihood and his reputation by speaking. He defended clients,
                    won votes, and exhorted the populace to support the nation's efforts in World War I. Though
                    little remembered by the American public today, Marshall achieved national prominence in the first
                    quarter of this century. His speeches on special occasions in such cities as 
                  New York, Chicago,
                            San Francisco
               , and 
                        Washington
                     were heard by large and sometimes distinguished audiences.
            The political speaking in which Marshall participated was restricted to support for the Democratic
                    party and its candidates and to his own campaign oratory. He was never a candidate for membership in
                    a legislative body. In three of his four contests he was elected to office; his only defeat was in a
                    campaign for the office of prosecuting attorney in Indiana's thirty-third judicial
                    district. His two successful candidacies for the vice presidency cannot be considered personal
                    victories because of Woodrow Wilson's strong leadership and popularity. However, the
                    gubernatorial campaign of 1908 in Indiana provided adequate testimony to the effectiveness of
                    Marshall's persuasive speaking and eventually changed him from a small town lawyer to Vice
                    President of the 
                        United States
                    .
            Marshall's nomination as the Democratic candidate for governor of Indiana was the result of
                    his loyalty to the party. Like his father before him, he gave devoted service to the Democratic
                    cause, working for it and its candidates in local contests; like his father, he seemed satisfied to
                    fill this role without personal ambition for public office.
            Early in his junior year at 
                        Wabash
                     College, Marshall organized the Greeley Club to arouse support for the 1872 Democratic
                    candidate for president. When Greeley visited

                            , Indiana.
               
                    
                    
                        Indianapolis
                    , the students in the organization went to a rally on the old State House grounds where
                    eight or ten platforms had been erected for the party orators. Here Marshall made his first public
                    political speech. His classmates boosted him onto a platform where he spoke on the issues of the
                        day.1 Although he remembered this experience with pride, most of his
                    undergraduate political activities were confined to the campus. Occasionally Marshall served as one
                    of the hosts for visiting Democrats;2 more often his efforts were expended in
                    the affairs of his 
                        Wabash
                     literary society where he was a popular leader and speaker.3
            
            Not until he was a practicing lawyer did Marshall have many opportunities for public expression of
                    his political views and those were usually limited to his own community. By 1880, seven years after
                    graduation, he had gained enough support as a local party worker in 
                        Columbia
                     City to receive the unanimous nomination of his party for prosecuting attorney of the
                    thirty-third judicial district, comprising 
                        Kosciusko
                     and 
                        Whitley
                     counties, but a vigorous campaign failed to match the traditional Republican vote in 
                        Kosciusko County
                    . This unsuccessful venture was Marshall's last try for a political office
                    until 1908.4
            
            A speech before the Democratic Editorial Association of Indiana on June 24, 1884, brought him his
                    first statewide recognition. Senator Daniel W. Voorhees, a great orator for the Democrats, spoke on
                    the same program at 
                        Indianapolis
                     where Marshall represented the Young Democrats. Although only thirty years old and
                    relatively unknown in state circles, Marshall was so well received that he was given a place on the
                    platform committee of the state convention.5
            
            The speech itself was a bitter comparison between the typical Democrat who is "filled with a

                        believed the Constitution was only a paper platform which it was bound to respect when it
                            could be made to subserve the interests of bigotry and intolerance, and, in casting it aside
                            upon all other occasions.6
                  
                    
            
            The vituperation that was becoming a trademark of the lawyer's speeches pleased the
                    Democratic editors and the Young Democrats when it was turned against the Republicans whose
                    "fondest boast" was "the insulting, spitting upon and mocking of manhood
                    because it dwelt South of Mason and Dixon's line." This description was offered in
                    contrast to "the refulgent splendor of Tilden and Hendricks" and the young
                    Democrats who, "like young Achilles standing picket guard," are "heroes
                    of an hundred hard fought battles for Constitutional rights—battles as all important to
                    the world as Runnymede." Displayed in the speech was a veneration of the Constitution (a
                    dominant theme in Marshall's speeches) as well as the zeal of a young party stalwart.
            Marshall's party strength grew, but his activities were confined largely to his own
                    Congressional district. He was, for example, chairman of the Twelfth District Democratic Committee
                    in 1896 and 1898 and made speeches throughout the northern section of the state.7 In 1906 he was asked to run for Congress from his district but declined because he was
                    afraid of being elected and had "strong personal reasons" for not going to 
                        Washington
                    . Mainly, he feared that in 
                        Washington
                     he could not, on a congressman's salary, give his wife the sort of life she
                        wanted.8 The spark of ambition was present, however; years previously he had
                    confided to his secretary that the one office he would like to hold was that of governor of
                        Indiana.9
            
            That prospect seemed unlikely. Although Marshall was popular in the northern part of the state and
                    politicians knew him as a sincere worker, the majority of Hoosiers

                     9 Interview with Mrs. Gladys Brenneman, November 26, 1954.
               
                     were generally unfamiliar with his name and his
                    accomplishments.
            The recognized party leader in Indiana, Thomas Taggart, had been a force in national Democratic
                    politics for a generation because Indiana's doubtful vote often helped to determine the
                    outcome of national elections. Despite Taggart's leadership serious revolts sometimes
                    occurred in the ranks of the state organization. In 1908 a clash in the Seventh District between
                    Taggart and 
                        Marion County
                    's Democratic chairman, William Fogarty, caused Taggart to lose some of his
                    control over the approaching state convention.10
            
            When the state convention opened in March at Tomlinson Hall in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the candidate of the Taggart faction for the gubernatorial nomination was Samuel M.
                    Ralston. The temperance and anti-Taggart element of the party favored L. Ert Slack.11 A few favorite son candidates completed the roster, one of whom, Thomas R. Marshall of 
                        Columbia
                     City, was nominated and supported by the Twelfth District organization.12
            
            Even though the division between Ralston and Slack made a stalemate a possibility, Marshall, with his
                    usual fatalism, had done little to forward his own cause. To the delegates he represented little
                    more than a receptive candidate whose original supporters were staying with him on every ballot.
                    This situation prevailed through the fourth ballot when Taggart forced Ralston to withdraw from the
                    race. With the eye of the practical politician, Taggart had seen that Slack was going to win unless
                    Ralston's votes were given to Marshall.13
            
            The convention was in a turmoil as the fifth ballot was taken. Ralston's withdrawal assured
                    either Marshall or Slack of the nomination. 
                        Marshall supporters, all of whom had been supplied with small American flags, were on their
                            feet shouting hoarsely, overturning chairs, and waving their emblems madly, as one county
                            after another that previously had been in the Ralston column joined the Marshall supporters
                            and cast solid votes for the 
                                Columbia

                     14
                            Ibid. The vote on the fifth and final ballot was Marshall 719½,
                            Slack 630½, Conn 21½.
               
                     When the count was made official, Slack escorted Marshall into
                    the hall for the speech of acceptance.
            Although Marshall was clearly victorious, the scene was charged with the tension that had prevailed
                    throughout the balloting, and the enmities between the factions had not been dispelled. As the
                    nominee began to speak, the delegates were on their feet and pressing forward. He began with
                    "a halting voice and plainly with an effort at self-control,"15 but he quickly regained his composure. Then "the eager men in front heard a speech
                    of acceptance such as few of them had ever listened to." Short and thin, the man did not
                    look impressive, but he could talk—"he knew just what to say."
            He did know "just what to say," for in his opening sentences he established his own
                    position but at the same time salved the wounds of his opponents.
            
                    Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen of the Convention, Ladies and Gentlemen—It has always been one
                        of the fortunes of my life that the bitter and the sweet should be intermingled. I never
                        overcome a rival that I do not feel mercy for him, and when I overcome friends there is a
                        feeling of sadness as well as of gladness. It is so here today.16
               
                
            After a statement of his belief in the principles of the party and of the Constitution, he referred
                    to the schism in the state organization and contrasted this to the loyalty of the Roman legions that
                    would "pass before the new ruler and swear allegiance to him." He demanded and
                    received the same pledge from the delegates. 
                        You have chosen me to lead you in this fight, and I accept your commission with the most
                            sincere thanks and appreciation of the honor, but in this hour I tender the nomination back
                            to you if there be one man in the convention who will not stand behind me.17
                  
                     The convention roared its approval.
            In this single speech Marshall had vaulted from the ranks of the party faithful to a position of
                    leadership. He was immediately branded "one of the best thinkers, best

                     talkers, best campaigners in the Democratic party."18 Thus in an impromptu speech lasting less than five minutes, Marshall had
                    emotionally reunited the party; many "that might not have been for him" supported
                    him because of this speech.19 Both anti-Taggart and Taggart men joined in the
                    chorus, and the party harmony that prevailed foreshadowed a successful campaign.
            Congressman James E. Watson was nominated the Republican candidate for governor in 1908 when that
                    party was also plagued with internal strife; but unlike the Democrats the Republicans had been
                    unable to heal the rift before the campaign.20 This was of some advantage to
                    Marshall, for the voters broke party lines when the major issue of the campaign became the
                    temperance question.
            The Republican state platform contained a plank that called for the control of the sale of liquor on
                    a county option basis; that is, if any county voted "dry," no liquor could be sold
                    anywhere within its borders. Because the rural vote was dry and could generally outvote the county
                    seats and other towns, nearly nine-tenths of the counties of the state would vote dry under this
                    system. The Democrats were also for local option, but the local unit favored by them was the city,
                    ward, or township. Obviously the number of taverns would be greater under the latter plan. Upon the
                    local option issue the major battle lines were drawn, and presumably the election would determine
                    whether the county or the township would be the local unit.21
            
            Watson, recognizing his strongest argument, devoted the bulk of his speeches to the liquor
                        question.22 Marshall, on the other hand, usually covered in his speeches the
                    entire Democratic platform, the principal planks of which were a new primary election law, direct
                    election of 
                        United States

            Although Marshall's first major address was delivered at 
                        Richmond
                     on June 2, 1908, his intensive campaigning began on August 22 with a speech at 
                        Salem
                     and continued without pause until November 1. Marshall claimed that his 169 speeches
                    represented the most strenuous campaign ever made in the state.24 This
                    information alone refutes the latter part of the statement by Marshall's biographer that
                    "the spirit of resignation that came with maturity led him to do nothing to obtain the
                    nomination, and once nominated less than is usually done to win the election."25 The assistant secretary of the Democratic State Committee in 1908 remembered
                    that "he believed he won because it was foreordained that he should be
                        Governor."26 Marshall's Presbyterian fatalism must have
                    prepared him for any eventuality, but "resignation" and
                    "foreordination" were nevertheless given every encouragement to operate
                    successfully.
            Marshall believed that he and the Democrats could win if their message were brought to a sufficient
                    number of voters. He was fully aware of the odds against him, however, and of the strength of the
                    Republicans who had controlled the state for twelve years. Since James Watson, the Republican
                    nominee, was a polished orator and known to the electorate because of his seven terms in
                        Congress,27 Marshall knew that he would have to build his own reputation
                    through his speeches. For these reasons "he did not dare to overlook a single crossing of
                    two country roads in his `whirlwind' speech-making tour of the Hoosier State."28 Obviously this remark cannot be accepted literally, but Marshall did speak
                    over the entire state.
            Many persons came to hear the candidates as they spoke to numerous audiences, for "the real
                    amusement of those early days was not golf nor mah jong. It was local politics. It was played by
                    everybody with the zest of the

                     confirmed gambler."29 The
                    audiences were attentive and eagerly listened to the speaker's ideas.
            When the candidate arrived in town by train, automobile, or, on rare occasions, horse and buggy, the
                    local dignitaries assembled and offered the official greeting. Then off to a reception or, more
                    frequently, two receptions—one for the men and one for the women. The nominee's
                    wife chatted with the local ladies about her family and theirs; the men discussed seriously the
                    outlook for their district in the approaching election.
            If the party workers were energetic and could expect a good turnout, a torchlight parade wound
                    through the town, gathering celebrants on the way to the opera house, skating rink, or, if an
                    afternoon rally, perhaps the courthouse yard. The audiences were large and enthusiastic. They
                    entered into the spirit of the moment with words of encouragement—`You'll be
                    elected governor, old pal"—and shouted answers to the speaker's
                    rhetorical questions. Despite the major distraction of a severe drought that lasted from the middle
                    of August until the end of September, farm families were numerous in the audiences and made the day
                    a holiday occasion.
            One or two thousand persons usually came to hear the speeches in each locale, but both at 
                        Huntingburg
                     and Petersburg more than 4,000 listened to Marshall. At 
                        Covington
                     the estimate was 5,000 to 6,000 while a total of 12,500 persons heard Marshall in his
                    four speeches at 
                        Indianapolis
                    .30 These audiences were representative of those who heard Marshall
                    in the 1908 campaign when the total vote for the several candidates was 712,000.31
            
            The newspapers, regardless of party affiliation, recorded that Marshall drew larger audiences than
                    Watson. The 
                  
                            Lafayette
                         Morning Journal, a Republican publication, surmised that Marshall's
                    large audience was full of Republicans there to observe his "rambling fashion" and
                        "sarcasm."32 Many were curious to hear what this Democrat
                    had to say since he was supporting the less popular side of the temperance question. Soon, however,
                    his ideas and use of language were attracting the crowds.

            At the speech in 
                        Richmond
                     Marshall's listeners had been principally Democrats waiting to hear his
                    interpretation of their platform, but later audiences included doubting Republicans,
                    Prohibitionists, and independents, as well as Democrats. At 
                        Richmond
                     he had spoken against the past record and printed platform of the Republican party, but
                    soon Watson and others were to speak and their charges had to be countered. Marshall, experienced as
                    debater and lawyer, adapted his techniques of argument and rebuttal to the heterogeneous audiences
                    as well as to the special methods of attack by the opposition.
            The Republicans established their main argument early in the campaign. Watson, the Republican
                    nominee, in his opening speech of the active campaign at 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , announced: "The real question in Indiana this year, the `paramount
                    issue' is, shall the brewers dominate Indiana politics, or shall the people
                        rule?"33 That is, would there be township option and thus saloons
                    in nearly every town as the Democrats wanted, or would "the people rule" by voting
                    Republican and gaining county control of the sale of liquor.
            The brewers themselves added fuel to this argument by contributing openly and freely to the
                    Democratic cause.34 Public denials by party officials did not stem the
                    criticism, and Republicans estimated that the brewers' fund had reached a million dollars
                    before the campaign began.35 The Republicans needed only to associate Marshall
                    with these events to create a seemingly unassailable position from which to attack. To support their
                    stand widespread rumors were spread that he was not a "sober man." The charges
                    became so acrimonious that the minister of the Presbyterian church in 
                        Columbia
                     City, the Rev. Alexander D. Sutherland, arose to Marshall's defense:
                    "Mr. Marshall is not only not a drunkard, but on the contrary is a total abstainer; a
                    practical, consistent temperance man, yet not a hypocrit nor a fanatic."36 The problem that faced Marshall was how to maintain his own integrity and support his
                    party's platform while at the same time disclaiming the aid the brewers were giving to the
                    party.

            One of the chief means of persuasion for a speaker is the personal or ethical appeal he has with an
                    audience. Marshall sometimes defended his character by a direct denial of the opposition's
                    attacks. At 
                        Muncie
                    , for example, he tried to clarify his personal position: 
                        I am not the brewer's candidate for Governor of Indiana. Not a dollar has been
                            raised for me by any brewer… . I have not a dollar of any man's money in
                            my pocket, except what I borrowed of the First National Bank of 
                                Columbia
                             City, Indiana, and unless you fellows are kind to me in November I'll
                            have to work like sin for three years to pay that back. But when I say that I am not the
                            brewers' candidate I mean that neither am I the lawyers' candidate, the
                            blacksmiths' candidate, the preachers' candidate nor the Anti-Saloon
                            League candidate. I am the candidate of the Democratic party and I stand upon its
                                platform.37
                  
                    
            
            Marshall was proud of his freedom from special interests, and he often varied the above remarks by
                    telling his audiences how much the campaign was costing him. This figure was $3,750 by
                    the end of the campaign; nearly $2,000 was spent for travel and $1,800 was
                    donated to the party at the request of the state committee. He accepted no contributions for his
                    travel or living expenses and continued this policy in future campaigns so as to avoid obligation to
                    financial supporters.38
            
            Another kind of ethical appeal brought a reprimand from the state committee. In the opening
                    statements of his speeches Marshall usually said: "If you think I would not make a good
                    Governor of Indiana, it is your duty to vote against me. If you think I would make a good Governor,
                    it is your duty to vote for me." This was not approved as practical politics, but he
                    ignored the advice to eliminate these remarks and in so doing probably contributed to the impression
                    of honesty and sincerity.39 Those remarks seemed as naïve at that
                    time as they do today, but they only reinforced the candidness for which he became noted.
            A speaker's physical appearance also affects a listener's reaction to a speech, and
                    in the case of Tom Marshall this was not a positive factor. He was not a commanding figure and
                    audiences that had never seen or heard him before were

                     amused as he rose to speak. "The singed cat,"
                    "a lean and malarial Hoosier," and "the storekeeper at Pumpkin
                    Center" were epithets applied in the attempts to describe this "typical"
                    Hoosier's appearance. Although he had never farmed or lived on a farm, there was a homespun
                    flavor about him and he somehow gave the impression that he should be exchanging stories with
                    cronies in a country store.40
            
            He was a small man, weighing about 125 pounds, with iron-gray hair, a large head, predominant ears,
                    and a bushy mustache that almost hid his mouth. Yet, on closer inspection, an observer could see
                    that he was well groomed and had a certain dignity of appearance. One reporter after interviewing
                    Marshall detailed him in fashion-plate manner: 
                        You would not guess it from his photographs, but he is urbane, from his well-cut locks to his
                            small, well-shod foot and the tips of his perfectly manicured fingers. The taste that
                            selects his ties transcends all criticism. Robert Chambers and other authorities on details
                            of the personal proprieties would describe the Hoosier Governor's clothes as
                            `well-built' and himself as `well-groomed.' To silence the slanders of the
                            camera, it remains only to note the Phi Beta Kappa key (of unusual weight and elegance) on
                            his fob, the ring on his finger, the stick in the gloved hand, the large, round, real,
                            tortoise-shell spectacles which add distinction while they relieve the wearied eye of the
                                wearer.41
                  
                    
            
            Marshall was not a formidable or a handsome figure; he was "picturesque," and his
                    appearance probably did not contribute to his prestige with an audience. When he began to speak,
                    however, what he said and how he said it overcame any doubts that might have been caused by his
                    physical characteristics. The comments about Marshall's voice and delivery indicate that he
                    persuaded some listeners because of his effective presentation of arguments.
            One source mentioned Marshall's delivery of the 
                        Richmond
                     speech in June as follows: 
                        The impression he made was a good impression. He did not jump and prance about the stage and
                            swing his arms like flails. Coolly, deliberately, and without passion he advanced his
                            arguments as if addressing a jury—the whole people seemed to be in a jury box
                            before him.42

                     These conclusions were verified by reports given on other
                    occasions.
            Mainly, the speaker's delivery gave the impression of sincerity. This direct and unaffected
                    manner was extolled by a reporter who heard Marshall's campaign speech at 
                        Evansville
                     early in September of 1908: 
                        A man with a bull dog jaw, every line of his countenance showing vigor, determination and
                            earnestness, his step quick and firm, a kindly smile showing over his features, walked onto
                            the stage at the People's theater last night to receive the plaudits of a great
                            audience. What manner of man he was, no one knew because he had never spoken in 
                                Evansville
                            . He was on trial before an audience of thinking men in the second city of
                            Indiana. He began like a fighter stripping for action, his eyes afire with the light of a
                            message he was about to deliver, his manner showing he was prepared to say it with solar
                            plexus force. Before he was done he had conquered the doubters, had won applause from
                            strangers and stamped himself as the greatest campaigner that Indiana has known since Blue
                            Jeans Williams.43
                  
                    
            
            His voice was variously labeled as clear, penetrating, forceful, pleasant, and musical. It was well
                    modulated and in the campaign it was to prove adequate for stump speaking out of doors. Although he
                    never shouted, the force of his voice amazed some: "in fact, when he lets it out into full
                    sway one wonders where such a small man can keep all the noise stored up."44 His gestures were natural and those who heard him speak were not distracted by extremes of
                    physical action. "He never sawed the air,"45 but photographs
                    and occasional reports about his delivery depict him with arms extended and using a pointed finger
                    for punctuation and emphasis.
            Years of experience had created the easy, natural, yet forceful delivery for which Marshall became
                    noted, but his effortless fluency amazed some of his auditors, causing one woman to turn to Mrs.
                    Marshall while Marshall was speaking and remark: "Isn't it wonderful the way the
                    Governor talks without thinking!"46
            
            The term "oratorical" was seldom applied to Marshall's delivery; instead
                    it was called an "easy conversational style"

                     or a "sincere approach." Even the 
                        Evansville
                     reporter summarized his rhapsodical account with the phrases
                    "straight-out-from-the-shoulder fashion" and "a man in
                        earnest."47 Marshall's delivery did not lack energy but it
                    did lack histrionics. The chief contribution of this direct, conversational manner was the
                    impression of sincerity. When audiences left his speeches in the 1908 campaign, they were convinced
                    that this man placed loyalty to country, state, and political party above personal desire.
            It was the task of both candidates to deal with the issues of the campaign in the most persuasive
                    manner possible, and numerous pre-election activities increased the tempo of the political conflict.
                    For example, in the midst of the campaigning both candidates had to shift their arguments on the
                    liquor question because of a special session of the state legislature. Governor J. Frank Hanly, the
                    Republican incumbent, called the representatives and senators together on September 18 and eight
                    days later the Republican majority passed a county option law. Watson opposed this tactic but was
                    forced to support it.18 Marshall immediately leaped to the attack, and the day before the session
                    was to convene he spoke at Rock-port: 
                        Governor Hanly is a shining example of one-man power. Governor Hanly goes on the old despotic
                            theory that the King can do no wrong. He does not grant to the people of this State the
                            right to think and decide for themselves, but sets himself up as their dictator to tell them
                            what they must do and what they must not do. He measures all things and all persons by his
                            own ideas. This I contend is a violation of constitutional government, for under a
                            constitutional government the people themselves rule.49
                  
                    
            
            Even when he was speaking on other issues, Marshall applied his wit against the special session. At 
                        Terre Haute
                    , for example, he was questioning the brief financial statement issued by the
                    Republicans. He compared it to a report made by "the trustees of Paw Paw Township to the
                    honorable board of commissioners" which read "All paid in and all paid
                    out."

                    ‘No,’ added Mr. Marshall, ‘I want to correct myself. Not quite
                        all of the state funds are paid out. Governor Hanly has called a special session of the
                        Legislature to spend the little that remains in the bottom.’50
               
                
            This sort of banter was expected by politicians of both sides, but Marshall's friends,
                    remembering his sharp-tongued courtroom invective, feared he would be unable to restrain himself on
                    the stump. He could not be expected to eliminate sarcasm, but they hoped he would control it. He
                    must have exercised admirable restraint in the following portion of a talk at 
                        Covington
                    : 
                        I have never said that any clerk received $7,500 as salary. I have said that
                            $7,500 men are drawing their salaries and devoting their time to politics. When I
                            give the figures furnished me, they call me a liar. When I ask questions they answer me
                            evasively. To call a man a liar is not an argument. When a man is getting the worst of the
                            argument he uses such language. Extravagance is the word that I use now. When the books are
                            opened—as they will be—I hope I need use no stronger words.
                        I will not bandy epithets with the Governor. He may forget his high office, but I will
                                not.51
                  
                    
            
            Marshall was not as successful at self-control on another occasion. He anticipated the opposition of
                    all the "dry" forces on the liquor question, but when the churches gave voice to
                    their disapproval he was openly vexed: 
                        I thought … that when the holy oil of consecration was poured on a
                            preacher's head, he was dedicated to the service of God, and not to the service of
                            the Republican party. There are still some preachers left in Indiana who think it is their
                            duty to preach the gospel and not to beat a brass drum in a political procession.52
                  
                     This gained nothing but the ire of the ministers, and "Brass Drum"
                    organizations sprang up over the state. The Republican 
                  
                            Lafayette
                         Morning Journal and Weekly Edition happily editorialized that "he
                    made a much better impression when confining his remarks to 
                        Greece
                     and 
                        Rome
                    ."53 This was a reference to Marshall's extensive
                    use of classical allusions in almost all of his speeches, a practice derived from his training in
                    the classical curriculum at 
                        Wabash
                     College.

            Fortunately for Marshall he was able to apply his wit with less abuse and more success as a
                    persuasive device during the remainder of the campaign. Two further examples demonstrate this.
                    Throughout the campaign he said that it was the governor's duty to sign all the bills the
                    legislature passed unless there was doubt as to their constitutionality. Watson asked in one of his
                    speeches if that meant that Marshall would sign bills to legalize murder and gambling if the
                    legislature should pass them. Marshall quickly replied to this absurdity in like manner: 
                        Mr. Watson asks me if I will sign such bills if a Republican Legislature passes
                            them… . All I have to say is that Mr. Watson certainly has a very poor opinion of
                            the Republican candidates for the Legislature if he thinks they will pass such bills.54
                  
                     He clarified his support of the township option law with similar levity: 
                        I am a believer in local self-government. I believe that no man has a right to call in his
                            neighbor to help him lick his wife until he finds he can't lick her himself.
                        I don't talk to Democrats this year. … It is not necessary. I have been
                            in fifty counties of Indiana and every Democrat I have met has had a smile on his face just
                            such as he had when he kissed his wife for the first time.55
                  
                    
            
            This form of audience adaptation was accompanied by more direct appeals. In a number of speeches
                    Marshall would turn to some of the elderly men who wore the button of the Grand Army of the
                    Republic, pause, and say: 
                        If you boys who wore the blue had not offered yourselves as a sacrifice there would have been
                            an aristocracy in this country that would have ultimately destroyed the republic.56
                  
                     A conspicuous play for the sympathy of the audience was vividly recalled by a person who
                    heard Marshall speak at 
                        Crawfordsville
                    . The meeting was in the old Music Hall which was so crowded on this occasion that some
                    of the listeners had to sit on the stage. The following sentences opened the speech:

                        Different things have stirred men's hearts in ages past. To the Greek, it was
                            thoughts of Marathon and Thermopylae; to the Roman, it was the Rubicon and 
                                Carthage
                            ; to the Frenchman, it was Tours and the fall of the Bastile; to the Englishman,
                            it was Hastings and Waterloo; to the American, it is Valley Forge and 
                                Gettysburg
                            , but the thing that makes my heart beat faster are thoughts of 
                                Wabash
                             College in 
                                Crawfordsville
                            .57
                  
                     The words had the desired effect, for every person in the building was on his feet and
                    cheering by the end of the address.
            Marshall also adapted his language to the various audiences. His figures of speech were based on
                    knowledge of his listeners and contributed to an informality of style that had clarity as its chief
                    virtue.
            
                    Do you believe that any man or combination of men has the right to obtain legislation that will
                        inure to the few and be to the detriment of the many? Has any one any such rights, God-given or
                        man-bestowed? If you believe they have not you are a Democrat, and though I am not a preacher
                        and have never taken on holy orders, I will do so now and take you into full
                        communion… . The Republican party and prosperity are not trotting in double harness
                        this year. The bottom is out of the full dinner pail.58
               
                
            There was unanimity among the newspaper reports that Marshall was unexcelled in presenting his side
                    of a question to an audience in a way that could be easily understood by all. Even the publications
                    of the opposition forces grudgingly conceded that he spoke logically and persuasively.
            Of course, if the voters failed to understand the message when they heard it, they had only to read
                    their newspapers for an account of the same message presented at another place. By the last few
                    weeks of the campaign the audiences and the occasions were described in the articles, but the
                    speeches were mentioned only as the same ones that had been presented at other places. Mrs.
                    Marshall, who traveled with her husband on all of his speaking engagements, claimed that she heard
                    one speech delivered 169 times and, if called on, she could deliver it herself.59 Thus, not only repetition within a speech but repetition throughout the campaign was
                    characteristic.

            Marshall was aware of the short memories of voters, and in a story told by George Fife of the 
                  
                            New York
                         Evening World, he demonstrated a perception of the transient effect of the
                    spoken word and of William Jennings Bryan's magnificent but fleeting hold on an audience.
                    During one of his presidential campaigns, Bryan crossed Indiana for a number of speeches and
                    Marshall was along as one of the representatives of the state organization. As Bryan was about to
                    leave the state, Marshall expressed his opinion with his customary bluntness: 
                        You are making a great mistake, Mr. Bryan. What you ought to do is to bring along a
                            ballot-box and fasten it to the rear platform and let the people vote for you while you are
                            speaking. You'll get a great many more votes that way than you will on Election
                                Day.60
                  
                     Needless to say, Bryan's very necessary support was never given to
                    Marshall's political aspirations on the national level because of the above incident as
                    well as basic political differences.61
            
            Thomas Marshall's speeches in the Indiana campaign of 1908 were marked by effective audience
                    adaptation, arguments from facts and assertions, and a clear and informal style. Underlying the
                    structure and style of every speech was the element of sincerity. The conversational mode of
                    delivery, constancy in support of the Democratic platform, consistency in statements of freedom from
                    special interests all added force to this impression. Marshall said he was and would be
                    unimpeachable, and the voters believed him. The immediate audience reaction to the speeches was
                    cheering and applauding; the election results proved that their approval was not temporary.
            On the eve of the election the political speculators believed that William Howard Taft would defeat
                    Bryan for the presidential electors of Indiana, but the odds were even on the gubernatorial race.62
                    If the pattern of previous years was followed, the Republicans would win. Not since 1872 when Thomas
                    A. Hendricks, a Democrat, was elected governor had Indiana given its vote for the presidency to the
                    candidate

                    of the other.
            Also, the Republicans seemed to be riding the crest of a tide of successes in recent Indiana
                    elections. The last Democratic victory had been in 1892. In 1896 the Republican margin in the
                    presidential election was 18,000; in 1900 it was 26,000. The Republican governors won by
                    "only slightly less decisive" margins. The difference in 1904 was the largest
                    since the Civil War, with Roosevelt obtaining a majority of 94,000 and Hanly elected governor by
                    84,000. The Republicans maintained their average lead of 30,000 in the off-year vote two years
                        later.63 A significant shift would have to occur if Marshall and the
                    Democrats were to win.
            The balloting took place on November 3 with both parties, as usual, stating their confidence as to
                    the outcome. The vote was close, and it was several days before some of the winners of state offices
                    were known. This was not true of Taft or Marshall. Although the exact pluralities were unavailable
                    for nearly three days, the Democrats conceded the state to Taft and the Republicans admitted that
                    Marshall had defeated Watson.64
            
            The total vote was more than 712,000 and the Democrats had won a partial victory. Eleven of the
                    thirteen congressmen elected were Democrats, but of the eleven positions on the state ticket only
                    three were gained by Democrats: the superintendent of public instruction by 762 votes, the
                    lieutenant governor by 1,672, and the governor by 14,809.65 Even though
                    Marshall's margin of victory was only 2 per cent of the total vote, that was superior to
                    the margin of any other candidate in either party. He had been a dark horse for his party's
                    nomination and had entered the campaign unknown to the constituency. Now he had won the most
                    decisive victory of any of the candidates.
            Newspaper analysts of the day offered numerous post hoc reasons for Marshall's victory.
                    Among them were "personal popularity" and "personal triumph."
                    These seemed to be the only justifications for a vote that ignored party lines on the state and
                    national tickets. The other reasons offered

                     for Marshall's triumph over Watson were varied. Some
                    said that the voters were tired of the long years of Republican domination. Others blamed Governor
                    Hanly's "arrogance" in calling the special session during the
                    campaign—Watson blamed his loss on that event.66 Most of the analysts
                    agreed, however, that Marshall had won on his own merit. The 
                        Indianapolis
                     News said that "but for the brewers and saloon keepers it is believed that
                    Marshall would have a greater plurality than he has."67 A Republican
                    newspaper concluded that "he was not elected because of the saloon issue, but in spite of
                        it."68 The wisest summation read: 
                        The causes that led to the anomalous political result in the Indiana elections are too
                            complex to be discussed hurriedly. It may be said, however, that Mr. Marshall's
                            personal charms, his strong character, and clean life together with his admitted great
                            abilities have made his triumph in a great measure personal.69
                  
                    
            
            The evidence is more than circumstantial that many of the thousands of voters Marshall attracted to
                    himself were convinced by his speaking. Some Democratic candidates had been elected on the
                    progressive wave that had begun to sweep the Middle West, but Marshall had preached old-fashioned
                    Jeffersonian doctrine and "inveighed against most of the new fangled notions in
                    politics… . The people heard him so gladly that they elected him Governor in a State that
                    had not gone Democratic in two decades."70 Virtually unknown when he
                    was nominated, he had established his political views and his strength of character by means of oral
                    communication. Claude G. Bowers heard Marshall speak on numerous occasions during the campaign and
                    believed that Marshall "contributed greatly to his success in the campaign by his
                    speeches." Among other things he "talked plainly" and "created
                    the impression of sincerity, and he delighted the people with his wit and humor."71 It is no overstatement that Marshall "fairly talked himself into an
                        election."72

            The strength of his character was probably his strongest single persuasive device. Throughout the
                    weeks of speechmaking his statements on all issues were both consistent and clear; he objected to
                    the deception and subterfuge practiced by some politicians. Not only is this candidness apparent
                    from the speeches themselves, but it is in accordance with Marshall's philosophy as
                    expressed in his Recollections: "The things which many people conceive to be necessary and
                    advisable in politics I either despised or imagined to be unjustified and ill-advised."73 This is a commendable and an unusually honest expression of personal
                    integrity, but an attitude which was inimical to his later political fortune. In the Indiana
                    gubernatorial campaign of 1908, however, Thomas R. Marshall was successful because of his clear
                    presentation and consistent interpretation of the campaign issues.

            The long and distinguished career of Professor William O. Lynch came to an end March 29, 1957, at the
                    home of his daughter, Mrs. Alfred L. Spurlock in Brownstown, Indiana. Born on a farm near Delphi,
                    Indiana, September 10, 1870, his early life was closely associated with the school system of the
                    state. He attended country school near his home and was later graduated from the high school of
                    Delphi. He served as teacher and principal of various schools of his neighborhood until he went to
                    Indiana State Teachers College at 
                        Terre Haute
                    , Indiana. Here he took the three year course and then became a high school teacher in 
                        Elkhart
                    , Indiana, where he taught from 1896 to 1901. He married Bertha Thomas in 1894.
            After two years of study at Indiana University Professor Lynch received the A.B. degree in 1903.
                    While a student at Indiana he became a charter member and the first president of the History Club.
                    Returning to 
                        Elkhart
                    , he taught history in the high school for an additional four years before spending a
                    summer at the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                    . Here he studied with Frederick J. Turner, Richard T. Ely, Edward A. Ross, Ulrich B.
                    Phillips, Herman V. Ames, and Dana C. Munro. Professor Lynch wrote his thesis on "The Party
                    Relations of John C. Calhoun," and was awarded the Master's degree at 
                        Wisconsin
                     in 1908. In the fall he became assistant professor of history at Indiana State Teachers
                    College. During the school year of 1911–1912 he studied history at Harvard University,
                    holding an Austin fellowship. He returned to Indiana State where he was advanced to the
                    professorship in 1917. When Ball State Teachers College was founded at 
                        Muncie
                    , the history department was assigned to Professor Lynch.
            In 1920 Professor Lynch accepted an invitation from Indiana University to become acting professor of
                    history. The following year he was made professor of history, a position he held until he retired in
                    1941. He also served as acting chairman of the history department in 1925–1926, and
                    during the

                            Indiana University. From 1941 to 1955 he served as editor of the Indiana
                                Magazine of History.
                  
               
                     second semester of 1937–1938. He taught American
                    history, specializing in the history of political parties and in the history of the South. Having
                    taught at three of the four state institutions of higher learning in Indiana, Professor Lynch was as
                    well acquainted with the university system as he was with the public school system of the state.
                    During the summers of 1925 and 1927 he was visiting professor at the University of 
                        Alabama
                    , and in 1930 at the University of 
                        Tennessee
                    .
            During his lifetime Professor Lynch published two books, several articles in historical journals, a
                    number of shorter pieces, and several autobiographical chapters. Fifty Years of Party
                        Warfare (
                        Indianapolis
                    , 1931) was reviewed in the American Historical Review as "a
                    sane and detailed summary of the early development of American parties," and "a
                    product of painstaking research and much thought." History of Indiana State
                        Teachers College (
                        Terre Haute
                    , 1946) was reviewed as a well documented account and an excellent portrayal of a
                    Hoosier teachers college, the author of which was quite aware of the larger environment which
                    included officials, faculty, students, and graduates. The latter book appeared after he had retired
                    from teaching. His articles appeared chiefly in the 
                  
                            Mississippi
                         Valley Historical Review, the Journal of Southern History, and the Indiana Magazine of History.

                    biographical sketches in the latter journal.
            Professor Lynch belonged to many organizations of various types. He was a delegate to the Indiana
                    State Progressive Party Convention in 1912 and 1914. In 1918 he was a member of the Liberty Guard in 
                        Terre Haute
                    . The historical societies to which he belonged included the American Historical
                    Association, 
                  
                     1 The principal articles include the following: "Anti-Slavery

            Throughout his life Professor Lynch revealed the quiet and unpretentious spirit of a man who wanted
                    to make things better. Much of his personal satisfaction from teaching was the opportunity it gave
                    to him to help young people realize their potentialities. Always he was concerned with finding
                    positions and advancements for his friends, friends who were to be found throughout the nation and
                    in the many organizations of which he was a member. He believed in the value of study and teaching
                    and gave much of his life to this work.

            Letters of John Traub, Twenty-ninth Indiana Infantry
            Edited by Paul Fatout*
            
            The Twenty-ninth Indiana Volunteer Infantry was mustered in on August 27, 1861. After months at Camp
                    Nevin, 
                        Kentucky
                    , and other points on the 
                        Louisville
                     and 
                        Nashville
                     Railroad, the regiment saw action at 
                        Shiloh
                     on April 7, 1862, and took part in the siege of Corinth. In the Army of the Cumberland,
                    the Twenty-ninth fought in the three days' battle at Stone River, 
                        Tennessee
                    , and in September, 1863, suffered its heaviest casualties in the bloody battle of
                    Chicka-mauga. After minor engagements in 
                        Georgia
                     and 
                        Alabama
                    , the regiment spent most of the last year of the war on garrison duty at 
                        Chattanooga
                     in the command of Major General George H. Thomas.1
            
            John Traub, of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , enlisted as a private in Company F on October 1, 1861. Promoted to sergeant, then to
                    first sergeant, he became a second lieutenant on June 15, 1865, and was honorably discharged at 
                        Marietta
                    , 
                        Georgia
                    , on December 2 of that year.2
            
            Evidently a good correspondent, he wrote fairly regularly to his brother, George, in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Most of these letters have disappeared, but two, now in the possession of the
                    editor's family, have survived. They reveal John Traub as a matter-of-fact man, voicing no
                    patriotic bombast, dismissing a big battle as "the fight," expressing his opinion
                    of commanders, listening to rumors, grumbling, thinking of home:

                        I suppose you may think it quite strange to write you a letter so soon. We do not
                                    know how soon we may leave here and as I had my picture taken today I thought it
                                    best to get it on the way as soon as possible. I suppose you will all know me I
                                    think it is a very good picture. I had it taken to my own taste I hope you will
                                    finde know fault with it. We were orderd out last night to strengthen the Picket

                                    Brigade of Reb's they having several peice's of artillery with
                                    them. They had got in between our froage train and our picket line so our men could
                                    not send in for reinforcement so thair only chance was to cut thair way through The
                                    reporte is that we lost 15 wagons 2 men killed and two men wounded in the 93 
                                        Ohio
                                    . By all appearance's it seem's to me as if we will
                                    have a heavy fight on hand before long. I may be mistaken. If we have to fight them
                                    here I hope we will give them the best th[r]ashing they every had. And the sooner
                                    the better. It seem's the same to me as when we were lying in camp before
                                    Corint do not know what hour or minute we may be called to fight or march. I hope
                                    this will soon be settled and we all can retur[n] home again. I think I writen about
                                    all. May this find you all in the best of health. I still keep good health and am
                                    very thankfull for it. give my best love to all.

                        P.S. You will see on the Picture that the U. S. is upside down, that is a fault
                                    of my own I thought and so did some of my Bunk mates by turning it upside-down it
                                    would come all right on the picture. And some of them of them sayed it  would not. So I had it taken upside down to settle the
                                    dispute. By having it on the way we ware them the S come's before the U. So
                                    thare is not much difference. So no more J. Traub. P. S. Write to me as

                        Dear Brother George
                        Your long looked for letter I received today. I thought something was wrong that you
                                    did not write sooner I am sorry to hear that William is sick I hope it may not prove
                                    to be the small pox. It is my earnest wish that he may be a getting better fast ere
                                    this is received. You say you saw them prisinor's that were taken at
                                    Vixburg it was quite a squad. I think if Gen Grant succeed's in taken
                                    Vichburg and the Army in thare it will not be long in putting down this rebellion.
                                    For that is one of thair main strong hold's. And will give our
                                    armie's down thare a chance to co-operate with us. May we be more
                                    successfull every day. I expect you have received that letter I wrote you of the
                                    31st so it will be of no use to write the same again. I expect we will make a
                                    forward move, it looks so at the present. It is always our luck to build breastworks
                                    and fortification's for others it is said that Van Cleave[General Horatio
                                    VanCleve]'s division occupys this place and we move on as usual. Our
                                    brigade has been to work every day except Sunday and sometime's Sunday, and
                                    night as well as day time every scince the fight here. Now as the most of the work
                                    and roughest of the work is done we are releived. They always ride a free horse to
                                    death. This is our case in most instances***. thare is one thing certan it will not
                                    last alway's… . We have had some very refreshing showers the
                                    past week which make's the weather very comfortable. We have
                                    Order's to be ready at a moment's notice with seven days
                                    ration's three in our haver-sack's and four in our
                                    knap-sack's we have always ten days rations in advance. It is with Gen
                                    Rosecranc [William S. Rosecrans] something like the cat watching a mouse He is
                                    watching [General Braxton] Bragg with keen eye for fear he might be reinforceing  the Rebble's at Vicsburg. Gen
                                    Rosecrance keeps wakeing them up occasionly and make's them beleive he is
                                    comeing by snatching off thair pickets now and then. Our mounted Infantry and
                                    cavelry are working nobely ever scince we have been here. I suppose if Old [General
                                    Don Carlos] Buell had command yet we would strike for 
                                        Louisville
                                     again. I am getting most to long. I will close hoping that these few
                                    words may finde you all enjoying the best of health my love to all.

                                    about it. May I hear from you soon and hear that William is getting better fast is

            An Indiana Volunteer Advises His Neighbors
            Edited by Charles G. Talbert*
            
            The Thirty-first Indiana Volunteer Infantry was mustered into service for three years at 
                        Terre Haute
                     on September 15, 1861. After active participation in the Battle of 
                        Shiloh
                    , the Thirty-first was assigned to the Fourth Division of the Army of the 
                        Ohio
                    , under the command of General William Nelson, and took part in the siege of Corinth. It
                    moved with Buell's army into 
                  Alabama,
                            Mississippi
               , and 
                        Tennessee
                    . Between December 31, 1862, and January 2, 1863, the Thirty-first saw action at the
                    Battle of Stone River, and on September 19 and 20, 1863, at the Battle of
                    Chickamauga. At the time the letter below was written, the Thirty-first was commanded by Colonel
                    John T. Smith, and was in the First Brigade of the Second Division of the Twenty-first Corps. The
                    corps commander was Major General Thomas L. Crittenden, the division commander was Major General
                    John M. Palmer, and the brigade commander was Brigadier General Charles Cruft. On January 1, 1864,
                    the regiment re-enlisted as a veteran organization and afterwards participated in the 
                        Atlanta
                     campaign and the Battle of 
                        Nashville
                    . The regiment was mustered out on December 8, 1865.1
            
            Sergeant James K. Wells was mustered into Company B, composed of men from 
                        Owen County
                    , on September 20, 1861. On January 8, 1863, he was commissioned second lieutenant. He
                    resigned from the army September 30, 1864.2
            
            The actual strength and role of the Copperheads in Indiana remains a moot question.3 Copperheads were nearly

                     all Democrats, but what proportion of Democrats were
                    Copperheads? How and to what degree were the Copperheads disloyal? To what extent did Republicans
                    exaggerate the Copperhead menace to justify possibly arbitrary and irregular acts of Governor Oliver
                    P. Morton? To what extent did the Democrats support and encourage the Copperheads to weaken or
                    embarrass the Republicans?
            Sergeant Wells, writing from 
                        Tennessee
                     in April of 1863, warned the Copperheads in his home community of the folly and
                    traitorous nature of their views and activities. The Copperhead movement was then gaining momentum
                    but Wells predicted ultimate success for the glorious Union and, though apparently uncertain about
                    the ultimate impact of emancipation, he considered talk of Negro immigration to and Negro equality
                    in Indiana as disruptive propaganda. Sergeant Wells' letter illustrates the understandingly
                    bitter feelings of loyal soldiers at the front toward the Copperheads, but it is not of much help
                    regarding their actual strength and role in Indiana during the war.

                        Permit me to appeal to you, who has spent twelve years of his life with you I have
                                    enjoyed the society of many of you and have as much interest for you as any man can
                                    have. But I am sorry to hear by letters sent to the soldiers and by newspapers that
                                    are read in camp that there is some in Jefferson township who are endeavoring to
                                    form secret lodges called the Knights of the Golden Circle for the purpose of
                                    protecting deserters that they have persuaded to leave the federal army. To all such
                                    let me ask them a question, what do you expect to gain by your wild and mad career.
                                    I would advise you to look back to the beginning of this wicked rebellion. You were
                                    made believe by the southern leaders and a few demagogues of the north that the 
                                        United States
                                     government intended to subjugate the south and establish negroe
                                    equality in the north. For these reasons you were made to believe that the south had
                                    a just right to secede and form a Southern Confederacy. You were told that they had
                                    a right under the Constitution of the 
                                        United States
                                     to secede peaceably if they wish to do so and that, that should be no
                                    reason for bringing on a war with the 
                                    
                                        United States
                                    . And you were made to believe that one southern man could whip five
                                    northern yankies as traitors called us. And some of you said that

                                     and 
                                        France
                                     would acknowledge the independence of the south and if their aid were
                                    needed they would aid the south and break the blockade. You thought that cotton was
                                    king and the south immensely rich and that they could wage war with the 
                                        United States
                                     and the Southern Confederacy would soon be a great nation and Jeff
                                    Davis a great man while the north would become verry poor and Abe. Lincoln verry
                                    unpopular, and consequently the 
                                        United States
                                     would be obliged to acknowledge the independence of the confederate
                                    states. And since the rebellion began you have been sympathiseing with the rebels in
                                    the south and trying to cripple the efforts of the armies that were trying to put
                                    down rebellion. You have threatened to destroy the property of union soldiers while
                                    they were in the army fighting to protect you and your property as well as their
                                    own. Now this war has been carried on nearly two years, and I ask you has the
                                    southern leaders fullfilled one promise they made to their soldiers. I answer they
                                    have not and the Confederate army is growing weaker every day while the Federal army
                                    is growing stronger and the soldiers in the Federal army are more revived in the
                                    work of their country than they ever were before. They have resolved to stand by the
                                    Union and fight for the Star Spangled bannor till again it shall wave over every
                                    state that belonged to the Union and over the heads of every traitor both south and
                                    north. The traitors at home may say what they please about the Presidents
                                    Proclimation. if we dont like it we will say but little about it but we will never
                                    forsake the Union as long as the Presidents Proclimation is in favor of weakening
                                    the rebellion.4 We are in for saveing our once glorious Union if
                                    it costs the lives and blood of every rebel in the south and if that wont do we will
                                    about face and hang and kill every butternut and copperhead in the north. I had
                                    rather kill a rebel at home any time than kill a man that will fight face to face.
                                    The copperheads must not talk about burning and stealing the property of the
                                    soldiers that are in the union army for there is a day when they will repent of it.
                                    this war will not last allways and we are shure 
                              
                                 * The writer seems to have recognized the Emancipation
                                            Proclamation as a military and diplomatic weapon.
                           
                                     to come out conqueror. Now I want to ask you if
                                    negroe equality is established in Indiana yet. Some of you tried to make the
                                    soldiers wives believe that their husbands were fighting to free the slaves and send
                                    them into Indiana by the 1st of April. I want some of you smart educated Knights of
                                    the Golden Circle to let me know when you see the first squad of negroes comeing
                                    from the south to become citizens in owen county. You big able bodied copperheads
                                    that are so fraid of the south being wronged out of their rights why dont you come
                                    down south and join the rebels and help them fight for their rights. They have
                                    acknowledged that one man of theirs cant whip five of ours and they say their
                                    friends in the north have been talking long and loud what they loud to do but had
                                    done nothing yet only some low degraded crime which caused them to be taken by some
                                    of the blue jackets to 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     and there be put in jail. I think so too. You have done the wind work
                                    but that is all. You are not powerful enough to effect any thing in the south and
                                    you havent got brains enough for Govenor Morton so I dont know what you are good for
                                    unless it is to drink rotgut whisky eat rotten eggs and stand on a rotten platform
                                    till it sinks deeper than a stone in the ocean and twice as hard to find. There are
                                    some of the democrats that voted with you at the Presidential election that are
                                    battling for their country while you are trying to stab them in the back. The
                                    seceded states are now cut in two and the rebels can no longer hope to gain their
                                    independence and you with the rebels have been deceived about 
                                        England
                                     and 
                                        France
                                     aiding to gain the independence of the Southern Confederacy therefore I
                                    think you had better lay low for if you dont it will only be the worse for you. It
                                    is a scandle and a shame for you and your children and relation and friends the way
                                    you have conducted yourselves since this rebellion broke out. You shurely have been
                                    crazy or drunk to think that the Southern Confederacy could whip the 
                                        United States
                                    , for they cant do it and you to help them so the longer you continue in
                                    your corruptness the worse it will be for you then why will you not stop your
                                    lowlified meanness and save yourselves. How barborous it is to continue the way you
                                    have been doing, when you can accomplish nothing only your own destruction and the
                                    destruction of your wives and daughters your fathers and mothers your  brothers and sisters and relations. There are some of
                                    you who still believe the 
                                        United States
                                     Government will free the negroes and turn them loose among you. But let
                                    us examine that point. For my part I have no uneasiness about that if the rebels
                                    would lay down their arms and come back into the Union. The majority of the union
                                    soldiers are in favor of restoreing the Union and the Constitution if it frees every
                                    slave in the south, then they will vote for men that are in favor of sending the
                                    negroe where he belongs or as near there as he can be got. You know as well as I do
                                    that the rebels have had a chance to save their slaves and property too by coming
                                    back to the Union in due time but they did not so who is to blame but themselves.
                                    They was not willing to any compromise nor nothing else only their independence that
                                    they will never get. It is now plain that they will have to return to the Union and
                                    the sooner the better for them. The rebellion would soon end if it was not for the
                                    leaders. They know that they are whiped and are only holding the southern troops
                                    between them and us to save their own necks till they have an opportunity to get a
                                    way. The rebels are sick enough in this section of the country. Instead of starving
                                    the Federals they have starved themselves. Now as I am about to conclude and dont
                                    know wheather I will ever see any of you or not I desire that you honor your
                                    government the government that has allways blessed you and the Union that you have
                                    always been protected in and the union that you have enjoyed all your happiness in.

            Papers of Senator Jesse D. Bright Desired
            Wayne J. Van Der Weele, a doctoral candidate in history at Indiana University, is writing a thesis on
                    the life of Jesse David Bright, 
                        United States
                     Senator from Indiana, 1845–1862. He is particularly interested in locating
                    letters, diaries, pamphlets, and manuscript materials of any kind pertaining to Senator Bright.
            Letters written by Bright which have been preserved in library collections are limited in number and
                    are mainly found in widely scattered places among the papers of his contemporaries. Mr. Van Der
                    Weele is interested also in obtaining letters, diaries, and other accounts written by
                    Bright's contemporaries which mention Bright.
            Anyone who can supply information about such papers is urged to communicate with Mr. Van Ver Weele,

            Genealogy
            County Records in the Genealogy Division of the Indiana State Library
            Carolynne Wendel and Dorothy Riker*
            
            As the center for genealogical research in Indiana, the Genealogy Division of the State Library is
                    continually building up its valuable collection of county records. Beginning with the present issue
                    of the Magazine we shall list for each county in the state the official records
                    and indexes that have been obtained over a period of years. Some of these are on microfilm, a few
                    are photostats, some are extracts of records made by individuals and organizations in the counties,
                    and some are indexes of county records made under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration.
                    The list includes only the material housed in the Genealogy Division and only the records kept by
                    county officials. Other county material is available such as census records, county histories,
                    cemetery, family, and Bible records. For a complete listing of all material available on any
                    particular county, one should consult the card index in the Genealogy Division.
            The first microfilming of county records was done in 1936 by the Historical Records Survey of the
                    Works Progress Administration. The project at that time was limited largely to the older counties in
                    the southern part of the state. The microfilms were placed in the Archives Division of the State
                    Library and at a later date positive copies were made for the Genealogy Division of those records
                    especially pertinent to genealogical study. In the 1950's a new microfilming project was
                    begun by the Genealogy Division with funds received from the Eugene Haslet Darrach Memorial Library
                    of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Library. Up to the present time (1957) deed indexes, wills, early marriages, and
                    probate records have been filmed in almost all the counties in the southern part of the state, and
                    the project is being continued in the central and northern counties as funds become available.
            
               
                  * Carolynne Wendel is acting head of the Genealogy Division, Indiana State
                        Library, and Dorothy Riker is editor at the Indiana Historical Bureau.
            
            
            The local chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution have taken the lead in making
                    available extracts of wills, probate, and marriage records from many counties. The Genealogy
                    Division is indebted to them for placing copies of these extracts in its Library where they may be
                    used by all patrons.
            Another type of record valuable for genealogical research is the indexes to the birth, death, and
                    marriage records. These were made under a WPA project sponsored by the State Department of Public
                    Welfare and cover principally the records kept by the county health officers. The work was not
                    carried on in every county.
            The systematic recording of births and deaths was not begun in Indiana until 1882, and in many
                    counties the records are not complete until a much later date. The indexes to the birth records show
                    the name of the father and mother, sex of the child, and date of birth. Unfortunately, the Christian
                    name given the child is sometimes not recorded, the attending physician apparently turning in the
                    record without waiting to learn the name. The indexes to the death records cover in general the
                    period from 1882 to 1920 and show the date and place of death and the age at death. These WPA
                    indexes cover the county birth and death records, but usually not those of the cities when they were
                    kept separate.
            Marriage transcripts sent by the county clerk to the county health officer beginning in 1882 are
                    indexed by the name of bride and groom. These give the name of father and maiden name of the mother
                    of the bride or groom as well as age and date of marriage. The project usually included the making
                    of a general index for the volumes of Marriage Records in the county clerk's office. These
                    indexes cover largely the period from 1850 to 1920 but in some instances they begin with the first
                    marriage records in the county. Names of the bride and groom are listed in alphabetical order with
                    name of spouse, date of birth, date of marriage, and reference to the number and page of the volume
                    in which the complete record may be found. In a few counties the Marriage Applications were indexed.
                    These are similar to the Transcripts in that they give the name of the father and mother of the
                    bride and groom.
            In listing the counties and their records, the date when the formation of each county became
                    effective is given as well  as the area out of which it was
                    formed. If the organization of county government was later than the formation of the county, this is
                    also given. The New Purchase embraced the land obtained from the Indians in 1818.

               Henry Watterson: Reconstructed Rebel. By Joseph Frazier Wall. (
                        New York
                    : Oxford University Press, 1956. Pp. xvi, 337. Notes and index. $6.00.)
            One of the last two ferries to shuttle the 
                        Ohio
                     between 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               , and 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , Indiana, was the "Henry Watterson"—so named, in the words
                    of its co-owner, "because both were symbols in the effort to unite the North and the
                    South." Appropriately, the bottle of water that launched this boat was a blend from wells
                    on both sides of the dividing line—from Mansfield, "Marse
                    Henry's" estate, and from Captain James E. Howard's mansion near 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , whence three generations of Howards also had helped link the North and South by
                    building over four hundred steamboats.
            This biography of the legendary editor of the 
                        Louisville
                    
                    Courier-Journal—which for fifty-three years (1868–1921)
                    served as a diary of this reconstructed rebel's struggle to reconciliate first the North
                    and the South, and then the Democratic party—should be of particular interest to
                    Hoosiers.
            As Irvin S. Cobb reminded us a generation ago in a "guyed book" to Indiana,
                    "There is a good deal of the Southerner in the composition of the typical
                    Hoosier." To this day, some profess that a more realistic Mason-Dixon Line (than its
                    projection down the 
                        Ohio
                    ) slices Indiana along an approximation of U.S. Route 40. Certainly, during the Civil
                    War, in the Copperhead Country of Indiana below the National Road, countless Hoosiers would have
                    understood why young Watterson's loyalty to the South outweighed his love for the Union and
                    his hatred of slavery.
            Soon after stillness settled on the battlefields, the editor of the newspaper most widely read among
                    Confederate troops (The Rebel) came to 
                        Louisville
                    . And thus, long before the present rulers of the Courier-Journal
                    coined the word "Ken-tuckiana" by which to lay claim to a vast circulation empire
                    across the river, Indiana found itself bounded on the south by one Henry Watterson.
            From the border of the great cataclysm, the young editor (only 28) began preaching reconciliation
                    through his  rhythmic writing. As in the case of the 
                        New Albany
                     citizen who at an earlier time had written in his diary that he believed only in the
                    Bible and Horace Greeley's weekly Tribune—and if the two
                    should disagree, he would stick with Greeley—a cult of avid believers in Watterson soon
                    sprang up.
            Of course, lest this reviewer be misunderstood, Watterson did not direct his words and thoughts only
                    to Indianians. (Indiana merits mention only a few times in this book.) But by Watterson's
                    very proximity to Indiana, his pen undoubtedly prevailed upon many Hoosiers who not long before had
                    been on the brink of succumbing to the temptations of the plotted Northwest Confederacy.
            Through his pre-Reconstruction writing, Watterson tried to bring to those who had hated Lincoln a
                    true appreciation of the greatness and benevolence of the martyr who had lived his formative years
                    in 
                        Kentucky
                     and in Indiana, and an understanding of the miseries wrought upon the South by his
                    murder. He pounded away bluntly at the government in 
                        Washington
                     to release the South from military rule until, in 1877, after the Tilden-Hayes
                    decision, the troops were recalled.
            Dr. Wall's chapters "To Victory with Tilden" and "On to
                    Defeat" are among the very best in the book and detail the role played by Watterson and his
                    paper in making the governor of 
                        New York
                     acceptable to Democrats in both North and South, as well as his efforts to prevent the
                    "Crime of '76." The Courier-Journal was the first to
                    fly proudly from the top of its mast the pennant of the "hero" Watterson
                    discovered. The selection of Watterson as chairman of the nominating convention assured
                    Tilden's nomination, and "the press of the country, both Republican and
                    Democratic, hailed the selection of Watterson as a fitting tribute to a man who … `has
                    worked harder for peace and order at the South, and for honest money, as against the Greenback
                    delusion, than any other journalist in his party.'"
            As a consolation prize for the Middle West, writes Dr. Wall, Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana
                    was given second place on the ticket. By the well-known 8–7 decision of the special
                    commission, Tilden and Hendricks lost—but in defeat Watterson had triumphed. As Dr. Wall
                    states: "With the expiration of the Forty-fourth Congress … Watterson could
                    return home from his only venture into officeholding  knowing
                    that officially the reconciliation of the sections had been achieved."
            Four more decades of a volatile career still lay ahead for Watterson, one of the last
                    "personal journalists." His pungent phrases darted through his editorials until
                    they became a part of the American language. He spoke with one of the most influential voices of his
                    party, yet quarrelled with all its great leaders—
                        Grover Cleveland
                    , William Jennings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson. Nearing the climax of his fiery career, but
                    still spry in mind and sharp of tongue, he consigned the kaiser of 
                        Germany
                     and the emperor of 
                        Austria
                    -
                        Hungary
                     to the nether regions with the best-remembered, and possibly most characteristic,
                    Watterson words: "To Hell with the Hohenzollerns and Hapsburgs."
            The new biographer of Watterson chose to study "Marse Henry" at the suggestion of
                    Arthur Krock (formerly of the Courier-Journal), and worked with Allan Nevins of 
                        Columbia
                     in writing his re-evaluation of the great editor for his 1951 doctoral dissertation.
                    The finished product is a tribute to both the subject and the writer.
            The late Alben W. Barkley, who wrote the introduction, found in Watterson and this book "a
                    charming chapter in the story of American democracy."
            We who have toiled on the latter-day Courier-Journal could not escape feeling that
                    Henry Watterson "is always a shadow behind your chair." Reading of the
                    "Reconstructed Rebel" gives substance to that shadow. No doubt about it,
                    "Henry Watterson was the last of his tribe."

               Lincoln Finds a General: A Military Study of the Civil War. Vol. IV, luka to Vicksburg. By Kenneth P. Williams. (
                        New York
                    : The Macmillan Company, 1956. Pp. xviii, 616. Illustrations and maps.
                    $7.50.)
            The volumes of this monumental work on the campaigns of the Federal armies during the Civil War
                    continue to appear with remarkable regularity. The first two came out in 1949, another three years
                    later, and now the fourth. Three more are projected. The story will then have been completed in
                    seven volumes, and Lincoln will not only have found his general (in fact Lincoln found him in the
                    third volume  whether he knew it or not) but in the seventh
                    volume the President will have found him bringing the war to a successful end. The first two volumes
                    carried the war in the East through 
                        Gettysburg
                    . In the third volume the war in the West emerged, as did Grant, and continued through
                    the battles of 
                        Shiloh
                     and Corinth.
            Though the title of this work might seem to indicate that the spotlight should be kept on Grant, this
                    is, of course, not the case, and rightly so even after Lincoln had found his general; for this is a
                    history of all Federal military activities, including something of what happened west of the 
                        Mississippi
                     River. In this volume Grant does not appear in full bloom until the victorious
                    Vicksburg campaign. The subtitle of this volume is luka to Vicksburg, but the whole military
                    situation in the West in the summer of 1862 is first made clear and then come in succeeding chapters
                    the battles of luka and of Corinth again; Buell's race with Bragg northward through 
                        Tennessee
                     into 
                        Kentucky
                    , culminating in the Battle of Perry-ville; Rosecrans superseding Buell and fighting the
                    Battle of Stone's River; then Holly Springs and raiding activities in 
                  Mississippi, Alabama
               , and 
                        Tennessee
                    ; and finally the capture of Vicksburg.
            Throughout it all there are many episodes, much drama, evaluations of men and events, and some
                    disagreements with previous evaluations. Although Professor Williams is no defender of Bragg in the 
                        Kentucky
                     campaign and says that he was in a state of collapse before the end, he places a good
                    deal of the blame for the Confederate failure on Kirby Smith, in addition to the fact that
                    Buell's army also had something to do with that failure. Of course, Williams' hero
                    is General Grant, in whom he can see no guile—or at least not much. He is disturbed by
                    the newspaper reporter Sylvanus Cad-wallader's account of Grant having had a terrible brush
                    with King Alcohol before Vicksburg. In an appendix to this volume Williams goes to great length to
                    disprove Cad-wallader's charges and to mildly dress down the late Benjamin Thomas for being
                    so uncritical as to publish Cad-wallader's manuscript. Those interested in this little
                    literary tussle might read Thomas' reply in American Heritage, August, 1956.
            Williams pulls together with skill the many facets that make up the military operations in the West
                    during the year  of this volume—July, 1862, to July,
                    1863. He does not hesitate to forego the temptation to see one campaign through before he picks up
                    another which has been going on; he breaks off even at the most dramatic moment which might seem to
                    call for full speed ahead. Only a person with the feel of military life could read the many
                    documents of the Civil War and understand their full meaning and implications. Williams with his
                    military background has this ability—even to marching in his imagination with Grant and
                    Sherman. Apparently there were no first-hand close-up accounts of the surrender of Pemberton to
                    Grant at Vicksburg which would have made it possible to deal in the kind of dramatics which
                    characterized the surrender of Lee to Grant at Appo-mattox. Readers will have to wait until the
                    seventh volume to see what Williams does with the Grant-Lee affair.
            The author is good at using the proper adjective to show the shade of meaning he wants to leave with
                    the reader regarding personalities—"the gloating words of Van
                    Dorn's," Sherman's "incurable honesty." Also he can say
                    much, and that aptly, in a sentence of few words: "Well did Wheeler's boldness and
                    skill pay off in the face of an army which had been so indoctrinated with caution that even
                    curiosity was rare" (p. 133). As for that marplot who had tried to worm his way into and
                    seize the glory that was to come to the captor of Vicksburg: "If the Yazoo
                    River was one of nature's curiosities, so was John McClernand" (p.
                    308).
            These volumes are not fast reading; they are packed with too much information for that; but they are
                    easy reading and the time spent cannot help but be rewarding. And the two dozen well-executed maps
                    are a joy.

            This is somewhat a reprinting of the author's Lincoln and His Wife's

                    added to the earlier chapters. Mr. Townsend set out to reconstruct life in the old agrarian town of 
                        Lexington
                    . Located in the  midst of the fertile Bluegrass,
                    and at the crossroads of transportation in this part of the Ohio Valley, 
                        Lexington
                     was of greater importance than was the average 
                        Bluegrass county
                     seat town. Travelers of all kinds came to visit the place, and they have left behind
                    them a picturesque record of their experiences in central 
                        Kentucky
                    .
            
               
                        Lexington
                     was a sporting town where horse racing, cock-fighting, and betting went on without too
                    much social inhibition. The rich farming country produced an enormous amount of hemp, tobacco, and
                    small grains. Rich pastures supported a highly profitable livestock industry. It was to this fertile
                    plateau that Virginians and Marylanders brought their slaves from the time the first pioneers
                    crossed through 
                        Cumberland Gap
                    . Central 
                        Kentucky
                     was almost as much a slavery stronghold as were 
                        Mississippi
                     and 
                        Alabama
                    . 
                        Lexington
                     was also the home of an important interstate slave market. The slave auction was not an
                    unusual sight on the courthouse square, and slave jails were almost as commonplace as harness shops.
            It was in this community with its leisurely, provincial way of life that Mary Todd was born. Her
                    people were slaveholders and were important folks in Bluegrass society. Her situation was in sharp
                    contrast to the background of Abraham Lincoln who was born among the sterile ridges of the Knob
                    country. It would have been hard to have imagined in the earlier years, even of republican 
                        Kentucky
                    , a union between the two.
            However favorably one might have viewed life in antebellum 
                        Kentucky
                    , the region had its serious problems. The importation of slaves for sale, the attitude
                    of certain ministers and churches, and the changing conditions of agriculture threatened a slave
                    system so amply protected by constitutional guarantees. In time there were to be discordant voices
                    from among the slaveholders themselves, the loudest of which was that of Cassius M. Clay and his True American. Clay almost supplants the Lincolns in the book. He was an exciting
                    character who kept life well agitated about him. Actually Cassius M. Clay, aside from being a
                    colorful and ambitious individual, tried desperately to buck the tight internal political situation
                    in 
                        Kentucky
                    . Mr. Townsend writes with intimate knowledge of these facts. He has a keen insight into
                    the political forces which have prevailed in 
                        Kentucky
                     since the beginning.
            
            This book is written in a charming style by a master hand at story telling. Interpretations of the
                    local scene are handled with more skill possibly than are national issues. Lincoln and the Bluegrass
                    is really a biography of a region and the various personalities who made it significant.

            Here is a biography which compares with Wiltse's Calhoun, Fuess'
                        Webster, and Van Deusen's 
                  
                            Clay
                        , for it is as near to being definitive as one could wish for. Thomas Hart 
                        Benton
                    , 1782–1858, was unquestionably regarded as one of the greatest intellectuals
                    and statesmen of his day. Perhaps this biography will help to restore him to the true perspective he
                    so rightly deserves.
            Benton was 
                        Missouri
                    's first Senator, and he served that state faithfully for thirty years. His
                    early association with the proposals for land reform and electoral reform—the latter
                    asking for the abolition of the electoral college and the direct election of the President of the 
                        United States
                    —helped to establish the "demos kratia" basis for the
                    rising Democratic party. 
                        Benton
                     as much as Jackson represented the era of the Common Man. He became the agrarian leader
                    behind the Jacksonian program—the representative of the yeoman farmer interests of the
                    rising West. It was he who spearheaded the attack on the "Monster" Bank of the 
                        United States
                     and authored the hard money theories and the famous Specie Circular. Hence his
                    nickname, "Old Bullion." Jackson never forgot 
                        Benton
                    's labors in his behalf and was faithful to the western Senator to his dying
                    day.
            Many people thought that 
                        Benton
                     should have succeeded Jackson; instead, the Senator backed Van Buren and fought a
                    losing Congressional battle with the Whigs following the Panic of 1837. In 1841, Clay
                    "stole 
                        Benton
                    's thunder" by getting the Distribution-Pre-emption Act through
                    Congress. But the triumph was really 
                        Benton
                    's, for the distribution part of the Act became inoperative after 1842 and
                    pre-emption—a  measure long championed by
                    Benton—became a permanent part of the American land system.
            With the rise of the slavery issue in Tyler's administration, Benton ably grappled with
                    Calhoun. Failing in his role as peacemaker in the Polk administration, he split openly with the
                    southern leaders of his party. "Old Bullion" insisted, however, that it was
                    primarily the "professional political brokers" who dominated the conventions and
                    the party.
            Benton was associated early with nearly every measure favoring western development, but his ultimate
                    break with the slavery interests caused his defeat for re-election in 1850. He made the same
                    sacrificial stand for the Union as did 
                        Houston
                     and Stephen A. Douglas. For seven years he fought hard to make a comeback, but there
                    was only the solace of a short term in the lower house. The passage of the Graduation Act in 1854
                    was again his triumph, but he was not in Congress to claim that victory. He became a bitter critic
                    of the Pierce and Buchanan administrations, and in his declining years appeared to be more of a
                    Eepublican than a Democrat.
            
               
                        Benton
                     proved to be as courageous a fighter in retirement as he had been in the Senate.
                    Failing in politics, he turned to the profession of an author, and at once established an enviable
                    reputation. Though his house burned down and his materials and manuscript were lost, he undauntedly
                    forged ahead to complete his two-volume work, Thirty Years' View, a
                    lengthy record of his years in the Senate. But perhaps of even greater significance was his Abridgement of the Debates of Congress, from 1789 to 1850, published in fifteen
                    volumes. It was a work which George Bancroft predicted would be "the monument of the
                    age." 
                        Benton
                     finished the last volume of this work on the day before his death.
            Perhaps the main reason for his not becoming President was that he never turned a stone in his own
                    behalf. Like Clay, Webster, and Calhoun, he was in the thick of politics and his record was not
                    always consistent. Furthermore, he was too often regarded as a "hothead." Fights
                    and several duels dotted his life, and like Jackson he had killed a man. Even his duel with Jackson
                    in his early life was not forgotten until Adams' administration. Notwithstanding these
                    traits, perhaps his greatest defect was his "pomposity," his
                    "vanity," his inflexible will; he seemed to love to play the role of a Roman
                    Senator.
            
            In spite of these weaknesses, he was a great statesman. Perhaps we should speak of this age as having
                    been led by a quadrumvirate rather than a triumvirate, for his "contemporaries saw him as
                    the equal, even the superior, of his great senatorial adversaries, Clay, Calhoun, and
                    Webster." Greeley spoke of his "incorruptible career." Others spoke on
                    his "gigantic intellect," his "vast erudition," his
                    "capacious memory," and his "superb eloquence." Indeed, he had
                    come a long way for a self-educated man.
            The author of this book has separated himself completely from the rhetorical, florid, classical style
                    of 
                        Benton
                    's speeches and writings. A study of the documentation—which the
                    author relegates to the end of the narrative—indicates an impressive, almost exhausting
                    amount of research. There are no illustrations, except a portrait of 
                        Benton

            This discerning biography is an account of Henry Churchill King in a career entirely associated with
                    Oberlin College. His life became interwoven with the history of the College and inevitably the
                    author has described the Oberlin community while setting forth King's character and place
                    in the ranks of American college presidents. Obviously the book will have special meaning for alumni
                    and friends of Oberlin. However, it should be of interest to other readers also, for it deals with
                    the thorny problems involved in preserving the character of an institution while modifying it to
                    meet the changes in American society which became particularly evident after 1914. Thus Oberlin
                    College in King's administration is a case study of the liberal arts college in transition.
            The biographer has a firm command of the material, often employing documents which would be useless
                    in less skillful hands. For example, he quotes King's pocket memorandum book entry for
                    November 19, 1902: "Trustee meeting 9 o'clock. Elected President in afternoon.
                    Rice Memorial Concert. Reception at Baldwin in evening. Student escort home" (p. 103). From
                    this and other equally unpromising evidence  Mr. Love succeeds
                    in drawing a clear portrait of a man who made his way without dramatic collisions, adventures, or
                    excitements while providing steady leadership for the College between 1902 and 1927 when he retired.
            King's early career seems to have been a long preparation for the presidency. In student
                    days and as a young instructor he absorbed the spirit of Oberlin, a college which still remembered
                    that it once had been a storm center for abolition and many other causes. Years of advanced study at 
                        Harvard
                     and at the University of Berlin meant opportunities for research in philosophy and
                    theology. As representative of the College at conferences and meetings he learned much about the
                    workings of other academic institutions. Wide-flung connections and a growing reputation brought
                    occasional offers of presidencies elsewhere which he steadily declined. In 1902, however, he took up
                    the presidency of Oberlin with quiet self-confidence, indicating an intention to chart his own
                    course.
            King's administration was guided by a few basic ideas which he held with unswerving
                    tenacity; fundamental among these was the importance of the individual, his growth and development.
                    At his inaugural King spoke on "The Primacy of the Person in College Education."
                    And, although he saw the Oberlin endowment increase by millions and the construction of new building
                    after new building, he never ceased to show concern for the quality of the educational process
                    within those buildings. He always believed that the most valuable thing in a college course was
                    "personal contact with a great teacher" and that the first duty of a faculty
                    member was to fulfill his obligation to his students.
            In choosing his faculty President King did not hesitate to appoint graduates of Oberlin who had
                    adequate postgraduate training and experience obtained elsewhere. Among faculty members he exerted
                    leadership as a teaching president working with colleagues many of whom were his close friends.
            Readers who never glimpsed life in the American Middle West prior to 1914 may consider this book
                    unreal, an idealized portrait of a man and of a college written by a loyal alumnus, a
                    "court historian." But the fair-minded reader with some knowledge of the region
                    and the period in which King did his work will recognize this biography as an extra-ordinarily  graphic and discriminating appraisal. Relations with the
                    townspeople of Oberlin, financial promotion, public service involving representation of the College
                    to the outside world, King's writing, and his service in World War I—all come
                    under review. Of particular interest in the light of recent Suez Canal troubles is the section of
                    the book dealing with the King-Crane Report. At the conclusion of World War I Wilson hoped to create
                    an Inter-Allied Commission to Syria which would study the situation there and recommend to the Peace
                    Conference what should be done with the lands and peoples of the former Ottoman Empire. President
                    King and Charles R. Crane were appointed as the American Commissioners. Their report, written after
                    travel in the Near East, touched on Zionism and other matters now very much to the fore. The Arabs
                    welcomed the Commission; the Zionists seemed to fear that its report would impair the fulfillment of
                    the Balfour Declaration creating a national home for the Jews.
            Something of King's statesmanship is revealed in his basic theory of educational
                    administration: "that it is necessary to carry with you the convictions—not
                    merely the opinions—of the faculty and the student body. If in initiating some measure of
                    your own, you cannot command that support, it means that the measure is, at least for the time
                    being, unripe."
            President King did not consider financial promotion to be "the main job." He
                    seriously hoped that the College would receive support simply by doing such excellent work that
                    people would desire to contribute. Naive as it may seem, King announced at the beginning of his
                    administration that he did not intend to become a beggar for the College. His approach proved
                    attractive to one substantial donor, at least; without solicitation Herbert A. Wilder gave
                    $375,000 to Oberlin. For all of his diffidence about financial promotion King was
                    remarkable in securing money for the College and by the end of his administration the school had an
                    endowment of more than eighteen million dollars.
            President King's colleagues were essential for his effectiveness as teacher and president.
                    He had around him such men as Edward I. Bosworth, Kemper Fullerton, Charles H. A. Wager, and Charles
                    B. Martin who all exerted an influence on students comparable to that of King himself.  Again and again the author deftly catches in a few sentences the facets
                    of personalities associated with King. He also reveals uncommon insight and taste in his account of
                    the King household, attributing to Mrs. King a most important part in the career of her basically
                    shy and overly sensitive husband. Julia Coates King enabled the Kings to build and to maintain
                    friendships with students and faculty alike by providing apparently effortless and genuine
                    hospitality for literally thousands of guests. Her quiet good sense and firm grip on reality gave
                    balance and serenity to everyone around her.
            This is a beautifully written book about an attractive man and the college he served. Throughout the
                    volume one glimpses a unique combination of scholarship, friendliness, religious faith, and devotion
                    to social causes and to principle—elements of a character which appeared in King and in
                    many of the men who worked with him. Mr. Love's biography will win a place in the
                    literature of the liberal arts college; certainly it is the definitive biography of President King
                    of Oberlin.

               Tecumseh: Vision of Glory. By Glenn Tucker. (
                        Indianapolis

                    $5.00.)
            This is a long and detailed, but never dull, biography of Tecumseh, Shawnee chief, brother of the
                    Prophet and de facto leader of those Indians inhabiting the unsettled areas of the Old Northwest
                    prior to the War of 1812. As a biography it contains all that can conceivably be known about
                    Tecumseh from birth to death. It is, however, more than a biography; it is essentially a history of
                    the struggle of the Indians north of the 
                        Ohio
                     River with the advancing white frontier from the close of the Revolution until the
                    death of Tecumseh at the Battle of the Thames in 1813.
            Tecumseh was an able and superior Indian in most respects; he was a man of vision who had unusual
                    qualities of leadership and personal magnetism. He strongly advocated that if the Indians were to
                    remain Indians, not succumb to the agricultural life of the whites or be dragged down into  drunken poverty by their whiskey, they must cease giving away
                    the tribal hunting lands by treaty and unite to resist the ever-moving frontier. From 1808 until the
                    outbreak of the War of 1812 he sought with only moderate success to sell this message to tribes both
                    north and south.
            Outside of the dime novel variety produced by the professional hacks and those written for juveniles,
                    there have been only a few biographies of Tecumseh of any merit: Benjamin Drake, The
                        Life of Tecumseh and His Brother the Prophet, 1841; Edward Eggleston, Tecumseh
                        and the Shawnee Prophet, 1878; E. 0. Randall, "Tecumseh, The Shawnee
                    Chief" in 
                  
                            Ohio
                         Archeological and Historical Society Publications, XV, 1906; Norman S. Gurd,
                        The Story of Tecumseh, 1912; and John M. Oskinson, Tecumseh and
                        His Times, 1938. Perhaps this great Indian chief has not attracted more biographers because
                    source materials relating to him are scattered in widely separated depositories, are fragmentary and
                    in many instances contradictory. The Shawnee had no written language, and many of the records that
                    remain were written by whites, some of whom were strongly biased and singularly inaccurate in their
                    accounts. The author has used this extant evidence judiciously, even where the trail has grown dim,
                    and has given us a modern appraisal of Tecumseh in youth and manhood as he played his role in peace,
                    diplomacy, and war.
            Readers who are expecting traditional treatment of such topics as the Prophet, William Henry
                    Harrison, the Battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , the causes of the War of 1812, the capture of 
                        Detroit
                    , and the death of Tecumseh will not find them in this biography. Mr. Tucker is not a
                    traditionalist and takes particular pains to revise the historical record when his reading of the
                    sources makes it necessary. Nor is he hesitant to call a spade by its correct title when, upon
                    careful examination and distillation of evidence, it has all the characteristics of a spade.
            Laulewasika, better known as the Prophet, youngest brother of Tecumseh was not, as has been commonly
                    recorded, a misguided epileptic who held a charm over the Indians but a great and even remarkable
                    religious leader whose doctrines possessed a brand of militant racialism used by Tecumseh to further
                    his own plans for Indian solidarity. Though the Prophet was vain, arrogant and sometimes vindictive
                         and a great emotional force in the Indian world, Tecumseh
                    emerges the dominant leader, the final voice of authority exercising a restraining influence on his
                    weaker and less stable brother.
            The picture Tucker draws of Harrison is not complimentary. Harrison is described as a verbose
                    ("he never permitted one word to serve a purpose when two would do" p. 134), proud
                    man who never really understood Indian character and was arbitrary and wily to the point of
                    circumvention in his negotiations and dealings with the red men. The Battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                     was precipitated by Harrison: "He was the aggressor. The responsibility rested
                    with him" (p. 218). "He was not only the aggressor, he was the presumptuous treaty
                    breaker… . Harrison's march was an outright invasion of the territory of another
                    nation without the consent of the President or a declaration of war by Congress" (p. 219). 
                        Tippecanoe
                     was a minor engagement of no consequence, except to make Harrison President.
            In what should be a final conclusion on one important aspect of war guilt Mr. Tucker has clearly
                    demonstrated that the Indian unrest preceding the outbreak of the War of 1812 was not the work of
                    the British in 
                        Canada
                     or the work of British agents circulating among the tribes promoting, urging, and
                    fomenting Indian attacks against the frontier. He has conclusively shown that the British were
                    strictly neutral and attempted to restrain Tecumseh and the Indians. The contemporary reports by
                    Harrison, western newspapers, and regional historians to the effect that the British in 
                        Canada
                     were the fountainhead of Indian aggression was unfounded propaganda so loudly and
                    repeatedly trumpeted that it seemingly had become inextricably woven into the fabric of American
                    historical writing. Now, thanks to this author we, at last, are set straight.
            This reviewer had always assumed that Major General Isaac Brock was the sole moving force behind the
                    capture of 
                        Detroit
                     by a combined force of British and Indians in the War of 1812. Mr. Tucker quickly
                    dispels this opinion and points out that a great deal of Brock's success at 
                        Detroit
                     was due to Tecumseh's military knowledge: "The British leader had
                    come to recognize that Tecumseh's knowledge of the country was invaluable, almost
                    photographic; but still not so important to the success of the campaign as his military judgment  and tactical ability, his quick eye for good battle positions
                    and his understanding of the value of intelligence and the need for its speedy transmission to
                    headquarters" (p. 267).
            Tecumseh presumably was killed in the Battle of the Thames, October 5, 1813. The legend was fostered
                    by returning soldiers and during the Presidential campaign of 1836 that Colonel Richard M. Johnson
                    shot him with his pistol. This version as well as others still seeps into regional literature.
                    Tucker has sifted all the evidence pertaining to Tecumseh in this battle and concludes: "No
                    one knows how he was killed, who killed him or where he lies buried, though as with other epic
                    heroes, the search and research have been indefatigable" (p. 319).
            It is occasionally the practice in writing a "favorable" review to pick out minor
                    flaws "which mar the work" in order to demonstrate the reviewer's
                    objectivity, or superiority. There are a few errors of fact in this volume but it would be
                    ungracious, even presumptuous, to note them. This is a good book, a readable one, written after long
                    and purposeful use of historical sources by an author filled with refreshing enthusiasm for his
                    subject.

               Westernized Yankee: The Story of Cyrus Woodman. By Larry Gara. (
                        Madison
                    : The State Historical Society of 
                        Wisconsin
                    , 1956. Pp. x, 254. Frontispiece, illustrations, notes, and index. $4.50.)
            
               The Story of Cyrus Woodman represents a kaleidoscopic view of the life of a western
                    land agent, 1840–1870. The value of this partial biography comes from the careful
                    enumeration and description which it contains of the activity of a man engaged in such a profession.
                    Cyrus Woodman, land agent, and others like him were the invaluable middlemen in the settling of the
                    West.
            Woodman's experiences also give good indication of the wide range of western business
                    opportunities open to the enterprising man. Numerous schemes to gain wealth presented themselves,
                    asking only for the investment of money, time, and energy. The vigorous and growing western society
                    was a challenge, a place in which fortunes could be made—and  lost. That Woodman made and held his fortune is a tribute to his
                    ability.
            Woodman was raised in 
                        Maine
                     and remained attached to the East throughout his life. Always he longed for its
                    cultured and civilized tone; the West was the materialistic, profit-making, working-world in which
                    he could best earn a living. Thus, after a brief business career in a 
                        Boston
                     law office, he secured employment with the 
                        Boston
                     and Western Land Company and went west to make his fortune.
            His talents for meticulous work and painstaking exactness placed him in good stead as a land agent,
                    as he conscientiously tried to sell his company's 
                        Illinois
                     lands. Although settlers poured into the region, few of them had cash and
                    Woodman's job was a constant struggle to secure income for his company.
            From 
                        Illinois
                     Woodman moved to the promising 
                        Wisconsin
                     Territory and established his headquarters at Mineral Point. Disassociating himself
                    from the 
                        Boston
                     and Western Land Company, he entered a partnership with the energetic Cadwallader
                    Washburn. Then followed his years of greatest business success: the talents of the two partners
                    complemented each other as they sold land, practiced law, and engaged in timberland speculation,
                    shot manufacture, and many other enterprises. Always their fortunes rose, and both men gained
                    financial independence.
            Following the dissolution of this partnership in 1855, Woodman strove to devote less time to business
                    and more time to his family and to cultural activities. More and more Woodman thought and talked of
                    a retirement in the East. Financial difficulties, however, held him to the West, as he continued to
                    supervise his investments, to make new investments, and to develop land sales for the St.
                    Mary's Falls Ship Canal Company in 
                        Michigan
                    . During this work and his subsequent employment as a supervisor for the 
                        Burlington
                     railroad, his family remained in the East. Whenever possible Woodman remained with them
                    and finally in 1870 he was able to join them permanently.
            While Woodman gave support to the 
                        Wisconsin
                     Historical Society and the Mineral Point Library Association, his philanthropic
                    interests largely centered in the cultural institutions of the East. The reader regrets that these
                    interests are not spelled out in more detail, just as he regrets that  Woodman's 
                        California
                     and European experiences are passed over so briefly. From this book does emerge,
                    however, a picture of Woodman as a Yankee business man: an easterner who found profitable employment
                    for his abilities in the West.

                            Columbus

            The title and the author's preface give a truthful indication of the theme of the book.
                    There is no attempt at a detailed biography of a many-sided man. Some earlier biographers seemed to
                    feel it necessary to portray 
                        Columbus
                     as excelling as a scientist, geographer, religious missionary, political administrator,
                    business man and sailor. The research of later historians resulted in the downgrading of 
                        Columbus
                     in some of these aspects of his personality. The critical process continued until some
                    writers ended up with the conclusion that he was a visionary, adventuresome charlatan who undertook
                    to find certain things, found some other things, but never knew what he did find. Some of these
                    definitely questioned his proficiency as a seaman. These were of the opinion that there were a
                    number of sailors in his crew who were more proficient than he and that he depended upon their
                    judgment and advice but did not admit it.
            Professor Morison has restricted himself to the task of writing the history of 
                        Columbus
                     as a mariner. One feels that Morison has come to the conclusion that this was what 
                        Columbus
                     essentially and really was. Other aspects of his life are mentioned and sometimes these
                    references give evidence of the shortcomings of 
                        Columbus
                     in some of these respects. These references, however, are brought in only to the extent
                    that they have bearing on the major theme. After one has read the book he concludes that 
                        Columbus
                     must have been the greatest mariner of his time and, considering changing conditions,
                    one of the greatest of all times. This conclusion is reached not because the author has labored or
                    argued the issue, but because he has in a clear, simple narrative followed 
                        Columbus
                     through his four voyages and related just what 
                        Columbus
                     did in described situations. The whole story seems 
                    so simple and casual that the reader may not realize that it could never have been written at all by
                    anyone who did not possess historical judgment and deep understanding of and feeling for the sea and
                    sailing ships. Incidentally the author has once again proved that a truthful narrative of a real
                    sea-adventure can be more thrilling than fiction.

               The Making of Charles A. Beard. By Mary Ritter Beard. (
                        New York
                    : Exposition Press, 1955. Pp. 104. $3.00.)
            This volume includes only four brief chapters of less than thirty pages by Mrs. Beard. The remainder
                    comprises documents concerning Beard's missions to 
                        Japan
                     and Yugoslavia, plus a reprint of an article entitled "Charles Austin Beard as
                    a Teacher."
            Perhaps Mrs. Beard poses more questions about her distinguished husband than she answers. For
                    instance, what was the impact of the 
                        Quaker
                     faith with its tradition of service to humanity on Beard? How great was the influence
                    of William Jennings Bryan on him ("Bryan's anti-imperialism took roots in
                    Beard's soul" p. 15) ? How much was he indebted to the English writer, John
                    Ruskin, and how significant was his preoccupation with workers' education during his 
                        Oxford
                     study? Was his critical attitude toward World War II influenced by his previous
                    contacts and work with Japanese politicians and scholars in the field of municipal government?
            At any rate, Mrs. Beard indicates the unusual diversity of her husband's interests, she
                    emphasizes his independence of character, and she pictures him as having been a reformer at heart.
                    She also makes clear that his father had sufficient wealth to provide a library from which Beard
                    early became acquainted with some of the classics and also adequate to afford him excellent
                    educational opportunities without undue concern about obtaining his daily bread.
            Unfortunately the lengthy quotation from a county history concerning Beard's father is

               Schoolcraft's Indian Legends. Edited by Mentor L. Williams. (East

                    bibliography, and index. $5.00.)
            In this volume are brought together, with annotations, all of the various Indian
                    "legends" published by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, 
                        United States
                     Indian Agent at Sault Ste. Marie, 
                        Michigan
                    , 1822–1836, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for 
                        Michigan
                    , 1836–1841, and one of the collectors of material relating to the North
                    American Indians, especially the Ojibwa (Chippewa) and the 
                        Ottawa
                    . The majority of the legends in the present volume (pp. 1–238) are
                    reproduced from Schoolcraft's Algic Researches (2 vols., 
                        New York
                    , 1839), now a scarce item; sixteen additional legends are also reproduced (pp.
                    239–285) from two other of Schoolcraft's works, The Myth of
                        Hiawatha and Other Oral Legends (
                        Philadelphia
                    , 1856) and The Red Race of America (
                        New York
                    , 1847). In an editor's introduction (pp. ix-xxii) Williams passes from
                    historical generalities on the American Indian to some rather interesting, but not altogether
                    accurate, biographical particulars about Schoolcraft and about the "much debated question
                    of Longfellow's indebtedness to Schoolcraft" (p. xix). Data bearing on this latter
                    point, which clearly intrigues Williams as it has other scholars, is also contained in Appendix B
                    (pp. 313–317) of Williams' present book.
            
               Schoolcraft's Indian Legends is an interesting effort to reproduce, in
                    convenient and accessible form, a pioneer collection of American Indian tales, annotated with
                    reasonable fullness. For the lay reader this may be enough. But for anyone  who has had occasion to use Schoolcraft for folkloristic or
                    ethnological research, it is not. Williams' criterion for inclusion of material in his book
                    was, so he tells us, "Is this a legend?" (p. v). If material was not what Williams
                    judged to be a "legend" (a form which he does not define) it was "rigidly
                    excluded"; all "biographical and historical Indian narratives" in
                    Schoolcraft's works were thus summarily omitted—or so Williams would have us
                    believe. However, his last selection from Schoolcraft (pp.282–285) is, in the
                    reviewer's opinion, both biographical and historical. Moreover, much of American Indian
                    biographical and historical material is, as Schoolcraft himself pointed out, tradition degenerated
                    into fable (p. 303); therefore it is hard to see where Williams could draw the line for the rigid
                    exclusion he says he practiced. It is also difficult for the folklorist, interested in the
                    distribution of motifs, to accept the fact that Williams has excluded from his book "a
                    large number of myths and legends which were mentioned in Schoolcraft's epitomes and
                    compendiums of Indian lore… either by summary, by reference, or by expository
                    fragments" (p. v). The exclusion of such material (which need not have been reproduced, but
                    should have been included by reference) makes it imperative that any folklorist with a serious
                    interest in Schoolcraft's tale material consult Schoolcraft's own works, rather
                    than Williams' present volume.
            A surprising omission from the Williams book is any reference to the recently published Index of Schoolcraft's six-volume Historical and Statistical
                        Information Respecting … the Indian Tribes of the 
                            United States
                        
                (
                        Philadelphia
                    , 1851–1857). This very complete index, prepared by Mrs. Frances S. Nichols,
                    a member of the editorial staff of the Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology, was
                    published in 1954 as Bulletin 152 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, under the title Index to Schoolcraft's "Indian Tribes of the 
                            United States
                        ", and carries with it a four-page Introduction by Matthew W.
                    Stirling, Director, Bureau of American Ethnology, in which Schoolcraft and his major works are
                    discussed. Williams reproduces Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's remark in his diary that
                    Schoolcraft's Historical and Statistical Information is not indexed (p.
                    314), but neither at this point, nor in his bibliography is any reference made to the Nichols Index.
                    Another unfortunate omission  from Williams'
                    "functional" bibliography is W. Vernon Kinietz' The Indian
                        Tribes of the Western Great Lakes (Occasional Contributions of the Museum of Anthropology

               The Struggle for Responsible Government in the North-West Territories,

            Dr. Thomas is Provincial Archivist of Saskatchewan and has made full use of the materials there as
                    well as those of the federal and other provincial archives. The result is a political narrative of
                    Canadian territorial administration dating from the Dominion's acquisition of the
                    North-West Territories, in 1870, up to 1897 when responsible government was achieved.
            The government of the Honorable Hudson's Bay Company in the territories and the transfer of
                    governmental power to the Dominion is traced with the attitudes of the few newspapers in the new
                    territories considered. The feelings of the people of the territories, many of whom were Metis,
                    French-Indian mixtures, are discussed. The author notes the force of church leaders among these
                    people and the lack of understanding by many in the Dominion government of their role. The revolt of
                    the Metis, in 1870, led by Louis Riel is barely noticed, since Dr. Thomas discounts this effort
                    along with the Riel revolt of 1885 as not being a part of the main effort toward autonomous
                    government for the territories.
            Of the territory acquired by the Dominion in 1870, 
                        Manitoba
                     was granted provincial status from the start. Although the Riel revolt of 1870 is
                    considered as a major reason for the granting of autonomy to 
                        Manitoba
                    , the role of Riel is discounted.
            The gradual development of representative government in the territories is traced. The role of the
                    lieutenant-governor is developed and the growing importance of the  advisory council is traced from its ineffective beginning to
                    development into a legislature. The influence of the extension of the Canadian Pacific Railroad upon
                    the territories and the efforts of its promoters to keep the territories under federal
                    administration are mentioned but not developed extensively.
            The author notes the effects of the American territorial system upon the Canadian territories as it
                    was interpreted in 
                        Ottawa
                    . The experience gained by the Americans under their system, as set out in the Northwest
                    Ordinance in 1787, was ignored and only the system itself considered. After 1827, the 
                        United States
                     initiated territorial governments without the first stage (the step by which officials
                    were appointed by the federal government), and instituted governments only in the second stage which
                    provided for a territorial legislature. The North-West Territory started its political life in 1870
                    with an appointed government—long after the Americans had found that phase of development
                    unworkable.
            Dr. Thomas concludes that the Canadian government assumed the "Imperial mantle" of
                    Britain and used the mother country's policy of cautious, gradual extension of provincial
                    autonomy. American practices are evident in the Canadian system, but the Dominion government
                    generally adhered to British practices.
            This book has three small maps which amply illustrate the shift in boundaries and the electoral
                    districts set up during the territorial period. Several tables of population are included with
                    tabulations of electoral information pertinent to the discussion.
            That the narrative is a little hard for the reader to keep going, at times, does not detract from the
                    value of this study. Undoubtedly, some readers would like this book in a more expanded form to
                    include the Riel Revolts and fuller reasoning as to why Riel "did not represent the main
                    stream of the autonomy movement in the Canadian North-West."
            Historians interested in the study of Turner's frontier thesis might find considerable
                    material here for comparative purposes. The population movement in 
                        Canada
                     was also westward and met conditions similar to those encountered in the 
                        United States
                    . Dr. Thomas ably presents the political development of the Canadian frontier, but does
                    not go much beyond that consideration.

            The subtitle suggests the scope of this well-documented monograph on 
                        Detroit
                    's economy. The author begins with "
                        Detroit
                     in 1815," devotes chapters to "Transportation and
                    Communication," "The Settlement of the Hinterland," "Currency
                    and Exchange," "Commerce and Industry," and concludes with a brief eulogy
                    of Yankee achievement under the title, "
                        Detroit
                     at the Close of 1825." In competent fashion Mr. Dain defines the problems
                    confronting the community (dependable transportation, an adequate local food supply, and a stable
                    currency) and describes their solution.
            The period under consideration has special interest because it concerns 
                        Detroit
                    's transition from a leisurely, French, fur-trading, garrison village to a
                    bustling, Yankee, commercial town. The inevitable cultural conflict involved, while not explicitly
                    treated, is frequently suggested in the author's generous use of contemporary strictures
                    upon the habitant. He was "shiftless" and "lacking in
                    ambition." "He wasted … his time in idleness and amusement."
                    Certainly his habits and values were not those of the New Englanders who were flocking to 
                        Detroit
                    . And the migrant Yankee of the early nineteenth century was rarely tolerant of cultural
                    patterns that differed from his own. A fuller treatment of the processes whereby the habitant relinquished or lost his 
                        Detroit
                     lands would have been desirable.
            Many more studies of this kind are needed. Definitive syntheses in urban history cannot be written
                    until much more such spadework is done.

               The Critical Method in Historical Research and Writing. By Homer Carey Hockett. (
                        New York
                    : The Macmillan Company, 1955. Pp. xv, 330. Bibliography and index. $5.00.)
            Billed as a third edition of the author's well-known Introduction to Research
                        in American History, this useful book is, as its preface admits, not only reorganized and
                    largely  rewritten, but vastly expanded. The older editions were
                    organized around three main processes in historical research and writing: selection of subject and
                    material, critical evaluation of the material, and the process of composition.
            In the new volume, Hockett discusses the principles of historical criticism first, utilizing the
                    traditional division into external and internal criticism. He prefaces this section by a new
                    discussion of the importance of history and the role of the historian, concerns to which this
                    pragmatic age increasingly forces us to attend.
            Next the student is led step by step along the road to completion of the historical thesis. Bearing
                    the elements of criticism in mind, he learns how to choose a subject, how to gather data, and about
                    problems of note taking. The latter part of this section incorporates the last part of the earlier
                    editions concerning composition of the master's essay, with somewhat more added about the
                    importance of good writing, which, again, reflects a hopeful modern trend.
            In this latest edition, the third section is entirely new, entitled "Beyond the Masters
                    Degree," and serves both to guide the aspirant for the Ph.D. in meeting the requirements,
                    and to sketch the opportunities open to the student of history. By taking note of current historical
                    activities in government, business history, and war history, the author serves not only those who
                    intend to teach but points out other important areas for the professional historian.
            Much of this last section is devoted to a brief survey of American historiography. In the
                    reviewer's opinion this is not happily inspired. Such information is treated better and
                    more at length in various other works with which candidates for the higher degree will necessarily
                    have to acquaint themselves. It must be admitted, however, that it performs a real service in
                    drawing attention to the efforts of private collectors, libraries, and historical societies usually
                    overlooked in surveys of historical scholarship.
            It may also be objected that in broadening the title of his work Professor Hockett misleads the
                    reader, for the work is still largely centered on the problems of writing American
                    history and the developments of historical study in America. But the author rightfully seeks in his
                    title to stress the critical method, not only because it deals with something essential to success
                    in writing history, "but because  it involves a
                    discipline of mind and character which everyone needs" (p. 72). Many will agree that for
                    these modern times history might well replace the study of traditional logic. Historians themselves
                    too often sell their subject short in counseling and teaching. Its methodology offers as much or
                    more for those who would learn as does its content.
            The use of exercises in criticism suggested in earlier editions has apparently been well received,
                    for eight such exercises are suggested, including the extensively developed one previously included
                    concerning Van Buren's role in the election of 1824–1825. The author has very
                    practically provided, too, a considerable body of information about how to find material. A
                    bibliographic summary draws attention to bibliographies of bibliographies, bibliographic information
                    in comprehensive works of history, biographical dictionaries, indexes to periodicals and newspapers,
                    catalagues of books, government publications and guides to them, and the intricacies of statutes,
                    documents, and court records.
            Towards the end of his discussion on requirements for the master's degree the author permits
                    himself some remarks on "some conditions that must be faced" (pp.
                    173–180) that tend to be somewhat lacking in direction. However interesting, his remarks
                    tend to be the kind that will soon be dated, and to some extent preachify. The reviewer would take
                    serious issue, too, with the statement on page 185 that it is advisable for candidates for the
                    doctorate to limit themselves to subjects which can be developed by the use of printed materials
                    rather than collections of manuscripts or archival matter. The National Archives, Library of
                    Congress, state libraries and historical societies are all bursting with manuscripts and documents
                    fit for the doctoral candidate to batten on with great profit to the more mature scholar who needs
                    the monographic studies that will result and who alone has achieved the breadth of view to make
                    meaningful general syntheses. Reworking of well-known printed materials by any but the most
                    brilliant graduate students seldom results in a worthwhile contribution. The author's
                    objections that the Ph.D. candidate lacks the special techniques for the work in archival or
                    manuscript sources and that he is customarily refused access to them is not borne out by the
                    experiences of most of them.
            
            Altogether, despite these objections, it is with a sense of gratitude that the reviewer puts down
                    this work. So much useful information is here compiled, logically and conveniently, to spare the
                    mentor of aspiring students the effort that Hockett has performed for him, with a sensitivity and
                    grasp that most of us could not summon. The author teaches by example as well as precept, mirroring
                    implicity in his style the same lessons he discusses explicitly. Though possibly more pedestrian
                    than the similar works by Allan Nevins and Louis Gottschalk, and not as concise as Sherman 
                        Kent
                    's little manual, for the student interested in American history
                    Hockett's work is the most useful. Mixing stimulating generalizations with excellent
                    specific illustrations, the author should, in this work, imbue most readers with enthusiasm for
                    writing history.

               The Radical Novel in the 
                            United States
                         1900–1954. By Walter B. Rideout. (
                        Cambridge
                    : Harvard University Press, 1956. Pp. viii, 339. Bibliography, notes, and index.
                    $6.00.)
            The subtitle of Professor Walter B. Rideout's study of the radical novel, "Some
                    Interrelations of Literature and Society," underscores the book's scope and
                    method. This is not only a history of a certain literary type, the radical or proletarian novel, in
                    a given period but also an attempt to explore the connections between the type and the society which
                    produced it. In a sense then this book has a double focus, and although the author shifts back and
                    forth easily, the reader sometimes gets the impression that in the effort to handle two subjects
                    adequately he has given neither in satisfactory detail.
            Professor Rideout defines the radical novel clearly: "A radical novel, then, is one which
                    demonstrates, either explicitly or implicitly, that its author objects to the human suffering
                    imposed by some socioeconomic system and advocates that the system be fundamentally
                        changed" (p. 12). Using this criterion, he then proceeds to examine over 160
                    novels published in the first half of the twentieth century and to point out their distinctions in
                    theme, characterization, and  technique. Moreover, he sketches a
                    doctrinal history of the period (particularly in chapters 6 and 8) in order to show the evolution of
                    Socialist and Marxist dogma in the 
                        United States
                    . Occasionally this exposition of the social and economic background breaks up into
                    accounts of internecine party squabbles and gets in the way of the analysis of the fiction. Since
                    many of the novelists considered here were associated with the Masses or New Masses, a full account of these periodicals is given, but others with less
                    actual or symbolic value are neglected.
            The narrowness of the definition is an unfortunate limitation. Novels which do not spectacularly
                    raise the red banner of revolt are in effect disregarded although their criticism of the economic
                    status quo might be more devastating than that in some of the fiction discussed. Thus the author
                    relegates John Steinbeck's In Dubious Battle to a footnote because it
                    does not fit his schematic formula although it is probably the best strike novel in American
                    literature. The work of Robert Herrick is bypassed, probably because of the mildness of its social
                    criticism, and both Upton Sinclair and John Dos Passos are accorded less space than their prominence
                    would seem to merit.
            Nevertheless, Professor Rideout's book is a competent and lucid study. Important early
                    twentieth century novels like Friedman's By Bread Alone, Poole's
                        The Harbor, and 
                        London
                    's The Iron Heel are given close attention, and the later
                    work of Josephine Herbst, Robert Cantwell, Howard Fast, James Farrell, and Richard Wright is treated
                    adequately. Henry Roth's Call It Sleep (1935) receives the accolade of
                    "the most distinguished single proletarian novel." Professor Rideout has not only
                    plowed his way through a field of dreary, crude, uninspired fiction, much of it quite without
                    artistic pretension and certainly without readers today, but has classified it in regard to theme
                    and quality. He finds, for example, that proletarian fiction is concerned thematically with strikes,
                    the conversion of men to the cause, the coming of Socialism or Marxism, the squalid life of the
                    bottom dogs, and the supposed decadence and venality of the middle class. He sees little aesthetic
                    merit in most of this writing, chiefly because of the authors' addiction to melodrama and
                    violence, because of their oversimplified and therefore falsified characters, and because of their
                    compulsion to flaunt  their political dogma at all costs. He
                    observes also that most radical fiction has an urban locale and is not written by
                    authors who are themselves members of the working classes. The radical novel, as Upton
                    Sinclair's work so conspicuously illustrates, is more propaganda than art.
            As a final remark, one must commend the writer for his sense of balance and sanity. The radical novel
                    was one development of twentieth century American literature, but it was neither the sole
                    development nor the most important one. And today when the radical novel is almost moribund as a
                    type (Professor Rideout lists only fifteen titles from 1950 to 1954), it seems largely a soiled and
                    turbid backwater in the main stream of our letters.

               The Pursuit of Science in Revolutionary America, 1735–1789. By Brooke
                    Hindle. (

                    : University of 
                        North Carolina

                    $7.50.)
            The development of science in early America is a subject which has not previously been treated in a
                    unified fashion, and therefore Mr. Hindle's book fills a long-standing deficiency in the
                    history of this period. The emphasis in this work is generally on the individuals who contributed to
                    the development of an early American science, and although it is possible to question whether the
                    many references to somewhat insignificant figures are entirely warranted, it must be admitted that
                    describing the growth of science in terms of the men who directed it has merit.
            In addition, Mr. Hindle has also attempted to show the effects which changing political and social
                    attitudes had on the growth of science in the colonies, and he has been successful in showing the
                    close relationship between science and colonial society.
            The first part of the book, "Colonial Circles and Ties, 1735–1765," is
                    concerned with the early efforts of Americans to associate themselves with the international
                    attempts to advance man's knowledge of the sciences. As the author shows, the European
                    legacy of the scientific revolution extended across the ocean and stimulated colonials to contribute
                         their share. The Natural History Circle in the colonies,
                    assisted and encouraged by the 
                        London
                     merchant, Peter Collinson, was quite extensive and contained such eminent men as James
                    Logan and John Bartram of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , and John Clayton of 
                        Virginia
                    .
            Also included among the early scientific amateurs in North America were a group of medical
                    practitioners, who, as might be expected, felt a strong interest in natural history. Cadwallader
                    Colden of 
                        Philadelphia
                    , William Douglass of 
                        Boston
                    , John Lining of 
                        Charleston
                    , and many others made valuable contributions to early American science.
            Quite naturally, the early American scientists, holding up to admiration such organizations as the
                    Royal Society of 
                        London
                    , and the Academy of Sciences in 
                        Paris
                    , should have wished to achieve for themselves some form of co-operative scientific
                    institution. Their attempts to found societies for this purpose are described in detail by Hindle,
                    who shows how much the groups suffered from lack of interest, lack of facilities, and lack of a
                    cultured society in sufficient numbers to sustain a society over a period of years. Of all the
                    groups organized during the colonial period, perhaps the medical societies achieved the greatest
                    success. This was understandable in view of their common professional base.
            The coming of the American Revolution affected science in the colonies just as it affected every
                    other concern of the people. For one thing, it tended to make Americans conscious of their separate
                    destiny and of what means they possessed to fulfill it. Colonists developed a renewed interest in
                    science, especially in its relation to the promotion of better agriculture and to manufacturing. One
                    strong indication of this heightened interest is to be found in the revival of the Philosophical
                    Society, which had been formed in 1743 and then had faded away. In 1767 the Society took on a new
                    vigor, thanks to the activities of Thomas Bond, Edward Shippen, William Smith, and others. It soon
                    merged with the American Society, and thus was born a unified scientific group for North America.
            Hindle also points out that colonial interest in the sciences at this time was very much weighted
                    toward the idea of utility: science was to be studied because this study would produce something
                    beneficial or useful. This attitude  seems to have been
                    generally held throughout the entire period described.
            The outbreak of the War of the Revolution produced a new set of conditions for science and
                    scientists, and its general effect was one of disruption. There was, to be sure, no direct
                    interference from governments, and 
                        Franklin
                     and others worked diligently to keep open the channels of scientific communication
                    between the Old World and the New. However, the altering of life in the colleges, and the necessary
                    burdens of the war on those citizens who previously had led the pursuit of science—all
                    these factors contributed to a decline in interest and achievement in America.
            After the war the "Prophets of Glory," who were willing to assert on all occasions
                    the superiority of America to the Old World, did not neglect the sciences when they spoke of the
                    future. They painted a wonderful picture of the advances which would be made now that the arts and
                    sciences were no longer under subjection. However, as the author clearly shows, the new republic, in
                    comparison to Europe, had an intellectual environment which was substantially inferior.
            Still, strenuous efforts were made in the years of the early Republic. These included the vigorous
                    promotion of study in natural history, including its introduction into some of the colleges;
                    friendly relations with European correspondents in the realm of natural philosophy; and interest in
                    such subjects as astronomy, electricity, and magnetism.
            As the author indicates in the final chapter, America, in this period of fifty-four years, was not
                    able to make great and momentous contributions to the scientific knowledge of the world, but
                    Americans did share in the scientific interests of their parent continent. Perhaps the most
                    important fact is that many people of revolutionary America did achieve a sustained faith in the
                    good that could be derived from the pursuit of science, and to this they added a firm faith that
                    America was capable of creating an environment in which science could flourish. In terms of this
                    theme, and in terms also of the considerable information and documentation which characterize this
                    book, it must be regarded as one of the most valuable contributions to an understanding of early
                    American science.

            This brief volume is a very readable story of the period from 1763 to 1789, the formative years of
                    the American Republic. In fact, the reviewer feels that the chief value of the book lies in its
                    readability rather than in any new contribution it makes to our knowledge of the Revolutionary era.
                    As one of the volumes in the University of 
                        Chicago
                    's new series on the "History of American Civilization," the
                    book's main audience undoubtedly will be undergraduate students enrolled in survey courses.
                    Dr. Morgan's narrative should be able to hold the attention and interest of the general
                    reader.
            Dr. Morgan advocates the well-known theme that 
                        England
                    's New Colonial Policy after 1763—particularly the new policy of
                    taxation—was the main cause of the American Revolution. He claims that the colonial
                    leaders from the beginning were unalterably opposed to all parliamentary taxation of the colonists
                    for revenue purposes, regardless of whether these taxes were "internal" or
                    "external." Unfortunately, perhaps, he has presented a one-sided view of the
                    Revolution. After briefly discussing parliamentary taxation and the colonial response to
                    it—in chapters with the eye-catching titles of "Sugar and Stamps,"
                    "Peace Without Honor," and "Troops and Tea"—Dr.
                    Morgan asks the question: "Were the colonists sincere in their declarations of principle or
                    were they merely trying to avoid the unpleasant task of paying taxes that they ought to have
                    paid?" He then declares that the book "has proceeded on the conviction that the
                    colonists' attachment to principle was genuine" (p. 51). Although he acknowledges
                    that other historians may disagree with this theory, he often fails to give an adequate treatment of
                    the opposing views.
            Dr. Morgan looks upon the Revolution primarily as a revolt against 
                        England
                     and feels that the internal changes and disputes in the colonies were of secondary
                    importance. He states that the "most radical change produced in Americans by the Revolution
                    was in fact not a division at all but the union of three million cantankerous colonists into a new
                    nation" (p. 100). The rest of his story deals with the molding of this new nation, the
                    adoption of state constitutions, the  Articles of Confederation
                    and, finally, the Constitution of the 
                        United States
                    . The author has much praise for the accomplishments of the government under the
                    Articles but recognizes the weaknesses of the government. In discussing the Constitutional
                    Convention, he refutes Charles Beard's interpretation and defends the patriotism and public
                    spirit of the members of that convention.
            Dr. Morgan's scholarship is irreproachable. In his earlier book, The Stamp Act
                        Crisis, he has given us one of the best accounts of parliamentary taxation and its
                    reception by the colonists. The theories he advanced in this previous volume have been repeated
                    here, but without elaboration. Space limitations imposed by the editors undoubtedly prevented him
                    from being more thorough. The use of some footnotes, if only a few, would have increased the value
                    of this book. In his very short bibliographical note Dr. Morgan could mention only a few authors,
                    yet the reviewer feels that the omission of such names as C. H. VanTyne, G. O. Trevelyan, and A. C.
                    McLaughlin—to mention several—was regrettable.
            To discuss coherently this important quarter-century in the space of 157 pages is indeed a difficult
                    task. Dr. Morgan has done a fine job of presenting his views on the subject. If this book attracts a
                    large audience among students and casual readers who prefer to do their reading "without
                    the trimmings," it will have served a worthy cause.

               The Cultural Heritage of the Swedish Immigrant, Selected References. By O.
                    Fritiof Ander. Augustana Library Publications, No. 27. (
                  Rock
                            Island, Illinois
               : Augustana
                    College Library, 1956. Pp. xix, 191. $3.00.)
            For a hundred years, Augustana College has been the special agent for the Royal Library of Stockholm
                    for the gathering of materials on Swedish immigration, and it now has the most extensive collection
                    in the 
                        United States
                    . The compiler of this bibliography is a distinguished member of the Augustana faculty
                    and has long been recognized as an authority on the Swedes in America. It was not surprising
                    therefore that the Swedish Pioneer Historical Society turned to Dr. Ander for the preparation of a
                    bibliography on Swedish  immigration, and that the American
                    Philosophical Society, the Social Science Research Council, Augustana College, and various other
                    organizations, gave the project their support. The result is a volume of which the author and his
                    sponsors can be justly proud.
            Dr. Ander modestly affirms that his work must not be regarded as "definitive," but
                    it is unlikely that anyone else will ever produce a more inclusive bibliography of Swedish
                    immigration. Anyone who has ever made even a select list of references will appreciate what a
                    back-breaking, time-consuming and exacting job the preparation of such a bibliography is. Few have
                    the expert knowledge, the patience and the stamina to complete such a huge undertaking. Dr. Ander is
                    primarily concerned with "Little Sweden" in the 
                        United States
                    , that is, with immigrants still conscious that they are immigrants. Therefore, his
                    major attention is focused on immigrant sources. But because the history of Swedish immigration is
                    so closely interwoven with the whole history of nineteenth century Sweden, it was necessary to comb
                    the libraries and depositories on both sides of the Atlantic. In addition to the thousands of items
                    cited in this volume, the author tells us that his original manuscript, deposited in the Augustana
                    College Library, contains some 1500 additional English and Swedish titles, which will be made
                    available to interested scholars.
            Professor Ander's bibliography is divided into ten subdivisions. A reviewer can hardly do
                    more than indicate the contents of each section. First of all, there is a bibliography of
                    bibliographies, which includes not only printed materials but lists of references from M.A. and
                    Ph.D. theses on Swedish immigration. Chapter 2 deals with the background of the Swedish folk
                    migration, and demonstrates once more that emigration and immigration can never be sharply
                    separated. Chapter 3 is devoted to the many "America books" produced by immigrants
                    and travelers, and chapter 4 is concerned with emigrant guidebooks, including those prepared by
                    steamship, railroad and land companies. Chapter 5 deals with the general contributions of the
                    immigrants to American life, especially in agriculture and labor, and chapter 8 with their
                    activities in the realm of art, music and the theater. Chapters 6 and 7 are devoted to the church,
                    education, and religious and secular literature. Religion helped  the stranger in a strange land to preserve his identity; it became a compelling factor in the
                    life of most Swedish-American communities, and it particularly affected their literature and music.
                    Chapter 9 is devoted primarily to Swedish-American newspapers, periodicals, and annuals, for, like
                    other immigrant groups, the Swedes issued scores of foreign-language papers and periodicals. The
                    mortality rate among them was high, although both the religious and secular press generally appealed
                    to a larger community than the particular locality where the publications appeared. Incidentally, as
                    Professor Ander points out, letters to the editors are an important and still largely unexploited
                    source for the history of immigration. The final chapter deals with archival materials and a wide
                    variety of primary sources difficult to classify, and indicates the libraries, here and abroad,
                    where they may be found.
            The debt of the scholar to Dr. Ander for this exhaustive bibliography is immeasurable. It will be an
                    unfailing guide for students and scholars for many years to come. Each chapter is provided with a
                    short, historical introduction, which provides the reader with penetrating observations on various
                    phases of Swedish immigration. If this introductory material could be gathered together into an
                    uninterrupted narrative, it would in itself constitute an excellent short history of Swedish
                    immigration in the 
                        United States

               A History of the School of Law, Columbia University. By the Staff of the
                    Foundation for Research in Legal History under the Direction of Julius Goebel, Jr. (
                        New York

            This monumental and heavily footnoted history of Columbia University School of Law could almost be a
                    history of any living American law school of its approximate age, by substituting names of men and
                    changing some dates. It could almost pass as a history of the development of legal education in the 
                        United States
                    . This book is not light reading, but it will be of interest and value to the law alumni
                    of Columbia University and to all who are interested in legal education in the 
                        United States
                    .
            
            It is essentially a reference book, a "who's who" of the deans, originally
                    wardens, of the teachers, and of some of the distinguished alumni of the School of Law at 
                        Columbia
                    . Like a history of most institutions it is a history of men and their accomplishments.
                    Some portrayed therein contributed greatly to the institution; others contributed little, if
                    anything.
            The writers start the story with the creation of a professorship of law in 1793 and the election of
                    James 
                        Kent
                     to that professorship. In the winter of 1794 
                        Kent
                     gave two lectures a week to seven students and thirty-six auditors. In his next series
                    of lectures, given the following winter, only two students appeared. In the third year none came,
                    but in the year following half a dozen attended. During this time, 
                        Kent
                     had been elected to the assembly, appointed recorder of the City of 
                        New York
                    , and finally appointed to a judgeship on the Supreme Court of 
                        New York
                    . After 
                        Kent
                     resigned his professorship in early 1798, this small and uncertain beginning of legal
                    education lay dormant at 
                        Columbia
                     for a quarter century.
            In 1823, when 
                        Kent
                     retired as chancellor and came back to 
                        New York
                     City, he was again elected to the professorship of law and started a new series of
                    lectures which continued over the next three years and which were better attended. In 1826 
                        Kent
                     abandoned his lecturing, not because of a lack of students but because of the demands
                    of his private practice. He continued as professor of law in name only for another twenty years,
                    until his death, but he never lectured again.
            The importance of these lectures is not so much the offering of legal education at 
                        Columbia
                    , but rather that these lectures furnished the basis for his four volumes of Commentaries, published between 1826 and 1830, which had a tremendous impact upon
                    the whole legal profession in this country.
            It is doubtful that it could properly be said that 
                        Kent
                     founded the School of Law at Columbia University. At best, he was but its prophet.
            The real credit for the founding of the School of Law must go to Theodore W. Dwight who was appointed
                    to the professorship of law in 1852, and who for the next twenty years gave all the instruction in
                    law. Dwight ran the School of Law almost as a proprietary institution for nearly forty  years. He taught one course at a time and used textbooks exclusively, a
                    method now looked upon with horror by the law teaching profession. Yet so effective were
                    Dwight's comments, so thought-provoking his questions, that he inspired in his students a
                    desire to learn more for themselves.
            Although several additional members joined the law faculty and a School actually existed, it became
                    increasingly clear that the School of Law was Theodore W. Dwight. The president of Columbia
                    University insisted in 1890 upon a curricular overhaul, and brought to the law faculty Professor
                    William Albert Keener, of the 
                        Harvard
                     Law School faculty, a strong advocate of the case system of teaching law. On the
                    retirement of Dwight soon after, Keener became dean, and the case system was adopted, to be enriched
                    throughout the years following by the faculty under the wise guidance of Harlan Fisk Stone, Young B.
                    Smith, and others.
            The history of the Columbia University School of Law illustrates the dispute over what law teaching
                    should be. Should it be only a teaching of craft skills, or should it include also an understanding
                    of the problems of the society in which those skills will be used? This book indicates that Columbia
                    University School of Law has done a satisfactory job in both directions.

               The Big Business Executive: The Factors That Made Him, 1900–1950. By
                    Mabel Newcomer. (
                        New York
                    : Columbia University Press, 1955. Pp. xii, 164. Index. $4.00.)
            Mabel Newcomer's name has long been associated with high scholarship in the realm of
                    economics. On this occasion she has turned her talents to the realm of corporate management. She is
                    concerned with the shifts in management attributes during the first half of the twentieth century
                    and especially with the endowments of modern "career" or
                    "professional" managers. The book represents a logical extension or refinement of
                    the thesis of A. A. Berle, Jr., and G. C. Means in The Modern Corporation and Private
                        Property (1932).
            Modern managers are no longer major stockholders or of the family. Furthermore, the officials are not
                    well known. Advertising and public relations extol the products and  company name. The shift in the type of executive from owners, founders,
                    and plungers prompted investigation of the personal qualifications. Major corporations were selected
                    for the years 1900, 1925, and 1950. Detailed data was unearthed on the president and the chairman of
                    the board in the firms as of the three years.
            Dr. Newcomer is at her best in treating the variety of exectuive backgrounds, yet her modal man is
                    intriguing: 
                        The typical executive of 1950 is a native American, the son of a small, independent business
                            man. His family's income was moderate, and such jobs as he pursued during his
                            boyhood were for extra spending money rather than to help support the family. His parents
                            managed to put him through college, with such contributions as he himself made to his own
                            expenses through part-time employment, mostly in summer. Upon graduation he obtained a
                            full-time job, with no assistance from his family. Thenceforward he was on his own. While
                            still relatively young and inexperienced he obtained a minor position with the corporation
                            that he eventually headed, and he gradually worked up, through operations or production, to
                            a vice presidency, from which he was promoted to the presidency at the age of fifty-two.
                            Although he has had specialized professional training, he has never practiced independently,
                            nor has he at any time run a business of his own as his father did. He is a business
                            administrator—a bureaucrat—with little job experience outside his own
                            corporation. His investments in "his" company are nominal, in terms of
                            potential control—less than 0.1 percent of the total stock outstanding. He is a
                            Republican in politics; he attends the Episcopalian church, if he attends church at all; and
                            he served the federal government in an advisory capacity during the war. He was, in 1950,
                            sixty-one years of age, and he will probably be seventy when he retires, (p. 149).
                    
            
            Concern is expressed over the departure of the mode from the ideal. The self-perpetuating arrangement
                    with internal advancement unduly limits the choice of successors. Senior executives come into power
                    too late to develop long term policies. The more dynamic companies in terms of growth appointed
                    younger officials than the relatively static companies. There is seemingly more democracy now as
                    compared with 1900 in the race for the top. The poor college graduate has a better chance than ever
                    before. Swelling ranks of products of schools of business administration may soon furnish an
                    increasing number of leaders. Dr. Newcomer approves of the shifts since 1900 but not without
                    sophisticated reservations. Her book represents important reading for students of corporate
                    management whether they be in  the classrooms of universities
                    and colleges or members of boards of directors wondering how to keep their corporate houses in good
                    hands.
            The book should be fascinating to those who dreamed of success in the ulcerous profession of top
                    management yet somehow were shunted or wandered into another pursuit. Everyone can locate the point
                    or points where he left or quit climbing on the corporate ladder of success.

               American Issues. Revised and enlarged edition. Edited by Willard Thorp, Merle
                    Curti, and Carlos Baker. Vols. I, II. (

                    bibliography, appendix, and index. $13.00.)
            In the revised and enlarged edition of American Issues the editors have attempted to strengthen some
                    sections of their earlier anthology (1941 and 1944) and, by the addition of recent material which
                    illustrates the turbulent days since the close of World War II, they have sought to give the present
                    publication contemporary significance. Here is in part (and a very sizable part at that) a written
                    record of American life—American thought and action as reflected in this collection of
                    readings and documents. The coverage of these two volumes is intended to present a well-rounded
                    picture of our political, social, and cultural development. Naturally, many authors, beginning with
                    John Smith and Increase Mather and concluding with Karl Shapiro and Reinhold Niebuhr, are included.
                    In short, here are northerners, southerners, easterners, and westerners responding to the issues
                    confronting them.
            The first volume, The Social Record, points out these issues which have permeated
                    our society. The vast array of speeches, essays, letters, pamphlets, and excerpts from biographies
                    and autobiographies are arranged chronologically under twenty-four special topics—for
                    example, "The Struggle for Freedom," and "The Passing of the
                    Frontier." The editors introduce each topic by interpretive comments which are lucid and
                    discerning. The second volume, The Literary Record, includes "only such
                    writing as can honestly be said to  show the artist's
                    hand at work, consciously shaping his material" (p. v). But much of our literature is an
                    outgrowth, consciously or unconsciously, of the basic issues which have been covered in the first
                    volume. Hence the editors believe that for an understanding of American literature a thorough
                    knowledge of social history is necessary. In addition, the editors consider a chronological
                    presentation of fewer authors to be more effective than a hodge-podge of everything, as is the case
                    with many anthologies of literature. In both volumes short biographical accounts and provocative
                    head-notes give background material for each writer included.
            One question seems pertinent. Is the basic division of the material justified? Some readers may
                    question the loose use of the term "social" and the rigid rule by which a
                    particular literary writing was included or excluded. When is a piece of writing the conscious
                    creation of the artist's imaginative mind? It is not the intention of the present reviewer
                    to discuss what is or what is not a work of art but rather to point out that the editors by their
                    predetermined classification have had to overcome an inherent weakness of the anthology by
                    arbitrarily assigning certain writings to categories which may be debatable. Furthermore, by lifting
                    a selection from an author and fitting it into an editorial pigeonhole, the reader may not arrive at
                    a proper perspective of the author. Although it is customary to include in texts of American
                    literature excerpts from the journal of Sarah Kemble Knight and portions of the diary of Samuel
                    Sewall, now that the editors have compiled a social history some readers will ask whether the
                    writings of Sewall and Knight are not more appropriate for the social than the literary record. It
                    is the age-old problem of how to organize your material after you have diligently gathered it. For
                    the most part, the editors have done well, but the very nature of their organization and the
                    division of these two volumes will cause some disagreement.
            Many anthologies raise the question of inclusion and exclusion; and in the case of the American Issues the question is not concerned with each separate volume but the volumes as
                    a whole. One of the good qualities of this work is the variety of material presented, some of which
                    is not easily accessible elsewhere. In fact, the Social Record contains many more
                    writings than would ordinarily be expected. In  regard to the
                        Literary Record the editors may have achieved their stated objective (a
                    sampling of fewer authors), but some critics will assert that this approach is not necessarily more
                    "profitable." These critics will say that the Literary Record is
                    but a pale reflection compared with the all-inclusive light emanating from the Social Record. Here
                    again is the incessant problem of how many trees does one have to observe before he can see the
                    forest. Does it require the writings of many authors or not so many?
            Then there is the problem of which and how much of an author's prose or poetry should be
                    included. The convenient and partial solution lies much within the purpose and whims of the editors.
                    Thus the editorial answer to this problem becomes a matter of selectivity which in turn may cause
                    disagreement among the readers. For example, there is in the opinion of this reviewer an adequate
                    amount of Benjamin 
                        Franklin
                    's writing but an inadequate proportion with respect to William
                    Bradford's.
            Of the two volumes, the Social Record shows superior editorial workmanship. The
                    selections listed under each basic issue usually illustrate what the editors intended the writings
                    to do. The Literary Record, with its chronological listing of the authors and
                    their works, is just another survey of American literature which does not indicate clearly the
                    relationship of the literary movements (romanticism, realism, etc.) to the dominant issues outlined
                    in the social history. It is true that there are some allusions to the issues in the various
                    biographical accounts of the authors, but it is questionable whether or not the reader will readily
                    understand the interrelationship implied by the title. The title, American Issues,
                    is appropriate for the Social Record, but it is not for the Literary
                        Record. The latter volume also appears to have been hastily revised. Why was there very
                    little revision of the biographical notes of several of the contemporary writers? For example, the
                    introductory comments about Ernest Hemingway leave him in the 1940's. Did not Hemingway and
                        The Old Man and the Sea make quite a literary splash in 1952? This reviewer
                    also questions the reprinting of The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne,
                    especially since this novel is easily accessible elsewhere, including paperbound editions, and since
                    the editors have apologized for the lack of space.
            
            The volumes are splendidly bound, and the index is good. For an easy place reference on the page
                    there are marginal notations indicating the number of lines. Another admirable feature of these
                    volumes is the date (found at the end of the selection) when each selection was written. The
                    technical and mechanical errors were held to a minimum. John Winthrop supervised the departure of
                    many who sailed from 
                        England
                     to 
                        Massachusetts
                     Bay, but he did this in 1630 and not "in 1636" (Vol. I, p. 53).
            Devotees of Indiana history will find Theodore Dreiser spending his youth at 
                        Terre Haute
                    , Ezra Pound teaching for a brief period at 
                        Wabash
                     College, and Ambrose Bierce enlisting in the Ninth Indiana regiment during the Civil
                    War. You may walk the streets of 
                        Muncie
                     with Robert S. and Helen Merrell Lynd. Albert J. Beveridge tells us in his defense of
                    American imperialism that we are "God's chosen people" (Vol. I, p. 916).
                    George Gary Eggleston, a native son of Vevay, Indiana, and a brother of Edward Eggleston, marches
                    with the Confederate Army. We read about that droll 
                        Kentland
                     boy, George Ade, rising above the status of a salesman peddling patent medicines.
            These volumes are truly a treasury of American life and culture—a comprehensive survey
                    which boldly asserts its claim to a place on any private or public library shelf. This reviewer
                    suggests that the publisher consider a third volume, one dealing primarily with official state
                    papers and political documents; then the set would attain unquestionable uniqueness and usefulness
                    in the areas most frequently needed by serious students of American civilization.

               By These Words: Great Documents of American Liberty, Selected and Placed in Their
                        Contemporary Settings, By Paul M. Angle. (
                        New York

            With that rare combination of historical accuracy, fluent style, and editorial selection displayed so
                    capably in his 1947 bestseller, The Lincoln Reader, Paul Angle has once again
                    produced a volume useful not only to the history major but  also
                    to the average American. This volume, as the subtitle indicates, consists of "great
                    documents of American liberty." As the author has pointed out, a document in itself is
                    often something less than exciting reading. Placed in its contemporary setting, however, with
                    carefully written introductions that scintillate and enlighten, each document can take on a
                    significance and interest for the modern reader which might otherwise be totally lacking. Mr.
                    Angle's success with this plan is evident from the fact that this volume, like The Lincoln Reader, was chosen as an offering by one of the national book clubs.
            In the selection of the forty-six documents which mark more than three centuries of American thought
                    and progress, Mr. Angle's choice fell on those that exemplified "two themes that
                    have distinguished American history from the beginning: the growth of democratic government, and the
                    evolution and defense of individual liberty." The author's choice here was a
                    judicious one about which there should be little if any quibbling. While the selections range from
                    the Mayflower Compact to Eisenhower's First Inaugural Address, there is a unity about the
                    series that is evident from the beginning.
            The first nine documents, covering the colonial period, are highlighted by Andrew 
                        Hamilton
                    's brilliant defense of freedom of the press in the Zenger Case and James
                    Otis' speech against writs of assistance. Eleven more documents carry the series from the
                    Confederation period to 1854. The twelve documents that cover the Civil War and Reconstruction era
                    begin with John Brown's Last Speech (1859) and end with President Johnson's 1866
                    message to Congress in which he pleaded for reunion without vengeance. The latter nineteenth
                    century, notably lacking in any number of great documents, statements, or messages, is represented
                    by a single document, namely, Governor Peter Altgeld's famous protest to President 
                        Cleveland
                     against using the regular army to break 
                        Chicago
                    's Pullman strike. For the twentieth century thirteen documents were chosen,
                    the bulk of them from the statements of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt does
                    not appear in the selections.
            The selection of court decisions is interesting, to say the least. Of the six which Mr. Angle has
                    seen fit to include, one, Commonwealth v. Hunt (1842), is from a
                    state court; one,  the Ulysses decision of
                    1933, is from a 
                        United States
                     District Court; and four, the Merryman Case (1861), the Milligan Case (1866), Abrams et al. v. U. S. (1919), and the Gaines Case (1938) are from the Supreme
                    Court of the 
                        United States
                    . In the Abrams case the famous dissenting opinion of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was
                    used. Somewhat unusual, but nonetheless apropos, is the inclusion among the documents of American
                    liberty of such ones as these: John Brown's Last Speech, 
                        South Carolina
                    's declaration of Causes for Secession, Lee's Farewell to the Army of
                    Northern 
                        Virginia
                    , and the McKinley-Root Instructions to the Philippine Commission.
            There are inaugural addresses by six men, namely, 
                        Washington
                    , Jefferson, Lincoln, Wilson, Eisenhower, and Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy. Among
                    the statements, addresses, and proclamations of presidents are these: 
                        Washington
                    's Farewell Address, the 
                        Monroe
                     Doctrine, Jackson's Proclamation against Nullification, Lincoln's
                    Message to Congress presenting the Case for the Union, the Emancipation Proclamation, the 
                        Gettysburg
                     Address, Johnson's Annual Message of 1866, Wilson's famous
                    "peace without victory" address to the Senate (January, 1917), Wilson's
                    clear summary of the reasons for requesting war with 
                        Germany
                     (April, 1917), 
                        Franklin
                     Roosevelt's "quarantine" speech, the Four Freedoms Message,
                    the Atlantic Charter (with Winston Churchill), and his address to the nation on December 9, 1941,
                    following the declaration of war against 
                        Japan
                    .
            In the reviewer's opinion errors of fact in the historical introductions are practically
                    non-existent. Only one minor one was noted: the declaration of war against 
                        Japan
                     in 1941 was not in fact "unanimous" (p. 515), although it certainly
                    was close to being so. Three days later the declaration of war against 
                        Germany
                     and 
                        Italy
                     was unanimous.
            The illustrations of Edward A. Wilson add life and spirit to a volume which is worthy of a place in
                    the hands and hearts of all Americans.

               The Making of the Modern World, from the Renaissance to the Present. By Richard
                    M. Brace. (

            Richard M. Brace's The Making of the Modern World was published as a
                    companion volume to Stewart Easton's The Heritage of The Past and covers
                    the period from the Renaissance to the present. In keeping with a current trend in texts of this
                    kind, Professor Brace has greatly expanded the material in the "non-European"
                    chapters—e.g., those on Asia and America—in an attempt to give the
                    "European" chapters a more adequate and proper frame of reference. Moreover, an
                    effort has been made in this text to arrive at a better balance between purely political
                    developments and those of a social, economic, or intellectual nature. In this respect, however, it
                    is this reviewer's opinion that Easton's Heritage is superior to
                    Professor Brace's volume.
            Considered as a textbook The Making of the Modern World may well prove to be a
                    strong contender in the "second-semester European Civilization" field. There is an
                    introductory chapter entitled "Europe's Inheritance in 1500" which, in
                    thirty-odd pages, concisely and helpfully sets the stage for the main themes of European history of
                    the last four and a half centuries. Most instructors who are familiar with the retention curve of
                    students between the first semester's final examination period and the opening lecture of
                    the second semester will probably feel that chapters of this kind have a definite place in college
                    history textbooks. In addition, The Making of the Modern World has illustrations
                    which actually illustrate the text material, adequate bibliographies at the end of each chapter, and
                    a series of excellent maps, many of which do more than simply indicate boundary changes at the
                    conclusions of wars—e.g., one captioned "The Expansion of Political Democracy in
                    Europe (after 1914)."
            Perhaps the strongest suit of this volume, however, is the author's willingness to
                    subordinate the traditional national and/or chronological emphasis found in "European
                    Civilization" texts to a broader topical approach. It may be argued, on a "first
                    things first" basis, that current freshman-student knowledge of European history demands
                    the foundation provided by the "nation by nation, king by king"  approach. On the other hand, for the vast majority of European
                    Civilization students, for whom the survey course is the first and last such course, it would seem
                    preferable to expose them to more of the ideas and theories behind the specific
                    episodes of European history than to count on their retaining the details of the episodes
                    themselves. Thus, Professor Brace has devoted considerable space to discussion of such topics as
                    "Absolutism," "Revolutionary Ideas," and "Reactionary
                    and Liberal Tendencies," thereby providing the student with broad frameworks of ideas which
                    are illustrated and demonstrated in those chapters which deal with separate national histories. In
                    this way, The Making of the Modern World may help to solve a common problem of
                    European Civilization students, i.e., the bewildering effect of being jerked abruptly from dynasty
                    to dynasty and from nation to nation, with the most apparent objectives being to cover a certain
                    number of centuries and to include the "powerful" nations.

                    Committee, it is in no sense an authorized work, and it was prepared independently of the Republican
                    party.
            The book presents the outward aspects of various stages of the development of the Republican party.
                    It contains vivid pictorial material, and is particularly strong in portraits of presidential
                    candidates of the G.O.P. All Republican presidential  candidates
                    from John C. Fremont to Eisenhower are shown in individual pictures, in family groups, and at
                    official functions surrounded by party heroes.
            Republicans will find the materials selected and the subjects emphasized far more congenial and
                    satisfactory to their conceptions of the history of the last century than will Democrats. Many of
                    the cartoons, posters, and other pictorial selections taken from dramatic and emotional episodes
                    insinuate the superior virtues of the Republicans. The misfortunes of the Grant and Harding
                    administrations are dealt with so lightly that they escape notice. One would never suspect from the
                    material, aside from some election maps, that either Woodrow Wilson or Franklin D. Roosevelt
                    existed. There are many pleasing pictures of Hughes, Hoover, Landon, Willkie, and Dewey. But, after
                    all, it is a pictorial history of the Grand Old Party!
            In these days of mass culture, perhaps it is understandable that experiments in reaching large
                    numbers of people through pictures as the chief means of communication will be attempted. But the
                    reviewer is not convinced by anything which has yet come to his attention that effective
                    presentation of history is possible by this device. "History" is
                    "inquiry," and to inquire is to ponder, to speculate, to search for truth.
            
               Grand Old Party, a Pictorial History is superficial, has no concern with
                    philosophical undercurrents, and no intellectual appeal. In short, while it has some interest for
                    those interested in history, it is not in itself history.

               A Literary Map of Indiana. Prepared jointly by the Indiana Council of Teachers
                    of English and the Indiana College English Association. (
                        Indianapolis
                    , 1956. $1.50.)
            This literary map, colorfully drawn in blue and gold, represents graphically the writers
                    "identified with Indiana and its culture. All, native or adopted, have concerned themselves
                    with Indiana people and scenes or have brought distinction to the state through their imaginative or
                    artistic literature—and, in a few instances, history." Decorative sketches or
                    scenes related to the literature of Indiana are included. 
                    Artist for the map was Warren V. Casey, Ball State Teachers College. Copies may be obtained from
                    Seward S. Craig, Thomas Carr Howe High School, 
                        Indianapolis

               The Appraisal of Modern Public Records. By T. R. Schellenberg. Bulletins of the
                    National Archives No. 8. (
                        Washington
                    : The National Archives, 1956. Pp. 46.)
            Explicit in this publication is the viewpoint that it is neither possible nor desirable to save all
                    public records; hence selection of those to be preserved (or destroyed) is inevitable. This bulletin
                    discusses general principles for determining which records should be preserved. It wisely indicates
                    the need for archivists to consult with scholars who use the records, but it unfortunately seems to
                    relegate the latter to a somewhat minor role in the actual decisions about what is to be saved.
         
         
            
               Report of the

                         Conference on the History of Philanthropy in the

                    : Russell Sage Foundation, 1956, Pp. 84. Appendices. $1.00.)
            This volume resulted from a two-day conference which the Russell Sage Foundation sponsored at 
                        Princeton
                     early in 1956 on historical research in American philanthropy. Attention was given to
                    the need for more and especially for better research on "widespread voluntary
                    giving" which "is an almost unique characteristic of the 
                        United States
                    , or at least of Anglo-Saxon people, and has greatly influenced our
                    institutions" (pp. 5–6). Exploration was made of ways and means of stimulating
                    such research, and topics which might be worthy of special study were listed. Slightly more than
                    half of the report is given to a select bibliography of the development and present status of
                    philanthropy, especially in the 
                        United States
