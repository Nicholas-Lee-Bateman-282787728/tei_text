            <p>The Civil War was the greatest challenge Indiana's democratic government had met. The war
                    affected all of the citizens of the state, penetrated their vital social relations, and threatened
                    their necessary and cherished organizations. The way the people met that challenge constitutes
                    muchof the history of the war years in Indiana.</p>
            <p>That all patriots yield obedience to the voice of the people when expressed in a constitutional
                    manner and that all citizens unite in preserving the Union and the Constitution was the message of
                    Abraham Lincoln to the people of Indiana as he journeyed from <placeName>

                    ominous deed. Some were gloomy because of the portent of war. Others were angry because of the

            <p>Angry or sad, the people responded immediately. In two mass meetings in <placeName>

                    their sanction to these same loyal sentiments. When President Lincoln and Governor Oliver P. Morton
                    called for troops, volunteers came forward in such numbers that Indiana's quota could have

            <p>The border states were in a difficult position, for their people were divided in sentiment, and none
                    relished the prospect of their land becoming a battleground of contending armies. Indianans were

            <p>A large number of Indiana citizens were natives of southern states or the children of transplanted

                    southerners were not so numerous in the northern counties of Indiana, but they were quite numerous

                    had helped to make Indiana a free state in 1816. They knew from experience some of the injustices
                    involved in slavery, and they did not want them in Indiana. They did not object, however, to this
                    institution in the southern states until efforts to preserve it threatened the unity of the nation.</p>
            <p>War issues tended to divide the people of Indiana, to break the unity of families, to form groups
                    with different ideals, to split political parties into factions, and to prevent representative
                    government from functioning smoothly. A few Hoosiers who were pro-southern were willing to acquiesce
                    in disunion. Jesse D. Bright, whose influence was dominant in the Democratic party for some years
                    before 1860, shared these views. He was expelled from the <placeName>

                    Democrats opposed the use of force and insisted that the Union could be preserved by concessions to
                    the South. Included in this faction were Lambdin P. Milligan, John C. Walker, and Horace Heffren,
                    individuals associated with the secret political societies.</p>
            <p>More numerous were the Constitutional Union men who wanted to preserve the Union and therefore
                    supported the war, but who opposed such measures as the tariff and the National Banking Act. Many of
                    these Union men were willing to offer some concessions to prevent a war or to bring an early peace.

                    Nevertheless they declared that they were unwilling to fight an abolition war.</p>
            <p>A few War Democrats openly supported the state and national administrations and joined with the
                    Republicans in forming the Union party. Among the War Democrats were former Governor Joseph A.

            <p>The firing on Fort Sumter not only started the Civil War but made it necessary for Indiana Democrats
                    to readjust themselves rather quickly. They had recently been engaged in state and national
                    political campaigns with considerable intensity and had continued their criticism of and hostility
                    toward the Lincoln and Morton administrations. After April 12, vigorous hostility began to assume
                    the aspects of disloyalty, which the Republicans were quick to turn to their advantage. Such action
                    only increased the anger of the Democrats and made their protests more vigorous. Although the
                    remarks of the Democrats were often tactless, the Republicans did not prefer charges in a civil
                    court against them, much less secure a conviction in a criminal court against anyone.</p>
            <p>The war not only embarrassed Democrats, but it also divided Republicans. The latter differed about
                    the concessions they would make to avoid war, but the real division came later in respect to the
                    Emancipation Proclamation. Was the preservation of the Union the sole purpose of the war? At the
                    beginning the answer was almost always in the affirmative. A few Republicans, however, like George
                    W. Julian, "had no love for a proslavery Union." He regarded liberty as more

            <p>In the naming of his cabinet, Lincoln tried to counteract the division within the party. He chose
                    party leaders who represented different elements and sectional groups in order that he might keep
                    the support of all factions. For secretary of the interior, Lincoln chose Caleb B. Smith, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who had been a lawyer, a newspaper publisher, and a railroad president. An advocate of
                    internal improvements, Smith was elected to the state house of representatives from 1832 to 1842.
                    From 1843 to 1849 he served Indiana as a member of the national House of Representatives. He was a
                    skilled stump speaker, and his appointment came to him at least in part because of his support of
                    Lincoln in the Republican national convention in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His appointment was also a recognition of the important role played by Indiana
                    Republicans in Lincoln's nomination and election. It has also been alleged that the choice
                    resulted from a pre-nomination pledge made by Judge David Davis and Joseph Medill to secure the
                    selection of Lincoln by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> convention and which Lincoln felt obligated to carry out although it was made without
                    his knowledge. Smith remained in the cabinet for less than two years; his resignation became
                    effective on January 1, 1863.</p>

            <p>Indiana's geographical position, her large population, and her large crops of agricultural
                    products made her support of the war important. Since the state was located between the Great Lakes

                    Atlantic ports. Other railroads which ran from north to south were prepared to carry troops,
                    supplies, and food to the armies which were soon located in the south central states. Indiana was a
                    part of the great production area for wheat, corn, and hogs. Hoosier farmers raised more hogs than
                    those of any other state and were second in the production of wheat. Only four loyal states had a

                    legislative approval and cooperation, Morton called a special session of the general assembly which
                    met on April 24.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>The new governor undertook the great task of guiding the state through the war years. He addressed
                    the special session of the legislature with an appeal that politics be forgotten and that all act as
                    patriots. The members of the assembly responded quickly and vigorously, divided legislative offices
                    between the two parties, authorized an issue of $2,000,000 in state bonds for the defense
                    of the state and nation, and appropriated $1,600,000 for military purposes.</p>

            <p>Since the markets for many products of southern Indiana had been in the southern states and trade
                    continued after Sumter, the legislature appointed committees to investigate the possibility that aid
                    was being given to the Confederacy by the continuation of trade. Acts were adopted defining treason,
                    prohibiting correspondence and trade with the Confederacy, and providing penalties for violation of
                    these measures. The federal government also intervened to prevent commerce with the enemy.
                    Interference with the normal economic activity of this part of the state resulted in hardships for
                    the people.</p>
            <p>The governor was authorized on May 6, 1861, to organize six additional regiments from the volunteers.
                    They were formed into a brigade under Brigadier General Joseph J. Reynolds, a graduate of West Point
                    who had several years of military experience. The regiments were soon in federal service. To
                    safeguard the immediate defense of the state, a militia was provided under the title
                    "Indiana Legion." Its organization was confined largely to the southern counties,
                    and inevitably much of the burden of local defense fell upon the citizens of this part of the state.</p>
            <p>A debate over the purpose of the nation in waging war also revealed elements of disunity. Both houses
                    of the general assembly adopted resolutions which declared that the men and resources of the state
                    should not be employed to destroy slavery or the constitutional rights of the states. Some of the
                    legislators wanted to add pledges stating that the preservation of the Union was the sole aim of the
                    war, but radicals asserted that only the abolition of slavery would bring permanent peace.</p>
            <p>The first engagement of large forces—the First Battle of Bull Run, or
                    Manassas—took place on July 21, 1861, a few miles southwest of <placeName>

            <p>After this battle federal officials, particularly Secretary of War Simon Cameron, were willing to
                    receive troops more readily. Governor Morton, who had been criticizing the unwillingness of the War
                    Department to call for more soldiers, rushed forward the organization of additional regiments. By
                    the end of the year, 61,341 volunteers had enlisted, a number considerably in excess of
                    Indiana's quota of 38,832.</p>

                    other supplies; consequently, they paid high prices and increased the profits of contractors and
                    speculators. The lack of system in purchasing also led to inadequate and inferior supplies.
                    Irregularities brought the state's quartermaster and commissary departments under fire. A
                    legislative investigation revealed adulterated coffee, unsatisfactory clothing, and, from the
                    commissary general's own pork house, inferior meat. The latter official resigned after the
                    Indiana House of Representatives requested his removal for malfeasance and incompetency. Bookkeeping
                    in both departments was chaotic.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>Governor Morton established a state arsenal that produced large quantities of munitions from 1861 to
                    1864 without scandal. Robert Dale Owen, one of Indiana's most able reformers, on May 30,
                    1861, became the agent of the state to purchase arms, a position he filled with honor and
                    distinction. His salary and expenses, which he determined for himself, amounted to $3,452
                    for almost two years of service.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year 1862 proved to be a most critical year. Significant military campaigns and battles were
                    fought both in the eastern and western theaters, Indiana Republicans were defeated in the fall
                    elections, and the slavery issue was injected into the war aims. The Emancipation Proclamation
                    produced repercussions among those who wished to bring the war to an early end with the sole issue
                    the preservation of the Union.</p>
            <p>In the East, General McClellan, who had been appointed general-in-chief, led the Army of the Potomac
                    in the Peninsular Campaign. After bloody and costly engagements, including the Battle of Seven Pines
                    on May 31, the Seven Days' Battle, of June 26 to July 1, and instances of

                    Carlos Buell, arrived in time to participate in the last few minutes of the fighting. Their
                    appearance also signified that other regiments were not far away. General Lew Wallace, who had been
                    summoned about noon, had taken the wrong road and did not reach the field of battle until late in
                    the afternoon, but with him came three brigades of troops with other Indiana regiments among them.
                    As night fell on this Sunday, April 6, Grant knew that he had met the full force of the Confederate
                    attack, that Wallace's army was on the field of battle, and that Buell's army was
                    being ferried over the river to him. During the next day the trend of battle was reversed, and

                    known as the "soldiers' friend."</p>
            <p>A rancorous partisan conflict without precedent in Indiana also took place in 1862. The Democratic

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on January 8 in the midst of discouraging circumstances. Divided among themselves in
                    respect to support of the war, their attitude towards slavery, and the methods of preserving the
                    Union, Democrats were associated in the minds of many people with the rebellion of the South. Thomas
                    A. Hendricks, president of the convention, promised support of the war for the preservation of the
                    Union, but warned against abolitionists and complained about economic changes which the war
                    stimulated and which worked to the advantage of the East. The platform promised support of a war for
                    the "integrity of the Union under the Constitution" but opposed emancipation of
                    the Negroes or the subjugation of the southern states.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> The platform was
                    unrealistic in demanding the preservation of the Union as it had been before the war.</p>
            <p>The Union party, a coalition of Republicans and War Democrats, met in convention on June 18,
                    anticipating an easy victory. Governor Morton as president of the convention again urged the
                    abandonment of party for the duration of the war. He also spoke of treasonable societies in the
                    state and of the possibility that strong measures against them might be necessary. Another speaker
                    likened the Democratic convention to the <placeName>

                    had destroyed its own usefulness. The nominations for offices were divided between the War Democrats
                    and the Republicans. The platform declared in favor of vigorous prosecution of the war, which should
                    be waged for the preservation of the Union and not for the abolition of slavery.</p>
            <p>Developments that occurred between the meeting of the Union party convention and the election caused

                    private corporation, and especially the raising of tariff duties to aid
                    manufacturers—seemed to be a return to Hamiltonian policies. Arbitrary arrests,
                    interference by the military in civilian affairs, violation of freedom of speech and the press, and
                    the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus for all persons charged with disloyal practices caused
                    the people to fear that their constitutional liberties were in danger. The failure of the military
                    to win the war was very disappointing. Hoosiers had expected the opening of the
                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>, but they were not prepared for the failure of
                    McClellan's Peninsular Campaign, the call for more volunteers which followed, and the
                    disaster at the Second Battle of Bull Run.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the causes of dissatisfaction in the state was the conscription of soldiers. Volunteers had
                    enlisted in 1861, but in December the War Department, fearing that it could not equip and use so
                    many soldiers, ordered governors to cease raising troops. When resumed in 1862 recruiting became
                    increasingly difficult. In June urgent appeals were sent to the governors for more regiments, and
                    early in July Lincoln issued a call for three hundred thousand additional soldiers. Fervent appeals,
                    promises of money for the support of soldiers' families, and bounties for volunteers
                    brought only languid recruiting. On July 17, 1862, Congress passed an act authorizing the states to
                    resort to conscription if necessary to meet their quotas. In each county a commissioner was
                    appointed, who in turn named a deputy in each precinct. The latter was to make a list of all
                    resident male citizens between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. The commissioners and deputies
                    then passed on all pleas for exemption and sent the final lists to the general commissioner in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The general commissioner determined whether each township had met its quota and then
                    ordered those that had not to draw names from the list and send the draftees to the capital.

            <p>In conformity with this measure, on August 4, Lincoln requested another 300,000 men. Because of

                    state officials and was applied only to those townships which had not furnished the number of
                    volunteers required of them. A total of 3,003 men were conscripted. Dissatisfied persons destroyed a

                    suggested that Congress pass a measure for compensated emancipation in the border states. Congress

                    </placeName> and excluded slavery from the territories. After the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, September 22, 1862, which
                    declared that slaves would be free in all states resisting the Union on January 1, 1863. Since the
                    proclamation applied only to the people of the Confederacy—who would not obey the
                    order—it was in reality only an announcement of policy and may not have freed a slave.
                    Although very pleasing to the Radicals and to English liberals who helped prevent English
                    interference in the American war, to many in Indiana the proclamation meant that the war had become
                    a means of ending slavery as well as a struggle to preserve the Union. To numerous citizens who had

                    disloyalty and treason and to a stimulation of emotions by means of horror stories which told of
                    cruelty on the part of Confederates. The report of a federal grand jury on a secret political
                    society was circulated as a campaign document. Republicans cultivated the impression that only Union
                    party members were loyal and that only their candidates could safely be entrusted with official
                    positions.</p>
            <p>The grand jury report just mentioned exposed the existence and activities of the Knights of the

                    the efforts of the Union party to win the state election of 1862 that the grains of truth cannot now
                    be separated from the chaff. The charges were often so extreme as to discredit themselves. Many of
                    the people undoubtedly believed that the order was an organization of traitors, and, perhaps, some
                    of the members were. Other observers asserted that such allegations were not only false but were
                    made for the purpose of winning the election. The existence of the society has been questioned, but
                    the persons said to be its leaders were critical and unfriendly towards many of the methods which

            <p>On October 14 the voters gave the Democratic candidates their preference by approximately nine
                    thousand votes. The new state legislature contained Democratic majorities in both houses, but
                    control of the senate was very narrowly held. The lesser state officials and seven of eleven
                    congressmen were Democrats. This result was, according to the victors, an expression of
                    dissatisfaction with Republican policies and with the failure of the administration to win the war.
                    The absence of many voters in the armies, said the Republicans, determined the election since there
                    was no provision for absentee ballots. Some truth may be found in each statement, but adequate
                    evidence does not exist to estimate the division of the soldiers between the two parties. The
                    soldier vote was assumed by the Republicans to be in their favor, but there is some evidence to the
                        contrary.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>Discouragement with the slow progress of the war and the bitterness of the previous political
                    campaign led to the collapse of constitutional government in Indiana in 1863. This development was
                    perhaps different only in degree from what took place in other states, for despondency, gloom,
                    declining morale, and even desertions were general. Professor Wood Gray has called the months from

                    began to consider several partisan measures to lessen the authority of the governor, for Morton had
                    conducted himself in a very forceful manner and many of the opposition hated him intensely. The
                    Democrats proposed to create an executive council composed of the other state administrative
                    officials, to limit the governor's power, to reorganize the state board of benevolent
                    institutions, and to modify the militia system by dividing the governor's authority with
                    other executive officers. Like most politicians recently come to power, they proposed to redistrict
                    the state in a manner favorable to themselves.</p>
            <p>Republican members of the legislature raised the cry of treason, and when Democratic members showed

            <p>Democratic representatives expected that their control over the appropriation bill would force the
                    Republicans to return before the session ended. Morton, however, chose to regard the Democratic
                    bills as proof of a treasonable conspiracy to take Indiana out of the Union; he therefore refused to
                    reassemble the legislature. The national War Department, nineteen counties, and various private
                    persons furnished the governor almost a half million dollars with which he financed the government
                    without the legislature and the appropriation bill. The most serious problem was the necessity of
                    paying interest due on the state debt. Winslow, Lanier, and Company, however, furnished
                    approximately $629,432.85 to meet the payments. In this manner the Republican governor
                    was able to evade the results of the election of 1862.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    opportunities to join in profiteering on war contracts. Gambling, heavy drinking, and various forms
                    of vice seemed to be increasing. Soldiers and other men lawlessly ignored the rights of property
                    holders and citizens. The organization of the northern states into military districts and the
                    assumption of governmental control by army officers approached the imposition of military rule over
                    a civilian people. Fanaticism, bitter sectionalism, and war hysteria rose to deny the rights of the
                    people to think for themselves and criticize what they regarded as unwise state and national actions
                    and policies. Inflation and the absence of wage earners who were in the army brought hardships to
                    families of the poor, while death or permanent disability of wage earners often made their
                    families' situation desperate. As bitter partisanship brought the collapse of
                    constitutional government, uncontrolled emotionalism threatened the loss of civil freedom.</p>
            <p>What of the enlisted man? How did he fare? The soldier was a fighting man, but he spent little of his
                    time in battle. He was constantly engaged in adjusting himself to a new scheme of life made
                    necessary by the existence of war, but which was a compromise between the civilian life he had known
                    and the exigencies of military activities. He learned quickly to sleep in the open or to find some
                    kind of shelter along the line of march. As soon as his regiment became stationary he constructed
                    some type of shanty out of whatever materials were at hand. When the Fourteenth Indiana Regiment was
                    guarding the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Railroad, a number of men found themselves without shelter in the midst of a rainy
                    night. They stood around the campfires until morning, a night they would long remember. A month
                    later at another camp, "a large pile of pine lumber, two stacks of hay, and a huge rick of
                    straw vanished in a jiffy." One can imagine that the men did not stand out in the rain that
                    night. The troops' usual equipment included tents and stoves—"better
                    quarters no soldier would ask for." Too frequently, however, orders came to march as soon
                    as comfortable quarters had been established.</p>

                    'dens' has been dubbed Provision Street for the reason that it runs smack into the
                    Commissary's Department." "Corporal Wm. H. Jackson's

                    many huts principally of stone and on the Esquimaux style, have been erected in the encampment

                    ingenuity.…" "Denny, Patterson, and I have our bed filled with a
                    plentiful supply of fresh `feathers,' (the tips of young pine and cedar tree branches) and
                    sleep as warm and comfortable thereon as though ensconced (Dutch fashion) between two feather
                    beds."</p>
            <p>The campfire was a necessary concomitant of military life. Around it some cooking was done, clothes
                    dried, and benumbed bodies warmed. It was the center of social life where stories were swapped and
                    rumors made their rounds. "Up to 9 o'clock camp fires burned brightly; around them
                    groups of soldiers gathered singing, laughing, `speculating' on the coming fight. There was
                    a constant jingle, jingle of iron ram-rods, snapping of caps, and sputtering of hot grease in sundry
                    frying pans.… "<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The soldier often experienced the necessity of finding his own food or going hungry. The commissary
                    department generally kept up with the regiments and furnished the men with such edibles as could be
                    procured but sometimes fell behind. Food tended to be very monotonous and tiresome. "We
                    have nothing to complain of just now but our grub which is of the most miserable quality. Should
                    like to see a whole brigade of commissaries hung." Furthermore, on raids and forced marches
                    the men carried with them rations which could not offer much variety. Consequently the soldier
                    learned to forage for himself, as well as to build shelters. One of the men of the Fourteenth

                    vegetables and fresh fruit was a serious failure of the commissary. Soldiers complained that they
                    were fed on "side meat and crackers till we are tired of it—no vegetables or

            <p>Amusement was not entirely lacking, although no officially appointed agents were authorized to

                    Other refreshments and amusements were obtained from time to time in taverns and saloons. Once in a

                    Fourteenth Indiana was "quartered in the fine brick buildings on Caroline Street in the

                    quartered near a large city the soldier or perhaps his company received a leave and spent some time

                    the immediate vicinity.</p>
            <p>Two happy occasions in camp were the days when mail and the paymaster arrived. The men were starved

                    postmaster was even more welcome than the paymaster, although the latter was also received with a
                    joyous shout. Money in the pocket could always be spent at the sutler's or in a neighboring
                    village, and the need for various items and liquid refreshments always seemed to be urgent. The
                    sutler, because of his high prices, was an unpopular individual.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>Life in the army was, however, a serious business. Gradually poor health, accidents, wounds,
                    fatalities, and desertions reduced the company's strength. From time to time recruits were
                    brought in as replacements, but many of these additions disappeared in time. A company that
                    participated in the full four years of fighting would be reduced to half strength or even less and
                    then be merged with other units.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> The soldier who saw his fellows killed or
                    disabled by wounds or disease tended to become hard and fatalistic. He developed into a skilled and
                    experienced fighter, but he was likely to feel that his continued existence was largely a matter of
                    chance. He was unhappy about being away from home, family, and friends. He became emotionally
                    wrought up about the war, why it was being fought, why it was not being won more rapidly, and about
                    supposedly disloyal persons back home. A large backlog of dissatisfaction, prejudice, and hate were
                    stored up, which many a soldier would carry with him to the grave. The last two generations of
                    historians have pointed feelingly to the wrongs suffered by the South after the war, and yet little
                    effort has been made to understand why northerners who were absent from their homes fighting to
                    preserve their country behaved as they did after 1865. Some of the reasons may be found in the
                    months and years they spent in camps, prisons, battles, and hospitals. Many of these men could not
                    return to the ways of thinking and living which they had known before 1861.</p>

                    Confederate General John C. Pemberton, who was ordered to hold Vicksburg at all costs, permitted
                    himself to be confined and besieged in the town. On July 4, 1863, after the exhaustion of his food
                    supplies, he surrendered an army of some thirty thousand men and extensive quantities of artillery

            <p>The revival of faith in the administration was timely, for conditions in Indiana were critical.
                    Political animosity continued at the boiling point, many persons protested the new draft, and the
                    vigorous Confederate John H. Morgan and his cavalry invaded the state.</p>
            <p>The most serious crisis came in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on May 20, 1863, when the Democrats held a mass state convention. The state was then
                    being governed by Morton without the legislature because Republicans had bolted the session and left
                    the capital, and the Democrats had failed to pass the appropriation bill. General Burnside, of the
                    Department of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, issued an order against "express or implied" treason. Arbitrary
                    arrests which he ordered caused Morton to protest. "The General had little faith in the
                    loyalty of Indiana, and it was only Morton's protest that prevented the establishment of
                    martial law in his state."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> In April, General Milo S. Hascal, of the
                    District of Indiana, ordered that newspapers or speakers who endeavored "to bring the war
                    policy of the government into disrepute" should be treated as violators of
                    Burnside's order. The editor of the <placeName>

                    and were placed under $5,000 bond not to violate the order again. Other papers were
                    warned to obey or cease publication.</p>
            <p>The violation of freedom of the press by military officers seemed to Democrats to be characteristic
                    of the general policy of the Governor and his party. Identification by the Republicans of criticism
                    with disloyalty and Morton's insistence that he had saved Indiana for the Union were
                    regarded by the Democrats as brazen distortions of the truth. In April and May the imposition of
                    military government, arbitrary arrests, and interference with freedom of the press angered the
                    critics of Morton almost beyond endurance.</p>
            <p>The Governor thought his actions were necessary to put down treason. Undoubtedly disloyalty existed,

                    convention, but officers ordered them away before violence occurred. As people started home on the
                    railroads, they were searched for weapons. A train was stopped near Pogue's Run, into which
                    a number of passengers threw their revolvers. The incident was thereafter called the
                    "Battle of Pogue's Run." That serious trouble did not occur, however, was
                    due in part to the forbearance of the Democrats.</p>
            <p>Congress passed on March 3, 1863, a second conscription act which provided for an enrollment of
                    eligible men by federal officials. It contained three objectionable features. First, <list type="footnotes">

                    $300 to be exempted or could hire substitutes. This provision rather obviously favored
                    rich men's sons. Second, conscription was to be used only in counties which had not met
                    their quotas of volunteers. Richer counties paid bounties to induce men to enlist. Nearby poorer
                    counties could not compete and consequently had to resort to the draft to fill their quotas. The
                    practice of paying bounties also led unscrupulous men to make a business of volunteering and
                    deserting in order to collect additional bounties. Third, enforcement and administration of the act
                    by federal officials was not popular in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Disorders occurred in connection with the draft, but an adequate critical study of the irregularities
                    has not been made. Considerable opposition to enrollment was met in 1863. Two officials were said to

                    leading Democrats for obedience to the law until it could be tested in the courts soon restored
                    order. As usual, the irregularities were attributed to the Knights of the Golden Circle.</p>
            <p>In the spring and summer of 1863, this organization was replaced or absorbed by the Order of the
                    American Knights, which a year later became the Sons of Liberty. The nature of the organization
                    seems to have changed less than the name. Each order had a military division which was not revealed
                    to the general membership. To the large number of adherents it seemed to be a harmless Democratic
                    club through which they could protest arbitrary actions by the government and try to protect their
                    civil rights.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                    the small bodies of militia that opposed him. Governor Morton called on the men of the southern half
                    of Indiana to organize, arm, and take the field. In the northern part of the state, citizens were
                    asked to organize military companies and hold themselves ready for action. In two days, twenty

                    $500,000, but in return he left a host of stories—many humorous, others

            <p>General William T. Sherman was sent with many more troops from Vicksburg, and Grant was given

                    on Missionary Ridge. Hooker's men scaled Lookout Mountain and planted the flag on its

                    engagements.</p>
            <p>Though it won important battles, the military was not able to end the war in 1864, but it did go a
                    long way toward achieving that goal. In the west the task of destroying the Confederate army and
                    invading the lower South was accomplished; only in the east did large operations continue. Grant was
                    promoted on March 9, awarded the title of lieutenant general, and, under Lincoln, given supreme
                    authority over all federal forces. Taking the eastern command for himself, Grant brought about
                    concerted action in the two theaters of the war. William T. Sherman was placed in command at <placeName>

                    retreat. Sherman, with an army twice the size of General Joseph E. Johnston's, was more
                    cautious than Grant and sometimes sought to make the flanking movement accomplish his aims without
                    the frontal attack. Johnston, who knew the importance of preserving his army, retreated by stages

                    </placeName>, but Hood refused to be surrounded and on September 3 marched to the west to attack his
                    opponent's supply line. Sherman sent Thomas to oppose Hood and began his own preparations

            <p>Meanwhile Grant moved against Lee. Their first encounter was the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5 to
                    7, in which both lost heavily in an indecisive conflict. When Grant began a flanking movement,
                    however, Lee retreated. The second engagement was a five-day battle at Spottsylvania, May 8 to 12,
                    in which Grant lost many men. He then moved southeastward around his opponent's right but
                    was met by Lee at North Anna. This time the national commander did not make a direct attack but
                    moved to his own left towards <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. From May 5 to 21 his losses totaled thirty-four thousand. At Cold Harbor, June 1 to 3,
                    Grant lost another eight thousand men before advancing to the south. His next attack was on
                    Petersburg, where loses continued to be heavy. Finally he settled down to the siege of Petersburg
                    and <placeName>

            <p>The political front in Indiana was more discouraging than the military situation. The failure of the
                    armed forces to secure a decisive victory and the heavy losses in men were very depressing. Many
                    became convinced that the war could not be won. The calls for additional soldiers and use of
                    conscription impressed the seriousness of the situation upon family after family. To make the
                    political conflict worse, a dangerous split developed among the Republicans when the Radicals spoke
                    against Lincoln's reconstruction policy. How to keep them in the party without making
                    concessions that would alienate the remaining War Democrats was a serious <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-057-3-036"/> problem. Much opposition to the renomination of Lincoln appeared on the
                    ground that his administration had failed to prosecute the war effectively.</p>

                    instructing the delegates to the national Republican convention to support Lincoln for another term.
                    The resolutions were adopted with a shout of approval. The Governor addressed the convention,
                    defended his administration, ignored economic issues, and demanded that the state make "no
                    compromise with traitors." The Indiana delegates to the national convention voted for the

                    although the military situation had strengthened the hands of the peace advocates. Joseph E.
                    McDonald, who was nominated for governor and headed a ticket of conservative candidates for the
                    state offices, promised to uphold the state and national constitutions, to support the war, to
                    preserve the Union, and to make peace if the Union could thus be restored according to the
                    Constitution. The platform denounced Morton's usurpation of power, the violations of civil
                    liberty, and the waste of the national administration. In the Democratic national convention, the
                    Indiana delegates supported General McClellan. When he practically repudiated the peace plank of the
                    national platform, which declared the war a failure and demanded a cessation of hostilities in order
                    to restore the Union by peaceful means, he was supported by all except radicals. The peace men
                    obtained very little satisfaction from either the state or national party.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

                    greater activity.</p>
            <p>On July 1, while Grant was besieging Petersburg, Lee sent General Jubal A. Early with seventeen
                    thousand men to drive federal forces from the <geogName>Shenandoah Valley</geogName> and to threaten
                    the national capital, as Lee had done in 1862 and 1863. In eleven days Early was in the outskirts of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and might have taken the city had he not delayed his attack overnight. Reinforcements
                    from Grant arrived in time. Not until the latter half of September did General Philip H. Sheridan
                    drive Early from the Valley and then proceed to its devastation. In the meantime the near success of
                    the Confederates pointed up the apparent hopelessness of the war.</p>

                    </placeName>, on July 18, 1864, Lincoln called for 500,000 additional soldiers, of which
                    Indiana's share was 35,732. This call was very disappointing to Morton, who had tried to
                    arrange matters so that neither a call for more troops nor a draft should come during the political
                    campaign. But to meet such a large quota when enthusiasm was low would likely necessitate
                    conscription. Every possible effort was made to meet the call with volunteers, but 12,474 men had to
                    be drafted. Of this number, substitutes were sent by 4,466; conscientious objectors who were
                    released numbered 623; 97 deserted before reaching the army, which left 7,288 who joined the forces
                    as drafted men.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much of the disorder that greeted conscription was attributed to the Sons of Liberty, an organization
                    which took the place of the earlier Order of American Knights and the Knights of the Golden Circle.
                    Today only estimates of the strength of these associations can be made, for most of the records have
                    disappeared.</p>
            <p>After the draft had aroused Morton's fear that a call for troops would be fatal to the
                    Republicans' hope of winning the election, he turned to the Sons of Liberty. In the top
                    hierarchy of this organization was a spy, Felix G. Stidger, whose report was helpful to the governor
                    in arranging another expose. On July 30, 1864, in the <placeName>

                    Republican papers represented the Sons of Liberty as an integral part of the Democratic party.</p>
            <p>While the agitation was continuing, a foolish scheme of Harrison H. Dodd, state commander of the Sons
                    of Liberty, and a few of his associates was revealed. They planned to free the rebel prisoners at
                    Camp Morton, seize the arsenal, and start a general uprising in order to form a northwestern
                    confederacy or join the South or at least to weaken the Union. When a few Democratic leaders heard
                    of the conspiracy, they induced Dodd to abandon his project, and August 16, the date set for the
                    insurrection, passed without incident. Morton had been informed of the plans on August 3 by Stidger,
                    but he did little about them except to alert and strengthen the militia. On August 20, when he
                    learned of a shipment of arms to Dodd's place of business, the establishment was raided. A
                    membership list of the Sons of Liberty, which included the names of several Democratic candidates
                    for state offices, four hundred revolvers, and ammunition were seized. Sensational use was made of
                    this information by political speakers and the partisan press. Little or no distinction was made
                    between Dodd and his helpers and the Democratic party.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Governor had not finished with the leaders of the Sons of Liberty. Early in September Dodd
                    was arrested and brought before a military court. Within the next thirty days or so, five other
                    leaders were arrested. The strength of the conspiracy or its exact nature were not made clear by the
                    testimony, much of which was given by unreliable persons. A few days before the state election, Dodd
                    managed to escape. His flight was interpreted as a confession that the charges were true.</p>
            <p>The trials of the other defendants were started shortly before the national election. One of the five
                    men turned state's evidence and was released, four were declared guilty, and three of the
                    latter were sentenced to be hanged. Punishment was delayed while an appeal was made to the federal
                    courts. On April 3, 1866, the Supreme Court in <hi rend="i">Ex parte Milligan</hi>

                    where civil courts were functioning was illegal. The prisoners were released and were not tried in a
                    civil court. The decision of the Supreme Court has become one of the great bulwarks of American
                    freedom, but the trials were also of great advantage to Union party candidates in the state and

                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Sheridan's destructive march through the <geogName>Shenandoah
                    Valley</geogName> gave renewed hope to the North, Morton was still greatly worried about the outcome
                    of the elections. He tried repeatedly to delay the draft until after the people had voted. He
                    insisted that Indiana soldiers be given a furlough so they could reach home in time to vote. He
                    obtained the return of seventy-five hundred of the hundred-day volunteers and about nine thousand
                    wounded veterans, as well as delaying the departure of new recruits for the front.</p>
            <p>Morton seems to have been unnecessarily cautious, for on October 11 voters gave the ticket a
                    substantial majority of twenty thousand votes. The new legislature contained a majority of Union men
                    in both houses, and the congressional delegation was divided eight to three in favor of the Union
                    party. A month later Lincoln carried the state by a similar majority.</p>
            <p>After the elections, the military situation improved. On November 15, Sherman, having burned the
                    machine shops, left <placeName>

                    reached Goldsborough a week later, where he was 160 miles south of Grant. Here he was joined by
                    Schofield, who had come from <placeName>

            <p>Grant, however, had seized the Petersburg and Lynchburg railroad and forced Lee to extend his lines
                    to the west. On April 1, he ordered Sheridan to attack Lee's right. As soon as Sheridan had
                    met some success, Grant ordered a general assault and began an envelopment of the Confederate army.

                    hour or two to rest. On April 9, Grant had troops in front of Lee, and the surrender of Lee followed

                    yielded to Sherman on the same terms as Lee had surrendered to Grant. Lincoln was assassinated on on

            <p>Indiana had furnished 208,367 men, of which 11,718 were re-enlistments. If the average family
                    contained four persons, more than half of the families furnished one of its members to the armed
                    forces. Almost 12 per cent of the soldiers, 24,416, were killed or died during the war. A few over 5
                    per cent, or 10,846, deserted from the service. Although the deserters were a blot on the state, the
                    military record of Indiana soldiers was otherwise very creditable.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

            <p>One of the near-casualties of the Civil War years in Indiana was the Democratic party, which had
                    enjoyed an almost uninterrupted series of victories before 1860. Although badly beaten by Governor
                    Morton and associated in the minds of many people with treason, the Democracy staged an early
                    revival in the election of Thomas A. Hendricks to the governorship in 1872. Possibly the Jacksonian
                    wing, which might have furnished liberal leadership, was even less popular than the party. But
                    Jacksonian principles became more popular in the person of "Blue Jeans" James D.
                    Williams, who was elected to succeed Hendricks. The lack of progressive leadership was also revealed
                    in the weakness in Indiana of the Granger movement, which laid the foundations for the state
                    regulation of railroads and utilities in four upper <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> states,
                    but did not produce such results in Indiana. Little progressive legislation, aside from that
                    regarding education, was passed until near the end of the century. How much of this conservatism was
                    due to Morton's war on the Democracy and changes which occurred during the war can only be
                    estimated.</p>
            <p>Economic changes of the war period also tended to diminish the influence of the old Democratic areas.

                    counties. The southern area in 1860 contained 45 per cent of the total population of the state, but
                    five years after the close of the war the percentage had declined to 39 per cent.</p>
            <p>On the positive side, the prosperity that accompanied the war and the rise of the new industrial
                    order paved the way for the acceptance of the changes. During the war the Republican administration
                    had enacted the National Banking Act of February 25, 1863, and repeatedly raised the tariff. Aided
                    by war contracts, the tariff, and railroad transportation, a new economy in which manufacturing
                    assumed an increasingly important role began to achieve significance. The new national banks, some
                    of which replaced former state banks, also became a part of the new order. Railroads enlarged the
                    markets that were available for Indiana farmers, while the feeding of the soldiers required vast
                    quantities of supplies from western states. High prices raised considerably the standard of living
                    in rural areas and small towns, where many new houses were built. These homes were in part made
                    possible by the prices received from raising wheat. Whatever remained of frontier self-sufficiency
                    disappeared along navigable streams and railroads. A less frugal way of life developed. Labor, too,
                    gained, for recruitment of men for the armies produced a shortage of manpower. Towns and cities grew
                    more rapidly.</p>

                    illustrates the forces which were at work. Property values increased so rapidly as to astonish the
                    people of that time. Although business buildings and many houses were constructed, housing seemed
                    difficult for newcomers to find. By the end of 1862 a vast inflation had occurred. Prices were
                    higher than the elder citizens could remember, but they were to rise still more. Coins passed out of
                    circulation; "shin plasters" and greenbacks became current money.</p>

                    street-car… `with cushioned seats affording ample room for sixteen
                    passengers'" began to serve the public in August. Kingan &amp; Company,

                    manufacturing, and sectional fears and animosities had effected a breach in the mental and spiritual
                    life of the nation that could not be healed quickly. The Union had been preserved, but at a terrible

            <p>In general, peace prevailed between Indians and settlers of the Old Northwest from the Battle of
                    Fallen Timbers, 1794, until the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. Nevertheless, both whites and Indians suffered occasional loss of life and some theft
                    or destruction of property during this period. Between 1803 and 1809 Governor Harrison and his
                    associates obtained several cessions of land from the tribesmen. These cessions, principally located
                    in southern Indiana and in southern and central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, amounted to an area roughly equal to that of the present state of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Such loss of territory was alone sufficient cause for Indian alarm and resistance. The Indians had
                    continued to be debauched by the white man's liquor and diseases. They were also the
                    victims of a double standard by which Indians received scant justice from whites, while the latter
                    at times trespassed on Indian territory or committed crimes against red men with impunity. In
                    commenting upon the situation, Professor John D. Barnhart has concluded: "Ample cause for
                    war had been given the Indians by the people of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, Governor Harrison, and apparently a majority of the settlers of Indiana Territory
                    as well, believed that the Indians had given just provocation for a military campaign against them.
                    Indiana Territory had a population of nearly twenty-five thousand in 1810, which showed promise of
                    rapid increase in the years immediately ahead. Much the greater portion of central Indiana and
                    virtually all of northern Indiana, however, yet belonged to the Indians.</p>
            <p>Harrison and other political leaders considered it essential that the area occupied by the Indians be
                    contracted so that Indiana could soon develop into a new member of the Union. Moreover, there were
                    continued complaints of Indian depredations against whites and frequent charges that the British
                    were supporting and instigating the Indians. As friction and hostility grew, insecurity increased
                    among the settlers.</p>

                                                spelling has been retained and original punctuation followed as closely
                                                as possible. It is, however, very difficult to distinguish between
                                                Larrabee's commas and the diagonal marks he often used instead
                                                of a period. In these doubtful cases whichever mark that is proper
                                                grammatically has been used. Doubtful capital letters were interpreted
                                                according to the judgment of the eye. All superior letters have been
                                                brought down to the line except for those used to form old style

                                                modifications of spacing within the letters were necessary in making
                                                handwritten documents conform to the printed page.</p>

            <p>The political novelists of the Progressive era were often drawn together in common struggles,
                    regardless of party affiliation. Two such novelists who were engaged in the exciting battles of the
                    early years of the twentieth century were the best-selling author, Winston Churchill, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName>, a Republican, and Meredith Nicholson, of Indiana, a Democrat.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1910, Churchill had come to Indiana at the urgent suggestion of Senator Albert J.
                    Beveridge to help the Senator in his quest for re-election in that state.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Nicholson, who heard of the author's efforts on Beveridge's behalf, sought to
                    contact his fellow novelist. The following letter is apparently the first of three that Nicholson
                    wrote Churchill and reflects his interest in the latter's literary and political work.</p>

                        the Meaning of Its History.</hi> By Edmundo O'Gorman. (<placeName>

                    </placeName>: Indiana University Press, 1961. Pp. 177. Maps, notes, index. $5.00.)</head>
            <p>This book, the first of Professor O'Gorman's works to be published in English,
                    represents the author's current reflections and opinions upon a theme which, in its various
                    ramifications, has occupied much of his thinking and all of his writing since 1940. The essence of
                    this theme is that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> cannot properly be said to have "discovered" America and that the
                    widely held view to that effect is not only logically absurd but represents an erroneous approach to
                    the very nature of historical phenomena.</p>
            <p>Discovery, according to O'Gorman's definition, implies conscious intent upon the
                    part of at least one of the following: the discoverer himself, some divine agency or destiny, or the
                    thing discovered. He shows that historically all three of these approaches have been used in turn to
                    justify the thesis that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> discovered America. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>' own son, Ferdinand, deliberately falsified the evidence in order to persuade
                    his readers that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> sailed in 1492 with the conscious purpose of discovering a new continent; reaching
                    Asia, according to Ferdinand, was a distinctly secondary objective. Bartolom$eA de Las
                    Casas adopted the second approach by maintaining that, although <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> himself was quite unaware of his role as the destined discoverer of a new world, he was
                    nonetheless the chosen instrument of God, whose conscious purpose was to bring the true doctrine of
                    Christianity to the inhabitants of this hitherto isolated and benighted part of the globe.</p>
            <p>Modern historians, of course, on the one hand have long recognized the deliberate falsehoods of
                    Ferdinand <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They know that Christopher <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> had no other intention than to reach the east coast of Asia and that to the end of his
                    life, despite disturbing evidence to the contrary, he clung to the belief that he actually <hi rend="i">had</hi> reached Asia. On the other hand, modern historians by and large do not indorse
                    the supernatural or providential view of history but limit themselves to the consideration of human
                    purposes and motives. Yet modern historians, including the eminent Professor Samuel Eliot Morison,
                    speak blithely of the "discovery" of America by Christopher <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> in October, 1492.</p>
            <p>If discovery implies conscious purpose, where did that conscious purpose lie? Not in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>— not in the mind of God— then of necessity in the object
                    discovered, in America itself. Professor O'Gorman quotes the following telltale passage
                    from Morison's <hi rend="i">Admiral of the Ocean Sea:</hi> " `Never again may
                    mortal men hope to recapture the amazement, the wonder, the delight of those October days in 1492
                    when the New World gracefully yielded her virginity to the conquering Castilians.'
                    " O'Gorman goes on: "What does this metaphysical rape <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-057-3-074"/> imply save the idea that, fully constituted in its being, the American
                    continent had always been there patiently waiting throughout the centuries to reveal itself to the
                    first man who, as in a fairy tale, would come to touch it?" (p. 44). Such an attitude, the
                    author concludes, is based upon an ontological view of historical phenomena as fixed and
                    unchangeable quantities, a view which is discredited by modern science and is logically absurd.</p>
            <p>Having discredited the idea of the discovery of America, O'Gorman proposes to substitute the
                    concept that America was "invented" gradually as accumulating evidence forced the
                    European community to revise its traditional idea of the nature of the world. He devotes the second
                    and third parts of the book to a historical reconstruction of this process which, although brief, is
                    impressive in its clarity and comprehensiveness. The last and least satisfactory section of the book
                    discusses the "meaning" of American history in its twofold development: Latin
                    America on the one hand, North America on the other.</p>
            <p>Many historians, impatient of philosophical analysis, will be inclined to dismiss this essay as an
                    unimportant quibbling over semantics. But those historians who appreciate the importance of sound
                    philosophical underpinnings to the building of historical edifices will find this book exciting and
                    rewarding.</p>

            <p>Edward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Robert Livingston were both significant figures in colonial politics in an era when <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> sought to centralize royal administration. In analyzing their roles, Michael G. Hall
                    and Lawrence H. Leder use the same approach of focusing on the activities of an individual to
                    illuminate the issues and politics of a formative period in American history. In comparing the
                    careers of the two men, one is immediately struck by the fact that whether he was a royal offical or
                    a provincial politician his abilities in achieving advancement and position counted far less than
                    personal contacts, family connections, and friendships. Without question, Livingston was the more
                    talented of the two as a manipulator of men, whereas <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> was severely handicapped by certain personal traits and lack of foresight and diplomacy
                    in implementing his policies.</p>
            <p>As a royal courier sent to enforce the Navigation Acts, as secretary and registrar of the Dominion of
                    New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and finally as surveyor <pb n="255" id="VAA4025-057-3-075"/> general, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a conscientious and loyal servant of the Crown, never wavering in his attempts to
                    extend the royal prerogative. The striking contradiction in the man is that he was among the most
                    experienced and informed of royal officials, yet he never appeared to learn from his errors.
                    Furthermore, his authoritarian and autocratic manner and his haughty arrogance antagonized and
                    infuriated the colonists and made him an exceedingly unpopular representative of the Crown. Though
                    he held various important offices during his twenty-five years of service, his career constantly
                    fluctuated between the extremes of loss of favor, imprisonment, failure and position, power, and
                    success. In the end he died friendless and in relative obscurity in America where he had sought to
                    carve a place for himself, but where he never belonged.</p>
            <p>The barrage of criticism directed against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s policies, personality, and inept ways has tended to belittle his
                    contributions and has emphasized his failures, imprisonment, attempts at personal aggrandizement,
                    and disputes with leading figures on both sides of the Atlantic. Thus to evaluate <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s role fairly is indeed a difficult task, but one which Hall has accomplished
                    with great objectivity. Because the emphasis of the book is on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s activities, however, the underlying principles behind his and <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s colonial policy are lost. This is one of the drawbacks in using the
                    biographical approach to study the politics of an age: the individual stands out, but the political
                    and imperial developments, as in this case, are not fully analyzed. Another example of the
                    disadvantages of the biographical approach is illustrated in the author's treatment of the
                    internal political situation in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> played such a dominant part. The book frequently refers to factions, vaguely defined as
                    the moderate and popular parties, but there is no description of their composition.</p>
            <p>While Edward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s career is that of a displaced Englishman and a man frequently frustrated in
                    his efforts to attain position and favor, Robert Livingston's life, in contrast, is a
                    remarkable success story of a transplanted Scotsman who came to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> in 1675 and achieved political and economic position and power. In his half-century
                    involvement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, he steadily rose from a minor official in the outpost community of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to secretary for Indian affairs, to member of the governor's council and
                    assembly, and finally to the post of speaker. His political achievements were matched by his
                    economic success as merchant and as lord of Livingston Manor. In presenting Livingston's
                    varied activities, the author offers a cross section of provincial politics and economic
                    developments in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> from 1675 to 1728. One of the most valuable contributions the author makes is his
                    analysis of the role Leislerian factionalism played in <placeName>

                    </placeName> politics long after the death of Leisler. Leder discusses the personal nature of
                    alliances and loyalties and the intricacies of colonial politics with its factionalism within
                    factions.</p>
            <p>This book, which received the first Annual Manuscript Award of the Institute of Early American
                    History and Culture, is an encyclopedia of information about Livingston's political
                    activities and financial dealings. Leder has carefully searched both published and unpublished
                    materials in America and <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and he presents an overabundance <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-057-3-076"/> of facts on
                    every transaction with which Livingston was remotely connected—almost to the exact pound.
                    The style as a result is awkward and cumbersome, and Livingston sounds more like a ledger with
                    debits and credits than the clever, able man he was.</p>

                    </placeName> Bassett in <hi rend="i">The Federalist System</hi> of the earlier <hi rend="i">American

                    diplomatic matters. Miller utilizes the many monographs which have appeared in the last
                    half-century, but he still asks most of the same questions which Bassett posed. The study emphasizes
                    the dominant themes of "Union and Liberty," stresses that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Jefferson were engaged in a struggle for power, and brings out the intense
                    partisan—if not party—spirit that existed from the beginning of the
                    government. The author is clearly sympathetic to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Hamiltonian view, and only in connection with his part in the election of 1800
                    does the New Yorker come in for even mild criticism. On the other hand, by choice of word and phrase
                    Miller creates an anti-Jefferson bias in his writing. Balance is lacking.</p>
            <p>Filler's study, somewhat neo-abolitionist in approach, is oriented to the Garrisonians and
                    disagrees sharply with the significance of the role assigned to Theodore Weld and his followers by
                    Gilbert Barnes and others. Filler does say that "it is difficult to assign precedence to
                    any of the protagonists of abolition. All had strategic moments of authority" (p. 280). But
                    it is also difficult to tell what the author means when he states, for example:
                    "Remarkably, though free soil, rather than antislavery, was at the base of popular unrest,
                    the western territories were too far away seriously to affect popular political attitudes.
                    Antislavery, not free soil, divided the country" (p. 200). In many places, there is an
                    insistence that <hi rend="i">abolitionists</hi> were not the important factor and that, even in
                    1840, northerners were not <hi rend="i">antislavery,</hi> but were with minor variations <hi rend="i">non-slavery.</hi> The reader has trouble following these
                    distinctions—important perhaps to the student of the philosophy of antislavery but not to
                    the ordinary citizen of the mid-nineteenth century—and is further hampered by the author
                    contradicting <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-057-3-077"/> himself. Knowledge of the free Negro, North and
                    South, as well as of antislavery sentiment in the South prior to 1830 appears rather limited. The
                    footnotes provide the finest known bibliography of the crusade against slavery, but numerous errors
                    were noted. The reviewer cannot refrain from stating that in the first citation of his own study of
                        <hi rend="i">Slavery in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> the state was given as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, while in the second the first name was incorrect.</p>
            <p>Nye interprets "cultural history to mean chiefly the development of key American ideas and
                    institutions" (p. xii), and within this framework he has produced a creditable survey of
                    the period. The first two chapters, "The Foundations of American Thought" and
                    "The Roots of an American Faith," are the best in the book. "The
                    Structure of a New Society" reveals a rather weak knowledge of the society of the South,
                    and there certainly were "fewer than 50,000" (p. 116) who owned 50 or more slaves
                    in 1850. A minimum of investigation would have revealed that there were fewer than 8,000! The author
                    finds that in just about every phase of cultural endeavor there was much groping and modifying, much
                    derivative and imitative activity, much grafting and adopting. In reaching this conclusion Nye
                    occasionally turns a felicitous sentence, such as: "The union of bench, pulpit, and
                    schoolroom made respectability conservative and conservatism respectable" (p. 110); but
                    unfortunately there are too many counterbalances of which "The overwhelming religious issue
                    of the period 1776 to 1830 was the contest for the West" (p. 229) is a fair example.</p>
            <p>Attention to details and to the niceties of editorial work seems to be decreasing with each volume in
                    this series. Each of these studies contains many errors in footnotes, bibliographies, and content
                    material. Numerous sentences, including some in the editors' introductions, have <hi rend="i">no</hi> meaning. Other things stated as fact can be classed only as absurdities; one
                    example from each of the volumes will be noted. John Adams left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> early on March 4, 1801, and was seen going through <placeName>

                    </placeName> later that same day (Miller, pp. 275–276) — the transportation
                    revolution came much earlier than has been heretofore realized! The echoes of Brook's
                    assault on Sumner were heard as far as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>

                    </placeName> to deal as he did with his Potawatomi foes (Filler, p. 245). This <hi rend="i">post hoc
                        propter hoc</hi> "logic" falls apart very quickly when it is realized that the
                    first incident occurred on May 22 and the second on May 25, 1856. The date of the first is given,
                    but the unsuspecting reader is left without the second date. A discussion of college teaching and
                    academic freedom cites Clement Eaton, "Southern Senators and the Right of Instruction,
                    1789–1860," saying that this article deals with the "particular
                    Southern problem" (Nye, p. 185). The reading even of the first sentence of this article
                    would have told the author and the editors that it dealt with the "right" of the
                    state legislatures to "tell" their senators how to vote in the national Senate.</p>
            <p>These books would have been much more valuable to historians and much more trusted by future students
                    if they had received a little more loving attention from the authors and a little more hardnosed
                    treatment by the editors.</p>

            <p>Morton Levy's <hi rend="i">Legacy of Suppression</hi> presents a revisionist interpretation
                    of the development and nature of libertarianism in eighteenth-century America based upon intensive
                    research in primary sources. The book challenges the Holmes-Chafee-Schofield thesis which is called
                    "an hallucination of sentiment that ignores history" (p. 18). The reason for the
                    "error" of these scholars is that they "anticipated the past by
                    succumbing to an impulse to recreate it so that its image may be seen in a manner consistent with
                    our rhetorical tradition of freedom" (p. 3). Professor Levy is also critical of writers who
                    disagree with this same thesis because they offer only slight evidence to support their view.</p>
            <p>Levy's book devotes itself to an investigation of different but related questions. Was it
                    the intention of the generation living during the time between the Revolution and the First
                    Amendment to supersede common law by repudiating the Blackstonian theory that freedom of the press
                    meant only freedom from prior restraint? Did public remarks that tended to lower the prestige of the
                    government constitute seditious libel? What was the significance of the abolition of the power of
                    government to punish statements that did not directly lead to acts in violation of law? Did the
                    concept of freedom of the press and speech advance when alleged distinctions betwen liberty and
                    license were abandoned? Levy proceeds to answer these questions by tracing the evolution of freedom
                    of expression. He finds that the phrase "freedom of speech" was extremely rare in
                    the seventeenth century. During the eighteenth century, the phrase was used to refer primarily to a
                    parliamentary and not a civil right. The common law's definition of freedom of the press
                    meant only the absence of censorship in advance of publication. The certainty of punishment after
                    publication, however, placed restraints on even the hardiest of souls. Thus, as late as 1763 the
                    situation remained substantially unchanged from that of the previous century except for the
                    disappearance of the licensing system.</p>
            <p>The revolutionary controversy with the mother country gave vitality to the colonial press and brought
                    about its expansion but did not change the prevailing concept of freedom of speech or press.
                    Certainly there was unlimited freedom to speak out on behalf of the American cause, but criticism of
                    it "brought the zealots of patriotism with tar and feathers" (p. 176). The Quebec
                    declaration of 1774 by the Continental Congress indicated that a diffusion of right sentiments was
                    to be permitted, but wrong sentiments were to be suppressed. Freedom of press was defined as a
                    privilege not to be used as justification for attempts to revile with impunity. This concept was not
                    only orthodox, "it was the only definition known in Anglo-American thought and
                    law" (p. 68).</p>
            <p>Professor Levy discusses in detail the Cushing-Adams correspondence of 1789, which is usually ignored
                    by scholars. The libertarianism of the two men was shown by the acceptance of the theory that the
                    publication of truth could not effectually harm a good government. <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-057-3-079"/> Still, they refused to admit that error of opinion should also be
                    tolerated. Had Cushing and Adams admitted that a good government could not be injured by false
                    opinion, they would have developed a libertarian philosophy that was incompatible with the concept
                    of seditious libel. The book concludes that the framers of the Constitution had a genius for studied
                    imprecision. There is no evidence that they possessed ultimate wisdom or even the best insights on
                    the meaning of freedom of expression. Their contribution was sufficient, however, in their
                    recognition of the principle of freedom of speech and press in the Constitution in unqualified and
                    undefined terms.</p>

                    </placeName> prior to 1850 is this republication of Captain Frederick Marryat's <hi rend="i">Diary in America.</hi> One of those fortunate few who enjoy more than one successful
                    career, Marryat resigned his commission as captain in the British navy—retiring from a
                    career of nearly a quarter-century that was marked by honor and personal bravery at
                    sea—to attempt the almost equally hazardous life of literature. At the height of his
                    popularity as a novelist he ventured to America; his object, in his own words, was "to
                    examine and ascertain <hi rend="i">what were the effects of a democratic form of government and
                        climate upon a people which, with all its foreign admixture, may still be considered as
                    English</hi>" (p. 46). (Italics are Marryat's.) Arriving in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> in the spring of 1837, Marryat traveled widely during the eighteen months of his

                    </placeName> where he hobnobbed with Indians near Fort Snelling. First lionized, later vilified, he
                    was in almost constant hot water with press and public. A speech he gave at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toronto</settlement>

               </placeName>, with the wife of a phrenologist
                    provided news of his tour for his detractors.</p>
            <p>More flippant than scholarly, Marryat reflects the same aristocratic prejudices as those of his
                    junketing predecessor Miss Martineau. Possessed of the quick and artistic eye of the novelist, he is
                    at his best when drawing word pictures of the sights, sounds, and smells of the America of the

                    contemporary De Tocqueville, the Englishman fares but poorly as a serious interpreter of American
                    democracy. But Marryat could be perceptive, as in this observation worthy of the best in the Turner
                    hypothesis: "We must always bear in mind <pb n="260" id="VAA4025-057-3-080"/> the peculiar

                    America and its form of government; for the country has had more to do with upholding this democracy
                    than people might at first imagine" (p. 43). By <hi rend="i">country</hi> he meant
                    "the vast extent and boundless resources of the territory" (p. 44).</p>
            <p>Though Marryat enjoyed his tour, and his enjoyment is infectious, he was more favorably impressed

                    Eminently readable, his <hi rend="i">Diary</hi> is also very quotable and not ephemeral.</p>
            <p>Professor Zanger's job of editing is extremely helpful. He does however make an error in the
                    identification of Gros Cap (p. 320, note 4). The Gros Cap described by Marryat is the Gros Cap of
                    Lake Superior about ten miles west of Sault Ste. Marie, <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Zanger includes a critical introduction of excellent quality in which he corrects
                    earlier misinterpretations of Marryat's itinerary and offers a sound estimate of the

            <p>Edward Lurie, a trained historian, has used the techniques of his craft to prepare this satisfying
                    full-length biography of the Swiss-born zoologist who became one of the leaders of science in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the middle of the ninetenth century. Agassiz was educated in the best European
                    universities, a friend of Cuvier and von Humboldt, and had a world-wide reputation for his studies
                    of fossil fish and for his brilliant exposition of the action of glaciers as a geological force. In
                    1846 he was invited to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> to deliver a series of lectures at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
                    </placeName> Institute. He soon attracted such favorable attention as a well-informed scientist who
                    could be understood by laymen that he was appointed professor of geology in the new Lawrence
                    Scientific School of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. From his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> friends Agassiz soon secured funds with which to begin research for a multivolume
                    account of the zoology of America, initiate a study of fishes, and establish a museum for the study
                    of comparative anatomy. For Agassiz the latter meant a collection of every kind of natural history
                    object from all over the world.</p>
            <p>Professor Lurie pictures Agassiz as a skillful teacher, an administrator, and researcher who started
                    many projects on so large a scale that they were never completed, and as a person engaged in
                    frequent controversy with his students and associates over credit for discoveries. Yet at the same
                    time he is shown as possessed with the breadth of vision necessary to initiate the broad-scale
                    development of scientific study and research in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. In cooperation with a handful of other top-flight scientists, Agassiz was most
                    influential in securing government and private financial support and in putting competent <pb n="261" id="VAA4025-057-3-081"/> men in positions of leadership. During the Civil War, Agassiz
                    and his friends succeeded in founding the National Academy of Sciences as the chief scientific body
                    in the nation.</p>
            <p>So busy was Agassiz, however, that he did not keep up with the thinking of his fellow scientists, and
                    for a long time he rejected the new views of Darwin on evolution and held to his own belief in
                    special creation. But his cogent arguments in opposition helped to bring about a reaffirmation of
                    Darwin's views. In general, as Lurie points out, scientific leadership in America passed
                    from Agassiz' hands as a result of his stand. Agassiz' lasting monument is the
                    Museum of Comparative Anatomy at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, which is today what Agassiz
                    envisioned—a great and well-ordered teaching museum of natural history.</p>
            <p>Professor Lurie develops all these facets of the life of Agassiz, and more. The University of <placeName>

            <p>Professor Dorothy Ganfield Fowler's biography of John Coit Spooner is a sympathetic but
                    objective study of a lawyer and statesman now almost forgotten. In the late 1890's and
                    during the first six or seven years of the twentieth century, Spooner was one of that small inner
                    circle of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senators known as "The Four," who dominated the Senate and exercised
                    unusual influence over the legislative and executive branches of the federal government.</p>
            <p>Beginning with Spooner's family background and his early years in his native <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, Mrs. Fowler traces his life in a chronological sequence of events which
                    includes his student years at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, his military service during the Civil War, his career as a railroad attorney in <placeName>

                    </placeName> City following his resignation from the Senate in 1907 until his death in 1919.</p>
            <p>Readers of this biography who are familiar with the history of the period of Spooner's
                    service in the Senate and with recent studies, published and unpublished, of some of his
                    contemporaries can hardly escape the thought that "conservatives," such as
                    Spooner, W. B. Allison, and S. B. Elkins, were not so reactionary, nor
                    "progressives," such as Albert J. Beveridge, Jonathan P. Dolliver, and Albert B.
                    Cummins, so radical as they seemed to be half a century ago. Spooner, to be sure, was a
                    conservative, but, as Mrs. Fowler ably demonstrates, he was not the "tool" of the
                    railroads or of any other special interest, and Lincoln Steffens did him a grave and unwarranted
                    injustice to include him <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-057-3-082"/> among those whom the Muckrakers
                    pilloried as "Enemies of the Republic."</p>
            <p>It was during his last ten years as a senator (1897–1907) that Spooner exercised his
                    greatest power. He was less than enthusiastic about some party measures such as the Dingley tariff
                    bill, and Theodore Roosevelt's "hasty course… in pushing through the
                    Panama Canal project caused Spooner some painful misgivings… " (p. 285), but in
                    general he did defend Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt. One may question, however, whether Spooner
                    was as much of a "defender" of the latter as were Jonathan P. Dolliver, Henry C.
                    Lodge, or Albert J. Beveridge.</p>
            <p>Dorothy Fowler, professor of history at Hunter College, is at her best in describing
                    Spooner's accomplishments as a lawyer and as an adviser on foreign policy. Unfortunately,
                    she sometimes fails to probe deeply enough or to explain with sufficient detail major domestic
                    political and economic developments. For example, her discussion of the efforts to pass the Hepburn
                    Act is quite inadequate, indeed inaccurate in some respects, and her treatment of the development of
                    the Progressive movement is rather superficial. Most disappointing and least understandable is the
                    author's failure to give any explanation whatever for Spooner's resignation from
                    the Senate in 1907 (p. 369).</p>
            <p>The book is amply documented, the index is complete and accurate, and despite its minor shortcomings
                    this is an interesting and much needed biography of a significant senator.</p>

                    the weft for the warp of the chronological volumes. John R. Stover's subject has special
                    relevance because it fits a dramatic framework—the cycle of rise, maturity, and decline
                    of the American railroad empire. He sees the 130 years of the development of railroads in this
                    country as falling generally into three well-defined eras: (1) the first generation from the
                    beginnings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1830 to the important role of railroads in the Civil War; (2) the half-century after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>, during which a great national rail network was created and finally subjected to close
                    governmental controls in the Progressive era of the early twentieth century; (3) the decades since
                    World War I, a troubled period full of new problems and new competition and presenting the railroads
                    with an uncertain future. Within the compass of 260 pages of text the author covers briefly but
                    clearly such matters as technical improvements, financial corruption in the post Civil War period,
                    regulatory legislation, and wartime accomplishments. He does a good <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-057-3-083"/> job not only in describing the growth of railroad transportation in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> but also in relating it to the main trends of American social and economic history.</p>
            <p>In so short a volume, however, some questions must be passed over lightly. This is apparently the
                    case with the part played by organized labor in the railroad story. Aside from brief mention of the
                    year of violence in 1877 and Debs and the Pullman strike of 1894, the book contains little
                    information about the organization and early struggles of the railroad workers'
                    brotherhoods and other unions. Yet the author has a good deal to say about such modern labor abuses
                    as "feather-bedding" and their effects upon railroad decline. As the editor of the
                    series writes in the Preface, the Age of the Railroad has its romantic element, but in <hi rend="i">American Railroads</hi> most of this is lost in the rapid pace of the narrative and beneath the
                    heavy but probably necessary burden of statistics—trackage and capitalization figures,
                    freight and passenger rates, number of employees—embedded in the prose of many of its
                    pages. But all in all, Stover has accomplished much in so small a space. The story of American
                    railroading as he tells it has continuity, breadth, and direction. Moreover, he obviously believes
                    in railroads. His last chapter is both a good account of present difficulties and a strong plea for
                    a "healthy, stabilized, and prosperous" American railroad system in the future. In
                    his conclusion he argues persuasively that the drama of the railroads' rise and decline
                    need not become decline and fall.</p>

            <p>For countless generations men have carried on a more or less continuous controversy over gambling: Is
                    it a natural "instinct"? If so, is it "moral" or an evidence of
                    human depravity? In any case, does the state have the right (or the obligation) to regulate, limit,
                    or suppress it? While this ageless dispute has been raging, men have had time to devise ingenious
                    and varied forms of gambling, among which the lottery has occupied a special and, in a sense,
                    honored place.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Fortune's Merry Wheel</hi> John Samuel Ezell, associate professor of history
                    at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>, traces the history of the lottery from its transportation as part of the intellectual
                    baggage brought to colonial America, through its "national mania" phase, to its
                    decline and legislative suppression in the closing years of the nineteenth century. Taken
                    altogether, the book is a detailed and meticulously organized substantiation of the
                    author's thesis that "many an institution has been built on the weakness of
                    man" (p. 281). It is unlikely that any other "weakness" has been
                    exploited for more socially useful purposes than man's fascination for the "lucky
                    lottery." For three centuries Americans used the lottery as a fund-raising device for a <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-057-3-084"/> wide range of social welfare projects, extending from providing
                    early <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> settlers with food to the building of schools, churches, libraries, and penitentiaries
                    during the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Despite the obvious social benefits which the lottery made possible, there were at all times
                    articulate critics of the practice, and during the wave of reform of the period from 1830 to 1860,
                    public opinion began to focus upon the lottery's "abuses and frauds." By
                    the late 1880's a growing feeling that state regulation had proven ineffective led to
                    demands for federal suppression. To these demands Congress responded, beginning in 1890, with a
                    series of laws based upon federal regulatory power over interstate commerce and the mails, which
                    effectively "ended the saga of the American lottery."</p>
            <p>Perhaps the chief significance of <hi rend="i">Fortune's Merry Wheel</hi> lies in Professor
                    Ezell's success in correlating the rise and fall of the lottery with the evolution of
                    social, economic, and political conditions in America over a period of three centuries. A clear
                    relationship is established between the antitax attitudes and the scarcity of capital in colonial
                    and early republican America and the general popularity of the lottery. Similarly, philosophical
                    optimism, a strong streak in American thought during the early nineteenth century, nurtured the
                    growth of the lottery mania. On the other hand, the reform impulse of the ante bellum period and the
                    radical economic and social transformations of the postwar years paved the way for state and,
                    finally, federal abolition.</p>
            <p>In this valuable work only two criticisms seem worth mentioning, and both of them are matters of
                    format and style: the reader must search in the back of the book for the numerous (and enlightening)
                    footnotes, and he may miss some of the lottery's drama and color as a result of Professor
                    Ezell's colony-by-colony, state-by-state, year-by-year organization of his material.</p>

            <p>This excellent volume will be welcomed by researchers in American history. Ably edited by Alan
                    Conway, lecturer in American history at the University College of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in Aberystwyth, this collection of "America" letters tells the story
                    of Welsh emigrants in America during the first seventy-five years of the last century. The greater
                    portion of the letters were printed in various Welsh newspapers and nonconformist denominational
                    periodicals of the time. Others were obtained from the collections of the National Library of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wlk">Wales</region>
                    </placeName> and from individuals. These letters, widely read in the homeland, stimulated Welsh
                    migration to America.</p>
            <p>In 1850, 96 per cent of the Welsh immigrants were living in the northern states, the greatest
                    concentrations being in <placeName>

                    states were farmers whose letters indicate that they were happy in their new homes. At least 90 per
                    cent of their letters encouraged farmers in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Their letters describing working and living conditions, strikes, etc. In these areas
                    comprise the most valuable portion of the volume. Because of depressed conditions in the steel and
                    coal industries after the Civil War, these Welsh advised people in the old country not to migrate to
                    America. A comparative few, in the "belief that where there was a hole in the ground there
                    should be a Welsh miner at the bottom of it," went to seek their fortunes in the gold and
                    silver fields of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cou">Colorado</region>
                    </placeName>. Their letters also discouraged others from following in their footsteps.</p>
            <p>Students of the Civil War will be interested in the letters from Welsh soldiers in the Union army.
                    Surprising to this reviewer was the number of Welsh Mormans who migrated to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="utu">Utah</region>
                    </placeName>. In 1849, 249 Welsh Saints left the homeland for the desert Zion. These were followed
                    in 1856 by 703 others.</p>
            <p>Compared to the great flood of Germans and other continental nationalities to America, the number of
                    Welsh emigrants was indeed small. They did not concentrate in certain communities as did the Germans
                    and Scandinavians in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>, <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. Consequently, there is little evidence today that they ever came here. The letters in
                    this volume "tell much more about the influence of America on the Welsh immigrant than vice
                    versa." Nevertheless, they are a valuable addition to our collection of printed source
                    material.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Harriette S. Arnow, a graduate of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is the author of three novels—<hi rend="i">Mountain Path, The Doll
                    Maker,</hi> and <hi rend="i">Hunter's Horn.</hi> In her first nonfiction attempt, <hi rend="i">Seedtime on the Cumberland,</hi> she has combined literary talent and historical method
                    to produce an interesting picture of pioneer life in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Since she was reared in the Cumberland area, this book is admittedly a labor of love.</p>
            <p>The specific locale of <hi rend="i">Seedtime</hi> is the crescent-shaped valley of the
                        <geogName>Cumberland River</geogName>, stretching from the mountains of southeast <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> through central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> to western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Because the Cumberland drainage basin forms a
                    curious, shoe-like shape on the map, Mrs. Arnow refers to it as the "Old Boot." In
                    point of time, <hi rend="i">Seedtime</hi> covers approximately the last quarter of the eighteenth
                    century.</p>
            <p>The book resembles a historical scrapbook with its fourteen long, rambling chapters. In its pages,
                    Mrs. Arnow portrays the roles of many <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-057-3-086"/> people: hunters,
                    settlers, scouts, traders, Indians, and surveyors. She also gives thumbnail sketches of individuals
                    such as Arnold Viele, Colonel William Byrd, Doctor Thomas Walker, John Sevier, James Robertson,
                    Kaspar Mansker, Andrew Jackson, and Nancy Gower. Throughout the book, however, the major theme is
                    the process of pioneering rather than the contributions of particular persons in the westward
                    movement. Actually, "Seedtime on the Cumberland" could be seedtime on almost any
                    western river. The methods and procedures of pioneering were in the main the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Seedtime</hi> attempts to recapture eighteenth-century life by recalling pioneer
                    architecture, furniture, clothing, implements, and recipes. Mrs. Arnow also calls attention to the
                    fact that there are still extant houses, implements, and recipes that reveal the life and creativity
                    of Cumberland pioneers. The author states that the main purpose of <hi rend="i">Seedtime on the
                        Cumberland</hi> is "to re-create a few of the more important aspects of pioneer life as
                    it was lived on the Cumberland by ordinary men and women" (p. vii). To do this, she has
                    provided infinite detail about pioneer life. She has also made several laudatory generalizations
                    about these people. She points out that they were neither intellectuals nor illiterates and that
                    they were more interested in freedom and independance than in security or even life itself.</p>
            <p>Although Mrs. Arnow says she is not "concerned with the lives of famous men and
                    women" (p. vii), she does mention a number of them who lived in the Cumberland area. In a
                    few cases, she even debunks some of the famous names of the area in an attempt to prove that the
                    less well-known were the true seed of the Cumberland country. For example, she describes Daniel <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> and John Donelson as unreliable leaders and inept frontiersmen. Although she downgrades
                    the exploits of some of these well-known individuals, she is unable to ignore their accomplishments.
                    At one point she notes that "Middle <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> was a wider world, and though it held many voices and clashing opinions, it was soon to
                    be the voice of the young <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, ever able to outshout <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, Webster, and Calhoun, producing three presidents to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s none" (p. 336).</p>
            <p>Drawing upon numerous depositories, Mrs. Arnow has consulted account books, newspapers, travel
                    accounts, wills, inventories, diaries, letters, reminiscences, local histories, and even historical
                    imagination in an attempt to make her portrayal of Cumberland life true and realistic. In some
                    places, she has actually overannotated in her zeal to approach historical accuracy. <hi rend="i">Seedtime on the Cumberland</hi> has a useful index and contains eight maps of the Cumberland
                    area and its surroundings. These maps emphasize transportation, population, and topography.</p>
            <p>This book would be of special value to libraries in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

            <p>This monograph is a readable summary of politics in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> from the 1824 presidential campaign through the first years of President Martin <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren's administration. The writer has shown how leaders of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> reacted to policies of "Jacksonian Democracy" when these policies
                    were implemented at the national level. In the account we see the expression of grassroots sentiment
                    on key domestic issues which we identify with Andrew Jackson: Indian removal, the tariff,
                    nullification, and "Mr. Biddle's Bank."</p>
            <p>To say that Andrew Jackson enjoyed prestige in frontier <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> from his Indian fighting days through the years of his public life would be a gross
                    understatement. That an effective political party would coalesce around his commanding figure was,
                    in the light of southwestern frontier circumstances, almost inevitable. Yet, as Miles demonstrates,
                    there was hardly unanimity among those who rode Old Hickory's coattails. The test facing
                    the ambitious <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> politician in the 1820's and 1830's was simple: How far can I pursue
                    my independent course and still enjoy the protection of the great Jackson name? Senator George
                    Poindexter is the prime example of a Mississippian who felt secure enough to swim against the
                    currents of Jacksonian popularity; most—including Samuel Gwin and Robert J.
                    Walker—drifted with the currents, even when the currents appeared to be flowing upstream.
                    Martin <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren eventually inherited Andrew Jackson's national title but not his aura,
                    and after 1836 the once effective Democratic coalition in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> splintered away its unity and power.</p>
            <p>In depicting <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> politics of the Jacksonian era, the writer lifts the veil from some of the practical
                    conditions which triggered overt political action. We see, even in this thinly settled state, clear
                    evidence of rural-urban rivalry. We see "pet banks" with varying degrees of fiscal
                    stability and "paper railroads" which would always remain trackless. We observe
                    the corroding effect of land hunger on political principles. And we are given new insights into the
                    perennial American debate which we have come to identify as the state versus federal authority.
                    Professor Mile's study should encourage scholars to explore similar facets of frontier
                    history more diligently. His documentation, based on scores of contemporary newspapers and an
                    impressive array of other primary sources, gives some valuable guidelines.</p>
            <p>The only point on which one might take issue with Miles relates to some indecision (in the Preface)
                    as to whether his study concerns Jacksonian "Democracy" or Jacksonian
                    "democracy." A close reading of the book resolves the dilemma in favor of the
                    capitalized form of the term, for in doing so one finds still further evidence that the early
                    nineteenth century American frontier is not an appropriate place to seek "political

            <p>This slim volume is one of the few life histories of any scope recorded for an American Indian woman
                    and is unique in being the second extensive autobiography recorded by a member of the same <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-057-3-089"/> immediate Indian family. (Anthropologist Paul Radin edited a
                    very different kind of autobiography by one of Mountain Wolf Woman's brothers, Big
                    Winnebago, called by Radin "Crashing Thunder" [<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, 1926].)</p>
            <p>Mountain Wolf Woman's autobiography was dictated by an "old Winnebago
                    lady" when she was more than 70 years old as a favor to her "niece,"
                    anthropologist Nancy Oestreich Lurie, who had asked her to do so and who understood, without being
                    told, the social implications, relationships, customs, emotions, and scene involved in the events.
                    As a consequence the narrative may sometimes seem obscure or too compressed to a general reader,
                    though it also contains many charming or striking passages.</p>
            <p>While her autobiography naturally reflects a woman's occupations and concerns, Mountain Wolf
                    Woman was conscious of the fact that her activities mirrored events and cultural changes shared by
                    the Winnebago generally. She recognized the fact that Winnebago ways of living had changed during
                    her lifetime and would continue to change. She makes this explicit a number of times, as when, for
                    example she points out that the Indians always found ways to earn a living and when older ways
                    disappeared they tried new ones. She viewed her life as part of a continuing stream of life in which
                    she had played her part and which would continue in the lives of her children and grandchildren. The
                    narrative is especially interesting in its depiction of universal human experiences described from
                    an exotic cultural point of view. It would be interesting to compare this autobiography with that of
                    a rural white woman living in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> during the same time period.</p>
            <p>The narrative was recorded on tape in the Winnebago language by Mountain Wolf Woman, to allow her
                    more freedom of expression and to make events easier for her to recall, and then retold by her in
                    English. For the most part she tells her story in chronological order. Nancy Lurie has reproduced
                    the text as faithfully as possible and has restricted her explanatory materials to an extremely
                    illuminating (and necessary) series of notes which indicate how what may seem a fairly bald
                    statement is charged with significance to one who knows Winnebago history, culture, and the
                    relationships involved, a fact which has more general implications for the interpretation of Indian
                    speeches and statements recorded in historical documents.</p>

            <p>The bursting of the South Sea Bubble at the end of the summer of 1720 nearly ruined the British
                    financial community, brought disgrace and confiscation of property to the directors of the South Sea
                    Company, ended a ministry, cast suspicion on the character of the King and his entourage, and left a
                    web which, until the appearance of this book, has not been satisfactorily untangled. The South Sea
                    Company was <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-057-3-090"/> founded in 1711 on the expectation of trade with
                    Spanish America. Engaged primarily in slaving at first, it was an economic failure. But in late 1719
                    and early 1720 it allied itself with the Sword Blade Company and undertook to fund the national
                    debt. Parliament's consent followed considerable shady maneuvering. An orgy of speculation
                    through the summer of 1720 sent South Sea shares to ten times their original value. Gambling was not
                    confined to South Sea stock, and the collapse, when it came, was general.</p>
            <p>The South Sea episode has seldom been treated at any length. Hitherto it has been dealt with in
                    economic histories or as incidental in essentially political histories. <hi rend="i">The South Sea
                        Bubble</hi> is a genuine contribution, for it is the first study of the South Sea Company and
                    the political, economic, and social activities around it. This in itself is no mean task,
                    considering the political and social implications as well as the difficulties of writing financial
                    history, and it is done clearly and well. In addition, there is an attempt to place the South Sea
                    Bubble in context, to determine what forces were behind it and the significance of those forces.</p>
            <p>It is Carswell's opinion that the Bubble was far more than the "grotesque
                    incident" it is sometimes considered, that it is attributable to great economic forces and
                    can be understood only if those forces are understood. Consequently, the English phenomenon is set
                    in a European background which Carswell names the "commercial revolution." This
                    "revolution" was partly the great growth of trade between 1660 and 1720, but it
                    should be understood above all as the widespread experimentation with credit and with money based on
                    property and productivity rather than on metal. John Law's experiments in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> illustrate this tendency perfectly, and considerable space is devoted to them. The
                    South Sea Bubble becomes an example of the economic inventiveness and vitality of the period. Its
                    utter and dismal failure shows that it was economic and political ineptitude which ended the
                    "commercial revolution." Had politicians been aware of the connections between
                    economics and politics, had the business community and the general public had enough experience to
                    practice restraint, the "commercial revolution" might have shaded off into the
                    industrial revolution instead of ending ingloriously and with no apparent constructive results.</p>
            <p>Well-written, carefully organized, based on thorough scholarship, this book should serve as a
                    rewarding and painless antidote to the tendency of many students to ignore the economic aspects of
                    history.</p>

            <p>The conflict between the opposing forces of nationalism and particularism occupies a prominent place
                    in nineteenth-century Canadian history. This is one major theme which runs through Donald
                    Warner's <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-057-3-091"/> book, <hi rend="i">The Idea of Continental
                        Union.</hi> Particularism is defined by Warner to mean class and provincial discontent which was
                    expressed in the form of annexation movements designed to join part or all of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. This discontent was the centrifugal force which presented a serious obstacle to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>'s struggle for national unity. Since particularism is a psychological
                    phenomenon usually expressed in group action and political terms, a study of its appearance
                    (together with the form it takes) requires careful investigation and analysis. The author has
                    accomplished both with skill and clarity.</p>
            <p>Currents of annexationist sentiment were especially strong from 1847–1850,
                    1867–1871, 1884–1893. Reaction to economic depression is underlined as the
                    common denominator in all three periods which gave substance and meaning to the idea of continental
                    union. As Warner makes abundantly clear, however, annexationism was not exclusively the product of
                    economic forces. Political and cultural conflicts of an inter-intraprovincial nature were important
                    as secondary causes.</p>
            <p>From 1847 to 1850 basic economic and political grievances set the pattern of response which
                    dissatisfied Canadians were to follow in the future. Canadian merchants, already faced with severe
                    economic depression, were annoyed in 1849 when the British Parliament repealed imperial preference.
                    Their subsequent failure to obtain trade reciprocity with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> snapped many ties of empire: "If the American market could not be gained by a
                    treaty, they could enter it through a political union with the Republic" (p. 13). The
                    threat of annexation proved equally useful as a weapon (but not nearly so effective) for other
                    disgruntled Canadians besides merchants. The <hi rend="i">Parti Rouge,</hi> with its program of
                    French nationalit$eA, and English Canadians in Montreal, who feared French domination,
                    played on the same theme to gain group concessions. The failure of these various movements for
                    annexation is explained in detail by Warner; most important was their lack of national support.</p>
            <p>Economic instability and political conflict from 1867 to 1871 excluded thoughts of national unity.
                    Despite the efforts of Sir John A. Macdonald, the Dominion's first prime minister, economic
                    depression and opposition to confederation produced a climate of discontent which in turn nourished
                    annexation movements. "The British North American Act," writes Warner,
                    "had combined the colonies in law but not in spirit" (p. 61). Although the scene
                    shifted from the Maritime Provinces to the sparsely settled territory of western <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, much the same drama was acted out. A touch of irony was provided as this sectional
                    response to central authority turned back on itself. Thus in the east the annexation movement,
                    "hastened the coming of confederation, and in the west it had helped to bring the union of
                    the British Northwest with the Dominion" (p. 126).</p>
            <p>In the years 1884 to 1893 a new wave of annexationism returned to trouble the Macdonald government.
                    But, as Warner points out, it was destined to be the last serious threat to Canadian nationalism. As
                    always the primary cause was economic, and once again the movement failed to gain national support.
                    By the turn of the century, prosperity and conciliation had done much to weaken the gravitational
                    pull of <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-057-3-092"/>

            <p>Professor Warner has written an important book for which he was awarded the first
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Association Prize. The petty typographical

            <p>This is the fifth of a series of indexes covering the <hi rend="i">Review of Historical Publications
                        Relating to <placeName>
                            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> and the <hi rend="i">Canadian Historical Review.</hi> The two initial indexes
                    covered Volumes I-XX of the annual <hi rend="i">Review,</hi> founded by George M. Wrong in 1896. The
                    third covered the first ten years of the <hi rend="i">Canadian Historical Review,</hi> established
                    in 1920, while the fourth continued the index for this quarterly to the end of 1939. The present
                    volume covers the <hi rend="i">Canadian Historical Review</hi> for the decade of the
                    1940's. It is to be hoped that a fifth index, for the 1950's, will soon be
                    available.</p>
            <p>The current index includes author and subject entries for items which appeared in the <hi rend="i">Canadian Historical Review,</hi> 1940–1949 (Volumes XXI-XXX). In addition, it
                    includes author and subject entries for titles which appeared in the <hi rend="i">Review's</hi> lists of "Recent Publications Relating to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>." The index appears to have been competently done, and its length suggests
                    that it has been done in a thorough manner. The items included indicate that the editors of the <hi rend="i">Canadian Historical Review</hi> have fortunately viewed Canadian history in a broad
                    context. The result is a guide of substantial value to students of Canadian history. Users of the
                    index, however, will find both advantages and disadvantages in the fact that it is divided into two
                    parts entitled "Author Index" and "Subject Index." The latter is
                    considerably longer than the former.</p>
            <p>This index and its predecessors merit considerable use by students and teachers of Canadian history.
                    Moreover, they deserve use by persons with special interest in the history of Indiana, the Old
                    Northwest, or the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The relationship between the historical development of these areas and Canadian
                    history, though much neglected, is both significant and continuous. The tendency of many persons to
                    view state and regional history in too limited a context is undoubtedly one cause for such neglect,
                    but American colleges and universities also bear much responsibility for it. A number of
                    universities which have or are sprouting courses dealing with various regions and countries of the
                    world still offer but little or even nothing concerning Canadian history. Whatever the reasons,
                    continued neglect of Canadian history by Americans is unfortunate.</p>

                    Paperbound, $1.50.) This directory, which is described by its title, is a biennial
                    publication of the American Association for State and Local History. The entries in this edition are
                    more complete and perhaps also more accurate than those in the previous one. Nonetheless, increased
                    responses from officers of historical societies and agencies are essential if the directory is to be
                    as current and as accurate as desirable. County historical societies constitute the bulk of the
                    nearly sixty entries for Indiana. The increase in their numbers in recent years is to a significant
                    extent a result of the continued labors and travels of Hubert Hawkins, director of the Indiana
                    Historical Bureau and executive secretary of the Indiana Historical Society. With Indiana's
                    sesquicentennial of statehood only five years away, Indiana counties lacking a local historical
                    society should either organize one or else affiliate with another county or local historical
                    society. Adding strength and quality to the historical societies of the state should be an important
                    and permanent result of Indiana's sesquicentennial program.</p>

                    original states or commonwealths. The editing appears to have been carefully done, and the editorial
                    comment is helpful without being obtrusive. According to Editor Taylor: "The story of the
                    struggle for a constitution in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> exemplifies that cardinal principle of the American Revolution, that government shall
                    be by consent of the governed. From the first this was the fixed idea of the Constitutionalists, and
                    the implementation of it gradually became the concern of men all over the state. Their determination
                    bore fruit in a bill of rights and a written constitution drafted by a convention elected for the
                    purpose and ratified by instructed delegates chosen by manhood suffrage. The method of a special
                    convention to draft a constitution and of the popular election of delegates to ratify it was used a
                    few years later to create a new government for the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Constitution also anticipated to a degree the federal one. The clearly defined
                    separation of powers and the checks and balances provided by a bicameral legislature and a very
                    strong executive were well in advance of the practice of the other states in that day" (p.

                    </placeName> Historical Society, March 4, 1960. The second paragraph of this lecture suggests its
                    general content and emphasis: "One cannot work long in the history of the Middle West
                    without realizing that over and beyond the factual content, the narrative of events, the interesting
                    data of economic life and politics, the development of institutions—the objective history
                    of the conscientious historian—there is a flavor and spirit impossible to capture in text
                    books, difficult to present in the general histories, and but partially conveyed in the study of
                    literature. Much of the stuff which gives richness to the pattern of life falls in the broad domain
                    of social and cultural history; much of it deals with the sentiments and feelings of those who made
                    the history, and the cold facts of history without an appreciation of these sentiments constitute a
                    carcass without a soul. So I speak briefly on `The Romantic Appeal of the New West' in the
                    years which followed the Second War with Great Britain, with the hope that I may convey something of
                    the spirit of the period and possibly open new paths to the enjoyment of the early history of our
                    region."</p>

                    as the edition which appeared in 1952. It is a detailed study of Harrison's life and career
                    to 1865. Its emphasis is on Harrison's family background, youth, education, practice of law

                    military service in the Civil War. This volume has merit for its exhaustive research and treatment
                    of the early professional, political, and military career of the future president. Nevertheless, it
                    appears longer than desirable, and Father Seviers seems unduly laudatory regarding
                    Harrison's qualities and achievements. Some unfortunate errors of fact appear. For
                    instance, the Miami Indians did not agree to vacate Indiana in 1818 (p. 91n); David Wallace became
                    governor of Indiana in 1837, not 1847 (p. 96n); Morton was not Indiana's "next
                    governor" in 1857 (p. 126), since both <placeName>

                    Sievers' second volume on Harrison appeared in 1959, while the third and final volume is
                    reported to be nearing completion.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, John Hay (1838–1905) had a distinguished career in American
                    diplomacy and also a significant career as an author. Perhaps if Americans of the 1960's
                    better understood the conservative and imperialistic views personified by John Hay, they would also
                    better understand the nature and significance of the fundamental forces and influences which have
                    modified and shaped American politics and diplomacy during the twentieth century.</p>

                    election campaign, offers information about the office of president, national campaigning, voting
                    for president and vice president, etc. It was apparently designed to increase both interest and
                    knowledge regarding presidential elections on the part of students. This publication is available at

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Monthly Bulletin</hi> of the Indiana State Board of Health devoted its March and
                    April issues, 1961, almost exclusively to a statistical study of population changes in Indiana since
                    1900. The statistical data and comments illustrate changes within counties and also within
                    particular sections of the state (groups of counties). Special attention is given to population
                    changes between 1950 and 1960. The data and comments were prepared by Robert Calhoun, director of
                    the Division of Statistical Research, Indiana State Board of Health. Such information as Calhoun
                    presents is obviously relevant to research concerning public health as well as to public health
                    programs. This information is also useful to students and citizens interested in the impact of
                    population changes on government, education, economic life, and so on. The <hi rend="i">Monthly

                    yield no or very little pottery, large crude flint blades and projectile points, and simple
                    problematical forms would seem to suggest a horizon below Early Woodland. This is purely
                    hypothetical, and clear evidence that any site in the area was occupied prior to Early Woodland has
                    not been found" (p. 42).</p>

                    and local tax burdens among various income groups and the distribution of the benefits of state and
                    local expenditures among these groups. Professor Brownlee, author of this booklet, explains some of
                    the problems and limitations involved in studies such as this. Similar studies have recently been
                    published for <placeName>

                    Professor Brownlee's conclusions are qualified, he nevertheless offers rather definite
                    observations and conclusions about the diffusion of tax burdens and the distribution of benefits of
