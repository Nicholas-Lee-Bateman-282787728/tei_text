                    <head>CHAPTER I</head>
                    <p>ONE morning, in the fall of 1880, a middle-aged woman, accompanied by a young
                        girl of eighteen, presented herself at the clerk&apos;s desk of the
                        principal hotel in Columbus, Ohio, and made inquiry as to whether there was
                        anything about the place that she could do. She was of a helpless, fleshy
                        build, with a frank, open countenance and an innocent, diffident manner. Her
                        eyes were large and patient, and in them dwelt such a shadow of distress as
                        only those who have looked sympathetically into the countenances of the
                        distraught and helpless poor know anything about. Any one could see where
                        the daughter behind her got the timidity and shame-facedness which now
                        caused her to stand back and look indifferently away. She was a product of
                        the fancy, the feeling, the innate affection of the untutored but poetic
                        mind of her mother combined with the gravity and poise which were
                        characteristic of her father. Poverty was driving them. Together they
                        presented so appealing a picture of honest necessity that even the clerk was
                        affected.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it you would like to do?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe you have some cleaning or scrubbing,&quot; she replied,
                        timidly. &quot;I could wash the floors.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The daughter, hearing the statement, turned uneasily, not because it
                        irritated her to work, but because she <pb id="VAA2406-009" n="2"/> hated
                        people to guess at the poverty that made it necessary. The clerk, manlike,
                        was affected by the evidence of beauty in distress. The innocent
                        helplessness of the daughter made their lot seem hard indeed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait a moment,&quot; he said; and, stepping into a back office,
                        he called the head housekeeper.</p>
                    <p>There was work to be done. The main staircase and parlor hall were unswept
                        because of the absence of the regular scrub-woman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that her daughter with her?&quot; asked the housekeeper, who
                        could see them from where she was standing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I believe so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She might come this afternoon if she wants to. The girl helps her,
                        I suppose?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You go see the housekeeper,&quot; said the clerk, pleasantly,
                        as he came back to the desk. &quot;Right through there&quot;pointing
                        to a near-by door. &quot;She&apos;ll arrange with you about
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A succession of misfortunes, of which this little scene might have been
                        called the tragic culmination, had taken place in the life and family of
                        William Gerhardt, a glass-blower by trade. Having suffered the reverse so
                        common in the lower walks of life, this man was forced to see his wife, his
                        six children, and himself <unclear>dependen-</unclear> for the necessaries
                        of life upon whatever windfall <unclear>o-</unclear> fortune the morning of
                        each recurring day might bring He himself was sick in bed. His oldest boy,
                        Sebastian, or &quot;Bass,&quot; as his associates transformed it,
                        worked as an apprentice to a local freight-car builder, but received only
                        four dollars a week. Genevieve, the oldest of the girls, was past eighteen,
                        but had not as yet been trained to any special work. The other children,
                        George, aged fourteen; Martha, twelve; William ten, and Veronica, eight,
                        were too young to do anything, and only made the problem of existence the
                        more complicated. Their one mainstay was the home, which, barring a
                        sixhundred-dollar mortgage, the father owned. He had <pb id="VAA2406-010"
                            n="3"/> borrowed this money at a time when, having saved enough to buy
                        the house, he desired to add three rooms and a porch, and so make it large
                        enough for them to live in. A few years were still to run on the mortgage,
                        but times had been so bad that he had been forced to use up not only the
                        little he had saved to pay off the principal, but the annual interest also.
                        Gerhardt was helpless, and the consciousness of his precarious situationthe
                        doctor&apos;s bill, the interest due upon the mortgage, together with
                        the sums owed butcher and baker, who, through knowing him to be absolutely
                        honest, had trusted him until they could trust no longer all these
                        perplexities weighed upon his mind and racked him so nervously as to delay
                        his recovery.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt was no weakling. For a time she took in washing, what little
                        she could get, devoting the intermediate hours to dressing the children,
                        cooking, seeing that they got off to school, mending their clothes, waiting
                        on her husband, and occasionally weeping. Not infrequently she went
                        personally to some new grocer, each time farther and farther away, and,
                        starting an account with a little cash, would receive credit until other
                        grocers warned the philanthropist of his folly. Corn was cheap. Sometimes
                        she would make a kettle of lye hominy, and this would last, with scarcely
                        anything else, for an entire week. Corn-meal also, when made into mush, was
                        better than nothing, and this, with a little milk, made almost a feast.
                        Potatoes fried was the nearest they ever came to luxurious food, and coffee
                        was an infrequent treat. Coal was got by picking it up in buckets and
                        baskets along the maze of tracks in the nearby railroad yard. Wood, by
                        similar journeys to surrounding lumber-yards. Thus they lived from day to
                        day, each hour hoping that the father would get well and that the
                        glass-works would soon start up. But as the winter approached Gerhardt began
                        to feel desperate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must get out of this now pretty soon,&quot; was the <pb
                            id="VAA2406-011" n="4"/> sturdy German&apos;s regular comment, and
                        his anxiety found but weak expression in the modest quality of his voice.</p>
                    <p>To add to all this trouble little Veronica took the measles, and, for a few
                        days, it was thought that she would die. The mother neglected everything
                        else to hover over her and pray for the best. Doctor Ellwanger came every
                        day, out of purely human sympathy, and gravely examined the child. The
                        Lutheran minister, Pastor Wundt, called to offer the consolation of the
                        Church. Both of these men brought an atmosphere of grim ecclesiasticism into
                        the house. They were the black-garbed, sanctimonious emissaries of superior
                        forces. Mrs. Gerhardt felt as if she were going to lose her child, and
                        watched sorrowfully by the cot-side. After three days the worst was over,
                        but there was no bread in the house. Sebastian&apos;s wages had been
                        spent for medicine. Only coal was free for the picking, and several times
                        the children had been scared from the railroad yards. Mrs. Gerhardt thought
                        of all the places to which she might apply, and despairingly hit upon the
                        hotel. Now, by a miracle, she had her chance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much do you charge?&quot; the housekeeper asked her.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt had not thought this would be left to her, but need emboldened
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would a dollar a day be too much?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the housekeeper; &quot;there is only about
                        three days&apos; work to do every week. If you would come every
                        afternoon you could do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said the applicant. &quot;Shall we start
                        to-day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; if you&apos;ll come with me now I&apos;ll show you
                        where the cleaning things are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The hotel, into which they were thus summarily introduced, was a rather
                        remarkable specimen for the time and place. Columbus, being the State
                        capital, and having a population of fifty thousand and a fair passenger <pb
                            id="VAA2406-012" n="5"/> traffic, was a good field for the hotel
                        business, and the opportunity had been improved; so at least the Columbus
                        people proudly thought. The structure, five stories in height, and of
                        imposing proportions, stood at one corner of the central public square,
                        where were the Capitol building and principal stores. The lobby was large
                        and had been recently redecorated. Both floor and wainscot were of white
                        marble, kept shiny by frequent polishing. There was an imposing staircase
                        with hand-rails of walnut and toe-strips of brass. An inviting corner was
                        devoted to a news and cigar-stand. Where the staircase curved upward the
                        clerk&apos;s desk and offices had been located, all done in hardwood and
                        ornamented by novel gas - fixtures. One could see through a door at one end
                        of the lobby to the barbershop, with its chairs and array of shaving-mugs.
                        Outside were usually two or three buses, arriving or departing, in
                        accordance with the movement of the trains.</p>
                    <p>To this caravanserai came the best of the political and social patronage of
                        the State. Several Governors had made it their permanent abiding place
                        during their terms of office. The two United States Senators, whenever
                        business called them to Columbus, invariably maintained parlor chambers at
                        the hotel. One of them, Senator Brander, was looked upon by the proprietor
                        as more or less of a permanent guest, because he was not only a resident of
                        the city, but an otherwise homeless bachelor. Other and more transient
                        guests included Congressmen, State legislators and lobbyists, merchants,
                        professional men, and, after them, the whole raft of indescribables who,
                        coming and going, make up the glow and stir of this kaleidoscopic world.</p>
                    <p>Mother and daughter, suddenly flung into this realm of superior brightness,
                        felt immeasurably overawed. They went about too timid to touch anything for
                        fear of giving offense. The great red-carpeted hallway, which they were set
                        to sweep, had for them all the magnificence of a <pb id="VAA2406-013" n="6"
                        /> palace; they kept their eyes down and spoke in their lowest tones. When
                        it came to scrubbing the steps and polishing the brass-work of the splendid
                        stairs both needed to steel themselves, the mother against her timidity, the
                        daughter against the shame at so public an exposure. Wide beneath lay the
                        imposing lobby, and men, lounging, smoking, passing constantly in and out,
                        could see them both.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it fine?&quot; whispered Genevieve, and started
                        nervously at the sound of her own voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; returned her mother, who, upon her knees, was
                        wringing out her cloth with earnest but clumsy hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It must cost a good deal to live here, don&apos;t you
                        think?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said her mother. &quot;Don&apos;t forget to
                        rub into these little corners. Look here what you&apos;ve
                        left.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie, mortified by this correction, fell earnestly to her task, and
                        polished vigorously, without again daring to lift her eyes.</p>
                    <p>With painstaking diligence they worked downward until about five
                        o&apos;clock; it was dark outside, and all the lobby was brightly
                        lighted. Now they were very near the bottom of the stairway.</p>
                    <p>Through the big swinging doors there entered from the chilly world without a
                        tall, distinguished, middle-aged gentleman, whose silk hat and loose
                        military cape-coat marked him at once, among the crowd of general idlers, as
                        some one of importance. His face was of a dark and solemn cast, but broad
                        and sympathetic in its lines, and his bright eyes were heavily shaded with
                        thick, bushy, black eyebrows. Passing to the desk he picked up the key that
                        had already been laid out for him, and coming to the staircase, started up.</p>
                    <p>The middle-aged woman, scrubbing at his feet, he acknowledged not only by
                        walking around her, but by graciously waving his hand, as much as to say,
                        &quot;Don&apos; <unclear/> move for me.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-014" n="7"/>
                    <p>The daughter, however, caught his eye by standing up, her troubled glance
                        showing that she feared she was in his way.</p>
                    <p>He bowed and smiled pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You shouldn&apos;t have troubled yourself,&quot; he said.
                        Jennie only smiled.</p>
                    <p>When he had reached the upper landing an impulsive sidewise glance assured
                        him, more clearly than before, of her uncommonly prepossessing appearance.
                        He noted the high, white forehead, with its smoothly parted and plaited
                        hair. The eyes he saw were blue and the complexion fair. He had even time to
                        admire the mouth and the full cheeksabove all, the well-rounded, graceful
                        form, full of youth, health, and that hopeful expectancy which to the
                        middle-aged is so suggestive of all that is worth begging of Providence.
                        Without another look he went dignifiedly upon his way, but the impression of
                        her charming personality went with him. This was the Hon. George Sylvester
                        Brander, junior Senator.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wasn&apos;t that a fine-looking man who went up just
                        now?&quot; observed Jennie a few moments later.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, he was,&quot; said her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He had a gold-headed cane.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t stare at people when they pass,&quot;
                        cautioned her mother, wisely. &quot;It isn&apos;t nice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t stare at him,&quot; returned Jennie,
                        innocently. &quot;He bowed to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, don&apos;t you pay any attention to anybody,&quot;
                        said her mother. &quot;They may not like it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie fell to her task in silence, but the glamor of the great world was
                        having its effect upon her senses. She could not help giving ear to the
                        sounds, the brightness, the buzz of conversation and laughter surrounding
                        her. In one section of the parlor floor was the diningroom, and from the
                        clink of dishes one could tell that supper was being prepared. In another
                        was the parlor <pb id="VAA2406-015" n="8"/> proper, and there some one came
                        to play on the piano. That feeling of rest and relaxation which comes before
                        the evening meal pervaded the place. It touched the heart of the innocent
                        working-girl with hope, for hers were the years, and poverty could not as
                        yet fill her young mind with cares. She rubbed diligently always, and
                        sometimes forgot the troubled mother at her side, whose kindly eyes were
                        becoming invested with crows&apos; feet, and whose lips half repeated
                        the hundred cares of the day. She could only think that all of this was very
                        fascinating, and wish that a portion of it might come to her.</p>
                    <p>At half-past five the housekeeper, remembering them, came and told them that
                        they might go. The fully finished stairway was relinquished by both with a
                        sigh of relief, and, after putting their implements away, they hastened
                        homeward, the mother, at least, pleased to think that at last she had
                        something to do.</p>
                    <p>As they passed several fine houses Jennie was again touched by that
                        half-defined emotion which the unwonted novelty of the hotel life had
                        engendered in her consciousness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it fine to be rich?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered her mother, who was thinking of the
                        suffering Veronica.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see what a big dining-room they had there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They went on past the low cottages and among the dead leaves of the year.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish we were rich,&quot; murmured Jennie, half to herself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know just what to do,&quot; confided her
                        mother with a long-drawn sigh. &quot;I don&apos;t believe
                        there&apos;s a thing to eat in the house.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s stop and see Mr. Bauman again,&quot; exclaimed
                        Jennie, her natural sympathies restored by the hopeless note in her
                        mother&apos;s voice.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-016" n="9"/>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think he would trust us any more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s tell him where we&apos;re working. I
                        will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said her mother, wearily.</p>
                    <p>Into the small, dimly lighted grocery store, which was two blocks from their
                        house, they ventured nervously. Mrs. Gerhardt was about to begin, but Jennie
                        spoke first.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you let us have some bread to-night, and a little bacon?
                        We&apos;re working now at the Columbus House, and we&apos;ll be sure
                        to pay you Saturday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; added Mrs. Gerhardt, &quot;I have something to
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bauman, who had long supplied them before illness and trouble began, knew
                        that they told the truth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long have you been working there?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just this afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know, Mrs. Gerhardt,&quot; he said, &quot;how it is
                        with me. I don&apos;t want to refuse you. Mr. Gerhardt is good for it,
                        but I am poor, too. Times are hard,&quot; he explained further,
                        &quot;I have my family to keep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt, weakly.</p>
                    <p>Her old shoddy shawl hid her rough hands, red from the day&apos;s work,
                        but they were working nervously. Jennie stood by in strained silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; concluded Mr. Bauman, &quot;I guess
                        it&apos;s all right this time. Do what you can for me
                        Saturday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He wrapped up the bread and bacon, and, handing Jennie the parcel, he added,
                        with a touch of cynicism:</p>
                    <p>&quot;When you get money again I guess you&apos;ll go and trade
                        somewhere else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; returned Mrs. Gerhardt; &quot;you know better
                        than that.&quot; But she was too nervous to parley long.</p>
                    <p>They went out into the shadowy street, and on past the low cottages to their
                        own home.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder,&quot; said the mother, wearily, when they neared the
                        door, &quot;if they&apos;ve got any coal?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; said Jennie. &quot;If they
                        haven&apos;t I&apos;ll</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-017" n="10"/>
                    <p>&quot;A man run us away,&quot; was almost the first greeting that the
                        perturbed George offered when the mother made her inquiry about the coal.
                        &quot;I got a little, though,&quot; he added. &quot;I threw it
                        off a car.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt only smiled, but Jennie laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How is Veronica?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She seems to be sleeping,&quot; said the father. &quot;I
                        gave her medicine again at five.&quot;</p>
                    <p>While the scanty meal was being prepared the mother went to the sick
                        child&apos;s bedside, taking up another long night&apos;s vigil
                        quite as a matter of course.</p>
                    <p>While the supper was being eaten Sebastian offered a suggestion, and his
                        larger experience in social and commercial matters made his proposition
                        worth considering. Though only a car-builder&apos;s apprentice, without
                        any education except such as pertained to Lutheran doctrine, to which he
                        objected very strongly, he was imbued with American color and energy. His
                        transformed name of Bass suited him exactly. Tall, athletic, and
                        well-featured for his age, he was a typical stripling of the town. Already
                        he had formulated a philosophy of life. To succeed one must do somethingone
                        must associate, or at least seem to associate, with those who were foremost
                        in the world of appearances.</p>
                    <p>For this reason the young boy loved to hang about the Columbus House. It
                        seemed to him that this hotel was the center and circumference of all that
                        was worth while in the social sense. He would go down-town evenings, when he
                        first secured money enough to buy a decent suit of clothes, and stand around
                        the hotel entrance with his friends, kicking his heels, smoking a
                        twofor-five-cent cigar, preening himself on his stylish appearance, and
                        looking after the girls. Others were there with himtown dandies and
                        nobodies, young men who came there to get shaved or to drink a glass of
                        whisky. And all of these he admired and sought to emulate. Clothes were the
                        main touchstone. If men wore nice <pb id="VAA2406-018" n="11"/> clothes and
                        had rings and pins, whatever they did seemed appropriate. He wanted to be
                        like them and to act like them, and so his experience of the more pointless
                        forms of life rapidly broadened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you get some of those hotel fellows to give you
                        their laundry?&quot; he asked of Jennie after she had related the
                        afternoon&apos;s experiences. &quot;It would be better than
                        scrubbing the stairs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you get it?&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, ask the clerk, of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This plan struck Jennie as very much worth while.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you ever speak to me if you meet me around
                        there,&quot; he cautioned her a little later, privately.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t you let on that you know me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; she asked, innocently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you know why,&quot; he answered, having indicated before
                        that when they looked so poor he did not want to be disgraced by having to
                        own them as relatives. &quot;Just you go on by. Do you hear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; she returned, meekly, for although this youth
                        was not much over a year her senior, his superior will dominated.</p>
                    <p>The next day on their way to the hotel she spoke of it to her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bass said we might get some of the laundry of the men at the hotel
                        to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt, whose mind had been straining all night at the problem of
                        adding something to the three dollars which her six afternoons would bring
                        her, approved of the idea.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So we might,&quot; she said. &quot;I&apos;ll ask that
                        clerk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When they reached the hotel, however, no immediate opportunity presented
                        itself. They worked on until late in the afternoon. Then, as fortune would
                        have it, the housekeeper sent them in to scrub up the floor behind the
                        clerk&apos;s desk. That important individual felt very kindly toward
                        mother and daughter. He liked <pb id="VAA2406-019" n="12"/> the
                        former&apos;s sweetly troubled countenance and the latter&apos;s
                        pretty face. So he listened graciously when Mrs. Gerhardt ventured meekly to
                        put the question which she had been revolving in her mind all the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is there any gentleman here,&quot; she said, &quot;who
                        would give me his washing to do? I&apos;d be so very much obliged for
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The clerk looked at her, and again recognized that absolute want was written
                        all over her anxious face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s see,&quot; he answered, thinking of Senator
                        Brander and Marshall Hopkins. Both were charitable men, who would be more
                        than glad to aid a poor woman. &quot;You go up and see Senator
                        Brander,&quot; he continued. &quot;He&apos;s in twenty-two.
                        Here,&quot; he added, writing out the number, &quot;you go up and
                        tell him I sent you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt took the card with a tremor of gratefulness. Her eyes looked
                        the words she could not say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all right,&quot; said the clerk, observing her
                        emotion. &quot;You go right up. You&apos;ll find him in his room
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With the greatest diffidence Mrs. Gerhardt knocked at number twenty-two.
                        Jennie stood silently at her side.</p>
                    <p>After a moment the door was opened, and in the full radiance of the bright
                        room stood the Senator. Attired in a handsome smoking-coat, he looked
                        younger than at their first meeting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, madam,&quot; he said, recognizing the couple, and
                        particularly the daughter, &quot;what can I do for you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Very much abashed, the mother hesitated in her reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We would like to know if you have any washing you could let us have
                        to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Washing?&quot; he repeated after her, in a voice which had a
                        peculiarly resonant quality. &quot;Washing? Come right in. Let me
                        see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stepped aside with much grace, waved them in and closed the door.
                        &quot;Let me see,&quot; he repeated, opening <pb id="VAA2406-020"
                            n="13"/> and closing drawer after drawer of the massive blackwalnut
                        bureau. Jennie studied the room with interest. Such an array of nicknacks
                        and pretty things on mantel and dressing-case she had never seen before. The
                        Senator&apos;s easy chair, with a green-shaded lamp beside it, the rich
                        heavy carpet and the fine rugs upon the floorwhat comfort, what luxury!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit down; take those two chairs there,&quot; said the Senator,
                        graciously, disappearing into a closet.</p>
                    <p>Still overawed, mother and daughter thought it more polite to decline, but
                        now the Senator had completed his researches and he reiterated his
                        invitation. Very uncomfortably they yielded and took chairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is this your daughter?&quot; he continued, with a smile at
                        Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the mother; &quot;she&apos;s my
                        oldest girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is your husband alive?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is his name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where does he live?&quot;</p>
                    <p>To all of these questions Mrs. Gerhardt very humbly answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How many children have you?&quot; he went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Six,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he returned, &quot;that&apos;s quite a
                        family. You&apos;ve certainly done your duty to the nation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; returned Mrs. Gerhardt, who was touched by his
                        genial and interesting manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you say this is your oldest daughter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What does your husband do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a glass-blower. But he&apos;s sick now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>During the colloquy Jennie&apos;s large blue eyes were wide with
                        interest. Whenever he looked at her she turned upon him such a frank,
                        unsophisticated gaze, and smiled in such a vague, sweet way, that he could
                        not keep his eyes off of her for more than a minute of the time.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-021" n="[14]"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he continued, sympathetically, &quot;that is
                        too bad! I have some washing herenot very muchbut you are welcome to it.
                        Next week there may be more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went about now, stuffing articles of apparel into a blue cotton bag with a
                        pretty design on the side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want these any certain day?&quot; questioned Mrs.
                        Gerhardt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, reflectively; &quot;any day next week
                        will do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She thanked him with a simple phrase, and started to go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me see,&quot; he said, stepping ahead of them and opening
                        the door, &quot;you may bring them back Monday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt. &quot;Thank
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They went out and the Senator returned to his reading, but it was with a
                        peculiarly disturbed mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Too bad,&quot; he said, closing his volume.
                        &quot;There&apos;s something very pathetic about those
                        people.&quot; Jennie&apos;s spirit of wonder and appreciation was
                        abroad in the room.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt and Jennie made their way anew through the shadowy streets.
                        They felt immeasurably encouraged by this fortunate venture.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t he have a fine room?&quot; whispered Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the mother; &quot;he&apos;s a great
                        man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a senator, isn&apos;t he?&quot; continued the
                        daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It must be nice to be famous,&quot; said the girl, softly.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II</head>
                    <p>THE spirit of Jenniewho shall express it? This daughter of poverty, who was
                        now to fetch and carry the laundry of this distinguished citizen of
                        Columbus, was a creature of a mellowness of temperament which words can but
                        vaguely suggest. There are natures born to the inheritance of flesh that
                        come without understanding, and that go again without seeming to have
                        wondered why. Life, so long as they endure it, is a true wonderland, a thing
                        of infinite beauty, which could they but wander into it wonderingly, would
                        be heaven enough. Opening their eyes, they see a conformable and perfect
                        world. Trees, flowers, the world of sound and the world of color. These are
                        the valued inheritance of their state. If no one said to them
                        &quot;Mine,&quot; they would wander radiantly forth, singing the
                        song which all the earth may some day hope to hear. It is the song of
                        goodness.</p>
                    <p>Caged in the world of the material, however, such a nature is almost
                        invariably an anomaly. That other world of flesh into which has been woven
                        pride and greed looks askance at the idealist, the dreamer. If one says it
                        is sweet to look at the clouds, the answer is a warning against idleness. If
                        one seeks to give ear to the winds, it shall be well with his soul, but they
                        will seize upon his possessions. If all the world of the so-called inanimate
                        delay one, calling with tenderness in sounds that seem to be too perfect to
                        be less than understanding, it shall be ill with the body. The hands of the
                        actual are forever reaching toward such as theseforever <pb id="VAA2406-023"
                            n="16"/> seizing greedily upon them. It is of such that the bond
                        servants are made.</p>
                    <p>In the world of the actual, Jennie was such a spirit. From her earliest youth
                        goodness and mercy had molded her every impulse. Did Sebastian fall and
                        injure himself, it was she who struggled with straining anxiety, carried him
                        safely to his mother. Did George complain that he was hungry, she gave him
                        all of her bread. Many were the hours in which she had rocked her younger
                        brothers and sisters to sleep, singing whole-heartedly betimes and dreaming
                        far dreams. Since her earliest walking period she had been as the right hand
                        of her mother. What scrubbing, baking, errand-running, and nursing there had
                        been to do she did. No one had ever heard her rudely complain, though she
                        often thought of the hardness of her lot. She knew that there were other
                        girls whose lives were infinitely freer and fuller, but, it never occurred
                        to her to be meanly envious; her heart might be lonely, but her lips
                        continued to sing. When the days were fair she looked out of her kitchen
                        window and longed to go where the meadows were. Nature&apos;s fine
                        curves and shadows touched her as a song itself. There were times when she
                        had gone with George and the others, leading them away to where a patch of
                        hickorytrees flourished, because there were open fields, with shade for
                        comfort and a brook of living water. No artist in the formulating of
                        conceptions, her soul still responded to these things, and every sound and
                        every sigh were welcome to her because of their beauty.</p>
                    <p>When the soft, low call of the wood-doves, those spirits of the summer, came
                        out of the distance, she would incline her head and listen, the whole
                        spiritual quality of it dropping like silver bubbles into her own great
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>Where the sunlight was warm and the shadows flecked with its splendid
                        radiance she delighted to wonder at the pattern of it, to walk where it was
                        most golden, and <pb id="VAA2406-024" n="17"/> follow with instinctive
                        appreciation the holy corridors of the trees.</p>
                    <p>Color was not lost upon her. That wonderful radiance which fills the western
                        sky at evening touched and unburdened her heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder,&quot; she said once with girlish
                        simplicity,&quot; how it would feel to float away off there among those
                        clouds.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had discovered a natural swing of a wild grapevine, and was sitting in it
                        with Martha and George.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, wouldn&apos;t it be nice if you had a boat up
                        there,&quot; said George.</p>
                    <p>She was looking with uplifted face at a far-off cloud, a red island in a sea
                        of silver.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just supposing,&quot; she said, &quot;people could live on
                        an island like that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her soul was already up there, and its elysian paths knew the lightness of
                        her feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There goes a bee,&quot; said George, noting a bumbler winging
                        by.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, dreamily, &quot;it&apos;s going
                        home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does everything have a home?&quot; asked Martha.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nearly everything,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do the birds go home?&quot; questioned George.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, deeply feeling the poetry of it herself,
                        &quot;the birds go home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do the bees go home?&quot; urged Martha.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, the bees go home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do the dogs go home?&quot; said George, who saw one traveling
                        lonesomely along the nearby road.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, of course,&quot; she said, &quot;you know that dogs go
                        home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do the gnats?&quot; he persisted, seeing one of those curious
                        spirals of minute insects turning energetically in the waning light.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, half believing her remark.
                        &quot;Listen!&quot; &quot;Oho,&quot; exclaimed George,
                        incredulously, &quot;I wonder what kind of houses they live
                        in.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-025" n="[18]"/>
                    <p>&quot;Listen!&quot; she gently persisted, putting out her hand to
                        still him.</p>
                    <p>It was that halcyon hour when the Angelus falls like a benediction upon the
                        waning day. Far off the notes were sounding gently, and nature, now that she
                        listened, seemed to have paused also. A scarlet-breasted robin was hopping
                        in short spaces upon the grass before her. A humming bee hummed, a cow-bell
                        tinkled, while some suspicious cracklings told of a secretly reconnoitering
                        squirrel. Keeping her pretty hand weighed in the air, she listened until the
                        long, soft notes spread and faded and her heart could hold no more. Then she
                        arose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, clenching her fingers in an agony of poetic
                        feeling. There were crystal tears overflowing in her eyes. The wondrous sea
                        of feeling in her had stormed its banks. Of such was the spirit of
                    Jennie.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III</head>
                    <p>THE junior Senator, George Sylvester Brander, was a man of peculiar mold. In
                        him there were joined, to a remarkable degree, the wisdom of the opportunist
                        and the sympathetic nature of the true representative of the people. Born a
                        native of southern Ohio, he had been raised and educated there, if one might
                        except the two years in which he had studied law at Columbia University. He
                        knew common and criminal law, perhaps, as well as any citizen of his State,
                        but he had never practised with that assiduity which makes for preeminent
                        success at the bar. He had made money, and had had splendid opportunities to
                        make a great deal more if he had been willing to stultify his conscience,
                        but that he had never been able to do. And yet his integrity had not been at
                        all times proof against the claims of friendship. Only in the last
                        presidential election he had thrown his support to a man for Governor who,
                        he well knew, had no claim which a strictly honorable conscience could have
                        recognized.</p>
                    <p>In the same way, he had been guilty of some very questionable, and one or two
                        actually unsavory, appointments. Whenever his conscience pricked him too
                        keenly he would endeavor to hearten himself with his pet phrase,
                        &quot;All in a lifetime.&quot; Thinking over things quite alone in
                        his easy-chair, he would sometimes rise up with these words on his lips, and
                        smile sheepishly as he did so. Conscience was not by any means dead in him.
                        His sympathies, if anything, were keener than ever.</p>
                    <p>This man, three times Congressman from the district <pb id="VAA2406-027"
                            n="20"/> of which Columbus was a part, and twice United States Senator,
                        had never married. In his youth he had had a serious love affair, but there
                        was nothing discreditable to him in the fact that it came to nothing. The
                        lady found it inconvenient to wait for him. He was too long in earning a
                        competence upon which they might subsist.</p>
                    <p>Tall, straight-shouldered, neither lean nor stout, he was to-day an imposing
                        figure. Having received his hard knocks and endured his losses, there was
                        that about him which touched and awakened the sympathies of the imaginative.
                        People thought him naturally agreeable, and his senatorial peers looked upon
                        him as not any too heavy mentally, but personally a fine man.</p>
                    <p>His presence in Columbus at this particular time was due to the fact that his
                        political fences needed careful repairing. The general election had weakened
                        his party in the State Legislature. There were enough votes to re-elect him,
                        but it would require the most careful political manipulation to hold them
                        together. Other men were ambitious. There were a half-dozen available
                        candidates, any one of whom would have rejoiced to step into his shoes. He
                        realized the exigencies of the occasion. They could not well beat him, he
                        thought; but even if this should happen, surely the President could be
                        induced to give him a ministry abroad.</p>
                    <p>Yes, he might be called a successful man, but for all that Senator Brander
                        felt that he had missed something. He had wanted to do so many things. Here
                        he was, fifty-two years of age, clean, honorable, highly distinguished, as
                        the world takes it, but single. He could not help looking about him now and
                        then and speculating upon the fact that he had no one to care for him. His
                        chamber seemed strangely hollow at timeshis own personality exceedingly
                        disagreeable.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fifty!&quot; he often thought to himself.
                        &quot;Aloneabsolutely alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sitting in his chamber that Saturday afternoon, a rap <pb id="VAA2406-028"
                            n="21"/> at his door aroused him. He had been speculating upon the
                        futility of his political energy in the light of the impermanence of life
                        and fame.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a great fight we make to sustain ourselves!&quot; he
                        thought. &quot;How little difference it will make to me a few years
                        hence!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He arose, and opening wide his door, perceived Jennie. She had come, as she
                        had suggested to her mother, at this time, instead of on Monday, in order to
                        give a more favorable impression of promptness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come right in,&quot; said the Senator; and, as on the first
                        occasion, he graciously made way for her.</p>
                    <p>Jennie passed in, momentarily expecting some compliment upon the promptitude
                        with which the washing had been done. The Senator never noticed it at all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, my young lady,&quot; he said when she had put the bundle
                        down, &quot;how do you find yourself this evening?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Jennie. &quot;We thought
                        we&apos;d better bring your clothes to-day instead of Monday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that would not have made any difference,&quot; replied
                        Brander lightly. &quot;Just leave them on the chair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie, without considering the fact that she had been offered no payment for
                        the service rendered, was about to retire, had not the Senator detained her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How is your mother?&quot; he asked pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s very well,&quot; said Jennie simply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And your little sister? Is she any better?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The doctor thinks so,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit down,&quot; he continued graciously. &quot;I want to
                        talk to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Moving to a nearby chair, the young girl seated herself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hem!&quot; he went on, clearing his throat lightly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What seems to be the matter with her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She has the measles,&quot; returned Jennie. &quot;We
                        thought once that she was going to die.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Brander studied her face as she said this, and he <pb id="VAA2406-029" n="22"
                        /> thought he saw something exceedingly pathetic there. The girl&apos;s
                        poor clothes and her wondering admiration for his exalted station in life
                        affected him. It made him feel almost ashamed of the comfort and luxury that
                        surrounded him. How high up he was in the world, indeed!</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad she is better now,&quot; he said kindly.
                        &quot;How old is your father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fifty-seven.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And is he any better?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh yes, sir; he&apos;s around now, although he can&apos;t
                        go out just yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe your mother said he was a glass-blower by
                        trade?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Brander well knew the depressed local conditions in this branch of
                        manufacture. It had been part of the political issue in the last campaign.
                        They must be in a bad way truly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do all of the children go to school?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why yes, sir,&quot; returned Jennie, stammering. She was too
                        shamefaced to own that one of the children had been obliged to leave school
                        for the lack of shoes. The utterance of the falsehood troubled her.</p>
                    <p>He reflected awhile; then realizing that he had no good excuse for further
                        detaining her, he arose and came over to her. From his pocket he took a thin
                        layer of bills, and removing one, handed it to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You take that,&quot; he said, &quot;and tell your mother
                        that I said she should use is for whatever she wants.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie accepted the money with mingled feelings; it did not occur to her to
                        look and see how much it was. The great man was so near her, the wonderful
                        chamber in which he dwelt so impressive, that she scarcely realized what she
                        was doing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. &quot;Is there any day you want
                        your washing called for?&quot; she added.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-030" n="23"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; he answered; &quot;MondayMonday
                        evenings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She went away, and in a half reverie he closed the door behind her. The
                        interest that he felt in these people was unusual. Poverty and beauty
                        certainly made up an affecting combination. He sat down in his chair and
                        gave himself over to the pleasant speculations which her coming had aroused.
                        Why should he not help them?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll find out where they live,&quot; he finally
                        resolved.</p>
                    <p>In the days that followed Jennie regularly came for the clothes. Senator
                        Brander found himself more and more interested in her, and in time he
                        managed to remove from her mind that timidity and fear which had made her
                        feel uncomfortable in his presence. One thing which helped toward this was
                        his calling her by her first name. This began with her third visit, and
                        thereafter he used it with almost unconscious frequency.</p>
                    <p>It could scarcely be said that he did this in a fatherly spirit, for he had
                        little of that attitude toward any one. He felt exceedingly young as he
                        talked to this girl, and he often wondered whether it were not possible for
                        her to perceive and appreciate him on his youthful side.</p>
                    <p>As for Jennie, she was immensely taken with the comfort and luxury
                        surrounding this man, and subconsciously with the man himself, the most
                        attractive she had ever known. Everything he had was fine, everything he did
                        was gentle, distinguished, and considerate. From some far source, perhaps
                        some old German ancestors, she had inherited an understanding and
                        appreciation of all this. Life ought to be lived as he lived it; the
                        privilege of being generous particularly appealed to her.</p>
                    <p>Part of her attitude was due to that of her mother, in whose mind sympathy
                        was always a more potent factor than reason. For instance, when she brought
                        to her the ten dollars Mrs. Gerhardt was transported with joy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Jennie, &quot;I didn&apos;t know until I
                        got outside <pb id="VAA2406-031" n="24"/> that it was so much. He said I
                        should give it to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt took it, and holding it loosely in her folded hands, saw
                        distinctly before her the tall Senator with his fine manners.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a fine man he is!&quot; she said. &quot;He has a good
                        heart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Frequently throughout the evening and the next day Mrs. Gerhardt commented
                        upon this wonderful treasuretrove, repeating again and again how good he
                        must be or how large must be his heart. When it came to washing his clothes
                        she almost rubbed them to pieces, feeling that whatever she did she could
                        scarcely do enough. Gerhardt was not to know. He had such stern views about
                        accepting money without earning it that even in their distress, she would
                        have experienced some difficulty in getting him to take it. Consequently she
                        said nothing, but used it to buy bread and meat, and going as it did such a
                        little way, the sudden windfall was never noticed.</p>
                    <p>Jennie, from now on, reflected this attitude toward the Senator, and, feeling
                        so grateful toward him, she began to talk more freely. They came to be on
                        such good terms that he gave her a little leather picture-case from his
                        dresser which he had observed her admiring. Every time she came he found
                        excuse to detain her, and soon discovered that, for all her soft
                        girlishness, there lay deep-seated in her a conscious deprecation of poverty
                        and a shame of having to own any need. He honestly admired her for this,
                        and, seeing that her clothes were poor and her shoes worn, he began to
                        wonder how he could help her without offending.</p>
                    <p>Not infrequently he thought to follow her some evening, and see for himself
                        what the condition of the family might be. He was a United States Senator,
                        however. The neighborhood they lived in must be very poor. He stopped to
                        consider, and for the time the counsels of <pb id="VAA2406-032" n="25"/>
                        prudence prevailed. Consequently the visit was put off.</p>
                    <p>Early in December Senator Brander returned to Washington for three weeks, and
                        both Mrs. Gerhardt and Jennie were surprised to learn one day that he had
                        gone. Never had he given them less than two dollars a week for his washing,
                        and several times it had been five. He had not realized, perhaps, what a
                        breach his absence would make in their finances. But there was nothing to do
                        about it; they managed to pinch along. Gerhardt, now better, searched for
                        work at the various mills, and finding nothing, procured a saw-buck and saw,
                        and going from door to door, sought for the privilege of sawing wood. There
                        was not a great deal of this to do, but he managed, by the most earnest
                        labor to earn two, and sometimes three, dollars a week. This added to what
                        his wife earned and what Sebastian gave was enough to keep bread in their
                        mouths, but scarcely more.</p>
                    <p>It was at the opening of the joyous Christmas-time that the bitterness of
                        their poverty affected them most. The Germans love to make a great display
                        at Christmas. It is the one season of the year when the fullness of their
                        large family affection manifests itself. Warm in the appreciation of the
                        joys of childhood, they love to see the little ones enjoy their toys and
                        games. Father Gerhardt at his saw-buck during the weeks before Christmas
                        thought of this very often. What would little Veronica not deserve after her
                        long illness! How he would have liked to give each of the children a stout
                        pair of shoes, the boys a warm cap, the girls a pretty hood. Toys and games
                        and candy they always had had before. He hated to think of the snow-covered
                        Christmas morning and no table richly piled with what their young hearts
                        would most desire.</p>
                    <p>As for Mrs. Gerhardt, one could better imagine than describe her feelings.
                        She felt so keenly about it that she could hardly bring herself to speak of
                        the dreaded <pb id="VAA2406-033" n="26"/> that it was
                        <unclear>-usband</unclear> She had managed to lay aside you.&quot;
                            <unclear>--ars</unclear> in the hope of getting enough to buy a ton of
                        coal, and so put an end to poor George&apos;s daily pilgrimage to the
                        coal yard, but now as the Christmas week drew near she decided to use it for
                        gifts. Father Gerhardt was also secreting two dollars without the knowledge
                        of his wife, thinking that on Christmas Eve he could produce it at a
                        critical moment, and so relieve her maternal anxiety.</p>
                    <p>When the actual time arrived, however, there was very little to be said for
                        the comfort that they got out of the occasion. The whole city was rife with
                        Christmas atmosphere. Grocery stores and meat markets were strung with
                        holly. The toy shops and candy stores were radiant with fine displays of
                        everything that a self-respecting Santa Claus should have about him. Both
                        parents and children observed it allthe former with serious thoughts of need
                        and anxiety, the latter with wild fancy and only partially suppressed
                        longings.</p>
                    <p>Frequently had Gerhardt said in their presence:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kriss Kringle is very poor this year. He hasn&apos;t so very
                        much to give.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But no child, however poverty-stricken, could be made to believe this. Every
                        time after so saying he looked into their eyes, but in spite of the warning,
                        expectation flamed in them undiminished.</p>
                    <p>Christmas coming on Tuesday, the Monday before there was no school. Before
                        going to the hotel Mrs. Gerhardt had cautioned George that he must bring
                        enough coal from the yards to last over Christmas day. The latter went at
                        once with his two younger sisters, but there being a dearth of good picking,
                        it took them a long time to fill their baskets, and by night they had
                        gathered only a scanty supply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you go for the coal?&quot; asked Mrs. Gerhardt the first
                        thing when she returned from the hotel that evening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said George.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-034" n="27"/>
                    <p>&quot;Did you get enough for to-morrow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;I guess so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, I&apos;ll go and look,&quot; she replied. Taking
                        the lamp, they went out into the woodshed where the coal was deposited.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, my!&quot; she exclaimed when she saw it; &quot;why,
                        that isn&apos;t near enough. You must go right off and get some
                        more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said George, pouting his lips, &quot; I
                        don&apos;t want to go. Let Bass go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bass, who had returned promptly at a quarter past six, was already busy in
                        the back bedroom washing and dressing preparatory to going down-town.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt. &quot;Bass has worked hard
                        all day. You must go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to,&quot; pouted George.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt, &quot;maybe to-morrow
                        you&apos;ll be without a fire, and then what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>They went back to the house, but George&apos;s conscience was too
                        troubled to allow him to consider the case as closed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bass, you come, too,&quot; he called to his elder brother when
                        he was inside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go where?&quot; said Bass.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To get some coal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the former, &quot;I guess not. What do you
                        take me for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, I&apos;ll not,&quot; said George, with an
                        obstinate jerk of his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you get it up this afternoon?&quot;
                        questioned his brother sharply; &quot;you&apos;ve had all day to do
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, I did try,&quot; said George. &quot;We
                        couldn&apos;t find enough. I can&apos;t get any when there
                        ain&apos;t any, can I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess you didn&apos;t try very hard,&quot; said the
                        dandy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter now?&quot; asked Jennie, who, coming
                        in after having stopped at the grocer&apos;s for her mother, saw George
                        with a solemn pout on his face.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-035" n="28"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Bass won&apos;t go with me to get any coal?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you get any this afternoon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said George, &quot;but ma says I didn&apos;t
                        get enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll go with you,&quot; said his sister.
                        &quot;Bass, will you come along?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the young man, indifferently, &quot;I
                        won&apos;t.&quot; He was adjusting his necktie and felt irritated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There ain&apos;t any,&quot; said George, &quot;unless
                        we get it off the cars. There wasn&apos;t any cars where I
                        was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are, too,&quot; exclaimed Bass.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There ain&apos;t,&quot; said George.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, don&apos;t quarrel,&quot; said Jennie. &quot;Get
                        the baskets and let&apos;s go right now before it gets too
                        late.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The other children, who had a fondness for their big sister, got out the
                        implements of supplyVeronica a basket, Martha and William buckets, and
                        George, a big clothes-basket, which he and Jennie were to fill and carry
                        between them. Bass, moved by his sister&apos;s willingness and the
                        little regard he still maintained for her, now made a suggestion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll tell you what you do, Jen,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;You go over there with the kids to Eighth Street and wait around
                        those cars. I&apos;ll be along in a minute. When I come by
                        don&apos;t any of you pretend to know me. Just you say,
                        &apos;Mister, won&apos;t you please throw us some coal
                        down?&apos; and then I&apos;ll get up on the cars and pitch off
                        enough to fill the baskets. D&apos;ye understand?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Jennie, very much pleased.</p>
                    <p>Out into the snowy night they went, and made their way to the railroad
                        tracks. At the intersection of the street and the broad railroad yard were
                        many heavily laden cars of bituminous coal newly backed in. All of the
                        children gathered within the shadow of one. While they were standing there,
                        waiting the arrival of their brother, the Washington Special arrived, a
                        long, fine train with several of the new style drawing-room cars, the big
                        plate-glass windows shining and the passengers <pb id="VAA2406-036" n="29"/>
                        looking out from the depths of their comfortable chairs. The children
                        instinctively drew back as it thundered past.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, wasn&apos;t it long?&quot; said George.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wouldn&apos;t I like to be a brakeman, though,&quot; sighed
                        William.</p>
                    <p>Jennie, alone, kept silent, but to her particularly the suggestion of travel
                        and comfort had appealed. How beautiful life must be for the rich!</p>
                    <p>Sebastian now appeared in the distance, a mannish spring in his stride, and
                        with every evidence that he took himself seriously. He was of that peculiar
                        stubbornness and determination that had the children failed to carry out his
                        plan of procedure he would have gone deliberately by and refused to help
                        them at all.</p>
                    <p>Martha, however, took the situation as it needed to be taken, and piped out
                        childishly, &quot;Mister, won&apos;t you please throw us down some
                        coal?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sebastian stopped abruptly, and looking sharply at them as though he were
                        really a stranger, exclaimed, &quot;Why, certainly,&quot; and
                        proceeded to climb up on the car, from whence he cast down with remarkable
                        celerity more than enough chunks to fill their baskets. Then as though not
                        caring to linger any longer amid such plebeian company, he hastened across
                        the network of tracks and was lost to view.</p>
                    <p>On their way home they encountered another gentleman, this time a real one,
                        with high hat and distinguished cape coat, whom Jennie immediately
                        recognized. This was the honorable Senator himself, newly returned from
                        Washington, and anticipating a very unprofitable Christmas. He had arrived
                        upon the express which had enlisted the attention of the children, and was
                        carrying his light grip for the pleasure of it to the hotel. As he passed he
                        thought that he recognized Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that you, Jennie?&quot; he said, and paused to be more
                        certain.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-037" n="30"/>
                    <p>The latter, who had discovered him even more quickly than he had her,
                        exclaimed, &quot;Oh, there is Mr. Brander!&quot; Then, dropping her
                        end of the basket, with a caution to the children to take it right home, she
                        hurried away in the opposite direction.</p>
                    <p>The Senator followed, vainly calling three or four times &quot;Jennie!
                        Jennie!&quot; Losing hope of overtaking her, and suddenly recognizing,
                        and thereupon respecting, her simple, girlish shame, he stopped, and turning
                        back, decided to follow the children. Again he felt that same sensation
                        which he seemed always to get from this girlthe far cry between her estate
                        and his. It was something to be a Senator to-night, here where these
                        children were picking coal. What could the joyous holiday of the morrow hold
                        for them? He tramped along sympathetically, an honest lightness coming into
                        his step, and soon he saw them enter the gateway of the low cottage.
                        Crossing the street, he stood in the weak shade of the snow-laden trees. The
                        light was burning with a yellow glow in a rear window. All about was the
                        white snow. In the woodshed he could hear the voices of the children, and
                        once he thought he detected the form of Mrs. Gerhardt. After a time another
                        form came shadowlike through the side gate. He knew who it was. It touched
                        him to the quick, and he bit his lip sharply to suppress any further show of
                        emotion. Then he turned vigorously on his heel and walked away.</p>
                    <p>The chief grocery of the city was conducted by one Manning, a stanch adherent
                        of Brander, and one who felt honored by the Senator&apos;s acquaintance.
                        To him at his busy desk came the Senator this same night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Manning,&quot; he said, &quot;could I get you to undertake
                        a little work for me this evening?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, certainly, Senator, certainly,&quot; said the groceryman.
                        &quot;When did you get back? Glad to see you. Certainly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to get everything together that would <pb

                    <p>&quot;Certainly, certainly, Senator.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind the cost now. Send plenty of everything. I&apos;ll
                        give you the address,&quot; and he picked up a note-book to write it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I&apos;ll be delighted, Senator,&quot; went on Mr.
                        Manning, rather affected himself. &quot;I&apos;ll be delighted. You
                        always were generous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here you are, Manning,&quot; said the Senator, grimly, from the
                        mere necessity of preserving his senatorial dignity. &quot;Send
                        everything at once, and the bill to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be delighted,&quot; was all the astonished and
                        approving grocery-man could say.</p>
                    <p>The Senator passed out, but remembering the old people, visited a clothier
                        and shoe man, and, finding that he could only guess at what sizes might be
                        required, ordered the several articles with the privilege of exchange. When
                        his labors were over, he returned to his room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carrying coal,&quot; he thought, over and over.
                        &quot;Really, it was very thoughtless in me. I mustn&apos;t forget
                        them any more.&quot;</p>

                    <p>THE desire to flee which Jennie experienced upon seeing the Senator again was
                        attributable to what she considered the disgrace of her position. She was
                        ashamed to think that he, who thought so well of her, should discover her
                        doing so common a thing. Girllike, she was inclined to imagine that his
                        interest in her depended upon something else than her mere personality.</p>
                    <p>When she reached home Mrs. Gerhardt had heard of her flight from the other
                        children.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What was the matter with you, anyhow?&quot; asked George, when
                        she came in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; she answered, but immediately turned to her
                        mother and said, &quot;Mr. Brander came by and saw us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, did he?&quot; softly exclaimed her mother.
                        &quot;He&apos;s back then. What made you run, though, you foolish
                        girl?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I didn&apos;t want him to see me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, maybe he didn&apos;t know you, anyhow,&quot; she
                        said, with a certain sympathy for her daughter&apos;s predicament.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh yes, he did, too,&quot; whispered Jennie. &quot;He
                        called after me three or four times.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; said Gerhardt, who had been hearing the
                        conversation from the adjoining room, and now came out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; said the mother, who hated to explain the
                        significance which the Senator&apos;s personality had come to have in
                        their lives. &quot;A man frightened them when they were bringing the
                        coal.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-040" n="33"/>
                    <p>The arrival of the Christmas presents later in the evening threw the
                        household into an uproar of excitement. Neither Gerhardt nor the mother
                        could believe their eyes when a grocery wagon halted in front of their
                        cottage and a lusty clerk began to carry in the gifts. After failing to
                        persuade the clerk that he had made a mistake, the large assortment of good
                        things was looked over with very human glee.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just you never mind,&quot; was the clerk&apos;s
                        authoritative words. &quot;I know what I&apos;m about. Gerhardt,
                        isn&apos;t it? Well, you&apos;re the people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt moved about, rubbing her hands in her excitement, and giving
                        vent to an occasional &quot;Well, isn&apos;t that nice
                        now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt himself was melted at the thought of the generosity of the unknown
                        benefactor, and was inclined to lay it all to the goodness of a great local
                        mill owner, who knew him and wished him well. Mrs. Gerhardt tearfully
                        suspected the source, but said nothing. Jennie knew, by instinct, the author
                        of it all.</p>
                    <p>The afternoon of the day after Christmas Brander encountered the mother in
                        the hotel, Jennie having been left at home to look after the house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you do, Mrs. Gerhardt,&quot; he exclaimed genially
                        extending his hand. &quot;How did you enjoy your Christmas?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Poor Mrs. Gerhardt took it nervously; her eyes filled rapidly with tears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There, there,&quot; he said, patting her on the shoulder.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t cry. You mustn&apos;t forget to get my laundry
                        to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh no, sir,&quot; she returned, and would have said more had he
                        not walked away.</p>
                    <p>From this on, Gerhardt heard continually of the fine Senator at the hotel,
                        how pleasant he was, and how much he paid for his washing. With the
                        simplicity of a German workingman, he was easily persuaded that <pb
                            id="VAA2406-041" n="34"/> Mr. Brander must be a very great and a very
                        good man.</p>
                    <p>Jennie, whose feelings needed no encouragement in this direction, was more
                        than ever prejudiced in his favor.</p>
                    <p>There was developing in her that perfection of womanhood, the full mold of
                        form, which could not help but attract any man. Already she was well built,
                        and tall for a girl. Had she been dressed in the trailing skirts of a woman
                        of fashion she would have made a fitting companion for a man the height of
                        the Senator. Her eyes were wondrously clear and bright, her skin fair, and
                        her teeth white and even. She was clever, too, in a sensible way, and by no
                        means deficient in observation. All that she lacked was training and the
                        assurance of which the knowledge of utter dependency despoils one. But the
                        carrying of washing and the compulsion to acknowledge almost anything as a
                        favor put her at a disadvantage.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays when she came to the hotel upon her semiweekly errand Senator
                        Brander took her presence with easy grace, and to this she responded. He
                        often gave her little presents for herself, or for her brothers and sisters,
                        and he talked to her so unaffectedly that finally the overawing sense of the
                        great difference between them was brushed away, and she looked upon him more
                        as a generous friend than as a distinguished Senator. He asked her once how
                        she would like to go to a seminary, thinking all the while how attractive
                        she would be when she came out. Finally, one evening, he called her to his
                        side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come over here, Jennie,&quot; he said, &quot;and stand by
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She came, and, moved by a sudden impulse, he took her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Jennie,&quot; he said, studying her face in a quizzical,
                        interrogative way, &quot;what do you think of me, anyhow?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-042" n="35"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she answered, looking consciously away, &quot;I
                        don&apos;t know. What makes you ask me that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh yes, you do,&quot; he returned. &quot;You have some
                        opinion of me. Tell me now, what is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I haven&apos;t,&quot; she said, innocently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh yes, you have,&quot; he went on, pleasantly, interested by
                        her transparent evasiveness. &quot;You must think something of me. Now,
                        what is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mean do I like you?&quot; she asked, frankly, looking
                        down at the big mop of black hair well streaked with gray which hung about
                        his forehead, and gave an almost lionine cast to his fine face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, yes,&quot; he said, with a sense of disappointment. She
                        was barren of the art of the coquette.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why of course I like you,&quot; she replied, prettily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t you ever thought anything else about me?&quot;
                        he went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think you&apos;re very kind,&quot; she went on, even more
                        bashfully; she realized now that he was still holding her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that all?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, with fluttering eyelids,
                        &quot;isn&apos;t that enough?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her, and the playful, companionable directness of her answering
                        gaze thrilled him through and through. He studied her face in silence while
                        she turned and twisted, feeling, but scarcely understanding, the deep import
                        of his scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said at last, &quot;I think you&apos;re
                        a fine girl. Don&apos;t you think I&apos;m a pretty nice
                        man?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jennie, promptly.</p>
                    <p>He leaned back in his chair and laughed at the unconscious drollery of her
                        reply. She looked at him curiously, and smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What made you laugh?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, your answer&quot; he returned. &quot;I really ought not
                            <pb id="VAA2406-043" n="36"/> to laugh, though. You don&apos;t
                        appreciate me in the least. I don&apos;t believe you like me at
                        all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I do, though,&quot; she replied, earnestly. &quot;I
                        think you&apos;re so good.&quot; Her eyes showed very plainly that
                        she felt what she was saying.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, drawing her gently down to him; then, at
                        the same instant, he pressed his lips to her cheek.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried, straightening up, at once startled and
                        frightened.</p>
                    <p>It was a new note in their relationship. The senatorial quality vanished in
                        an instant. She recognized in him something that she had not felt before. He
                        seemed younger, too. She was a woman to him, and he was playing the part of
                        a lover. She hesitated, but not knowing just what to do, did nothing at all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;did I frighten you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him, but moved by her underlying respect for this great man,
                        she said, with a smile, &quot;Yes, you did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did it because I like you so much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She meditated upon this a moment, and then said, &quot;I think
                        I&apos;d better be going.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now then,&quot; he pleaded, &quot;are you going to run away
                        because of that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said, moved by a curious feeling of ingratitude;
                        &quot;but I ought to be going. They&apos;ll be wondering where I
                        am.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re sure you&apos;re not angry about it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied, and with more of a womanly air than she
                        had ever shown before. It was a novel experience to be in so authoritative a
                        position. It was so remarkable that it was somewhat confusing to both of
                        them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re my girl, anyhow,&quot; the Senator said,
                        rising. &quot;I&apos;m going to take care of you in the
                        future.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie heard this, and it pleased her. He was so well <pb id="VAA2406-044"
                            n="37"/> fitted, she thought, to do wondrous things; he was nothing less
                        than a veritable magician. She looked about her, and the thought of coming
                        into such a life and such an atmosphere was heavenly. Not that she fully
                        understood his meaning, however. He meant to be good and generous, and to
                        give her fine things. Naturally she was happy. She took up the package that
                        she had come for, not seeing or feeling the incongruity of her position,
                        while he felt it as a direct reproof.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She ought not to carry that,&quot; he thought. A great wave of
                        sympathy swept over him. He took her cheeks between his hands, this time in
                        a superior and more generous way. &quot;Never mind, little
                        girl,&quot; he said. &quot;You won&apos;t have to do this
                        always. I&apos;ll see what I can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The outcome of this was simply a more sympathetic relationship between them.
                        He did not hesitate to ask her to sit beside him on the arm of his chair the
                        next time she came, and to question her intimately about the
                        family&apos;s condition and her own desires. Several times he noticed
                        that she was evading his questions, particularly in regard to what her
                        father was doing. She was ashamed to own that he was sawing wood. Fearing
                        lest something more serious was impending, he decided to go out some day and
                        see for himself.</p>
                    <p>This he did when a convenient morning presented itself and his other duties
                        did not press upon him. It was three days before the great fight in the
                        Legislature began which ended in his defeat. Nothing could be done in these
                        few remaining days. So he took his cane and strolled forth, coming to the
                        cottage in the course of a half hour, and knocked boldly at the door.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt opened it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-morning,&quot; he said, cheerily; then, seeing her
                        hesitate, he added, &quot;May I come in?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The good mother, who was all but overcome by his astonishing presence, wiped
                        her hands furtively upon <pb id="VAA2406-045" n="38"/> her much-mended
                        apron, and, seeing that he waited for a reply, said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh yes. Come right in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hurried forward, forgetting to close the door, and, offering him a chair,
                        asked him to be seated.</p>
                    <p>Brander, feeling sorry that he was the occasion of so much confusion, said:
                        &quot;Don&apos;t trouble yourself, Mrs. Gerhardt. I was passing and
                        thought I&apos;d come in. How is your husband?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s well, thank you,&quot; returned the mother.
                        &quot;He&apos;s out working to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then he has found employment?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt, who hesitated, like Jennie,
                        to say what it was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The children are all well now, and in school, I hope?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Mrs. Gerhardt. She had now unfastened her
                        apron, and was nervously turning it in her lap.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s good, and where is Jennie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The latter, who had been ironing, had abandoned the board and had concealed
                        herself in the bedroom, where she was busy tidying herself in the fear that
                        her mother would not have the forethought to say that she was out, and so
                        let her have a chance for escape.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s here,&quot; returned the mother.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll call her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you tell him I was here for?&quot; said Jennie,
                        weakly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What could I do?&quot; asked the mother.</p>
                    <p>Together they hesitated while the Senator surveyed the room. He felt sorry to
                        think that such deserving people must suffer so; he intended, in a vague
                        way, to ameliorate their condition if possible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-morning,&quot; the Senator said to Jennie, when finally
                        she came hesitatingly into the room. &quot;How do you do
                        to-day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie came forward, extending her hand and blushing. She found herself so
                        much disturbed by this visit that she could hardly find tongue to answer his
                        questions.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-046" n="39"/>
                    <p>&quot;I thought,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;d come out and
                        find where you live. This is a quite comfortable house. How many rooms have
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Five,&quot; said Jennie. &quot;You&apos;ll have to
                        excuse the looks this morning. We&apos;ve been ironing, and
                        it&apos;s all upset.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Brander, gently. &quot;Don&apos;t
                        you think I understand, Jennie? You mustn&apos;t feel nervous about
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She noticed the comforting, personal tone he always used with her when she
                        was at his room, and it helped to subdue her flustered senses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t think it anything if I come here occasionally.
                        I intend to come. I want to meet your father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Jennie, &quot;he&apos;s out
                        to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>While they were talking, however, the honest woodcutter was coming in at the
                        gate with his buck and saw. Brander saw him, and at once recognized him by a
                        slight resemblance to his daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There he is now, I believe,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, is he?&quot; said Jennie, looking out.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt, who was given to speculation these days, passed by the window
                        without looking up. He put his wooden buck down, and, hanging his saw on a
                        nail on the side of the house, came in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother,&quot; he called, in German, and, then not seeing her,
                        he came to the door of the front room and looked in.</p>
                    <p>Brander arose and extended his hand. The knotted and weather-beaten German
                        came forward, and took it with a very questioning expression of countenance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is my father, Mr. Brander,&quot; said Jennie, all her
                        diffidence dissolved by sympathy. &quot;This is the gentleman from the
                        hotel, papa, Mr. Brander.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the name?&quot; said the German, turning his
                        head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Brander,&quot; said the Senator.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; he said, with a considerable German accent.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-047" n="40"/>
                    <p>&quot;Since I had the fever I don&apos;t hear good. My wife, she
                        spoke to me of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Senator, &quot;I thought I&apos;d
                        come out and make your acquaintance. You have quite a family.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the father, who was conscious of his very poor
                        garments and anxious to get away. &quot;I have six childrenall young.
                        She&apos;s the oldest girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt now came back, and Gerhardt, seeing his chance, said hurriedly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;ll go. I broke my
                        saw, and so I had to stop work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Brander, graciously, realizing now why
                        Jennie had never wanted to explain. He half wished that she were courageous
                        enough not to conceal anything.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Mrs. Gerhardt,&quot; he said, when the mother was stiffly
                        seated, &quot;I want to tell you that you mustn&apos;t look on me as
                        a stranger. Hereafter I want you to keep me informed of how things are going
                        with you. Jennie won&apos;t always do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie smiled quietly. Mrs. Gerhardt only rubbed her hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered, humbly grateful.</p>
                    <p>They talked for a few minutes, and then the Senator rose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell your husband,&quot; he said, &quot;to come and see me
                        next Monday at my office in the hotel. I want to do something for
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; faltered Mrs. Gerhardt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not stay any longer now,&quot; he added.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t forget to have him come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;ll come,&quot; she returned.</p>
                    <p>Adjusting a glove on one hand, he extended the other to Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here is your finest treasure, Mrs. Gerhardt,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I think I&apos;ll take her.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-048" n="[41]"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know,&quot; said her mother,
                        &quot;whether I could spare her or not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the Senator, going toward the door, and giving
                        Mrs. Gerhardt his hand, &quot;good-morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He nodded and walked out, while a half-dozen neighbors, who had observed his
                        entrance, peeked from behind curtains and drawn blinds at the astonishing
                        sight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who can that be, anyhow&quot; was the general query.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See what he gave me,&quot; said the innocent mother to her
                        daughter the moment he had closed the door.</p>
                    <p>It was a ten-dollar bill. He had placed it softly in her hand as he said
                        good-by.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER V</head>
                    <p>HAVING been led by circumstances into an attitude of obligation toward the
                        Senator, it was not unnatural that Jennie should become imbued with a most
                        generous spirit of appreciation for everything he had done and now continued
                        to do. The Senator gave her father a letter to a local mill owner, who saw
                        that he received something to do. It was not much, to be sure, a mere job as
                        night-watchman, but it helped, and old Gerhardt&apos;s gratitude was
                        extravagant. Never was there such a great, such a good man!</p>
                    <p>Nor was Mrs. Gerhardt overlooked. Once Brander sent her a dress, and at
                        another time a shawl. All these benefactions were made in a spirit of
                        mingled charity and self-gratification, but to Mrs. Gerhardt they glowed
                        with but one motive. Senator Brander was good-hearted.</p>
                    <p>As for Jennie, he drew nearer to her in every possible way, so that at last
                        she came to see him in a light which would require considerable analysis to
                        make clear. This fresh, young soul, however, had too much innocence and
                        buoyancy to consider for a moment the world&apos;s point of view. Since
                        that one notable and halcyon visit upon which he had robbed her of her
                        original shyness, and implanted a tender kiss upon her cheek, they had lived
                        in a different atmosphere. Jennie was his companion now, and as he more and
                        more unbended, and even joyously flung aside the habiliments of his dignity,
                        her perception of him grew clearer. They laughed and chatted in a natural
                        way, and he keenly enjoyed this new entrance into the radiant world of
                        youthful happiness.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-050" n="43"/>
                    <p>One thing that disturbed him, however, was the occasional thought, which he
                        could not repress, that he was not doing right. Other people must soon
                        discover that he was not confining himself strictly to conventional
                        relations with this washer-woman&apos;s daughter. He suspected that the
                        housekeeper was not without knowledge that Jennie almost invariably lingered
                        from a quarter to three-quarters of an hour whenever she came for or
                        returned his laundry. He knew that it might come to the ears of the hotel
                        clerks, and so, in a general way, get about town and work serious injury,
                        but the reflection did not cause him to modify his conduct. Sometimes he
                        consoled himself with the thought that he was not doing her any actual harm,
                        and at other times he would argue that he could not put this one delightful
                        tenderness out of his life. Did he not wish honestly to do her much good?</p>
                    <p>He thought of these things occasionally, and decided that he could not stop.
                        The self-approval which such a resolution might bring him was hardly worth
                        the inevitable pain of the abnegation. He had not so very many more years to
                        live. Why die unsatisfied?</p>
                    <p>One evening he put his arm around her and strained her to his breast. Another
                        time he drew her to his knee, and told her of his life at Washington. Always
                        now he had a caress and a kiss for her, but it was still in a tentative,
                        uncertain way. He did not want to reach for her soul too deeply.</p>
                    <p>Jennie enjoyed it all innocently. Elements of fancy and novelty entered into
                        her life. She was an unsophisticated <unclear>crea-ure</unclear>, emotional,
                        totally inexperienced in the matter of the affections, and yet mature enough
                        mentally to enjoy the attentions of this great man who had thus bowed from
                        his high position to make friends with her.</p>
                    <p>One evening she pushed his hair back from his forehead as she stood by his
                        chair, and, finding nothing else <pb id="VAA2406-051" n="44"/> to do, took
                        out his watch. The great man thrilled as he looked at her pretty innocence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you like to have a watch, too?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed, I would,&quot; said Jennie, with a deep breath.</p>
                    <p>The next day he stopped as he was passing a jewelry store and bought one. It
                        was gold, and had pretty ornamented hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jennie,&quot; he said, when she came the next time, &quot;I
                        want to show you something. See what time it is by my watch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie drew out the watch from his waistcoat pocket and started in surprise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This isn&apos;t your watch!&quot; she exclaimed, her face
                        full of innocent wonder.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, delighted with his little deception.
                        &quot;It&apos;s yours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mine!&quot; exclaimed Jennie. &quot;Mine! Oh,
                        isn&apos;t it lovely!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think so?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Her delight touched and pleased him immensely. Her face shone with light and
                        her eyes fairly danced.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s yours,&quot; he said. &quot;See that you
                        wear it now, and don&apos;t lose it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re so good!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, but he held her at arm&apos;s length by
                        the waist, to make up his mind what his reward should be. Slowly he drew her
                        toward him until, when very close, she put her arms about his neck, and laid
                        her cheek in gratitude against his own. This was the quintessence of
                        pleasure for him. He felt as he had been <unclear>l-ging</unclear> to feel
                        for years.</p>
                    <p>The progress of his idyl suffered a check when the great senatorial fight
                        came on in the Legislature. Attacked by a combination of rivals, Brander was
                        given the fight of his life. To his amazement he discovered that a great
                        railroad corporation, which had always beer <pb id="VAA2406-052" n="45"/>
                        friendly, was secretly throwing its strength in behalf of an already too
                        powerful candidate. Shocked by this defection, he was thrown alternately
                        into the deepest gloom and into paroxysms of wrath. These slings of fortune,
                        however lightly he pretended to receive them, never failed to lacerate him.
                        It had been long since he had suffered a defeattoo long.</p>
                    <p>During this period Jennie received her earliest lesson in the vagaries of
                        men. For two weeks she did not even see him, and one evening, after an
                        extremely comfortless conference with his leader, he met her with the most
                        chilling formality. When she knocked at his door he only troubled to open it
                        a foot, exclaiming almost harshly: &quot;I can&apos;t bother about
                        the clothes to-night. Come tomorrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie retreated, shocked and surprised by this reception. She did not know
                        what to think of it. He was restored on the instant to his far-off, mighty
                        throne, and left to rule in peace. Why should he not withdraw the light of
                        his countenance if it pleased him. But why</p>
                    <p>A day or two later he repented mildly, but had no time to readjust matters.
                        His washing was taken and delivered with considerable formality, and he went
                        on toiling forgetfully, until at last he was miserably defeated by two
                        votes. Astounded by this result, he lapsed into gloomy dejection of soul.
                        What was he to do now?</p>
                    <p>Into this atmosphere came Jennie, bringing with her the lightness and comfort
                        of her own hopeful disposition. Nagged to desperation by his thoughts,
                        Brander first talked to her to amuse himself; but soon his distress
                        imperceptibly took flight; he found himself actually smiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, Jennie,&quot; he said, speaking to her as he might have
                        done to a child, &quot;youth is on your side. You possess the most
                        valuable thing in life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but you don&apos;t realize it. You never will until it is
                        too late.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-053" n="46"/>
                    <p>&quot;I love that girl,&quot; he thought to himself that night.
                        &quot;I wish I could have her with me always.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But fortune had another fling for him to endure. It got about the hotel that
                        Jennie was, to use the mildest expression, conducting herself strangely. A
                        girl who carries washing must expect criticism if anything not befitting her
                        station is observed in her apparel. Jennie was seen wearing the gold watch.
                        Her mother was informed by the housekeeper of the state of things.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I&apos;d speak to you about it,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;People are talking. You&apos;d better not let your daughter go
                        to his room for the laundry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt was too astonished and hurt for utterance. Jennie had told her
                        nothing, but even now she did not believe there was anything to tell. The
                        watch had been both approved of and admired by her. She had not thought that
                        it was endangering her daughter&apos;s reputation.</p>
                    <p>Going home she worried almost incessantly, and talked with Jennie about it.
                        The latter did not admit the implication that things had gone too far. In
                        fact, she did not look at it in that light. She did not own, it is true,
                        what really had happened while she was visiting the Senator.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s so terrible that people should begin to
                        talk!&quot; said her mother. &quot;Did you really stay so long in
                        the room?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; returned Jennie, compelled by her
                        conscience to admit at least part of the truth. &quot;Perhaps I
                        did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He has never said anything out of the way to you, has he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; answered her daughter, who did not attach any
                        suspicion of evil to what had passed between them.</p>
                    <p>If the mother had only gone a little bit further she might have learned more,
                        but she was only too glad, for her own peace of mind, to hush the matter up.
                        People <pb id="VAA2406-054" n="47"/> were slandering a good man, that she
                        knew. Jennie had been the least bit indiscreet. People were always so ready
                        to talk. How could the poor girl, amid such unfortunate circumstances, do
                        otherwise than she did. It made her cry to think of it.</p>
                    <p>The result of it all was that she decided to get the washing herself.</p>
                    <p>She came to his door the next Monday after this decision. Brander, who was
                        expecting Jennie, was both surprised and disappointed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why,&quot; he said to her, &quot;what has become of
                        Jennie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Having hoped that he would not notice, or, at least, not comment upon the
                        change, Mrs. Gerhardt did not know what to say. She looked up at him weakly
                        in her innocent, motherly way, and said, &quot;She couldn&apos;t
                        come to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not ill, is she?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad to hear that,&quot; he said resignedly.
                        &quot;How have you been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt answered his kindly inquiries and departed. After she had gone
                        he got to thinking the matter over, and wondered what could have happened.
                        It seemed rather odd that he should be wondering over it.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday, however, when she returned the clothes he felt that there must
                        be something wrong.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter, Mrs. Gerhardt?&quot; he inquired.
                        &quot;Has anything happened to your daughter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; she returned, too troubled to wish to deceive
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t she coming for the laundry any more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;II&quot; ventured the mother, stammering in her perturbation;
                        &quot;shethey have been talking about her,&quot; she at last forced
                        herself to say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who has been talking?&quot; he asked gravely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The people here in the hotel.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-055" n="48"/>
                    <p>&quot;Who, what people?&quot; he interrupted, a touch of annoyance
                        showing in his voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The housekeeper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The housekeeper, eh!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;What has she
                        got to say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The mother related to him her experience.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And she told you that, did she?&quot; he remarked in wrath.
                        &quot;She ventures to trouble herself about my affairs, does she? I
                        wonder people can&apos;t mind their own business without interfering
                        with mine. Your daughter, Mrs. Gerhardt, is perfectly safe with me. I have
                        no intention of doing her an injury. It&apos;s a shame,&quot; he
                        added indignantly, &quot;that a girl can&apos;t come to my room in
                        this hotel without having her motive questioned. I&apos;ll look into
                        this matter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope you don&apos;t think that I have anything to do with
                        it,&quot; said the mother apologetically. &quot;I know you like
                        Jennie and wouldn&apos;t injure her. You&apos;ve done so much for
                        her and all of us, Mr. Brander, I feel ashamed to keep her away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all right, Mrs. Gerhardt,&quot; he said
                        quietly. &quot;You did perfectly right. I don&apos;t blame you in
                        the least. It is the lying accusation passed about in this hotel that I
                        object to. We&apos;ll see about that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt stood there, pale with excitement. She was afraid she had
                        deeply offended this man who had done so much for them. If she could only
                        say something, she thought, that would clear this matter up and make him
                        feel that she was no tattler. Scandal was distressing to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I was doing everything for the best,&quot; she said
                        at last.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you were,&quot; he replied. &quot;I like Jennie very
                        much. I have always enjoyed her coming here. It is my intention to do well
                        by her, but perhaps it will be better to keep her away, at least for the
                        present.</p>
                    <p>Again that evening the Senator sat in his easy-chair <pb id="VAA2406-056"
                            n="49"/> and brooded over this new development. Jennie was really much
                        more precious to him than he had thought. Now that he had no hope of seeing
                        her there any more, he began to realize how much these little visits of hers
                        had meant. He thought the matter over very carefully, realized instantly
                        that there was nothing to be done so far as the hotel gossip was concerned,
                        and concluded that he had really placed the girl in a very unsatisfactory
                        position.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps I had better end this little affair,&quot; he thought.
                        &quot;It isn&apos;t a wise thing to pursue.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On the strength of this conclusion he went to Washington and finished his
                        term. Then he returned to Columbus to await the friendly recognition from
                        the President which was to send him upon some ministry abroad. Jennie had
                        not been forgotten in the least. The longer he stayed away the more eager he
                        was to get back. When he was again permanently settled in his old quarters
                        he took up his cane one morning and strolled out in the direction of the
                        cottage. Arriving there, he made up his mind to go in, and knocking at the
                        door, he was greeted by Mrs. Gerhardt and her daughter with astonished and
                        diffident smiles. He explained vaguely that he had been away, and mentioned
                        his laundry as if that were the object of his visit. Then, when chance gave
                        him a few moments with Jennie alone, he plunged in boldly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would you like to take a drive with me tomorrow
                        evening?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like it,&quot; said Jennie, to whom the
                        proposition was a glorious novelty.</p>
                    <p>He smiled and patted her cheek, foolishly happy to see her again. Every day
                        seemed to add to her beauty. Graced with her clean white apron, her shapely
                        head crowned by the glory of her simply plaited hair, she was a pleasing
                        sight for any man to look upon.</p>
                    <p>He waited until Mrs. Gerhardt returned, and then, having accomplished the
                        purpose of his visit, he arose.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-057" n="50"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to take your daughter out riding to-morrow
                        evening,&quot; he explained. &quot;I want to talk to her about her
                        future.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t that be nice?&quot; said the mother. She saw
                        nothing incongruous in the proposal. They parted with smiles and much
                        handshaking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That man has the best heart,&quot; commented Mrs. Gerhardt.
                        &quot;Doesn&apos;t he always speak so nicely of you? He may help you
                        to an education. You ought to be proud.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am,&quot; said Jennie frankly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know whether we had better tell your father or
                        not,&quot; concluded Mrs. Gerhardt. &quot;He doesn&apos;t like
                        for you to be out evenings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Finally they decided not to tell him. He might not understand.</p>
                    <p>Jennie was ready when he called. He could see by the weak-flamed,
                        unpretentious parlor-lamp that she was dressed for him, and that the
                        occasion had called out the best she had. A pale lavender gingham, starched
                        and ironed, until it was a model of laundering, set off her pretty figure to
                        perfection. There were little lace-edged cuffs and a rather high collar
                        attached to it. She had no gloves, nor any jewelry, nor yet a jacket good
                        enough to wear, but her hair was done up in such a dainty way that it set
                        off her well-shaped head better than any hat, and the few ringlets that
                        could escape crowned her as with a halo. When Brander suggested that she
                        should wear a jacket she hesitated a moment; then she went in and borrowed
                        her mother&apos;s cape, a plain gray woolen one. Brander realized now
                        that she had no jacket, and suffered keenly to think that she had
                        contemplated going without one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She would have endured the raw night air,&quot; he thought,
                        &quot;and said nothing of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her and shook his head reflectively. Then they started, and he
                        quickly forgot everything but <pb id="VAA2406-058" n="51"/> the great fact
                        that she was at his side. She talked with freedom and with a gentle girlish
                        enthusiasm that he found irresistibly charming.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Jennie,&quot; he said, when she had called upon him to
                        notice how soft the trees looked, where, outlined dimly against the new
                        rising moon, they were touched with its yellow light,
                        &quot;you&apos;re a great one. I believe you would write poetry if
                        you were schooled a little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you suppose I could?&quot; she asked innocently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do I suppose, little girl?&quot; he said, taking her hand.
                        &quot;Do I suppose? Why, I know. You&apos;re the dearest little
                        day-dreamer in the world. Of course you could write poetry. You live it. You
                        are poetry, my dear. Don&apos;t you worry about writing any.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This eulogy touched her as nothing else possibly could have done. He was
                        always saying such nice things. No one ever seemed to like or to appreciate
                        her half as much as he did. And how good he was! Everybody said that. Her
                        own father.</p>
                    <p>They rode still farther, until suddenly remembering, he said: &quot;I
                        wonder what time it is. Perhaps we had better be turning back. Have you your
                        watch?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie started, for this watch had been the one thing of which she had hoped
                        he would not speak. Ever since he had returned it had been on her mind.</p>
                    <p>In his absence the family finances had become so strained that she had been
                        compelled to pawn it. Martha had got to that place in the matter of apparel
                        where she could no longer go to school unless something new were provided
                        for her. And so, after much discussion, it was decided that the watch must
                        go.</p>
                    <p>Bass took it, and after much argument with the local pawn broker, he had been
                        able to bring home ten dollars. Mrs. Gerhardt expended the money upon her
                        children, and heaved a sigh of relief. Martha looked very much better.
                        Naturally, Jennie was glad.</p>
                    <p>Now, however, when the Senator spoke of it, her hour <pb id="VAA2406-059"
                            n="52"/> of retribution seemed at hand. She actually trembled, and he
                        noticed her discomfiture.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Jennie,&quot; he said gently, &quot;what made you
                        start like that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; she answered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t you your watch?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused, for it seemed impossible to tell a deliberate falsehood. There
                        was a strained silence; then she said, with a voice that had too much of a
                        sob in it for him not to suspect the truth, &quot;No, sir.&quot; He
                        persisted, and she confessed everything.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;dearest, don&apos;t feel
                        badly about it. There never was such another girl. I&apos;ll get your
                        watch for you. Hereafter when you need anything I want you to come to me. Do
                        you hear? I want you to promise me that. If I&apos;m not here, I want
                        you to write me. I&apos;ll always be in touch with you from now on. You
                        will have my address. Just let me know, and I&apos;ll help you. Do you
                        understand?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll promise to do that now, will you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>For a moment neither of them spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jennie,&quot; he said at last, the spring-like quality of the
                        night moving him to a burst of feeling, &quot;I&apos;ve about
                        decided that I can&apos;t do without you. Do you think you could make up
                        your mind to live with me from now on?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie looked away, not clearly understanding his words as he meant them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she said vaguely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you think about it,&quot; he said pleasantly.
                        &quot;I&apos;m serious. Would you be willing to marry me, and let me
                        put you away in a seminary for a few years?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go away to school?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, after you marry me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess so,&quot; she replied. Her mother came into her mind.
                        Maybe she could help the family.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-060" n="[53]"/>
                    <p>He looked around at her, and tried to make out the expression on her face. It
                        was not dark. The moon was now above the trees in the east, and already the
                        vast host of stars were paling before it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you care for me at all, Jennie?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You never come for my laundry any more, though,&quot; he
                        returned pathetically. It touched her to hear him say this.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t do that,&quot; she answered. &quot;I
                        couldn&apos;t help it; Mother thought it was best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So it was,&quot; he assented. &quot;Don&apos;t feel
                        badly. I was only joking with you. You&apos;d be glad to come if you
                        could, wouldn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I would,&quot; she answered frankly.</p>
                    <p>He took her hand and pressed it so feelingly that all his kindly words seemed
                        doubly emphasized to her. Reaching up impulsively, she put her arms about
                        him. &quot;You&apos;re so good to me,&quot; she said with the
                        loving tone of a daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re my girl, Jennie,&quot; he said with deep
                        feeling. &quot;I&apos;d do anything in the world for
                    you.&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
                    <p>THE father of this unfortunate family, William Gerhardt, was a man of
                        considerable interest on his personal side. Born in the kingdom of Saxony,
                        he had had character enough to oppose the army conscription iniquity, and to
                        flee, in his eighteenth year, to Paris. From there he had set forth for
                        America, the land of promise.</p>
                    <p>Arrived in this country, he had made his way, by slow stages, from New York
                        to Philadelphia, and thence westward, working for a time in the various
                        glass factories in Pennsylvania. In one romantic village of this new world
                        he had found his heart&apos;s ideal. With her, a simple American girl of
                        German extraction, he had removed to Youngstown, and thence to Columbus,
                        each time following a glass manufacturer by the name of Hammond, whose
                        business prospered and waned by turns.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt was an honest man, and he liked to think that others appreciated his
                        integrity. &quot;William,&quot; his employer used to say to him,
                        &quot;I want you because I can trust you,&quot; and this, to him,
                        was more than silver and gold.</p>
                    <p>This honesty, like his religious convictions, was wholly due to inheritance.
                        He had never reasoned about it. Father and grandfather before him were
                        sturdy German artisans, who had never cheated anybody out of a dollar, and
                        this honesty of intention came into his veins <unclear>u-</unclear>
                        diminished.</p>
                    <p>His Lutheran proclivities had been strengthened by years of church-going and
                        the religious observances of home life. In his father&apos;s cottage the
                        influence of the <pb id="VAA2406-062" n="55"/> Lutheran minister had been
                        all-powerful; he had inherited the feeling that the Lutheran Church was a
                        perfect institution, and that its teachings were of all-importance when it
                        came to the issue of the future life. His wife, nominally of the Mennonite
                        faith, was quite willing to accept her husband&apos;s creed. And so his
                        household became a God-fearing one; wherever they went their first public
                        step was to ally themselves with the local Lutheran church, and the minister
                        was always a welcome guest in the Gerhardt home.</p>
                    <p>Pastor Wundt, the shepherd of the Columbus church, was a sincere and ardent
                        Christian, but his bigotry and hard-and-fast orthodoxy made him intolerant.
                        He considered that the members of his flock were jeopardizing their eternal
                        salvation if they danced, played cards, or went to theaters, and he did not
                        hesitate to declare vociferously that hell was yawning for those who
                        disobeyed his injunctions. Drinking, even temperately, was a sin.
                        Smokingwell, he smoked himself. Right conduct in marriage, however, and
                        innocence before that state were absolute essentials of Christian living.
                        Let no one talk of salvation, he had said, for a daughter who had failed to
                        keep her chastity unstained, or for the parents who, by negligence, had
                        permitted her to fall. Hell was yawning for all such. You must walk the
                        straight and narrow way if you would escape eternal punishment, and a just
                        God was angry with sinners every day.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt and his wife, and also Jennie, accepted the doctrines of their
                        Church as expounded by Mr. Wundt without reserve. With Jennie, however, the
                        assent was little more than nominal. Religion had as yet no striking hold
                        upon her. It was a pleasant thing to know that there was a heaven, a
                        fearsome one to realize that there was a hell. Young girls and boys ought to
                        be good and obey their parents. Otherwise the whole religious problem was
                        badly jumbled in her mind.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-063" n="56"/>
                    <p>Gerhardt was convinced that everything spoken from the pulpit of his church
                        was literally true. Death and the future life were realities to him.</p>
                    <p>Now that the years were slipping away and the problem of the world was
                        becoming more and more inexplicable, he clung with pathetic anxiety to the
                        doctrines which contained a solution. Oh, if he could only be so honest and
                        upright that the Lord might have no excuse for ruling him out. He trembled
                        not only for himself, but for his wife and children. Would he not some day
                        be held responsible for them? Would not his own laxity and lack of system in
                        inculcating the laws of eternal life to them end in his and their damnation?
                        He pictured to himself the torments of hell, and wondered how it would be
                        with him and his in the final hour.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, such a deep religious feeling made him stern with his children. He
                        was prone to scan with a narrow eye the pleasures and foibles of youthful
                        desire. Jennie was never to have a lover if her father had any voice in the
                        matter. Any flirtation with the youths she might meet upon the streets of
                        Columbus could have no continuation in her home. Gerhardt forgot that he was
                        once young himself, and looked only to the welfare of her spirit. So the
                        Senator was a novel factor in her life.</p>
                    <p>When he first began to be a part of their family affairs the conventional
                        standards of Father Gerhardt proved untrustworthy. He had no means of
                        judging such a character. This was no ordinary person coquetting with his
                        pretty daughter. The manner in which the Senator entered the family life was
                        so original and so plausible that he became an active part before any one
                        thought anything about it. Gerhardt himself was deceived, and, expecting
                        nothing but honor and profit to flow to the family from such a source,
                        accepted the interest and the service, and plodded peacefully on. His wife
                        did not tell him of the many presents which had come before and since the
                        wonderful Christmas.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-064" n="57"/>
                    <p>But one morning as Gerhardt was coming home from his night work a neighbor
                        named Otto Weaver accosted him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gerhardt,&quot; he said, &quot;I want to speak a word with
                        you. As a friend of yours, I want to tell you what I hear. The neighbors,
                        you know, they talk now about the man who comes to see your
                        daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My daughter?&quot; said Gerhardt, more puzzled and pained by
                        this abrupt attack than mere words could indicate. &quot;Whom do you
                        mean? I don&apos;t know of any one who comes to see my
                        daugther.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No?&quot; inquired Weaver, nearly as much astonished as the
                        recipient of his confidences. &quot;The middle-aged man, with gray hair.
                        He carries a cane sometimes. You don&apos;t know him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt racked his memory with a puzzled face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They say he was a senator once,&quot; went on Weaver, doubtful
                        of what he had got into; &quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah,&quot; returned Gerhardt, measurably relieved.
                        &quot;Senator Brander. Yes. He has come sometimesso. Well, what of
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is nothing,&quot; returned the neighbor, &quot;only they
                        talk. He is no longer a young man, you know. Your daughter, she goes out
                        with him now a few times. These people, they see that, and now they talk
                        about her. I thought you might want to know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt was shocked to the depths of his being by these terrible words.
                        People must have a reason for saying such things. Jennie and her mother were
                        seriously at fault. Still he did not hesitate to defend his daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is a friend of the family,&quot; he said confusedly.
                        &quot;People should not talk until they know. My daughter has done
                        nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is so. It is nothing,&quot; continued Weaver.
                        &quot;People talk before they have any grounds. You and I are old
                        friends. I thought you might want to know.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-065" n="58"/>
                    <p>Gerhardt stood there motionless another minute or so, his jaw fallen and a
                        strange helplessness upon him. The world was such a grim thing to have
                        antagonistic to you. Its opinions and good favor were so essential. How hard
                        he had tried to live up to its rules! Why should it not be satisfied and let
                        him alone?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad you told me,&quot; he murmured as he started
                        homeward. &quot;I will see about it. Good-by.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt took the first opportunity to question his wife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is this about Senator Brander coming out to call on
                        Jennie?&quot; he asked in German. &quot;The neighbors are talking
                        about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, nothing,&quot; answered Mrs. Gerhardt, in the same
                        language. She was decidedly taken aback at his question. &quot;He did
                        call two or three times.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t tell me that,&quot; he returned, a sense of
                        her frailty in tolerating and shielding such weakness in one of their
                        children irritating him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied, absolutely nonplussed. &quot;He has
                        only been here two or three times.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Two or three times!&quot; exclaimed Gerhardt, the German
                        tendency to talk loud coming upon him. &quot;Two or three times! The
                        whole neighborhood talks about it. What is this, then?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He only called two or three times,&quot; Mrs. Gerhardt repeated
                        weakly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Weaver comes to me on the street,&quot; continued Gerhardt,
                        &quot;and tells me that my neighbors are talking of the man my daughter
                        is going with. I didn&apos;t know anything about it. There I stood. I
                        didn&apos;t know what to say. What kind of a way is that? What must the
                        man think of me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is nothing the matter,&quot; declared the mother, using
                        an effective German idiom. &quot;Jennie has gone walking with him once
                        or twice. He has called here at the house. What is there now in that for the
                        people <pb id="VAA2406-066" n="59"/> to talk about? Can&apos;t the girl
                        have any pleasure at all?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But he is an old man,&quot; returned Gerhardt, voicing the
                        words of Weaver. &quot;He is a public citizen. What should he want to
                        call on a girl like Jennie for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt, defensively.
                        &quot;He comes here to the house. I don&apos;t know anything but
                        good about the man. Can I tell him not to come?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt paused at this. All that he knew of the Senator was excellent. What
                        was there now that was so terrible about it?</p>
                    <p>&quot;The neighbors are so ready to talk. They haven&apos;t got
                        anything else to talk about now, so they talk about Jennie. You know whether
                        she is a good girl or not. Why should they say such things?&quot; and
                        tears came into the soft little mother&apos;s eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is all right,&quot; grumbled Gerhardt, &quot;but he
                        ought not to want to come around and take a girl of her age out walking. It
                        looks bad, even if he don&apos;t mean any harm.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this moment Jennie came in. She had heard the talking in the front
                        bedroom, where she slept with one of the children, but had not suspected its
                        import. Now her mother turned her back and bent over the table where she was
                        making biscuit, in order that her daughter might not see her red eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; she inquired, vaguely
                        troubled by the tense stillness in the attitude of both her parents.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Gerhardt firmly.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt made no sign, but her very immobility told something. Jennie
                        went over to her and quickly discovered that she had been weeping.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; she repeated wonderingly,
                        gazing at her father.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt only stood there, his daughter&apos;s innocence dominating his
                        terror of evil.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; she urged softly of her
                        mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it&apos;s the neighbors,&quot; returned the mother
                        brokenly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-067" n="60"/>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re always ready to talk about something they
                        don&apos;t know anything about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it me again?&quot; inquired Jennie, her face flushing
                        faintly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see,&quot; observed Gerhardt, apparently addressing the
                        world in general, &quot;she knows. Now, why didn&apos;t you tell me
                        that he was coming here? The neighbors talk, and I hear nothing about it
                        until to-day. What kind of a way is that, anyhow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; exclaimed Jennie, out of the purest sympathy for her
                        mother, &quot;what difference does it make?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What difference?&quot; cried Gerhardt, still talking in German,
                        although Jennie answered in English. &quot;Is it no difference that men
                        stop me on the street and speak of it? You should be ashamed of yourself to
                        say that. I always thought well of this man, but now, since you
                        don&apos;t tell me about him, and the neighbors talk, I don&apos;t
                        know what to think. Must I get my knowledge of what is going on in my own
                        home from my neighbors?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mother and daughter paused. Jennie had already begun to think that their
                        error was serious.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t keep anything from you because it was
                        evil,&quot; she said. &quot;Why, he only took me out riding
                        once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but you didn&apos;t tell me that,&quot; answered her
                        father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know you don&apos;t like for me to go out after
                        dark,&quot; replied Jennie. &quot;That&apos;s why I
                        didn&apos;t. There wasn&apos;t anything else to hide about
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He shouldn&apos;t want you to go out after dark with
                        him,&quot; observed Gerhardt, always mindful of the world outside.
                        &quot;What can he want with you. Why does he come here? He is too old,
                        anyhow. I don&apos;t think you ought to have anything to do with himsuch
                        a young girl as you are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He doesn&apos;t want to do anything except help me,&quot;
                        murmured Jennie. &quot;He wants to marry me.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-068" n="61"/>
                    <p>&quot;Marry you? Ha! Why doesn&apos;t he tell me that!&quot;
                        exclaimed Gerhardt. &quot;I shall look into this. I won&apos;t have
                        him running around with my daughter, and the neighbors talking. Besides, he
                        is too old. I shall tell him that. He ought to know better than to put a
                        girl where she gets talked about. It is better he should stay away
                        altogether.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This threat of Gerhardt&apos;s, that he would tell Brander to stay away,
                        seemed simply terrible to Jennie and to her mother. What good could come of
                        any such attitude? Why must they be degraded before him? Of course Brander
                        did call again, while Gerhardt was away at work, and they trembled lest the
                        father should hear of it. A few days later the Senator came and took Jennie
                        for a long walk. Neither she nor her mother said anything to Gerhardt. But
                        he was not to be put off the scent for long.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has Jennie been out again with that man?&quot; he inquired of
                        Mrs. Gerhardt the next evening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was here last night,&quot; returned the mother, evasively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did she tell him he shouldn&apos;t come any more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t think so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, I will see for myself once whether this thing will be
                        stopped or not,&quot; said the determined father. &quot;I shall talk
                        with him. Wait till he comes again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In accordance with this, he took occasion to come up from his factory on
                        three different evenings, each time carefully surveying the house, in order
                        to discover whether any visitor was being entertained. On the fourth evening
                        Brander came, and inquiring for Jennie, who was exceedingly nervous, he took
                        her out for a walk. She was afraid of her father, lest some unseemly things
                        should happen, but did not know exactly what to do.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt, who was on his way to the house at the time, observed her
                        departure. That was enough for him. Walking deliberately in upon his wife,
                        he said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-069" n="62"/>
                    <p>&quot;Where is Jennie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is out somewhere,&quot; said her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know where,&quot; said Gerhardt. &quot;I saw her.
                        Now wait till she comes home. I will tell him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He sat down calmly, reading a German paper and keeping an eye upon his wife,
                        until, at last, the gate clicked, and the front door opened. Then he got up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where have you been?&quot; he exclaimed in German.</p>
                    <p>Brander, who had not suspected that any trouble of this character was
                        pending, felt irritated and uncomfortable. Jennie was covered with
                        confusion. Her mother was suffering an agony of torment in the kitchen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I have been out for a walk,&quot; she answered confusedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you not to go out any more after
                        dark?&quot; said Gerhardt, utterly ignoring Brander.</p>
                    <p>Jennie colored furiously, unable to speak a word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is the trouble?&quot; inquired Brander gravely.
                        &quot;Why should you talk to her like that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She should not go out after dark,&quot; returned the father
                        rudely. &quot;I have told her two or three times now. I don&apos;t
                        think you ought to come here any more, either.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And why?&quot; asked the Senator, pausing to consider and
                        choose his words. &quot;Isn&apos;t this rather peculiar? What has
                        your daughter done?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What has she done!&quot; exclaimed Gerhardt, his excitement
                        growing under the strain he was enduring, and speaking almost unaccented
                        English in consequence. &quot;She is running around the streets at night
                        when she oughtn&apos;t to be. I don&apos;t want my daughter taken
                        out after dark by a man of your age. What do you want with her anyway? She
                        is only a child yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Want!&quot; said the Senator, straining to regain his ruffled
                        dignity. &quot;I want to talk with her, of course. She is old enough to
                        be interesting to me. I want to marry her if she will have me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to go out of here and stay out of here,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2406-070" n="63"/> returned the father, losing all sense of
                        logic, and descending to the ordinary level of parental compulsion.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t want you to come around my house any more. I have
                        enough trouble without my daughter being taken out and given a bad
                        name.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tell you frankly,&quot; said the Senator, drawing himself up
                        to his full height, &quot;that you will have to make clear your meaning.
                        I have done nothing that I am ashamed of. Your daughter has not come to any
                        harm through me. Now, I want to know what you mean by conducting yourself in
                        this manner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean,&quot; said Gerhardt, excitedly repeating himself,
                        &quot;I mean, I mean that the whole neighborhood talks about how you
                        come around here, and have buggy-rides and walks with my daughter when I am
                        not herethat&apos;s what I mean. I mean that you are no man of honorable
                        intentions, or you would not come taking up with a little girl who is only
                        old enough to be your daughter. People tell me well enough what you are.
                        Just you go and leave my daughter alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;People!&quot; said the Senator. &quot;Well, I care nothing
                        for your people. I love your daughter, and I am here to see her because I do
                        love her. It is my intention to marry her, and if your neighbors have
                        anything to say to that, let them say it. There is no reason why you should
                        conduct yourself in this manner before you know what my intentions
                        are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Unnerved by this unexpected and terrible altercation, Jennie had backed away
                        to the door leading out into the dining-room, and her mother, seeing her,
                        came forward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said the latter, breathing excitedly, &quot;he
                        came home when you were away. What shall we do?&quot; They clung
                        together, as women do, and wept silently. The dispute continued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Marry, eh,&quot; exclaimed the father. &quot;Is that
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Senator, &quot;marry, that is exactly
                        it. Your daughter is eighteen years of age and can decide <pb
                            id="VAA2406-071" n="64"/> for herself. You have insulted me and outraged
                        your daughter&apos;s feelings. Now, I wish you to know that it cannot
                        stop here. If you have any cause to say anything against me outside of mere
                        hearsay I wish you to say it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Senator stood before him, a very citadel of righteousness. He was neither
                        loud-voiced nor angry-mannered, but there was a tightness about his lips
                        which bespoke the man of force and determination.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to talk to you any more,&quot; returned
                        Gerhardt, who was checked but not overawed. &quot;My daughter is my
                        daughter. I am the one who will say whether she shall go out at night, or
                        whether she shall marry you, either. I know what you politicians are. When I
                        first met you I thought you were a fine man, but now, since I see the way
                        you conduct yourself with my daughter, I don&apos;t want anything more
                        to do with you. Just you go and stay away from here. That&apos;s all I
                        ask of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sorry, Mrs. Gerhardt,&quot; said Brander, turning
                        deliberately away from the angry father, &quot;to have had such an
                        argument in your home. I had no idea that your husband was opposed to my
                        visits. However, I will leave the matter as it stands for the present. You
                        must not take all this as badly as it seems.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt looked on in astonishment at his coolness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will go now,&quot; he said, again addressing Gerhardt,
                        &quot;but you mustn&apos;t think that I am leaving this matter for
                        good. You have made a serious mistake this evening. I hope you will realize
                        that. I bid you goodnight.&quot; He bowed slightly and went out.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt closed the door firmly. &quot;Now,&quot; he said, turning to
                        his daughter and wife, &quot;we will see whether we are rid of him or
                        not. I will show you how to go after night upon the streets when everybody
                        is talking already.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In so far as words were concerned, the argument ceased, <pb id="VAA2406-072"
                            n="65"/> but looks and feeling ran strong and deep, and for days
                        thereafter scarcely a word was spoken in the little cottage. Gerhardt began
                        to brood over the fact that he had accepted his place from the Senator and
                        decided to give it up. He made it known that no more of the
                        Senator&apos;s washing was to be done in their house, and if he had not
                        been sure that Mrs. Gerhardt&apos;s hotel work was due to her own
                        efforts in finding it he would have stopped that. No good would come out of
                        it, anyway. If she had never gone to the hotel all this talk would never
                        have come upon them.</p>
                    <p>As for the Senator, he went away decidedly ruffled by this crude occurrence.
                        Neighborhood slanders are bad enough on their own plane, but for a man of
                        his standing to descend and become involved in one struck him now as being a
                        little bit unworthy. He did not know what to do about the situation, and
                        while he was trying to come to some decision several days went by. Then he
                        was called to Washington, and he went away without having seen Jennie again.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time the Gerhardt family struggled along as before. They were
                        poor, indeed, but Gerhardt was willing to face poverty if only it could be
                        endured with honor. The grocery bills were of the same size, however. The
                        children&apos;s clothing was steadily wearing out. Economy had to be
                        practised, and payments stopped on old bills that Gerhardt was trying to
                        adjust.</p>
                    <p>Then came a day when the annual interest on the mortgage was due, and yet
                        another when two different grocery-men met Gerhardt on the street and asked
                        about their little bills. He did not hesitate to explain just what the
                        situation was, and to tell them with convincing honesty that he would try
                        hard and do the best he could. But his spirit was unstrung by his
                        misfortunes. He prayed for the favor of Heaven while at his labor, and did
                        not hesitate to use the daylight hours that he should have had for sleeping

                        remunerative position or to obtain such little jobs as he could now and then
                        pick up. One of them was that of cutting grass.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt protested that he was killing himself, but he explained his
                        procedure by pointing to their necessity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When people stop me on the street and ask me for money I have no
                        time to sleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a distressing situation for all of them.</p>
                    <p>To cap it all, Sebastian got in jail. It was that old coal-stealing ruse of
                        his practised once too often. He got up on a car one evening while Jennie
                        and the children waited for him, and a railroad detective arrested him.
                        There had been a good deal of coal stealing during the past two years, but
                        so long as it was confined to moderate quantities the railroad took no
                        notice. When, however, customers of shippers complained that cars from the
                        Pennsylvania fields lost thousands of pounds in transit to Cleveland,
                        Cincinnati, Chicago, and other points, detectives were set to work.
                        Gerhardt&apos;s children were not the only ones who preyed upon the
                        railroad in this way. Other families in Columbusmany of themwere constantly
                        doing the same thing, but Sebastian happened to be seized upon as the
                        Columbus example.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You come off that car now,&quot; said the detective, suddenly
                        appearing out of the shadow. Jennie and the other children dropped their
                        baskets and buckets and fled for their lives. Sebastian&apos;s first
                        impulse was to jump and run, but when he tried it the detective grabbed him
                        by the coat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold on here,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I want
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, let go,&quot; said Sebastian savagely, for he was no
                        weakling. There was nerve and determination in him, as well as a keen sense
                        of his awkward predicament.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let go, I tell you,&quot; he reiterated, and giving a jerk, he
                        almost upset his captor.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-074" n="67"/>
                    <p>&quot;Come here now,&quot; said the detective, pulling him viciously
                        in an effort to establish his authority.</p>
                    <p>Sebastian came, but it was with a blow which staggered his adversary.</p>
                    <p>There was more struggling, and then a passing railroad hand came to the
                        detective&apos;s assistance. Together they hurried him toward the depot,
                        and there discovering the local officer, turned him over. It was with a torn
                        coat, scarred hands and face, and a black eye that Sebastian was locked up
                        for the night.</p>
                    <p>When the children came home they could not say what had happened to their
                        brother, but as nine o&apos;clock struck, and then ten and eleven, and
                        Sebastian did not return, Mrs. Gerhardt was beside herself. He had stayed
                        out many a night as late as twelve and one, but his mother had a foreboding
                        of something terrible tonight. When half-past one arrived, and no Sebastian,
                        she began to cry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Some one ought to go up and tell your father,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;He may be in jail.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie volunteered, but George, who was soundly sleeping, was awakened to go
                        along with her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What!&quot; said Gerhardt, astonished to see his two children.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bass hasn&apos;t come yet,&quot; said Jennie, and then told
                        the story of the evening&apos;s adventure in explanation.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt left his work at once, walking back with his two children to a point
                        where he could turn off to go to the jail. He guessed what had happened, and
                        his heart was troubled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that so, now!&quot; he repeated nervously, rubbing his
                        clumsy hands across his wet forehead.</p>
                    <p>Arrived at the station-house, the sergeant in charge told him curtly that
                        Bass was under arrest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sebastian Gerhardt?&quot; he said, looking over his blotter;
                        &quot;yes, here he is. Stealing coal and resisting an officer. Is he
                        your boy?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-075" n="68"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, my!&quot; said Gerhardt, &quot;<hi rend="i">Ach
                        Gott!</hi>&quot; He actually wrung his hands in distress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Want to see him? &quot; asked the Sergeant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said the father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take him back, Fred,&quot; said the other to the old watchman
                        in charge, &quot;and let him see the boy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Gerhardt stood in the back room, and Sebastian was brought out all
                        marked and tousled, he broke down and began to cry. No word could cross his
                        lips because of his emotion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t cry, pop,&quot; said Sebastian bravely.
                        &quot;I couldn&apos;t help it. It&apos;s all right.
                        I&apos;ll be out in the morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt only shook with his grief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t cry,&quot; continued Sebastian, doing his very
                        best to restrain his own tears. &quot;I&apos;ll be all right.
                        What&apos;s the use of crying?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know, I know,&quot; said the gray-headed parent brokenly,
                        &quot;but I can&apos;t help it. It is my fault that I should let you
                        do that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no, it isn&apos;t,&quot; said Sebastian. &quot;You
                        couldn&apos;t help it. Does mother know anything about it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, she knows,&quot; he returned. &quot;Jennie and George
                        just came up where I was and told me. I didn&apos;t know anything about
                        it until just now,&quot; and he began to cry again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, don&apos;t you feel badly,&quot; went on Bass, the
                        finest part of his nature coming to the surface. &quot;I&apos;ll be
                        all right. Just you go back to work now, and don&apos;t worry.
                        I&apos;ll be all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did you hurt your eye?&quot; asked the father, looking at
                        him with red eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I had a little wrestling match with the man who nabbed
                        me,&quot; said the boy, smiling bravely. &quot;I thought I could get
                        away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You shouldn&apos;t do that, Sebastian,&quot; said the
                        father. &quot;It may go harder with you on that account. When does your
                        case come up?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-076" n="[69]"/>
                    <p>&quot;In the morning, they told me,&quot; said Bass. &quot;Nine
                        o&apos;clock.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt stayed with his son for some time, and discussed the question of
                        bail, fine, and the dire possibility of a jail sentence without arriving at
                        any definite conclusion. Finally he was persuaded by Bass to go away, but
                        the departure was the occasion for another outburst of feeling; he was led
                        away shaking and broken with emotion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s pretty tough,&quot; said Bass to himself as he
                        was led back to his cell. He was thinking solely of his father. &quot;I
                        wonder what ma will think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The thought of this touched him tenderly. &quot;I wish I&apos;d
                        knocked the dub over the first crack,&quot; he said. &quot;What a
                        fool I was not to get away.&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
                    <p>GERHARDT was in despair; he did not know any one to whom he could appeal
                        between the hours of two and nine o&apos;clock in the morning. He went
                        back to talk with his wife, and then to his post of duty. What was to be
                        done? He could think of only one friend who was able, or possibly willing to
                        do anything. This was the glass manufacturer, Hammond; but he was not in the
                        city. Gerhardt did not know this, however.</p>
                    <p>When nine o&apos;clock came, he went alone to the court, for it was
                        thought advisable that the others should stay away. Mrs. Gerhardt was to
                        hear immediately what happened. He would come right back.</p>
                    <p>When Sebastian was lined up inside the dock he had to wait a long time, for
                        there were several prisoners ahead of him. Finally his name was called, and
                        the boy was pushed forward to the bar. &quot;Stealing coal, Your Honor,
                        and resisting arrest,&quot; explained the officer who had arrested him.</p>
                    <p>The magistrate looked at Sebastian closely; he was unfavorably impressed by
                        the lad&apos;s scratched and wounded face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, young man,&quot; he said, &quot;what have you to say
                        for yourself? How did you get your black eye?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sebastian looked at the judge, but did not answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I arrested him,&quot; said the detective. &quot;He was on
                        one of the company&apos;s cars. He tried to break away from me, and when
                        I held him he assaulted me. This man here was a witness,&quot; he added,
                        turning to the railroad hand who had helped him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-078" n="71"/>
                    <p>&quot;Is that where he struck you?&quot; asked the Court, observing
                        the detective&apos;s swollen jaw.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; he returned, glad of an opportunity to be
                        further revenged.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you please,&quot; put in Gerhardt, leaning forward,
                        &quot;he is my boy. He was sent to get the coal. He&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We don&apos;t mind what they pick up around the yard,&quot;
                        interrupted the detective, &quot;but he was throwing it off the cars to
                        half a dozen others.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t you earn enough to keep from taking coal off the
                        coal cars?&quot; asked the Court; but before either father or son had
                        time to answer he added, &quot;What is your business?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Car builder,&quot; said Sebastian.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what do you do?&quot; he questioned, addressing Gerhardt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am watchman at Miller&apos;s furniture factory.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Um,&quot; said the court, feeling that Sebastian&apos;s
                        attitude remained sullen and contentious. &quot;Well, this young man
                        might be let off on the coal-stealing charge, but he seems to be somewhat
                        too free with his fists. Columbus is altogether too rich in that sort of
                        thing. Ten dollars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you please,&quot; began Gerhardt, but the court officer was
                        already pushing him away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to hear any more about it,&quot; said the
                        judge. &quot;He&apos;s stubborn, anyhow. What&apos;s the next
                        case?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt made his way over to his boy, abashed and yet very glad it was no
                        worse. Somehow, he thought, he could raise the money. Sebastian looked at
                        him solicitously as he came forward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all right,&quot; said Bass soothingly.
                        &quot;He didn&apos;t give me half a chance to say
                        anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m only glad it wasn&apos;t more,&quot; said
                        Gerhardt nervously. &quot;We will try and get the money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Going home to his wife, Gerhardt informed the troubled household of the
                        result. Mrs. Gerhardt stood <pb id="VAA2406-079" n="72"/> white and yet
                        relieved, for ten dollars seemed something that might be had. Jennie heard
                        the whole story with open mouth and wide eyes. It was a terrible blow to
                        her. Poor Bass! He was always so lively and good natured. It seemed awful
                        that he should be in jail.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt went hurriedly to Hammond&apos;s fine residence, but he was not
                        in the city. He thought then of a lawyer by the name of Jenkins, whom he
                        knew in a casual way, but Jenkins was not at his office. There were several
                        grocers and coal merchants whom he knew well enough, but he owed them money.
                        Pastor Wundt might let him have it, but the agony such a disclosure to that
                        worthy would entail held him back. He did call on one or two acquaintances,
                        but these, surprised at the unusual and peculiar request, excused
                        themselves. At four o&apos;clock he returned home, weary and exhausted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what to do,&quot; he said despairingly.
                        &quot;If I could only think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie thought of Brander, but the situation had not accentuated her
                        desperation to the point where she could brave her father&apos;s
                        opposition and his terrible insult to the Senator, so keenly remembered, to
                        go and ask. Her watch had been pawned a second time, and she had no other
                        means of obtaining money.</p>
                    <p>The family council lasted until half-past ten, but still there was nothing
                        decided. Mrs. Gerhardt persistently and monotonously turned one hand over in
                        the other and stared at the floor. Gerhardt ran his hand through his reddish
                        brown hair distractedly. &quot;It&apos;s no use,&quot; he said
                        at last. &quot;I can&apos;t think of anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go to bed, Jennie,&quot; said her mother solicitously;
                        &quot;get the others to go. There&apos;s no use their sitting up. I
                        may think of something. You go to bed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie went to her room, but the very thought of repose was insupportable.
                        She had read in the paper, shortly <pb id="VAA2406-080" n="73"/> after her
                        father&apos;s quarrel with the Senator, that the latter had departed for
                        Washington. There had been no notice of his return. Still he might be in the
                        city. She stood before a short, narrow mirror that surmounted a shabby
                        bureau, thinking. Her sister Veronica, with whom she slept, was already
                        composing herself to dreams. Finally a grim resolution fixed itself in her
                        consciousness. She would go and see Senator Brander. If <hi rend="i">he</hi>
                        were in town he would help Bass. Why shouldn&apos;t shehe loved her. He
                        had asked over and over to marry her. Why should she not go and ask him for
                        help?</p>
                    <p>She hesitated a little while, then hearing Veronica breathing regularly, she
                        put on her hat and jacket, and noiselessly opened the door into the
                        sitting-room to see if any one were stirring.</p>
                    <p>There was no sound save that of Gerhardt rocking nervously to and fro in the
                        kitchen. There was no light save that of her own small room-lamp and a gleam
                        from under the kitchen door. She turned and blew the former outthen slipped
                        quietly to the front door, opened it and stepped out into the night.</p>
                    <p>A waning moon was shining, and a hushed sense of growing life filled the air,
                        for it was nearing spring again. As Jennie hurried along the shadowy
                        streetsthe are light had not yet been inventedshe had a sinking sense of
                        fear; what was this rash thing she was about to do? How would the Senator
                        receive her? What would he think? She stood stock-still, wavering and
                        doubtful; then the recollection of Bass in his night cell came over her
                        again, and she hurried on.</p>
                    <p>The character of the Capitol Hotel was such that it was not difficult for a
                        woman to find ingress through the ladies&apos; entrance to the various
                        floors of the hotel at any hour of the night. The hotel, not unlike many
                        others of the time, was in no sense loosely conducted, but its method of
                        supervision in places was lax. Any person <pb id="VAA2406-081" n="74"/> son
                        could enter, and, by applying at a rear entrance to the lobby, gain the
                        attention of the clerk. Otherwise not much notice was taken of those who
                        came and went.</p>
                    <p>When she came to the door it was dark save for a low light burning in the
                        entry-way. The distance to the Senator&apos;s room was only a short way
                        along the hall of the second floor. She hurried up the steps, nervous and
                        pale, but giving no other outward sign of the storm that was surging within
                        her. When she came to his familiar door she paused; she feared that she
                        might not find him in his room; she trembled again to think that he might be
                        there. A light shone through the transom, and, summoning all her courage,
                        she knocked. A man coughed and bestirred himself.</p>
                    <p>His surprise as he opened the door knew no bounds. &quot;Why,
                        Jennie!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;How delightful! I was thinking of
                        you. Come income in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He welcomed her with an eager embrace.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was coming out to see you, believe me, I was. I was thinking all
                        along how I could straighten this matter out. And now you come. But
                        what&apos;s the trouble?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He held her at arm&apos;s length and studied her distressed face. The
                        fresh beauty of her seemed to him like cut lilies wet with dew.</p>
                    <p>He felt a great surge of tenderness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have something to ask you,&quot; she at last brought herself
                        to say. &quot;My brother is in jail. We need ten dollars to get him out,
                        and I didn&apos;t know where else to go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My poor child!&quot; he said, chafing her hands.
                        &quot;Where else should you go? Haven&apos;t I told you always to
                        come to me? Don&apos;t you know, Jennie, I would do anything in the
                        world for you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she gasped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, don&apos;t worry about that any more. But
                        won&apos;t fate ever cease striking at you, poor child? How did your
                        brother come to get in jail?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-082" n="75"/>
                    <p>&quot;They caught him throwing coal down from the cars,&quot; she
                        replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he replied, his sympathies touched and awakened. Here
                        was this boy arrested and fined for what fate was practically driving him to
                        do. Here was this girl pleading with him at night, in his room, for what to
                        her was a great necessityten dollars; to him, a mere nothing. &quot;I
                        will arrange about your brother,&quot; he said quickly.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t worry. I can get him out in half an hour. You sit
                        here now and be comfortable until I return.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He waved her to his easy-chair beside a large lamp, and hurried out of the
                        room.</p>
                    <p>Brander knew the sheriff who had personal supervision of the county jail. He
                        knew the judge who had administered the fine. It was but a five
                        minutes&apos; task to write a note to the judge asking him to revoke the
                        fine, for the sake of the boy&apos;s character, and send it by a
                        messenger to his home. Another ten minutes&apos; task to go personally
                        to the jail and ask his friend, the sheriff, to release the boy then and
                        there.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here is the money,&quot; he said. &quot;If the fine is
                        revoked you can return it to me. Let him go now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sheriff was only too glad to comply. He hastened below to personally
                        supervise the task, and Bass, a very much astonished boy, was set free. No
                        explanations were vouchsafed him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all right now,&quot; said the turnkey.
                        &quot;You&apos;re at liberty. Run along home and don&apos;t let
                        them catch you at anything like that again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bass went his way wondering, and the ex-Senator returned to his hotel trying
                        to decide just how this delicate situation should be handled. Obviously
                        Jennie had not told her father of her mission. She had come as a last
                        resource. She was now waiting for him in his room.</p>
                    <p>There are crises in all men&apos;s lives when they waver <pb
                            id="VAA2406-083" n="76"/> between the strict fulfilment of justice and
                        duty and the great possibilities for personal happiness which another line
                        of conduct seems to assure. And the dividing line is not always marked and
                        clear. He knew that the issue of taking her, even as his wife, was made
                        difficult by the senseless opposition of her father. The opinion of the
                        world brought up still another complication. Supposing he should take her
                        openly, what would the world say? She was a significant type emotionally,
                        that he knew. There was something thereartistically, temperamentally, which
                        was far and beyond the keenest suspicion of the herd. He did not know
                        himself quite what it was, but he felt a largeness of feeling not altogether
                        squared with intellect, or perhaps better yet, experience, which was worthy
                        of any man&apos;s desire. &quot;This remarkable girl,&quot; he
                        thought, seeing her clearly in his mind&apos;s eye.</p>
                    <p>Meditating as to what he should do, he returned to his hotel, and the room.
                        As he entered he was struck anew with her beauty, and with the irresistible
                        appeal of her personality. In the glow of the shaded lamp she seemed a
                        figure of marvelous potentiality.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, endeavoring to appear calm, &quot;I
                        have looked after your brother. He is out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She rose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she exclaimed, clasping her hands and stretching her
                        arms out toward him. There were tears of gratefulness in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>He saw them and stepped close to her. &quot;Jennie, for heaven&apos;s
                        sake don&apos;t cry,&quot; he entreated. &quot;You angel! You
                        sister of mercy! To think you should have to add tears to your other
                        sacrifices.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He drew her to him, and then all the caution of years deserted him. There was
                        a sense both of need and of fulfilment in his mood. At last, in spite of
                        other losses, fate had brought him what he most desiredlove, a woman whom he
                        could love. He took her in his arms, and kissed her again and again.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-084" n="[77]"/>
                    <p>The English Jefferies has told us that it requires a hundred and fifty years
                        to make a perfect maiden. &quot;From all enchanted things of earth and
                        air, this preciousness has been drawn. From the south wind that breathed a
                        century and a half over the green wheat; from the perfume of the growing
                        grasses waving over heavy-laden clover and laughing veronica, hiding the
                        green finches, baffling the bee; from rose-lined hedge, woodbine, and
                        cornflower, azure blue, where yellowing wheat stalks crowd up under the
                        shadow of green firs. All the devious brooklets&apos; sweetness where
                        the iris stays the sunlight; all the wild woods hold of beauty; all the
                        broad hills of thyme and freedomthrice a hundred years repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A hundred years of cowslips, bluebells, violets; purple spring and
                        golden autumn; sunshine, shower, and dewy mornings; the night immortal; all
                        the rhythm of time unrolling. A chronicle unwritten and past all power of
                        writing; who shall preserve a record of the petals that fell from the roses
                        a century ago? The swallows to the house-tops three hundred timesthink of
                        that! Thence she sprang, and the world yearns toward her beauty as to
                        flowers that are past. The loveliness of seventeen is centuries old. That is
                        why passion is almost sad.&quot;</p>

                        beauty were passing, and you were given these things to hold in your arms

                    <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
                    <p>THE significance of the material and spiritual changes which sometimes
                        overtake us are not very clear at the time. A sense of shock, a sense of
                        danger, and then apparently we subside to old ways, but the change has come.
                        Never again, here or elsewhere, will we be the same. Jennie pondering after
                        the subtle emotional turn which her evening&apos;s sympathetic
                        expedition had taken, was lost in a vague confusion of emotions. She had no
                        definite realization of what social and physical changes this new
                        relationship to the Senator might entail. She was not conscious as yet of
                        that shock which the possibility of maternity, even under the most favorable
                        conditions, must bring to the average woman. Her present attitude was one of
                        surprise, wonder, uncertainty; and at the same time she experienced a
                        genuine feeling of quiet happiness. Brander was a good man; now he was
                        closer to her than ever. He loved her. Because of this new relationship a
                        change in her social condition was to inevitably follow. Life was to be
                        radically different from now onwas different at this moment. Brander assured
                        her over and over of his enduring affection.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tell you, Jennie,&quot; he repeated, as she was leaving,
                        &quot;I don&apos;t want you to worry. This emotion of mine got the
                        best of me, but I&apos;ll marry you. I&apos;ve been carried off my
                        feet, but I&apos;ll make it up to you. Go home and say nothing at all.
                        Caution your brother, if it isn&apos;t too late. Keep your own counsel,
                        and I will marry you and take you away. I can&apos;t do it right now. I
                        don&apos;t <pb id="VAA2406-086" n="79"/> want to do it here. But
                        I&apos;m going to Washington, and I&apos;ll send for you. And
                        here&quot;he reached for his purse and took from it a hundred dollars,
                        practically all he had with him, &quot;take that. I&apos;ll send you
                        more tomorrow. You&apos;re my girl nowremember that. You belong to
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He embraced her tenderly.</p>
                    <p>She went out into the night, thinking. No doubt he would do as he said. She
                        dwelt, in imagination, upon the possibilities of a new and fascinating
                        existence. Of course he would marry her. Think of it! She would go to
                        Washingtonthat far-off place. And her father and motherthey would not need
                        to work so hard any more. And Bass, and Marthashe fairly glowed as she
                        recounted to herself the many ways in which she could help them all.</p>
                    <p>A block away she waited for Brander, who accompanied her to her own gate, and
                        waited while she made a cautious reconnaissance. She slipped up the steps
                        and tried the door. It was open. She paused a moment to indicate to her
                        lover that she was safe, and entered. All was silent within. She slipped to
                        her own room and heard Veronica breathing. She went quietly to where Bass
                        slept with George. He was in bed, stretched out as if asleep. When she
                        entered he asked, &quot;Is that you, Jennie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where have you been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Have you seen papa and
                        mamma?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did they know I had gone out?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma did. She told me not to ask after you. Where have you
                        been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I went to see Senator Brander for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that was it. They didn&apos;t say why they let me
                        out.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-087" n="80"/>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t tell any one,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t want any one to know. You know how papa feels about
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he replied. But he was curious as to what the
                        ex-Senator thought, what he had done, and how she had appealed to him. She
                        explained briefly; then she heard her mother come to the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jennie,&quot; she whispered.</p>
                    <p>Jennie went out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, why did you go?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t help it, ma,&quot; she replied. &quot;I
                        thought I must do something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why did you stay so long?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He wanted to talk to me,&quot; she answered evasively.</p>
                    <p>Her mother looked at her nervously, wanly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have been so afraid, oh, so afraid. Your father went to your
                        room, but I said you were asleep. He locked the front door, but I opened it
                        again. When Bass came in he wanted to call you, but I persuaded him to wait
                        until morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again she looked wistfully at her daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m all right, mamma,&quot; said Jennie encouragingly.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll tell you all about it to-morrow. Go to bed. How does
                        he think Bass got out?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He doesn&apos;t know. He thought maybe they just let him go
                        because he couldn&apos;t pay the fine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie laid her hand lovingly on her mother&apos;s shoulder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go to bed,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>She was already years older in thought and act. She felt as though she must
                        help her mother now as well as herself.</p>
                    <p>The days which followed were ones of dreamy uncertainty to Jennie. She went
                        over in her mind these dramatic events time and time and time and again. It
                        was not such a difficult matter to tell her mother that the Senator had
                        talked again of marriage, that he proposed to come and get her after his
                        next trip to Washington, that he had given her a hundred dollars and
                        intended <pb id="VAA2406-088" n="81"/> to give her more, but of that other
                        matterthe one all-important thing, she could not bring herself to speak. It
                        was too sacred. The balance of the money that he had promised her arrived by
                        messenger the following day, four hundred dollars in bills, with the
                        admonition that she should put it in a local bank. The ex-Senator explained
                        that he was already on his way to Washington, but that he would come back or
                        send for her. &quot;Keep a stout heart,&quot; he wrote.
                        &quot;There are better days in store for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Brander was gone, and Jennie&apos;s fate was really in the balance. But
                        her mind still retained all of the heart-innocence, and unsophistication of
                        her youth; a certain gentle wistfulness was the only outward change in her
                        demeanor. He would surely send for her. There was the mirage of a distant
                        country and wondrous scenes looming up in her mind. She had a little fortune
                        in the bank, more than she had ever dreamed of, with which to help her
                        mother. There were natural, girlish anticipations of good still holding
                        over, which made her less apprehensive than she could otherwise possibly
                        have been. All nature, life, possibility was in the balance. It might turn
                        good, or ill, but with so inexperienced a soul it would not be entirely evil
                        until it was so.</p>
                    <p>How a mind under such uncertain circumstances could retain so comparatively
                        placid a vein is one of those marvels which find their explanation in the
                        inherent trustfulness of the spirit of youth. It is not often that the minds
                        of men retain the perceptions of their younger days. The marvel is not that
                        one should thus retain, but that any should ever lose them Go the world
                        over, and after you have put away the wonder and tenderness of youth what is
                        there left? The few sprigs of green that sometimes invade the barrenness of
                        your materialism, the few glimpses of summer which flash past the eye of the
                        wintry soul, the half hours off during the long tedium of burrowing, these
                        reveal to the hardened earth-seeker <pb id="VAA2406-089" n="82"/> the
                        universe which the youthful mind has with it always. No fear and no favor;
                        the open fields and the light upon the hills; morning, noon, night; stars,
                        the bird-calls, the water&apos;s purlthese are the natural inheritance
                        of the mind of the child. Men call it poetic, those who are hardened
                        fanciful. In the days of their youth it was natural, but the receptiveness
                        of youth has departed, and they cannot see.</p>
                    <p>How this worked out in her personal actions was to be seen only in a slightly
                        accentuated wistfulness, a touch of which was in every task. Sometimes she
                        would wonder that no letter came, but at the same time she would recall the
                        fact that he had specified a few weeks, and hence the six that actually
                        elapsed did not seem so long.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile the distinguished ex-Senator had gone light-heartedly to his
                        conference with the President, he had joined in a pleasant round of social
                        calls, and he was about to pay a short country visit to some friends in
                        Maryland, when he was seized with a slight attack of fever, which confined
                        him to his room for a few days. He felt a little irritated that he should be
                        laid up just at this time, but never suspected that there was anything
                        serious in his indisposition. Then the doctor discovered that he was
                        suffering from a virulent form of typhoid, the ravages of which took away
                        his senses for a time and left him very weak. He was thought to be
                        convalescing, however, when just six weeks after he had last parted with
                        Jennie, he was seized with a sudden attack of heart failure and never
                        regained consciousness. Jennie remained blissfully ignorant of his illness
                        and did not even see the heavy-typed headlines of the announcement of his
                        death until Bass came home that evening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here, Jennie,&quot; he said excitedly,
                        &quot;Brander&apos;s dead!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He held up the newspaper, on the first column of which was printed in heavy
                        block type:<q rend="blockquote">

                            <p>Jennie looked at it in blank amazement. &quot;Dead?&quot; she
                                exclaimed.</p>
                            <p>&quot;There it is in the paper,&quot; returned Bass, his tone
                                being that of one who is imparting a very interesting piece of news.
                                &quot;He died at ten o&apos;clock this
                            morning.&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
                    <p>JENNIE took the paper with but ill-concealed trembling and went into the
                        adjoining room. There she stood by the front window and looked at it again,
                        a sickening sensation of dread holding her as though in a trance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is dead,&quot; was all that her mind could formulate for the
                        time, and as she stood there the voice of Bass recounting the fact to
                        Gerhardt in the adjoining room sounded in her ears. &quot;Yes, he is
                        dead,&quot; she heard him say; and once again she tried to get some
                        conception of what it meant to her. But her mind seemed a blank.</p>
                    <p>A moment later Mrs. Gerhardt joined her. She had heard Bass&apos;s
                        announcement and had seen Jennie leave the room, but her trouble with
                        Gerhardt over the Senator had caused her to be careful of any display of
                        emotion. No conception of the real state of affairs ever having crossed her
                        mind, she was only interested in seeing how Jennie would take this sudden
                        annihilation of her hopes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it too bad?&quot; she said, with real sorrow.
                        &quot;To think that he should have to die just when he was going to do
                        so much for youfor us all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused, expecting some word of agreement, but Jennie remained unwontedly
                        dumb.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t feel badly,&quot; continued Mrs. Gerhardt.
                        &quot;It can&apos;t be helped. He meant to do a good deal, but you
                        mustn&apos;t think of that now. It&apos;s all over, and it
                        can&apos;t be helped, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused again, and still Jennie remained motionless <pb id="VAA2406-092"
                            n="85"/> and mute. Mrs. Gerhardt, seeing how useless her words were,
                        concluded that Jennie wished to be alone, and she went away.</p>
                    <p>Still Jennie stood there, and now, as the real significance of the news began
                        to formulate itself into consecutive thought, she began to realize the
                        wretchedness of her position, its helplessness. She went into her bedroom
                        and sat down upon the side of the bed, from which position she saw a very
                        pale, distraught face staring at her from out of the small mirror. She
                        looked at it uncertainly; could that really be her own countenance?
                        &quot;I&apos;ll have to go away,&quot; she thought, and began,
                        with the courage of despair, to wonder what refuge would be open to her.</p>
                    <p>In the mean time the evening meal was announced, and, to maintain
                        appearances, she went out and joined the family; the naturalness of her part
                        was very difficult to sustain. Gerhardt observed her subdued condition
                        without guessing the depth of emotion which it covered. Bass was too much
                        interested in his own affairs to pay particular attention to anybody.</p>
                    <p>During the days that followed Jennie pondered over the difficulties of her
                        position and wondered what she should do. Money she had, it was true; but no
                        friends, no experience, no place to go. She had always lived with her
                        family. She began to feel unaccountable sinkings of spirit, nameless and
                        formless fears seemed to surround and haunt her. Once when she arose in the
                        morning she felt an uncontrollable desire to cry, and frequently thereafter
                        this feeling would seize upon her at the most inopportune times. Mrs.
                        Gerhardt began to note her moods, and one afternoon she resolved to question
                        her daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now you must tell me what&apos;s the matter with you,&quot;
                        she said quietly. &quot;Jennie, you must tell your mother
                        everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie, to whom confession had seemed impossible, <pb id="VAA2406-093" n="86"
                        /> under the sympathetic persistence of her mother broke down at last and
                        made the fatal confession. Mrs. Gerhardt stood there, too dumb with misery
                        to give vent to a word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she said at last, a great wave of self-accusation
                        sweeping over her, &quot;it is all my fault. I might have known. But
                        we&apos;ll do what we can.&quot; She broke down and sobbed aloud.</p>
                    <p>After a time she went back to the washing she had to do, and stood over her
                        tub rubbing and crying. The tears ran down her cheeks and dropped into the
                        suds. Once in a while she stopped and tried to dry her eyes with her apron,
                        but they soon filled again.</p>
                    <p>Now that the first shock had passed, there came the vivid consciousness of
                        ever-present danger. What would Gerhardt do if he learned the truth? He had
                        often said that if ever one of his daughters should act like some of those
                        he knew he would turn her out of doors. &quot;She should not stay under
                        my roof!&quot; he had exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m so afraid of your father,&quot; Mrs. Gerhardt
                        often said to Jennie in this intermediate period. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        know what he&apos;ll say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps I&apos;d better go away,&quot; suggested her
                        daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said; &quot;he needn&apos;t know just
                        yet. Wait awhile.&quot; But in her heart of hearts she knew that the
                        evil day could not be long postponed.</p>
                    <p>One day, when her own suspense had reached such a pitch that it could no
                        longer be endured, Mrs. Gerhardt sent Jennie away with the children, hoping
                        to be able to tell her husband before they returned. All the morning she
                        fidgeted about, dreading the opportune moment and letting him retire to his
                        slumber without speaking. When afternoon came she did not go out to work,
                        because she could not leave with her painful duty unfulfilled. Gerhardt
                        arose at four, and still she hesitated, knowing full well that Jennie would
                        soon return and that the specially prepared occasion would then be lost. It
                        is <pb id="VAA2406-094" n="87"/> almost certain that she would not have had
                        the courage to say anything if he himself had not brought up the subject of
                        Jennie&apos;s appearance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She doesn&apos;t look well,&quot; he said. &quot;There
                        seems to be something the matter with her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; began Mrs. Gerhardt, visibly struggling with her
                        fears, and moved to make an end of it at any cost, &quot;Jennie is in
                        trouble. I don&apos;t know what to do. She&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt, who had unscrewed a door-lock and was trying to mend it, looked up
                        sharply from his work.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt had her apron in her hands at the time, her nervous tendency to
                        roll it coming upon her. She tried to summon sufficient courage to explain,
                        but fear mastered her completely; she lifted the apron to her eyes and began
                        to cry.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt looked at her and rose. He was a man with the Calvin type of face,
                        rather spare, with skin sallow and discolored as the result of age and work
                        in the wind and rain. When he was surprised or angry sparks of light
                        glittered in his eyes. He frequently pushed his hair back when he was
                        troubled, and almost invariably walked the floor; just now he looked alert
                        and dangerous.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is that you say?&quot; he inquired in German, his voice
                        straining to a hard note. &quot;In troublehas some one&quot; He
                        paused and flung his hand upward. &quot;Why don&apos;t you
                        speak?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never thought,&quot; went on Mrs. Gerhardt, frightened, and
                        yet following her own train of thought, &quot;that anything like that
                        would happen to her. She was such a good girl. Oh!&quot; she concluded,
                        &quot;to think he should ruin Jennie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;By thunder!&quot; shouted Gerhardt, giving way to a fury of
                        feeling, &quot;I thought so! Brander! Ha! Your fine man! That comes of
                        letting her go running around <pb id="VAA2406-095" n="88"/> at nights,
                        buggy-riding, walking the streets. I thought so. God in heaven!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He broke from his dramatic attitude and struck out in a fierce stride across
                        the narrow chamber, turning like a caged animal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ruined!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Ruined! Ha! So he has
                        ruined her, has he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Suddenly he stopped like an image jerked by a string. He was directly in
                        front of Mrs. Gerhardt, who had retired to the table at the side of the
                        wall, and was standing there pale with fear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is dead now!&quot; he shouted, as if this fact had now first
                        occurred to him. &quot;He is dead!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He put both hands to his temples, as if he feared his brain would give way,
                        and stood looking at her, the mocking irony of the situation seening to burn
                        in his brain like fire.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dead!&quot; he repeated, and Mrs. Gerhardt, fearing for the
                        reason of the man, shrank shall farther away, her wits taken up rather with
                        the tragedy of the figure he presented than with the actual substance of his
                        woe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He intended to marry her,&quot; she pleaded nervously.
                        &quot;He would have married her if he had not died.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would have!&quot; shouted Gerhardt, coming out of his trance at
                        the sound of her voice. &quot;Would have! That&apos;s a fine thing
                        to talk about now. Would have! The hound! May his soul burn in hellthe dog!
                        Ah, God, I hopeI hope If I were not a Christian&quot; He clenched his
                        hands, the awfulness of his passion shaking him like a leaf.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt burst into tears, and her husband turned away, his own feelings
                        far too intense for him to have any sympathy with her. He walked to and fro,
                        his heavy step shaking the kitchen floor. After a time he came back, a new
                        phase of the dread calamity having offered itself to his mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When did this happen?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-096" n="89"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; returned Mrs. Gerhardt, too table
                        stricken to tell the truth. &quot;I only found it out the
                            <unclear>ot--day.</unclear>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You lie!&quot; he exclaimed in his excitement. &quot;You
                        were always shielding her. It is your fault that she is where she is. If you
                        had let me have my way there would have been no cause for our trouble
                        to-night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A fine ending,&quot; he went on to himself. &quot;A fine
                        ending. My boy gets into jail; my daughter walks the streets and gets
                        herself talked about; the neighbors come to me with open remarks about my
                        children; and now this scoundrel ruins her. By the God in heaven, I
                        don&apos;t know what has got into my children!</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know how it is,&quot; he
                        <unclear>we--</unclear>, on, unconsciously commiserating himself. &quot;
                        I try, I <unclear>-ry</unclear>! Every night I pray that the Lord will let
                        me de right, but it is no use. I might work and work. My handslook at
                        themare rough with work. All my life I have tried to be an honest man.
                        Nownow&quot; His voice broke, and it seemed for a moment as if he would
                        give way to tears. Suddenly he turned on his wife, the major passion of
                        anger possessing him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are the cause of this,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;You
                        are the sole cause. If you had done as I told you to do this would not have
                        happened. No, you wouldn&apos;t do that. She must go out! out!! out!!!
                        She has become a streetwalker, that&apos;s what she has become. She has
                        set herself right to go to hell. Let her go. I wash my hands of the whole
                        thing. This is enough for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He made as if to go off to his little bedroom, but he had no sooner reached
                        the door than he came back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She shall get out!&quot; he said electrically. &quot;She
                        shall not stay under my roof! To-night! At once! I will not let her enter my
                        door again. I will show her whether she will disgrace me or not!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t turn her out on the streets
                        to-night,&quot; pleaded Mrs. Gerhardt. &quot;She has no place to
                        go.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-097" n="90"/>
                    <p>
                        <unclear/> at <unclear>----night!</unclear>&quot; he repeated.
                        &quot;This very minute! Let find a home. She did not want this one. Let
                        her go out now. We will see how the world treats her.&quot; He walked
                        out of the room, inflexible resolution fixed upon his rugged features.</p>
                    <p>At half-past five, when Mrs. Gerhardt was tearfully going about the duty of
                        getting supper, Jennie returned. Her mother started when she heard the door
                        open, for now she knew the storm would burst afresh. Her father met her on
                        the threshold.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get out of my sight!&quot; he said savagely. &quot;You
                        shall not stay another hour in my house. I don&apos;t want to see you
                        any more. Get out!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie stood before him, pale, trembling a little, and silent. The children
                        she had brought home with her crowded about in frightened amazement.
                        Veronica and Martha, who loved her dearly, began to cry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter?&quot; George asked, his mouth open
                        in wonder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She shall get out,&quot; reiterated Genhardt. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t want her under my roof. If she wa cs to be a streetwalker,
                        let her be one, but she shall n c stay here. Pack your things,&quot; he
                        added, staring at <unclear>he-</unclear>.</p>
                    <p>Jennie had no word to say, but the children cried loudly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be still,&quot; said Gerhardt. &quot;Go into the
                        kitchen.&quot; He drove them all out and followed stubbornly himself.</p>
                    <p>Jennie went quietly to her room. She gathered up her few little belongings
                        and began, with tears, to put them into a valise her mother brought her. The
                        little girlish trinkets that she had accumulated from time to time she did
                        not take. She saw them, but thought of her younger sisters, and let them
                        stay. Martha and Veronica would have assisted her, but their father forbade
                        them to go.</p>
                    <p>At six o&apos;clock Bass came in, and seeing the nervous <pb
                            id="VAA2406-098" n="91"/> assembly in the kitchen, inquired what the
                        trouble was.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt looked at him grimly, but did not answer. &quot;What&apos;s
                        the trouble?&quot; insisted Bass. &quot;What are you all sitting
                        around for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is driving Jennie away,&quot; whispered Mrs. Gerhardt
                        tearfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What for?&quot; asked Bass, opening his eyes in astonishment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall tell you what for,&quot; broke in Gerhardt, still
                        speaking in German. &quot;Because she&apos;s a street-walker,
                        that&apos;s what for. She goes and get herself ruined by a man thirty
                        years older than she is, man old enough to be her father. Let her get out o
                        this. She shall not stay here another minute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bass looked about him, and the children opened their eyes. All felt clearly
                        that some ning terrible had happened, even the little ones. None but Bass
                        understood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you want to send her out to-night for?&quot; he
                        inquired. &quot;This is no time to send a girl out on the streets.
                        Can&apos;t she stay here until morning?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Gerhardt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He oughtn&apos;t to do that,&quot; put in the mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She goes now,&quot; said Gerhardt. &quot;Let that be an end
                        of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is she going to go?&quot; insisted Bass.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; Mrs. Gerhardt interpolated weakly.
                        Bass looked around, but did nothing until Mrs. Gerhardt motioned him toward
                        the front door when her husband was not looking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go in! Go in!&quot; was the import of her gesture.</p>
                    <p>Bass went in, and then Mrs. Gerhardt dared to leave her work and follow. The
                        children stayed awhile, but, one by one, even they slipped away, leaving
                        Gerhardt alone. When he thought that time enough had elapsed he arose.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-099" n="[92]"/>
                    <p>In the interval Jennie had been hastily coached by her mother.</p>
                    <p>Jennie should go to a private boarding-house somewhere, and send back her
                        address. Bass should not accompany her, but she should wait a little way up
                        the street, and he would follow. When her father was away the mother might
                        get to see her, or Jennie could come home. All else must be postponed until
                        they could meet again.</p>
                    <p>While the discussion was still going on, Gerhardt came in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is she going?&quot; he asked harshly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Mrs. Gerhardt, with her first and only note
                        of defiance.</p>
                    <p>Bass said, &quot;What&apos;s the hurry?&quot; But Gerhardt
                        frowned too mightily for him to venture on any further remonstrance.</p>
                    <p>Jennie entered, wearing her one good dress and carrying her valise. There was
                        fear in her eyes, for she was passing through a fiery ordeal, but she had
                        become a woman. The strength of love was with her, the support of patience
                        and the ruling sweetness of sacrifice. Silently she kissed her another,
                        while tears fell fast. Then she turned, and the door closed upon her as she
                        went forth to a new life.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER X</head>
                    <p>THE world into which Jennie was thus unduly thrust forth was that in which
                        virtue has always vainly struggled since time immemorial; for virtue is the
                        wishing well and the doing well unto others. Virtue is that quality of
                        generosity which offers itself willingly for another&apos;s service,
                        and, being this, it is held by society to be nearly worthless. Sell yourself
                        cheaply and you shall be used lightly and trar pled under foot. Hold
                        yourself dearly, however unw rthily, and you will be respected. Society, in
                        the mas, lacks woefully in the matter of discrimination. Its one criterion
                        is the opinion of others. Its one test that of self-preservation. Has he
                        preserved his fortune? Has she preserved her purity? Only in rare instances
                        and with rare individuals does there seem to be any guiding light from
                        within.</p>
                    <p>Jennie had not sought to hold herself dear. Innate feeling in her made for
                        self-sacrifice. She could not be readily corrupted by the world&apos;s
                        selfish lessons on how to preserve oneself from the evil to come.</p>
                    <p>It is in such supreme moments that growth is greatest. It comes as with a
                        vast surge, this feeling of strength and sufficiency. We may still tremble,
                        the fear of doing wretchedly may linger, but we grow. Flashes of inspiration
                        come to guide the soul. In nature there is no outside. When we are cast from
                        a group or a condition we have still the companionship of all that is.
                        Nature is not ungenerous. Its winds and stars are fellows with you. Let the
                        soul be but gentle and receptive, and this fast truth will come homenot in
                        set phrases, perhaps, <pb id="VAA2406-101" n="94"/> but as a feeling, a
                        comfort, which, after all, is the last essence of knowledge. In the universe
                        peace is wisdom.</p>
                    <p>Jennie had hardly turned from the door when she was overtaken by Bass.
                        &quot;Give me your grip,&quot; he said; and then seeing that she was
                        dumb with unutterable feeling, he added, &quot;I think I know where I
                        can get you a room.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He led the way to the southern part of the city, where they were not known,
                        and up to the door of an old lady whose parlor clock had been recently
                        purchased from the instalment firm by whom he was now employed. She was not
                        well off, he knew, and had a room to rent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that room of yours still vacant?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, looking at Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you&apos;d let my sister have it. We&apos;re moving
                        away, and she can&apos;t go yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old lady expressed her willingness, and Jennie was soon temporarily
                        installed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry now,&quot; said Bass, who feet rather
                        sorry for her. &quot;This&apos;ll blow over. Ma said I should tell
                        you not to worry. Come up to-morrow <unclear>wb-n</unclear> he&apos;s
                        gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie said she would, and, after giving her further oral encouragement, he
                        arranged with the old lady about board, and took his leave.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all right now,&quot; he said encouragingly as he
                        went out. &quot;You&apos;ll come out all right. Don&apos;t
                        worry. I&apos;ve got to go back, but I&apos;ll come around in the
                        morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went away, and the bitter stress of it blew lightly over his head, for he
                        was thinking that Jennie had made a mistake. This was shown by the manner in
                        which he had asked her questions as they had walked together, and that in
                        the face of her sad and doubtful mood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;d you want to do that for?&quot; and
                        &quot;Didn&apos;t you ever think what you were doing?&quot; he
                        persisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please don&apos;t ask me to-night,&quot; Jennie had said,
                        which put an end to the sharpest form of his queries. She had no excuse to
                        offer and no complaint to make <pb id="VAA2406-102" n="95"/> If any blame
                        attached, very likely it was hers. His own misfortune and the
                        family&apos;s and her sacrifice were alike forgotten.</p>
                    <p>Left alone in her strange abode, Jennie gave way to her saddened feelings.
                        The shock and shame of being banished from her home overcame her, and she
                        wept. Although of a naturally long-suffering and uncomplaining disposition,
                        the catastrophic wind-up of all her hopes was too much for her. What was
                        this element in life that could seize and overwhelm one as does a great
                        wind? Why this sudden intrusion of death to shatter all that had seemed most
                        promising in life?</p>
                    <p>As she thought over the past, a very clear recollection of the details of her
                        long relationship with Brander came back to her, and for all her suffering
                        she could only feel a loving affection for him. After all, he had not
                        deliberately willed her any harm. His kindness, his generositythese things
                        had been real. He had been essentially a good man, and she was sorrymore for
                        his sake than for her ownthat his end had been so untimely.</p>
                    <p>These cogitations, while not at all reassuring, at least served to pass the
                        night away, and the next morning Bass stopped on his way to work to say that
                        Mrs. Gerhardt wished her to come home that same evening. Gerhardt would not
                        be present, and they could talk it over. She spent the day lonesomely
                        enough, but when night fell her spirits brightened, and at a quarter of
                        eight she set out.</p>
                    <p>There was not much of comforting news to tell her. Gerhardt was still in a
                        direfully angry and outraged mood. He had already decided to throw up his
                        place on the following Saturday and go to Youngstown. Any place was better
                        than Columbus after this; he could never expect to hold up his head here
                        again. Its memories were odious. He would go away now, and if he succeeded
                        in finding work the family should follow, a decision which meant the
                        abandoning of the little home. <pb id="VAA2406-103" n="96"/> He was not
                        going to try to meet the mortgage on the househe could not hope to.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the week Gerhardt took his leave, Jennie returned home, and for
                        a time at least there was a restoration of the old order, a condition which,
                        of course, could not endure.</p>
                    <p>Bass saw it. Jennie&apos;s trouble and its possible consequences weighed
                        upon him disagreeably. Columbus was no place to stay. Youngstown was no
                        place to go. If they should all move away to some larger city it would be
                        much better.</p>
                    <p>He pondered over the situation, and hearing that a manufacturing boom was on
                        in Cleveland, he thought it might be wise to try his luck there. If he
                        succeeded, the others might follow. If Gerhardt still worked on in
                        Youngstown, as he was now doing, and the family came to Cleveland, it would
                        save Jennie from being turned out in the streets.</p>
                    <p>Bass waited a little while before making up his mind, but finally announced
                        his purpose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe I&apos;ll go up to Cleveland,&quot; he said to
                        his mother one evening as she was getting supper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; she asked, looking up uncertainly. She was rather
                        afraid that Bass would desert her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I can get work there,&quot; he returned. &quot;We
                        oughtn&apos;t to stay in this darned old town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t swear,&quot; she returned reprovingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; he said, &quot;but it&apos;s enough
                        to make any one swear. We&apos;ve never had anything but rotten luck
                        here. I&apos;m going to go, and maybe if I get anything we can all move.
                        We&apos;d be better off if we&apos;d get some place where people
                        don&apos;t know us. We can&apos;t be anything here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt listened with a strong hope for a betterment of their miserable
                        life creeping into her heart. If Bass would only do this. If he would go and
                        get work, and come to her rescue, as a strong bright young son <pb
                            id="VAA2406-104" n="[97]"/> might, what a thing it would be! They were
                        in the rapids of a life which was moving toward a dreadful calamity. If only
                        something would happen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think you could get something to do?&quot; she asked
                        interestedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ought to,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve never looked
                        for a place yet that I didn&apos;t get it. Other fellows have gone up
                        there and done all right. Look at the Millers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shoved his hands into his pockets and looked out the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think you could get along until I try my hand up
                        there?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess we could,&quot; she replied. &quot;Papa&apos;s
                        at work now and we have some money that, that--&quot; she hesitated to
                        name the source, so ashamed was she of their predicament.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; said Bass, grimly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We won&apos;t have to pay any rent here before fall and then
                        we&apos;ll have to give it up anyhow,&quot; she added.</p>
                    <p>She was referring to the mortgage on the house, which fell due the next
                        September and which unquestionably could not be met. &quot;If we could
                        move away from here before then, I guess we could get along.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll do it,&quot; said Bass determinedly.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, he threw up his place at the end of the month, and the day after
                        he left for Cleveland.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
                    <p>The incidents of the days that followed, relating as they did peculiarly to
                        Jennie, were of an order which the morality of our day has agreed to taboo.</p>
                    <p>Certain processes of the all-mother, the great artificing wisdom of the power
                        that works and weaves in silence and in darkness, when viewed in the light
                        of the established opinion of some of the little individuals created by it,
                        are considered very vile. We turn our faces away from the creation of life
                        as if that were the last thing that man should dare to interest himself in,
                        openly.</p>
                    <p>It is curious that a feeling of this sort should spring up in a world whose
                        very essence is generative, the vast process dual, and where wind, water,
                        soil, and light alike minister to the fruition of that which is all that we
                        are. Although the whole earth, not we alone, is moved by passions hymeneal,
                        and everything terrestrial has come into being by the one common road, yet
                        there is that ridiculous tendency to close the eyes and turn away the head
                        as if there were something unclean in nature itself. &quot;Conceived in
                        iniquity and born in sin,&quot; is the unnatural interpretation put upon
                        the process by the extreme religionist, and the world, by its silence, gives
                        assen to a judgment so marvelously warped.</p>
                    <p>Surely there is something radically wrong in this attitude. The teachings of
                        philosophy and the deductions of biology should find more practical
                        application in the daily reasoning of man. No process is vile, no condition
                        is unnatural. The accidental variation from a given social practice does not
                        necessarily entail sin. No <pb id="VAA2406-106" n="99"/> poor little
                        earthling, caught in the enormous grip of chance, and so swerved from the
                        established customs of men, could possibly be guilty of that depth of
                        vileness which the attitude of the world would seem to predieate so
                        inevitably.</p>
                    <p>Jennie was now to witness the unjust interpretation of that wonder of nature,
                        which, but for Brander&apos;s death, might have been consecrated and
                        hallowed as one of the ideal functions of life. Although herself unable to
                        distinguish the separateness of this from every other normal process of
                        life, yet was she made to feel, by the actions of all about her, that
                        degradation was her portion and sin the foundation as well as the condition
                        of her state. Almost, not quite, it was sought to extinguish the affection,
                        the consideration, the care which, afterward, the world would demand of her,
                        for her child. Almost, not quite, was the budding and essential love looked
                        upon as evil. Although her punishment was neither the gibbet nor the jail of
                        a few hundred years before, yet the ignorance and immobility of the human
                        beings about her made it impossible for them to see anything in her present
                        condition but a vile and premeditated infraction of the social code, the
                        punishment of which was ostracism. All she could do now was to shun the
                        scornful gaze of men, and to bear in silence the great change that was
                        coming upon her. Strangely enough, she felt no useless remorse, no vain
                        regrets. Her heart was pure, and she was conscious that it was filled with
                        peace. Sorrow there was, it is true, but only a mellow phase of it, a vague
                        uncertainty and wonder, which would sometimes cause her eyes to fill with
                        tears.</p>
                    <p>You have heard the wood-dove calling in the lone stillness of the summertime;
                        you have found the unheeded brooklet singing and babbling where no ear comes
                        to hear. Under dead leaves and snow-banks the delicate arbutus unfolds its
                        simple blossom, answering some heavenly call for color. So, too, this other
                        flower of womanhood.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-107" n="100"/>
                    <p>Jennie was left alone, but, like the wood-dove, she was a voice of sweetness
                        in the summer-time. Going about her household duties, she was content to
                        wait, without a murmur, the fulfilment of that process for which, after all,
                        she was but the sacrificial implement. When her duties were lightest she was
                        content to sit in quiet meditation, the marvel of life holding her as in a
                        trance. When she was hardest pressed to aid her mother, she would sometimes
                        find herself quietly singing, the pleasure of work lifting her out of
                        herself. Always she was content to face the future with a serene and
                        unfaltering courage. It is not so with all women. Nature is unkind in
                        permitting the minor type to bear a child at all. The larger natures in
                        their maturity welcome motherhood, see in it the immense possibilities of
                        racial fulfilment, and find joy and satisfaction in being the hand-maiden of
                        so immense a purpose.</p>
                    <p>Jennie, a child in years, was potentially a woman physically and mentally,
                        but not yet come into rounded conclusions as to life and her place in it.
                        The great situation which had forced her into this anomalous position was
                        from one point of view a tribute to her individual capacity. It proved her
                        courage, the largeness of her sympathy, her willingness to sacrifice for
                        what she considered a worthy cause. That it resulted in an unexpected
                        consequence, which placed upon her a larger and more complicated burden, was
                        due to the fact that her sense of self-protection had not been commensurate
                        with her emotions. There were times when the prospective coming of the child
                        gave her a sense of fear and confusion, because she did not know but that
                        the child might eventually reproach her; but there was always that saving
                        sense of eternal justice in life which would not permit her to be utterly
                        crushed. To her way of thinking, people were not intentionally cruel. Vague
                        thoughts of sympathy and divine goodness permeated her soul. Life at worst
                        or best was beautifulhad always been so.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-108" n="101"/>
                    <p>These thoughts did not come to her all at once, but through the months during
                        which she watched and waited. It was a wonderful thing to be a mother, even
                        under these untoward conditions. She felt that she would love this child,
                        would be a good mother to it if life permitted. That was the problemwhat
                        would life permit?</p>
                    <p>There were many things to be doneclothes to be made; certain provisions of
                        hygiene and diet to be observed. One of her fears was that Gerhardt might
                        unexpectedly return, but he did not. The old family doctor who had nursed
                        the various members of the Gerhardt family through their multitudinous
                        ailmentsDoctor Ellwangerwas taken into consultation, and he gave sound and
                        practical advice. Despite his Lutheran upbringing, the practice of medicine
                        in a large and kindly way had led him to the conclusion that there are more
                        things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophies and in
                        our small neighborhood relationships. &quot;So it is,&quot; he
                        observed to Mrs. Gerhardt when she confided to him nervously what the
                        trouble was &quot;Well, you mustn&apos;t worry. These things happen
                        in more places than you think. If you knew as much about life as I do, and
                        about your neighbors, you would not cry. Your girl will be all right. She is
                        very healthy. She can go away somewhere afterward, and people will never
                        know. Why should you worry about what your neighbors think. It is not so
                        uncommon as you imagine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt marveled. He was such a wise man. It gave her a little courage.
                        As for Jennie, she listened to his advice with interest and without fear.
                        She wanted things not so much for herself as for her child, and she was
                        anxious to do whatever she was told. The doctor was curious to know who the
                        father was; when informed he lifted his eyes. &quot;Indeed,&quot; he
                        commented. &quot;That ought to be a bright baby.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-109" n="[102]"/>
                    <p>There came the final hour when the child was ushered into the world. It was
                        Doctor Ellwanger who presided, assisted by the mother, who, having brought
                        forth six herself, knew exactly what to do. There was no difficulty, and at
                        the first cry of the new-born infant there awakened in Jennie a tremendous
                        yearning toward it. This was <hi rend="i">her</hi> child! It was weak and
                        feeblea little girl, and it needed her care. She took it to her breast, when
                        it had been bathed and swaddled, with a tremendous sense of satisfaction and
                        joy. This was her child, her little girl. She wanted to live to be able to
                        work for it, and rejoiced, even in her weakness, that she was so strong.
                        Doctor Ellwanger predicted a quick recovery. He thought two weeks would be
                        the outside limit of her need to stay in bed. As a matter of fact, in ten
                        days she was up and about, as vigorous and healthy as ever. She had been
                        born with strength and with that nurturing quality which makes the ideal
                        mother.</p>
                    <p>The great crisis had passed, and now life went on much as before. The
                        children, outside of Bass, were too young to understand fully, and had been
                        deceived by the story that Jennie was married to Senator Brander, who had
                        died. They did not know that a child was coming until it was there. The
                        neighbors were feared by Mrs. Gerhardt, for they were ever watchful and
                        really knew all. Jennie would never have braved this local atmosphere except
                        for the advice of Bass, who, having secured a place in Cleveland some time
                        before, had written that he thought when she was well enough it would be
                        advisable for the whole family to seek a new start in Cleveland. Things were
                        flourishing there. Once away they would never hear of their present
                        neighbors and Jennie could find something to do. So she stayed at home.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
                    <p>BASS was no sooner in Cleveland than the marvel of that growing city was
                        sufficient to completely restore his equanimity of soul and to stir up new
                        illusions as to the possibility of rehabilitation for himself and his
                        family. &quot;If only they could come here,&quot; he thought.
                        &quot;If only they could all get work and do right.&quot; Here was
                        no evidence of any of their recent troubles, no acquaintances who could
                        suggest by their mere presence the troubles of the past. All was business,
                        all activity. The very turning of the corner seemed to rid one of old times
                        and crimes. It was as if a new world existed in every block.</p>
                    <p>He soon found a place in a cigar store, and, after working a few weeks, he
                        began to write home the cheering ideas he had in mind. Jennie ought to come
                        as soon as she was able, and then, if she found something to do, the others
                        might follow. There was plenty of work for girls of her age. She could live
                        in the same house with him temporarily; or maybe they could take one of the
                        fifteen-dollar-a-month cottages that were for rent. There were big general
                        furnishing houses, where one could buy everything needful for a small house
                        on very easy monthly terms. His mother could come and keep house for them.
                        They would be in a clean, new atmosphere, unknown and untalked about. They
                        could start life all over again; they could be decent, honorable,
                        prosperous.</p>
                    <p>Filled with this hope and the glamor which new scenes and new environment
                        invariably throw over the unsophisticated mind, he wrote a final letter, in
                        which he <pb id="VAA2406-111" n="104"/> suggested that Jennie should come at
                        once. This was when the baby was six months old. There were theaters here,
                        he said, and beautiful streets. Vessels from the lakes came into the heart
                        of the city. It was a wonderful city, and growing very fast. It was thus
                        that the new life appealed to him.</p>
                    <p>The effect which all this had upon Mrs. Gerhardt, Jennie, and the rest of the
                        family was phenomenal. Mrs. Gerhardt, long weighed upon by the misery which
                        Jennie&apos;s error had entailed, was for taking measures for carrying
                        out this plan at once. So buoyant was her natural temperament that she was
                        completely carried away by the glory of Cleveland, and already saw fulfilled
                        therein not only her own desires for a nice home, but the prosperous
                        advancement of her children. &quot;Of course they could get
                        work,&quot; she said. Bass was right. She had always wanted Gerhardt to
                        go to some large city, but he would not. Now it was necessary, and they
                        would go and become better off than they ever had been.</p>
                    <p>And Gerhardt did take this view of the situation. In answer to his
                        wife&apos;s letter he wrote that it was not advisable for him to leave
                        his place, but if Bass saw a way for them, it might be a good thing to go.
                        He was the more ready to acquiesee in the plan for the simple reason that he
                        was half distracted with the worry of supporting the family and of paying
                        the debts already outstanding. Every week he laid by five dollars out of his
                        salary, which he sent in the form of a postal order to Mrs. Gerhardt. Three
                        dollars he paid for board, and fifty cents he kept for spending money,
                        church dues, a little tobacco and occasionally a glass of beer. Every week
                        he put a dollar and a half in a little iron bank against a rainy day. His
                        room was a bare corner in the topmost loft of the mill. To this he would
                        ascend after sitting alone on the doorstep of the mill in this lonely,
                        foresaken neighborhood, until nine o&apos;clock of an evening; and here,
                        amid the odor of machinery wafted up from the floor below, by the <pb
                            id="VAA2406-112" n="105"/> light of a single tallow candle, he would
                        conclude his solitary day, reading his German paper, folding his hands and
                        thinking, kneeling by an open window in the shadow of the night to say his
                        prayers, and silently stretching himself to rest. Long were the days, dreary
                        the prospect. Still he lifted his hands in utmost faith to God, praying that
                        his sins might be forgiven and that he might be vouchsafed a few more years
                        of comfort and of happy family life.</p>
                    <p>So the momentous question was finally decided. There was the greatest longing
                        and impatience among the children, and Mrs. Gerhardt shared their emotions
                        in a suppressed way. Jennie was to go first, as Bass had suggested; later on
                        they would all follow.</p>
                    <p>When the hour came for Jennie&apos;s departure there was great excitement
                        in the household.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long you going to be &apos;fore you send for us?&quot;
                        was Martha&apos;s inquiry, several times repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell Bass to hurry up,&quot; said the eager George.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to go to Cleveland, I want to go to Cleveland,&quot;
                        Veronica was caught singing to herself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen to her,&quot; exclaimed George, sarcastically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aw, you hush up,&quot; was her displeased rejoinder.</p>
                    <p>When the final hour came, however, it required all of Jennie&apos;s
                        strength to go through with the farewells. Though everything was being done
                        in order to bring them together again under better conditions, she could not
                        help feeling depressed. Her little one, now six months old, was being left
                        behind. The great world was to her one undiscovered bourne. It frightened
                        her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t worry, Ma,&quot; she found courage enough
                        to say. &quot;I&apos;ll be all right. I&apos;ll write you just
                        as soon as I get there. It won&apos;t be so very long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But when it came to bending over her baby for the last time her courage went
                        out like a blown lamp. Stooping over the cradle in which the little one was
                        rest <pb id="VAA2406-113" n="[106]"/> ing she looked into its face with
                        passionate, motherly yearning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it going to be a good little girl?&quot; she cooed.</p>
                    <p>Then she caught it up into her arms, and hugging it closely to her neck and
                        bosom, she buried her face against its little body. Mrs. Gerhardt saw that
                        she was trembling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come now,&quot; she said, coaxingly, &quot;you
                        mustn&apos;t carry on so. She will be all right with me. I&apos;ll
                        take care of her. If you&apos;re going to act this way, you&apos;d
                        better not try to go at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie lifted her head, her blue eyes wet with tears, and handed the little
                        one to her mother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t help it,&quot; she said, half crying, half
                        smiling.</p>
                    <p>Quickly she kissed her mother and the children; then she hurried out.</p>
                    <p>As she went down the street with George she looked back and bravely waved her
                        hand. Mrs. Gerhardt responded, noticing how much more like a woman she
                        looked. It had been necessary to invest some of her money in new clothes to
                        wear on the train. She had selected a neat, ready-made suit of brown, which
                        fitted her nicely. She wore the skirt of this with a white shirtwaist, and a
                        sailor hat with a white veil wound around it in such fashion that it could
                        be easily drawn over her face. As she went farther and farther away Mrs.
                        Gerhardt followed her lovingly with her glance; and when she disappeared
                        from view she said tenderly, through her own tears:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad she looked so nice, anyhow.&quot;</p>

                    <p>BASS met Jennie at the depot in Cleveland and talked hopefully of the
                        prospects. &quot;The first thing is to get work,&quot; he began,
                        while the jingling sounds and the changing odors which the city thrust upon
                        her were confusing and almost benumbing her senses. &quot;Get something
                        to do. It doesn&apos;t matter what, so long as you get something. If you
                        don&apos;t get more than three or four dollars a week, it will pay the
                        rent. Then, with what George can earn, when he comes, and what Pop sends, we
                        can get along all right. It&apos;ll be better than being down in that
                        hole,&quot; he concluded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jennie, vaguely, her mind so hypnotized by the
                        new display of life about her that she could not bring it forcibly to bear
                        upon the topic under discussion. &quot;I know what you mean.
                        I&apos;ll get something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was much older now, in understanding if not in years. The ordeal through
                        which she had so recently passed had aroused in her a clearer conception of
                        the responsibilities of life. Her mother was always in her mind, her mother
                        and the children. In particular Martha and Veronica must have a better
                        opportunity to do for themselves than she had had. They should be dressed
                        better; they ought to be kept longer in school; they must have more
                        companionship, more opportunity to broaden their lives.</p>
                    <p>Cleveland, like every other growing city at this time, was crowded with those
                        who were seeking employment. New enterprises were constantly springing up,
                        but those who were seeking to fulfil the duties they provided were
                        invariably in excess of the demand. A stranger coming <pb id="VAA2406-115"
                            n="108"/> to the city might walk into a small position of almost any
                        kind on the very day he arrived; and he might as readily wander in search of
                        employment for weeks and even months. Bass suggested the shops and
                        department stores as a first field in which to inquire. The factories and
                        other avenues of employment were to be her second choice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t pass a place, though,&quot; he had cautioned
                        her, &quot;if you think there&apos;s any chance of getting anything
                        to do. Go right in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What must I say?&quot; asked Jennie, nervously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell them you want work. You don&apos;t care what you do to
                        begin with.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In compliance with this advice, Jennie set out the very first day, and was
                        rewarded by some very chilly experiences. Wherever she went, no one seemed
                        to want any help. She applied at the stores, the factories, the little shops
                        that lined the outlying thoroughfares, but was always met by a rebuff. As a
                        last resource she turned to housework, although she had hoped to avoid that;
                        and, studying the want columns, she selected four which seemed more
                        promising than the others. To these she decided to apply. One had already
                        been filled when she arrived, but the lady who came to the door was so taken
                        by her appearance that she invited her in and questioned her as to her
                        ability.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you had come a little earlier,&quot;she said.
                        &quot;I like you better than I do the girl I have taken. Leave me your
                        address, anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie went away, smiling at her reception. She was not quite so youthful
                        looking as she had been before her recent trouble, but the thinner cheeks
                        and the slightly deeper eyes added to the pensiveness and delicacy of her
                        countenance. She was a model of neatness. Her clothes, all newly cleaned and
                        ironed before leaving home, gave her a fresh and inviting appearance. There
                        was growth coming to her in the matter of height, but <pb id="VAA2406-116"
                            n="109"/> already in appearance and intelligence she looked to be a
                        young woman of twenty. Best of all, she was of that naturally sunny
                        disposition, which, in spite of toil and privation, kept her always
                        cheerful. Any one in need of a servant-girl or house companion would have
                        been delighted to have had her.</p>
                    <p>The second place at which she applied was a large residence in Euclid Avenue;
                        it seemed far too imposing for anything she might have to offer in the way
                        of services, but having come so far she decided to make the attempt. The
                        servant who met her at the door directed her to wait a few moments, and
                        finally ushered her into the boudoir of the mistress of the house on the
                        second floor. The latter, a Mrs. Bracebridge, a prepossessing brunette of
                        the conventionally fashionable type, had a keen eye for feminine values and
                        was impressed rather favorably with Jennie. She talked with her a little
                        while, and finally decided to try her in the general capacity of maid.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will give you four dollars a week, and you can sleep here if you
                        wish,&quot; said Mrs. Bracebridge.</p>
                    <p>Jennie explained that she was living with her brother, and would soon have
                        her family with her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, very well,&quot; replied her mistress. &quot;Do as you
                        like about that. Only I expect you to be here promptly.</p>
                    <p>She wished her to remain for the day and to begin her duties at once, and
                        Jennie agreed. Mrs. Bracebridge provided her a dainty cap and apron, and
                        then spent some little time in instructing her in her duties. Her principal
                        work would be to wait on her mistress, to brush her hair and to help her
                        dress. She was also to answer the bell, wait on the table if need be, and do
                        any other errand which her mistress might indicate. Mrs. Bracebridge seemed
                        a little hard and formal to her prospective servant, but for all that Jennie
                        admired the dash and go and the obvious executive capacity of her employer.</p>
                    <p>At eight o&apos;clock that evening Jennie was dismissed for <pb
                            id="VAA2406-117" n="110"/> the day. She wondered if she could be of any
                        use in such a household, and marveled that she had got along as well as she
                        had. Her mistress had set her to cleaning her jewelry and boudoir ornaments
                        as an opening task, and though she had worked steadily and diligently, she
                        had not finished by the time she left. She hurried away to her
                        brother&apos;s apartment, delighted to be able to report that she had
                        found a situation. Now her mother could come to Cleveland. Now she could
                        have her baby with her. Now they could really begin that new life which was
                        to be so much better and finer and sweeter than anything they had ever had
                        before.</p>
                    <p>At Bass&apos;s suggestion Jennie wrote her mother to come at once, and a
                        week or so later a suitable house was found and rented. Mrs. Gerhardt, with
                        the aid of the children, packed up the simple belongings of the family,
                        including a single vanload of furniture, and at the end of a fort night they
                        were on their way to the new home.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt always had had a keen desire for a really comfortable home.
                        Solid furniture, upholstered and trimmed, a thick, soft carpet of some warm,
                        pleasing color, plenty of chairs, settees, pictures, a lounge, and a
                        pianoshe had wanted these nice things all her life, but her circumstances
                        had never been good enough for her hopes to be realized. Still she did not
                        despair. Some day, maybe, before she died these things would be added to
                        her, and she would be happy. Perhaps her chance was coming now.</p>
                    <p>Arrived at Cleveland, this feeling of optimism was encouraged by the sight of
                        Jennie&apos;s heerful face. Bass assured her that they would get along
                        all right. He took them out to the house, and George was shown the way to go
                        back to the depot and have the freight looked after. Mrs. Gerhardt had still
                        fifty dollars left out of the money which Senator Brander had sent to
                        Jennie, and with this a way of getting a little extra furniture on the
                        instalment plan was provided. Bass had already paid the first <pb
                            id="VAA2406-118" n="111"/> month&apos;s rent, and Jennie had spent
                        her evenings for the last few days in washing the windows and floors of this
                        new house and in getting it into a state of perfect cleanliness. Now, when
                        the first night fell, they had two new mattresses and comfortables spread
                        upon a clean floor; a new lamp, purchased from one of the nearby stores, a
                        single box, borrowed by Jennie from a grocery store, for cleaning purposes,
                        upon which Mrs. Gerhardt could sit, and some sausages and bread to stay them
                        until morning. They talked and planned for the future until nine
                        o&apos;clock came, when all but Jennie and her mother retired. These two
                        talked on, the burden of responsibilities resting on the daughter. Mrs.
                        Gerhardt had come to feel in a way dependent upon her.</p>
                    <p>In the course of a week the entire cottage was in order, with a half-dozen
                        pieces of new furniture, a new carpet, and some necessary kitchen utensils.
                        The most disturbing thing was the need of a new cooking-stove, the cost of
                        which added greatly to the bill. The younger children were entered at the
                        public school, but it was decided that George must find some employment.
                        Both Jennie and her mother felt the injustice of this keenly, but knew no
                        way of preventing the sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will let him go to school next year if we can,&quot; said
                        Jennie.</p>
                    <p>Auspiciously as the new life seemed to have begun, the closeness with which
                        their expenses were matching their income was an ever-present menace. Bass,
                        originally very generous in his propositions, soon announced that he felt
                        four dollars a week for his room and board to be a sufficient contribution
                        from himself. Jennie gave everything she earned, and protested that she did
                        not stand in need of anything, so long as the baby was properly taken care
                        of. George secured a place as an overgrown cash-boy, and brought in two
                        dollars and fifty cents a week, all of which, at first, he gladly
                        contributed. Later on he was allowed the fifty cents for <pb
                            id="VAA2406-119" n="112"/> himself as being meet and just. Gerhardt,
                        from his lonely post of labor, contributed five dollars by mail, always
                        arguing that a little money ought to be saved in order that his honest debts
                        back in Columbus might be paid. Out of this total income of fifteen dollars
                        a week all of these individuals had to be fed and clothed, the rent paid,
                        coal purchased, and the regular monthly instalment of three dollars paid on
                        the outstanding furniture bill of fifty dollars.</p>
                    <p>How it was done, those comfortable individuals, who frequently discuss the
                        social aspects of poverty, might well trouble to inform themselves. Rent,
                        coal, and light alone consumed the goodly sum of twenty dollars a month;
                        food, another unfortunately necessary item, used up twenty-five more;
                        clothes, instalments, dues, occasional items of medicine and the like, were
                        met out of the remaining eleven dollarshow, the ardent imagination of the
                        comfortable reader can guess. It was done, however, and for a time the
                        hopeful members considered that they were doing fairly well.</p>
                    <p>During this period the little family presented a picture of honorable and
                        patient toil, which was interesting to contemplate. Every day Mrs. Gerhardt,
                        who worked like a servant and who received absolutely no compensation either
                        in clothes, amusements, or anything else, arose in the morning while the
                        others slept, and built the fire. Then she took up the task of getting the
                        breakfast. Often as she moved about noiselessly in her thin, worn slippers,
                        cushioned with pieces of newspaper to make them fit, she looked in on
                        Jennie, Bass, and George, wrapped in their heavy slumbers, and with that
                        divine sympathy which is born in heaven she wished that they did not need to
                        rise so early or to work so hard. Sometimes she would pause before touching
                        her beloved Jennie, gaze at her white face, so calm in sleep, and lament
                        that life had not dealt more kindly with her. Then she would lay her hand
                        gently upon her shoulder <pb id="VAA2406-120" n="[113]"/> and whisper,
                        &quot;Jennie, Jennie,&quot; until the weary sleeper would wake.</p>
                    <p>When they arose breakfast was always ready. When they returned at night
                        supper was waiting. Each of the children received a due share of Mrs.
                        Gerhardt&apos;s attention. The little baby was closely looked after by
                        her. She protested that she needed neither clothes nor shoes so long as one
                        of the children would run errands for her.</p>
                    <p>Jennie, of all the children, fully understood her mother; she alone strove,
                        with the fullness of a perfect affection, to ease her burden.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma, you let me do this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, ma, I&apos;ll &apos;tend to that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You go sit down, ma.&quot;</p>
                    <p>These were the every-day expressions of the enduring affection that existed
                        between them. Always there was perfect understanding between Jennie and her
                        mother, and as the days passed this naturally widened and deepened. Jennie
                        could not bear to think of her as being always confined to the house. Daily
                        she thought as she worked of that humble home where her mother was watching
                        and waiting. How she longed to give her those comforts which she had always
                        craved!</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XIV</head>
                    <p>THE days spent in the employ of the Bracebridge household were of a
                        broadening character. This great house was a school to Jennie, not only in
                        the matter of dress and manners, but as formulating a theory of existence.
                        Mrs. Bracebridge and her husband were the last word in the matter of
                        self-sufficiency, taste in the matter of appointments, care in the matter of
                        dress, good form in the matter of reception, entertainment, and the various
                        usages of social life. Now and then, apropos of nothing save her own mood,
                        Mrs. Bracebridge would indicate her philosophy of life in an epigram.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Life is a battle, my dear. If you gain anything you will have to
                        fight for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In my judgment it is silly not to take advantage of any aid which
                        will help you to be what you want to be.&quot; (This while applying a
                        faint suggestion of rouge.)</p>
                    <p>&quot;Most people are born silly. They are exactly what they are capable
                        of being. I despise lack of taste; it is the worst crime.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Most of these worldly-wise counsels were not given directly to Jennie. She
                        overheard them, but to her quiet and reflective mind they had their import.
                        Like seeds fallen upon good ground, they took root and grew. She began to
                        get a faint perception of hierarchies and powers. They were not for her,
                        perhaps, but they were in the world, and if fortune were kind one might
                        better one&apos;s state. She worked on, wondering, however, just how
                        better fortune might come to her. Who would have her to wife knowing her
                        history? How could she ever explain the existence of her child?</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-122" n="115"/>
                    <p>Her child, her child, the one transcendent, gripping theme of joy and fear.
                        If she could only do something for itsometime, somehow!</p>
                    <p>For the first winter things went smoothly enough. By the closest economy the
                        children were clothed and kept in school, the rent paid, and the instalments
                        met. Once it looked as though there might be some difficulty about the
                        continuance of the home life, and that was when Gerhardt wrote that he would
                        be home for Christmas. The mill was to close down for a short period at that
                        time. He was naturally anxious to see what the new life of his family at
                        Cleveland was like.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt would have welcomed his return with unalloyed pleasure had it
                        not been for the fear she entertained of his creating a scene. Jennie talked
                        it over with her mother, and Mrs. Gerhardt in turn spoke of it to Bass,
                        whose advice was to brave it out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; he said; &quot;he
                        won&apos;t do anything about it. I&apos;ll talk to him if he says
                        anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The scene did occur, but it was not so unpleasant as Mrs. Gerhardt had
                        feared. Gerhardt came home during the afternoon, while Bass, Jennie, and
                        George were at work. Two of the younger children went to the train to meet
                        him. When he entered Mrs. Gerhardt greeted him affectionately, but she
                        trembled for the discovery which was sure to come. Her suspense was not for
                        long. Gerhardt opened the front bedroom door only a few minutes after he
                        arrived. On the white counterpane of the bed was a pretty child, sleeping.
                        He could not but know on the instant whose it was, but he pretended
                        ignorance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whose child is that?&quot; he questioned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s Jennie&apos;s,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt,
                        weakly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When did that come here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so very long ago,&quot; answered the mother, nervously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess she is here, too,&quot; he declared, contemptuously,
                            <pb id="VAA2406-123" n="116"/> refusing to pronounce her name, a fact
                        which he had already anticipated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s working in a family,&quot; returned his wife in
                        a pleading tone. &quot;She&apos;s doing so well now. She had no
                        place to go. Let her alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt had received a light since he had been away. Certain inexplicable
                        thoughts and feelings had come to him in his religious meditations. In his
                        prayers he had admitted to the All-seeing that he might have done
                        differently by his daughter. Yet he could not make up his mind how to treat
                        her for the future. She had committed a great sin; it was impossible to get
                        away from that.</p>
                    <p>When Jennie came home that night a meeting was unavoidable. Gerhardt saw her
                        coming, and pretended to be deeply engaged in a newspaper. Mrs. Gerhardt,
                        who had begged him not to ignore Jennie entirely, trembled for fear he would
                        say or do something which would hurt her feelings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is coming now,&quot; she said, crossing to the door of the
                        front room, where he was sitting; but Gerhardt refused to look up.
                        &quot;Speak to her, anyhow,&quot; was her last appeal before the
                        door opened; but he made no reply.</p>
                    <p>When Jennie came in her mother whispered, &quot;He is in the front
                        room.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie paled, put her thumb to her lip and stood irresolute, not knowing how
                        to meet the situation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has he seen?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie paused as she realized from her mother&apos;s face and nod that
                        Gerhardt knew of the child&apos;s existence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go ahead,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt; &quot;it&apos;s all
                        right. He won&apos;t say anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie finally went to the door, and, seeing her father, his brow wrinkled as
                        if in serious but not unkindly thought, she hesitated, but made her way
                        forward.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Papa,&quot; she said, unable to formulate a definite sentence.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-124" n="[117]"/>
                    <p>Gerhardt looked up, his grayish-brown eyes a study under their heavy sandy
                        lashes. At the sight of his daughter he weakened internally; but with the
                        selfadjusted armor of resolve about him he showed no sign of pleasure at
                        seeing her. All the forces of his conventional understanding of morality and
                        his naturally sympathetic and fatherly disposition were battling within him,
                        but, as in so many cases where the average mind is concerned, convention was
                        temporarily the victor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you forgive me, Papa?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do,&quot; he returned grimly.</p>
                    <p>She hesitated a moment, and then stepped forward, for what purpose he well
                        understood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There,&quot; he said, pushing her gently away, as her lips
                        barely touched his grizzled cheek.</p>
                    <p>It had been a frigid meeting.</p>
                    <p>When Jennie went out into the kitchen after this very trying ordeal she
                        lifted her eyes to her waiting mother and tried to make it seem as though
                        all had been well, but her emotional disposition got the better of her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did he make up to you?&quot; her mother was about to ask; but
                        the words were only half out of her mouth before her daughter sank down into
                        one of the chairs close to the kitchen table and, laying her head on her
                        arm, burst forth into soft, convulsive, inaudible sobs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, now,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt. &quot;There now,
                        don&apos;t cry. What did he say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was some time before Jennie recovered herself sufficiently to answer. Her
                        mother tried to treat the situation lightly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t feel bad,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;He&apos;ll get over it. It&apos;s his way.&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XV</head>
                    <p>THE return of Gerhardt brought forward the child question in all its
                        bearings. He could not help considering it from the standpoint of a
                        grandparent, particularly since it was a human being possessed of a soul. He
                        wondered if it had been baptized. Then he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, not yet,&quot; said his wife, who had not forgotten this
                        duty, but had been uncertain whether the little one would be welcome in the
                        faith.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, of course not,&quot;sneered Gerhardt, whose opinion of his
                        wife&apos;s religious devotion was not any too great. &quot;Such
                        carelessness! Such irreligion! That is a fine thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He thought it over a few moments, and felt that this evil should be corrected
                        at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It should be baptized,&quot;he said. &quot;Why
                        don&apos;t she take it and have it baptized?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt reminded him that some one would have to stand godfather to the
                        child, and there was no way to have the ceremony performed without
                        confessing the fact that it was without a legitimate father.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt listened to this, and it quieted him for a few moments, but his
                        religion was something which he could not see put in the background by any
                        such difficulty. How would the Lord look upon quibbling like this? It was
                        not Christian, and it was his duty to attend to the matter. It must be
                        taken, forthwith, to the church, Jennie, himself, and his wife accompanying
                        it as sponsors; or, if he did not choose to condescend thus far to his
                        daughter, he must see that it was baptized <pb id="VAA2406-126" n="119"/>
                        when she was not present. He brooded over this difficulty, and finally
                        decided that the ceremony should take place on one of these week-days
                        between Christmas and New Year&apos;s, when Jennie would be at her work.
                        This proposal he broached to his wife, and, receiving her approval, he made
                        his next announcement. &quot;It has no name,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Jennie and her mother had talked over this very matter, and Jennie had
                        expressed a preference for Vesta. Now her mother made bold to suggest it as
                        her own choice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would Vesta do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt heard this with indifference. Secretly he had settled the question
                        in his own mind. He had a name in store, left over from the halcyon period
                        of his youth, and never opportunely available in the case of his own
                        childrenWilhelmina. Of course he had no idea of unbending in the least
                        toward his small granddaughter. He merely liked the name, and the child
                        ought to be grateful to get it. With a far-off, gingery air he brought
                        forward this first offering upon the altar of natural affection, for
                        offering it was, after all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is nice,&quot; he said, forgetting his indifference.
                        &quot;But how would Wilhelmina do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt did not dare cross him when he was thus unconsciously
                        weakening. Her woman&apos;s tact came to the rescue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We might give her both names,&quot; she compromised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It makes no difference to me,&quot; he replied, drawing back
                        into the shell of opposition from which he had been inadvertently drawn.
                        &quot;Just so she is baptized.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie heard of this with pleasure, for she was anxious that the child should
                        have every advantage, religious or otherwise, that it was possible to
                        obtain. She took great pains to starch and iron the clothes it was to wear
                        on the appointed day.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt sought out the minister of the nearest Lu <pb id="VAA2406-127"
                            n="120"/> theran church, a round-headed, thick-set theologian of the
                        most formal type, to whom he stated his errand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your grandchild?&quot; inquired the minister.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Gerhardt, &quot;her father is not
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So,&quot; replied the minister, looking at him curiously.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt was not to be disturbed in his purpose. He explained that he and his
                        wife would bring her. The minister, realizing the probable difficulty, did
                        not question him further.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The church cannot refuse to baptize her so long as you, as
                        grandparent, are willing to stand sponsor for her,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt came away, hurt by the shadow of disgrace in which he felt himself
                        involved, but satisfied that he had done his duty. Now he would take the
                        child and have it baptized, and when that was over his present
                        responsibility would cease.</p>
                    <p>When it came to the hour of the baptism, however, he found that another
                        influence was working to guide him into greater interest and responsibility.
                        The stern religion with which he was enraptured, its insistence upon a
                        higher law, was there, and he heard again the precepts which had helped to
                        bind him to his own children.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it your intention to educate this child in the knowledge and
                        love of the gospel?&quot; asked the blackgowned minister, as they stood
                        before him in the silent little church whither they had brought the infant;
                        he was reading from the form provided for such occasions. Gerhardt answered
                        &quot;Yes,&quot; and Mrs. Gerhardt added her affirmative.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you engage to use all necessary care and diligence, by prayerful
                        instruction, admonition, example, and discipline that this child may
                        renounce and avoid everything that is evil and that she may keep
                        God&apos;s will and commandments as declared in His sacred
                        word?&quot;</p>
                    <p>A thought flashed through Gerhardt&apos;s mind as the <pb
                            id="VAA2406-128" n="121"/> words were uttered of how it had fared with
                        his own children. They, too, had been thus sponsored. They too, had heard
                        his solemn pledge to care for their spiritual welfare. He was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We do,&quot; prompted the minister.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We do,&quot; repeated Gerhardt and his wife weakly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you now dedicate this child by the rite of baptism unto the
                        Lord, who brought it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And, finally, if you can conscientiously declare before God that
                        the faith to which you have assented is your faith, and that the solemn
                        promises you have made are the serious resolutions of your heart, please to
                        announce the same in the presence of God, by saying
                        &apos;Yes.&quot;&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; they replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I baptize thee, Wilhelmina Vesta,&quot; concluded the minister,
                        stretching out his hand over her, &quot;in the name of the Father and of
                        the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Let us pray.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt bent his gray head and followed with humble reverence the beautiful
                        invocation which followed:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Almighty and everlasting God! we adore Thee as the great Parent of
                        the children of men, as the Father of our spirits and the Former of our
                        bodies. We praise Thee for giving existence to this infant and for
                        preserving her until this day. We bless Thee that she is called to virtue
                        and glory, that she has now been dedicated to Thee, and brought within the
                        pale of the Christian Church. We thank Thee that by the Gospel of the Son
                        she is furnished with everything necessary to her spiritual happiness; that
                        it supplies light for her mind and comfort for her heart, encouragement and
                        power to discharge her duty, and the precious hope of mercy and immortality
                        to sustain and make her faithful. And we beseech Thee, O most merciful God,
                        that this child may be enlightened and sanctified from her early years by
                        the Holy Spirit, and be everlastingly saved by Thy mercy. Direct and <pb
                            id="VAA2406-129" n="122"/> bless Thy servants who are intrusted with the
                        care of her in the momentous work of her education. Inspire them with just
                        conception of the absolute necessity of religious instruction and
                        principles. Forbid that they should ever forget that this offspring belongs
                        to Thee, and that, if through their criminal neglect or bad example Thy
                        reasonable creature be lost, Thou wilt require it at their hands. Give them
                        a deep sense of the divinity of her nature, of the worth of her soul, of the
                        dangers to which she will be exposed, of the honor and felicity to which she
                        is capable of ascending with Thy blessing, and of the ruin in this world and
                        the misery in the world to come which springs from wicked passion and
                        conduct. Give them grace to check the first risings of forbidden
                        inclinations in her breast, to be her defense against the temptations
                        incident to childhood and youth, and, as she grows up, to enlarge her
                        understanding and to lead her to an acquaintance with Thee and with Jesus
                        Christ, whom Thou hast sent. Give them grace to cultivate in her heart a
                        supreme reverence and love for Thee, a grateful attachment to the Gospel of
                        Thy Son, her Saviour, a due regard for all its ordinances and institutions,
                        a temper of kindness and good-will to all mankind, and an invincible love of
                        sincerity and truth. Help them to watch continually over her with tender
                        solicitude, to be studious, that by their conversation and deportment her
                        heart may not be corrupted, and at all times to set before her such an
                        example that she may safely tread in their footsteps. If it please Thee to
                        prolong her days on earth, grant that she may prove an honor and a comfort
                        to her parents and friends, be useful in the world, and find in Thy
                        Providence an unfailing defense and support. Whether she live, let her live
                        to Thee; or whether she die, let her die to Thee. And, at the great day of
                        account, may she and her parents meet each other with rapture and rejoice
                        together in Thy redeeming love, through Jesus Christ, forever and ever,
                        Amen.&quot;</p>

                    <p>As this solemn admonition was read a feeling of obligation descended upon the
                        grandfather of this little outcast; a feeling that he was bound to give the
                        tiny creature lying on his wife&apos;s arm the care and attention which
                        God in His sacrament had commanded. He bowed his head in utmost reverence,
                        and when the service was concluded and they left the silent church he was
                        without words to express his feelings. Religion was a consuming thing with
                        him. God was a person, a dominant reality. Religion was not a thing of mere
                        words or of interesting ideas to be listened to on Sunday, but a strong,
                        vital expression of the Divine Will handed down from a time when men were in
                        personal contact with God. Its fulfilment was a matter of joy and salvation
                        with him, the one consolation of a creature sent to wander in a vale whose
                        explanation was not here but in heaven. Slowly Gerhardt walked on, and as he
                        brooded on the words and the duties which the sacrament involved the shade
                        of lingering disgust that had possessed him when he had taken the child to
                        church disappeared and a feeling of natural affection took its place.
                        However much the daughter had sinned, the infant, was not to blame. It was a
                        helpless, puling, tender thing, demanding his sympathy and his love.
                        Gerhardt felt his heart go out to the little child, and yet he could not
                        yield his position all in a moment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is a nice man,&quot; he said of the minister to his wife
                        as they walked along, rapidly softening in his conception of his duty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, he was,&quot; agreed Mrs. Gerhardt timidly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a good-sized little church,&quot; he continued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt looked around him, at the street, the houses, the show of brisk life
                        on this sunshiny, winter&apos;s day, and then finally at the child that
                        his wife was carrying.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She must be heavy,&quot; he said, in his characteristic German.
                        &quot;Let me take her.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-131" n="[124]"/>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt, who was rather weary, did not refuse.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There!&quot; he said, as he looked at her and then fixed her
                        comfortably upon his shoulder. &quot;Let us hope she proves worthy of
                        all that has been done to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt listened, and the meaning in his voice interpreted itself
                        plainly enough. The presence of the child in the house might be the cause of
                        recurring spells of depression and unkind words, but there would be another
                        and greater influence restraining him. There would always be her soul to
                        consider. He would never again be utterly unconscious of her soul.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XVI</head>
                    <p>DURING the remainder of Gerhardt&apos;s stay he was shy in
                        Jennie&apos;s presence and endeavored to act as though he were
                        unconscious of her existence. When the time came for parting he even went
                        away without bidding her good-by, telling his wife she might do that for
                        him; but after he was actually on his way back to Youngstown he regretted
                        the omission. &quot;I might have bade her good-by,&quot; he thought
                        to himself as the train rumbled heavily along. But it was too late.</p>
                    <p>For the time being the affairs of the Gerhardt family drifted. Jennie
                        continued her work with Mrs. Bracebridge. Sebastian fixed himself firmly in
                        his clerkship in the cigar store. George was promoted to the noble sum of
                        three dollars, and then three-fifty. It was a narrow, humdrum life the
                        family led. Coal, groceries, shoes, and clothing were the uppermost topics
                        of their conversation; every one felt the stress and strain of trying to
                        make ends meet.</p>
                    <p>That which worried Jennie most, and there were many things which weighed upon
                        her sensitive soul, was the outcome of her own lifenot so much for herself
                        as for her baby and the family. She could not really see where she fitted
                        in. &quot;Who would have me?&quot; she asked herself over and over.
                        &quot;How was she to dispose of Vesta in the event of a new love
                        affair?&quot;Such a contingency was quite possible. She was young,
                        good-looking, and men were inclined to flirt with her, or rather to attempt
                        it. The Bracebridges entertained many masculine guests, and some of them had
                        made unpleasant overtures to her.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-133" n="126"/>
                    <p>&quot;My dear, you&apos;re a very pretty girl,&quot; said one old
                        rake of fifty-odd when she knocked at his door one morning to give him a
                        message from his hostess.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; she said, confusedly, and colored.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed, you&apos;re quite sweet. And you needn&apos;t beg
                        my pardon. I&apos;d like to talk to you some time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He attempted to chuck her under the chin, but Jennie hurried away. She would
                        have reported the matter to her mistress but a nervous shame deterred her.
                        &quot;Why would men always be doing this?&quot; she thought. Could
                        it be because there was something innately bad about her, an inward
                        corruption that attracted its like?</p>
                    <p>It is a curious characteristic of the non-defensive disposition that it is
                        like a honey-jar to flies. Nothing is brought to it and much is taken away.
                        Around a soft, yielding, unselfish disposition men swarm naturally. They
                        sense this generosity, this non-protective attitude from afar. A girl like
                        Jennie is like a comfortable fire to the average masculine mind; they
                        gravitate to it, seek its sympathy, yearn to possess it. Hence she was
                        annoyed by many unwelcome attentions.</p>
                    <p>One day there arrived from Cincinnati a certain Lester Kane, the son of a
                        wholesale carriage builder of great trade distinction in that city and
                        elsewhere throughout the country, who was wont to visit this house
                        frequently in a social way. He was a friend of Mrs. Bracebridge more than of
                        her husband, for the former had been raised in Cincinnati and as a girl had
                        visited at his father&apos;s house. She knew his mother, his brother and
                        sisters and to all intents and purposes socially had always been considered
                        one of the family.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lester&apos;s coming to-morrow, Henry,&quot; Jennie heard
                        Mrs. Bracebridge tell her husband. &quot;I had a wire from him this
                        noon. He&apos;s such a scamp. I&apos;m going to give him the big
                        east front room up-stairs. Be sociable and pay him some attention. His
                        father was so good to me.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-134" n="127"/>
                    <p>&quot;I know it,&quot; said her husband calmly. &quot;I like
                        Lester. He&apos;s the biggest one in that family. But he&apos;s too
                        indifferent. He doesn&apos;t care enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know; but he&apos;s so nice. I do think he&apos;s one of
                        the nicest men I ever knew.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be decent to him. Don&apos;t I always do pretty
                        well by your people?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, pretty well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know about that,&quot; he replied, dryly.</p>
                    <p>When this notable person arrived Jennie was prepared to see some one of more
                        than ordinary importance, and she was not disappointed. There came into the
                        receptionhall to greet her mistress a man of perhaps thirty-six years of
                        age, above the medium in height, clear-eyed, firm-jawed, athletic, direct,
                        and vigorous. He had a deep, resonant voice that carried clearly everywhere;
                        people somehow used to stop and listen whether they knew him or not. He was
                        simple and abrupt in his speech.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, there you are,&quot; he began. &quot;I&apos;m glad
                        to see you again. How&apos;s Mr. Bracebridge? How&apos;s
                        Fannie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He asked his questions forcefully, whole-heartedly, and his hostess answered
                        with an equal warmth. &quot;I&apos;m glad to see you,
                        Lester,&quot; she said. &quot;George will take your things
                        up-stairs. Come up into my room. It&apos;s more comfy. How are grandpa
                        and Louise?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He followed her up the stairs, and Jennie, who had been standing at the head
                        of the stairs listening, felt the magnetic charm of his personality. It
                        seemed, why she could hardly say, that a real personage had arrived. The
                        house was cheerier. The attitude of her mistress was much more complaisant.
                        Everybody seemed to feel that something must be done for this man.</p>
                    <p>Jennie went about her work, but the impression persisted; his name ran in her
                        mind. Lester Kane. And he was from Cincinnati. She looked at him now and
                        then on the sly, and felt, for the first time in her life, an interest in a
                        man on his own account. He was so big, <pb id="VAA2406-135" n="128"/> so
                        handsome, so forceful. She wondered what his business was. At the same time
                        she felt a little dread of him. Once she caught him looking at her with a
                        steady, incisive stare. She quailed inwardly, and took the first opportunity
                        to get out of his presence. Another time he tried to address a few remarks
                        to her, but she pretended that her duties called her away. She knew that
                        often his eyes were on her when her back was turned, and it made her
                        nervous. She wanted to run away from him, although there was no very
                        definite reason why she should do so.</p>
                    <p>As a matter of fact, this man, so superior to Jennie in wealth, education,
                        and social position, felt an instinctive interest in her unusual
                        personality. Like the others, he was attracted by the peculiar softness of
                        her disposition and her pre-eminent femininity. There was that about her
                        which suggested the luxury of love. He felt as if somehow she could be
                        reachedwhy, he could not have said. She did not bear any outward marks of
                        her previous experience. There were no evidences of coquetry about her, but
                        still he &quot;felt that he might.&quot; He was inclined to make the
                        venture on his first visit, but business called him away; he left after four
                        days and was absent from Cleveland for three weeks. Jennie thought he was
                        gone for good, and she experienced a queer sense of relief as well as of
                        regret. Then, suddenly, he returned. He came apparently unexpectedly,
                        explaining to Mrs. Bracebridge that business interests again demanded his
                        presence in Cleveland. As he spoke he looked at Jennie sharply, and she felt
                        as if somehow his presence might also concern her a little.</p>
                    <p>On this second visit she had various opportunities of seeing him, at
                        breakfast, where she sometimes served, at dinner, when she could see the
                        guests at the table from the parlor or sitting-room, and at odd times when
                        he came to Mrs. Bracebridge&apos;s boudoir to talk things over. They
                        were very friendly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-136" n="129"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you settle down, Lester, and get
                        married?&quot; Jennie heard her say to him the second day he was there.
                        &quot;You know it&apos;s time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; he replied, &quot;but I&apos;m in no mood
                        for that. I want to browse around a little while yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know about your browsing. You ought to be ashamed of
                        yourself. Your father is really worried.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He chuckled amusedly. &quot;Father doesn&apos;t worry much about me.
                        He has got all he can attend to to look after the business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie looked at him curiously. She scarcely understood what she was
                        thinking, but this man drew her. If she had realized in what way she would
                        have fled his presence then and there.</p>
                    <p>Now he was more insistent in his observation of heraddressed an occasional
                        remark to herengaged her in brief, magnetic conversations. She could not
                        help answering himhe was pleasing to her. Once he came across her in the
                        hall on the second floor searching in a locker for some linen. They were all
                        alone, Mrs. Bracebridge having gone out to do some morning shopping and the
                        other servants being below stairs. On this occasion he made short work of
                        the business. He approached her in a commanding, unhesitating, and
                        thoroughly determined way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to talk to you,&quot;he said. &quot;Where do you
                        live?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;II&quot;she stammered, and blanched perceptibly. &quot;I
                        live out on Lorrie Street.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What number?&quot; he questioned, as though she were compelled
                        to tell him.</p>
                    <p>She quailed and shook inwardly. &quot;Thirteen fourteen,&quot;she
                        replied mechanically.</p>
                    <p>He looked into her big, soft-blue eyes with his dark, vigorous brown ones. A
                        flash that was hypnotic, significant, insistent passed between them.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-137" n="[130]"/>
                    <p>&quot;You belong to me,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve been
                        looking for you. When can I see you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you mustn&apos;t,&quot; she said, her fingers going
                        nervously to her lips. &quot;I can&apos;t see youII&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I mustn&apos;t, mustn&apos;t I? Look here&quot;he
                        took her arm and drew her slightly closer&quot; you and I might as well
                        understand each other right now. I like you. Do you like me? Say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him, her eyes wide, filled with wonder, with fear, with a
                        growing terror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she gasped, her lips dry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you?&quot; He fixed her grimly, firmly with his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at me,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>He pulled her to him quickly. &quot;I&apos;ll talk to you
                        later,&quot; he said, and put his lips masterfully to hers.</p>
                    <p>She was horrified, stunned, like a bird in the grasp of a cat; but through it
                        all something tremendously vital and insistent was speaking to her. He
                        released her with a short laugh. &quot;We won&apos;t do any more of
                        this here, but, remember, you belong to me,&quot; he said, as he turned
                        and walked nonchalantly down the hall. Jennie, in sheer panic, ran to her
                        mistress&apos;s room and locked the door behind her.</p>

                    <p>THE shock of this sudden encounter was so great to Jennie that she was hours
                        in recovering herself. At first she did not understand clearly just what had
                        happened. Out of clear sky, as it were, this astonishing thing had taken
                        place. She had yielded herself to another man. Why? Why? she asked herself,
                        and yet within her own consciousness there was an answer. Though she could
                        not explain her own emotions, she belonged to him temperamentally and he
                        belonged to her.</p>
                    <p>There is a fate in love and a fate in fight. This strong, intellectual bear
                        of a man, son of a wealthy manufacturer, stationed, so far as material
                        conditions were concerned, in a world immensely superior to that in which
                        Jennie moved, was, nevertheless, instinctively, magnetically, and chemically
                        drawn to this poor servingmaid. She was his natural affinity, though he did
                        not know itthe one woman who answered somehow the biggest need of his
                        nature. Lester Kane had known all sorts of women, rich and poor, the highly
                        bred maidens of his own class, the daughters of the proletariat, but he had
                        never yet found one who seemed to combine for him the traits of an ideal
                        womansympathy, kindliness of judgment, youth, and beauty. Yet this ideal
                        remained fixedly seated in the back of his brainwhen the right woman
                        appeared he intended to take her. He had the notion that, for purposes of
                        marriage, he ought perhaps to find this woman on his own plane. For purposes
                        of temporary happiness he might take her from anywhere, 10 <pb
                            id="VAA2406-139" n="132"/> leaving marriage, of course, out of the
                        question. He had no idea of making anything like a serious proposal to a
                        servant-girl. But Jennie was different. He had never seen a servant quite
                        like her. And she was lady-like and lovely without appearing to know it.
                        Why, this girl was a rare flower. Why shouldn&apos;t he try to seize
                        her? Let us be just to Lester Kane; let us try to understand him and his
                        position. Not every mind is to be estimated by the weight of a single folly;
                        not every personality is to be judged by the drag of a single passion. We
                        live in an age in which the impact of materialized forces is well-nigh
                        irresistible; the spiritual nature is overwhelmed by the shock. The
                        tremendous and complicated development of our material civilization, the
                        multiplicity, and variety of our social forms, the depth, subtlety, and
                        sophistry of our imaginative impressions, gathered, remultiplied, and
                        disseminated by such agencies as the railroad, the express and the
                        post-office, the telephone, the telegraph, the newspaper, and, in short, the
                        whole machinery of social intercoursethese elements of existence combine to
                        produce what may be termed a kaleidoscopic glitter, a dazzling and confusing
                        phantasmagoria of life that wearies and stultifies the mental and moral
                        nature. It induces a sort of intellectual fatigue through which we see the
                        ranks of the victims of insomnia, melancholia, and insanity constantly
                        recruited. Our modern brain-pan does not seem capable as yet of receiving,
                        sorting, and storing the vast army of facts and impressions which present
                        themselves daily. The white light of publicity is too white. We are weighed
                        upon by too many things. It is as if the wisdom of the infinite were
                        struggling to beat itself into finite and cup-big minds.</p>
                    <p>Lester Kane was the natural product of these untoward conditions. His was a
                        naturally observing mind, Rabelaisian in its strength and tendencies, but
                        confused by the multiplicity of things, the vastness of <pb id="VAA2406-140"
                            n="133"/> the panorama of life, the glitter of its details, the
                        unsubstantial nature of its forms, the uncertainty of their justification.
                        Born a Catholic, he was no longer a believer in the divine inspiration of
                        Catholicism; raised a member of the social elect, he had ceased to accept
                        the fetish that birth and station presuppose any innate superiority; brought
                        up as the heir to a comfortable fortune and expected to marry in his own
                        sphere, he was by no means sure that he wanted marriage on any terms. Of
                        course the conjugal state was an institution. It was established. Yes,
                        certainly. But what of it? The whole nation believed in it. True, but other
                        nations believed in polygamy. There were other questions that bothered
                        himsuch questions as the belief in a single deity or ruler of the universe,
                        and whether a republican, monarchial, or aristocratic form of government
                        were best. In short, the whole body of things material, social, and
                        spiritual had come under the knife of his mental surgery and been left but
                        half dissected. Life was not proved to him. Not a single idea of his, unless
                        it were the need of being honest, was finally settled. In all other things
                        he wavered, questioned, procrastinated, leaving to time and to the powers
                        back of the universe the solution of the problems that vexed him. Yes,
                        Lester Kane was the natural product of a combination of elementsreligious,
                        commercial, socialmodified by that pervading atmosphere of liberty in our
                        national life which is productive of almost uncounted freedom of thought and
                        action. Thirty-six years of age, and apparently a man of vigorous,
                        aggressive, and sound personality, he was, nevertheless, an essentially
                        animal-man, pleasantly veneered by education and environment. Like the
                        hundreds of thousands of Irishmen who in his father&apos;s day had
                        worked on the railroad tracks, dug in the mines, picked and shoveled in the
                        ditches, and carried up bricks and mortar on the endless structures of a new
                        land, he was strong, hairy, axiomatic, and witty.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-141" n="134"/>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want me to come back here next year?&quot; he had asked
                        of Brother Ambrose, when, in his seventeenth year, that ecclesiastical
                        member was about to chastise him for some school-boy misdemeanor.</p>
                    <p>The other stared at him in astonishment. &quot;Your father will have to
                        look after that,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, my father won&apos;t look after it,&quot; Lester
                        returned. &quot;If you touch me with that whip I&apos;ll take things
                        into my own hands. I&apos;m not committing any punishable offenses, and
                        I&apos;m not going to be knocked around any more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Words, unfortunately, did not avail in this case, but a good, vigorous
                        Irish-American wrestle did, in which the whip was broken and the discipline
                        of the school so far impaired that he was compelled to take his clothes and
                        leave. After that he looked his father in the eye and told him that he was
                        not going to school any more.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m perfectly willing to jump in and work,&quot; he
                        explained. &quot;There&apos;s nothing in a classical education for
                        me. Let me go into the office, and I guess I&apos;ll pick up enough to
                        carry me through.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Old Archibald Kane, keen, single-minded, of unsullied commercial honor,
                        admired his son&apos;s determination, and did not attempt to coerce him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come down to the office,&quot; he said; &quot;perhaps there
                        is something you can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Entering upon a business life at the age of eighteen, Lester had worked
                        faithfully, rising in his father&apos;s estimation, until now he had
                        come to be, in a way, his personal representative. Whenever there was a
                        contract to be entered upon, an important move to be decided, or a
                        representative of the manufactory to be sent anywhere to consummate a deal,
                        Lester was the agent selected. His father trusted him implicitly, and so
                        diplomatic and earnest was he in the fulfilment of his duties that this
                        trust had never been impaired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Business is business,&quot; was a favorite axiom with him, <pb
                            id="VAA2406-142" n="135"/> and the very tone in which he pronounced the
                        words was a reflex of his character and personality.</p>
                    <p>There were molten forces in him, flames which burst forth now and then in
                        spite of the fact that he was sure that he had them under control. One of
                        these impulses was a taste for liquor, of which he was perfectly sure he had
                        the upper hand. He drank but very little, he thought, and only, in a social
                        way, among friends; never to excess. Another weakness lay in his sensual
                        nature; but here again he believed that he was the master. If he chose to
                        have irregular relations with women, he was capable of deciding where the
                        danger point lay. If men were only guided by a sense of the brevity inherent
                        in all such relationships there would not be so many troublesome
                        consequences growing out of them. Finally, he flattered himself that he had
                        a grasp upon a right method of living, a method which was nothing more than
                        a quiet acceptance of social conditions as they were, tempered by a little
                        personal judgment as to the right and wrong of individual conduct. Not to
                        fuss and fume, not to cry out about anything, not to be mawkishly
                        sentimental; to be vigorous and sustain your personality intactsuch was his
                        theory of life, and he was satisfied that it was a good one.</p>
                    <p>As to Jennie, his original object in approaching her had been purely selfish.
                        But now that he had asserted his masculine prerogatives, and she had
                        yielded, at least in part, he began to realize that she was no common girl,
                        no toy of the passing hour.</p>
                    <p>There is a time in some men&apos;s lives when they unconsciously begin to
                        view feminine youth and beauty not so much in relation to the ideal of
                        happiness, but rather with regard to the social conventions by which they
                        are environed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Must it be?&quot; they ask themselves, in speculating
                        concerning the possibility of taking a maiden to wife, &quot;that I
                        shall be compelled to swallow the whole social code, <pb id="VAA2406-143"
                            n="136"/> make a covenant with society, sign a pledge of abstinence, and
                        give to another a life interest in all my affairs, when I know too well that
                        I am but taking to my arms a variable creature like myself, whose wishes are
                        apt to become insistent and burdensome in proportion to the decrease of her
                        beauty and interest?&quot; These are the men, who, unwilling to risk the
                        manifold contingencies of an authorized connection, are led to consider the
                        advantages of a less-binding union, a temporary companionship. They seek to
                        seize the happiness of life without paying the cost of their indulgence.
                        Later on, they think, the more definite and conventional relationship may be
                        established without reproach or the necessity of radical readjustment.</p>
                    <p>Lester Kane was past the youthful love period, and he knew it. The innocence
                        and unsophistication of younger ideals had gone. He wanted the comfort of
                        feminine companionship, but he was more and more disinclined to give up his
                        personal liberty in order to obtain it. He would not wear the social
                        shackles if it were possible to satisfy the needs of his heart and nature
                        and still remain free and unfettered. Of course he must find the right
                        woman, and in Jennie he believed that he had discovered her. She appealed to
                        him on every side; he had never known anybody quite like her. Marriage was
                        not only impossible but unnecessary. He had only to say
                        &quot;Come&quot; and she must obey; it was her destiny.</p>
                    <p>Lester thought the matter over calmly, dispassionately. He strolled out to
                        the shabby street where she lived; he looked at the humble roof that
                        sheltered her. Her poverty, her narrow and straitened environment touched
                        his heart. Ought he not to treat her generously, fairly, honorably? Then the
                        remembrance of her marvelous beauty swept over him and changed his mood. No,
                        he must possess her if he couldto-day, quickly, as soon as possible. It was
                        in that frame of mind that he returned to Mrs. Bracebridge&apos;s home
                        from his visit to Lorrie Street.</p>

                    <p>JENNIE was now going through the agony of one who has a varied and
                        complicated problem to confront. Her baby, her father, her brothers, and
                        sisters all rose up to confront her. What was this thing that she was doing?
                        Was she allowing herself to slip into another wretched, unsanctified
                        relationship? How was she to explain to her family about this man? He would
                        not marry her, that was sure, if he knew all about her. He would not marry
                        her, anyhow, a man of his station and position. Yet here she was parleying
                        with him. What ought she to do? She pondered over the problem until evening,
                        deciding first that it was best to run away, but remembering painfully that
                        she had told him where she lived. Then she resolved that she would summon up
                        her courage and refuse himtell him she couldn&apos;t, wouldn&apos;t
                        have anything to do with him. This last solution of the difficulty seemed
                        simple enoughin his absence. And she would find work where he could not
                        follow her up so easily. It all seemed simple enough as she put on her
                        things in the evening to go home.</p>
                    <p>Her aggressive lover, however, was not without his own conclusion in this
                        matter. Since leaving Jennie he had thought concisely and to the point. He
                        came to the decision that he must act at once. She might tell her family,
                        she might tell Mrs. Bracebridge, she might leave the city. He wanted to know
                        more of the conditions which surrounded her, and there was only one way to
                        do thattalk to her. He must persuade her to come and live with him. She
                        would, he thought. She admitted <pb id="VAA2406-145" n="138"/> that she
                        liked him. That soft, yielding note in her character which had originally
                        attracted him seemed to presage that he could win her without much
                        difficulty, if he wished to try. He decided to do so, anyhow, for truly he
                        desired her greatly.</p>
                    <p>At half-past five he returned to the Bracebridge home to see if she were
                        still there. At six he had an opportunity to say to her, unobserved,
                        &quot;I am going to walk home with you. Wait for me at the next corner,
                        will you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, a sense of compulsion to do his bidding
                        seizing her. She explained to herself afterward that she ought to talk to
                        him, that she must tell him finally of her decision not to see him again,
                        and this was as good an opportunity as any. At half-past six he left the
                        house on a pretexta forgotten engagementand a little after seven he was
                        waiting for her in a closed carriage near the appointed spot. He was calm,
                        absolutely satisfied as to the result, and curiously elated beneath a
                        sturdy, shock-proof exterior. It was as if he breathed some fragrant
                        perfume, soft, grateful, entrancing.</p>
                    <p>A few minutes after eight he saw Jennie coming along. The flare of the
                        gas-lamp was not strong, but it gave sufficient light for his eyes to make
                        her out. A wave of sympathy passed over him, for there was a great appeal in
                        her personality. He stepped out as she neared the corner and confronted her.
                        &quot;Come,&quot; he said, &quot;and get in this carriage with
                        me. I&apos;ll take you home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied. &quot;I don&apos;t think I ought
                        to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come with me. I&apos;ll take you home. It&apos;s a better
                        way to talk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Once more that sense of dominance on his part, that power of compulsion. She
                        yielded, feeling all the time that she should not; he called out to the
                        cabman, &quot;Anywhere for a little while.&quot; When she was seated
                        beside him he began at once.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-146" n="139"/>
                    <p>&quot;Listen to me, Jennie, I want you. Tell me something about
                        yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have to talk to you,&quot; she replied, trying to stick to
                        her original line of defense.</p>
                    <p>&quot;About what?&quot; he inquired, seeking to fathom her expression
                        in the half light.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t go on this way,&quot; she murmured nervously.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t act this way. You don&apos;t know how it all
                        is. I shouldn&apos;t have done what I did this morning. I
                        mustn&apos;t see you any more. Really I mustn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t do what you did this morning,&quot; he
                        remarked, paradoxically, seizing on that one particular expression.
                        &quot;I did that. And as for seeing me any more, I&apos;m going to
                        see you.&quot; He seized her hand. &quot;You don&apos;t know me,
                        but I like you. I&apos;m crazy about you, that&apos;s all. You
                        belong to me. Now listen. I&apos;m going to have you. Are you going to
                        come to me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no, no!&quot; she replied in an agonized voice, &quot;I
                        can&apos;t do anything like that, Mr. Kane. Please listen to me. It
                        can&apos;t be. You don&apos;t know. Oh, you don&apos;t know. I
                        can&apos;t do what you want. I don&apos;t want to. I
                        couldn&apos;t, even if I wanted to. You don&apos;t know how things
                        are. But I don&apos;t want to do anything wrong. I mustn&apos;t. I
                        can&apos;t. I won&apos;t. Oh, no! no!! no!!! Please let me go
                        home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He listened to this troubled, feverish outburst with sympathy, with even a
                        little pity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean by you can&apos;t?&quot; he asked,
                        curiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I can&apos;t tell you,&quot; she replied.
                        &quot;Please don&apos;t ask me. You oughtn&apos;t to know. But I
                        mustn&apos;t see you any more. It won&apos;t do any good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you like me,&quot; he retorted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh yes, yes, I do. I can&apos;t help that. But you
                        mustn&apos;t come near me any more. Please don&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned his proposition over in his mind with the solemnity of a judge. He
                        knew that this girl liked him <pb id="VAA2406-147" n="140"/> loved him
                        really, brief as their contact had been. And he was drawn to her, perhaps
                        not irrevocably, but with exceeding strength. What prevented her from
                        yielding, especially since she wanted to? He was curious.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See here, Jennie,&quot; he replied. &quot;I hear what you
                        say. I don&apos;t know what you mean by
                        &apos;can&apos;t&apos; if you want to. You say you like me. Why
                        can&apos;t you come to me? You&apos;re my sort. We will get along
                        beautifully together. You&apos;re suited to me temperamentally.
                        I&apos;d like to have you with me. What makes you say you can&apos;t
                        come?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t,&quot; she replied. &quot;I
                        can&apos;t. I don&apos;t want to. I oughtn&apos;t. Oh, please
                        don&apos;t ask me any more. You don&apos;t know. I can&apos;t
                        tell you why.&quot; She was thinking of her baby.</p>
                    <p>The man had a keen sense of justice and fair play. Above all things he wanted
                        to be decent in his treatment of people. In this case he intended to be
                        tender and considerate, and yet he must win her. He turned this over in his
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen to me,&quot; he said finally, still holding her hand.
                        &quot;I may not want you to do anything immediately. I want you to think
                        it over. But you belong to me. You say you care for me. You admitted that
                        this morning. I know you do. Now why should you stand out against me? I like
                        you, and I can do a lot of things for you. Why not let us be good friends
                        now? Then we can talk the rest of this over later.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I mustn&apos;t do anything wrong,&quot; she insisted.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t want to. Please don&apos;t come near me any
                        more. I can&apos;t do what you want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, look here,&quot; he said. &quot;You don&apos;t
                        mean that. Why did you say you liked me? Have you changed your mind? Look at
                        me.&quot; (She had lowered her eyes.) &quot;Look at me! You
                        haven&apos;t, have you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh no, no, no,&quot; she half sobbed, swept by some force
                        beyond her control.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-148" n="141"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, why stand out against me? I love you, I tell
                        youI&apos;m crazy about you. That&apos;s why I came back this time.
                        It was to see you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was it?&quot; asked Jennie, surprised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it was. And I would have come again and again if necessary. I
                        tell you I&apos;m crazy about you. I&apos;ve got to have you. Now
                        tell me you&apos;ll come with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no, no,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I can&apos;t. I
                        must work. I want to work. I don&apos;t want to do anything wrong.
                        Please don&apos;t ask me. You mustn&apos;t. You must let me go.
                        Really you must. I can&apos;t do what you want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me, Jennie,&quot; he said, changing the subject.
                        &quot;What does your father do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a glass-blower.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here in Cleveland?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, he works in Youngstown.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is your mother alive?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You live with her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled at the &quot;sir.&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t say
                        &apos;sir&apos; to me, sweet!&quot; he pleaded in his gruff way.
                        &quot;And don&apos;t insist on the <hi rend="i">Mr.</hi> Kane.
                        I&apos;m not &apos;mister&apos; to you any more. You belong to
                        me, little girl, me.&quot; And he pulled her close to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please don&apos;t, Mr. Kane,&quot; she pleaded.
                        &quot;Oh, please don&apos;t. I can&apos;t! I can&apos;t! You
                        mustn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But he sealed her lips with his own.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen to me, Jennie,&quot; he repeated, using his favorite
                        expression. &quot;I tell you you belong to me. I like you better every
                        moment. I haven&apos;t had a chance to know you. I&apos;m not going
                        to give you up. You&apos;ve got to come to me eventually. And
                        I&apos;m not going to have you working as a lady&apos;s maid. You
                        can&apos;t stay in that place except for a little while. I&apos;m
                        going to take you somewhere else. And I&apos;m going to leave you some
                        money, do you hear? You have to take it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-149" n="142"/>
                    <p>At the word money she quailed and withdrew her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no, no!&quot; she repeated. &quot;No, I won&apos;t
                        take it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you will. Give it to your mother. I&apos;m not trying to
                        buy you. I know what you think. But I&apos;m not. I want to help you. I
                        want to help your family. I know where you live. I saw the place to-day. How
                        many are there of you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Six,&quot; she answered faintly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The families of the poor,&quot; he thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you take this from me,&quot; he insisted, drawing a purse
                        from his coat. &quot;And I&apos;ll see you very soon again.
                        There&apos;s no escape, sweet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; she protested. &quot;I won&apos;t. I
                        don&apos;t need it. No, you mustn&apos;t ask me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He insisted further, but she was firm, and finally he put the money away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One thing is sure, Jennie, you&apos;re not going to escape
                        me,&quot; he said soberly. &quot;You&apos;ll have to come to me
                        eventually. Don&apos;t you know you will? Your own attitude shows that.
                        I&apos;m not going to leave you alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, if you knew the trouble you&apos;re causing me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not causing you any real trouble, am I?&quot; he
                        asked. &quot;Surely not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I can never do what you want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will! You will!&quot; he exclaimed eagerly, the bare
                        thought of this prize escaping him heightening his passion.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll come to me.&quot; And he drew her close in
                        spite of all her protests.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There,&quot; he said when, after the struggle, that mystic
                        something between them spoke again, and she relaxed. Tears were in her eyes,
                        but he did not see them. &quot;Don&apos;t you see how it is? You
                        like me too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t,&quot; she repeated, with a sob.</p>
                    <p>Her evident distress touched him. &quot;You&apos;re not crying,
                        little girl, are you?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>She made no answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; he went on. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        not say anything <pb id="VAA2406-150" n="[143]"/> more to-night.
                        We&apos;re almost at your home. I&apos;m leaving to-morrow, but
                        I&apos;ll see you again. Yes, I will, sweet. I can&apos;t give you
                        up now. I&apos;ll do anything in reason to make it easy for you, but I
                        can&apos;t, do you hear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here&apos;s where you get out,&quot; he said, as the
                        carriage drew up near the corner. He could see the evening lamp gleaming
                        behind the Gerhardt cottage curtains.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-by,&quot; he said as she stepped out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-by,&quot; she murmured.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Remember,&quot; he said, &quot;this is just the
                        beginning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh no, no!&quot; she pleaded.</p>
                    <p>He looked after her as she walked away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The beauty!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>Jennie stepped into the house weary, discouraged, ashamed. What had she done?
                        There was no denying that she had compromised herself irretrievably. He
                        would come back.</p>
                    <p>He would come back. And he had offered her money. That was the worst of
                    all.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XIX</head>
                    <p>THE inconclusive nature of this interview, exciting as it was, did not leave
                        any doubt in either Lester Kane&apos;s or Jennie&apos;s mind;
                        certainly this was not the end of the affair. Kane knew that he was deeply
                        fascinated. This girl was lovely. She was sweeter than he had had any idea
                        of. Her hesitancy, her repeated protests, her gentle &quot;no, no,
                        no&quot; moved him as music might. Depend upon it, this girl was for
                        him, and he would get her. She was too sweet to let go. What did he care
                        about what his family or the world might think?</p>
                    <p>It was curious that Kane held the well-founded idea that in time Jennie would
                        yield to him physically, as she had already done spiritually. Just why he
                        could not say. Something about hera warm womanhood, a guileless expression
                        of countenanceintimated a sympathy toward sex relationship which had nothing
                        to do with hard, brutal immorality. She was the kind of a woman who was made
                        for a manone man. All her attitude toward sex was bound up with love,
                        tenderness, service. When the one man arrived she would love him and she
                        would go to him. That was Jennie as Lester understood her. He felt it. She
                        would yield to him because he was the one man.</p>
                    <p>On Jennie&apos;s part there was a great sense of complication and of
                        possible disaster. If he followed her of course he would learn all. She had
                        not told him about Brander, because she was still under the vague illusion
                        that, in the end, she might escape. When she left him she knew that he would
                        come back. She knew, in spite <pb id="VAA2406-152" n="145"/> of herself that
                        she wanted him to do so. Yet she felt that she must not yield, she must go
                        on leading her straitened, humdrum life. This was her punishment for having
                        made a mistake. She had made her bed, and she must lie on it.</p>
                    <p>The Kane family mansion at Cincinnati to which Lester returned after leaving
                        Jennie was an imposing establishment, which contrasted strangely with the
                        Gerhardt home. It was a great, rambling, two-story affair, done after the
                        manner of the French chateaux, but in red brick and brownstone. It was set
                        down, among flowers and trees, in an almost park-like inclosure, and its
                        very stones spoke of a splendid dignity and of a refined luxury. Old
                        Archibald Kane, the father, had amassed a tremendous fortune, not by
                        grabbing and browbeating and unfair methods, but by seeing a big need and
                        filling it. Early in life he had realized that America was a growing
                        country. There was going to be a big demand for vehicleswagons, carriages,
                        draysand he knew that some one would have to supply them. Having founded a
                        small wagon industry, he had built it up into a great business; he made good
                        wagons, and he sold them at a good profit. It was his theory that most men
                        were honest; he believed that at bottom they wanted honest things, and if
                        you gave them these they would buy of you, and come back and buy again and
                        again, until you were an influential and rich man. He believed in the
                        measure &quot;heaped full and running over.&quot; All through his
                        life and now in his old age he enjoyed the respect and approval of every one
                        who knew him. &quot;Archibald Kane,&quot; you would hear his
                        competitors say, &quot;Ah, there is a fine man. Shrewd, but honest.
                        He&apos;s a big man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This man was the father of two sons and three daughters, all healthy, all
                        good-looking, all blessed with exceptional minds, but none of them so
                        generous and forceful as their long-living and big-hearted sire. Robert, the
                            <pb id="VAA2406-153" n="146"/> eldest, a man forty years of age, was his
                        father&apos;s right-hand man in financial matters, having a certain hard
                        incisiveness which fitted him for the somewhat sordid details of business
                        life. He was of medium height, of a rather spare build, with a high
                        forehead, slightly inclined to baldness, bright, liquid-blue eyes, an eagle
                        nose, and thin, firm, even lips. He was a man of few words, rather slow to
                        action and of deep thought. He sat close to his father as vice-president of
                        the big company which occupied two whole blocks in an outlying section of
                        the city. He was a strong mana coming man, as his father well knew.</p>
                    <p>Lester, the second boy, was his father&apos;s favorite. He was not by any
                        means the financier that Robert was, but he had a larger vision of the
                        subtleties that underlie life. He was softer, more human, more good-natured
                        about everything. And, strangely enough, old Archibald admired and trusted
                        him. He knew he had the bigger vision. Perhaps he turned to Robert when it
                        was a question of some intricate financial problem, but Lester was the most
                        loved as a son.</p>
                    <p>Then there was Amy, thirty-two years of age, married, handsome, the mother of
                        one childa boy; Imogene, twenty-eight, also married, but as yet without
                        children, and Louise, twenty-five, single, the best-looking of the girls,
                        but also the coldest and most critical. She was the most eager of all for
                        social distinction, the most vigorous of all in her love of family prestige,
                        the most desirous that the Kane family should outshine every other. She was
                        proud to think that the family was so well placed socially, and carried
                        herself with an air and a hauteur which was sometimes amusing, sometimes
                        irritating to Lester! He liked herin a way she was his favorite sisterbut he
                        thought she might take herself with a little less seriousness and not do the
                        family standing any harm.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Kane, the mother, was a quiet, refined woman, <pb id="VAA2406-154"
                            n="147"/> sixty years of age, who, having come up from comparative
                        poverty with her husband, cared but little for social life. But she loved
                        her children and her husband, and was naively proud of their position and
                        attainments. It was enough for her to shine only in their reflected glory. A
                        good woman, a good wife, and a good mother.</p>
                    <p>Lester arrived at Cincinnati early in the evening, and drove at once to his
                        home. An old Irish servitor met him at the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, Mr. Lester,&quot; he began, joyously, &quot;sure
                        I&apos;m glad to see you back. I&apos;ll take your coat. Yes, yes,
                        it&apos;s been fine weather we&apos;re having. Yes, yes, the
                        family&apos;s all well. Sure your sister Amy is just after
                        leavin&apos; the house with the boy. Your mother&apos;s up-stairs in
                        her room. Yes, yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester smiled cheerily and went up to his mother&apos;s room. In this,
                        which was done in white and gold and overlooked the garden to the south and
                        east, sat Mrs. Kane, a subdued, graceful, quiet woman, with smoothly laid
                        gray hair. She looked up when the door opened, laid down the volume that she
                        had been reading, and rose to greet him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There you are, Mother,&quot; he said, putting his arms around
                        her and kissing her. &quot;How are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m just about the same, Lester. How have you
                        been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fine. I was up with the Bracebridges for a few days again. I had to
                        stop off in Cleveland to see Parsons. They all asked after you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How is Minnie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just the same. She doesn&apos;t change any that I can see.
                        She&apos;s just as interested in entertaining as she ever was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s a bright girl,&quot; remarked his mother,
                        recalling Mrs. Bracebridge as a girl in Cincinnati. &quot;I always liked
                        her. She&apos;s so sensible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She hasn&apos;t lost any of that, I can tell you,&quot;
                        replied <pb id="VAA2406-155" n="[148]"/> Lester significantly. Mrs. Kane
                        smiled and went on to speak of various family happenings. Imogene&apos;s
                        husband was leaving for St. Louis on some errand. Robert&apos;s wife was
                        sick with a cold. Old Zwingle, the yard watchman at the factory, who had
                        been with Mr. Kane for over forty years, had died. Her husband was going to
                        the funeral. Lester listened dutifully, albeit a trifle absently.</p>
                    <p>Lester, as he walked down the hall, encountered Louise.
                        &quot;Smart&quot; was the word for her. She was dressed in a beaded
                        black silk dress, fitting close to her form, with a burst of rubies at her
                        throat which contrasted effectively with her dark complexion and black hair.
                        Her eyes were black and piercing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, there you are, Lester,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;When
                        did you get in? Be careful how you kiss me. I&apos;m going out, and
                        I&apos;m all fixed, even to the powder on my nose. Oh, you
                        bear!&quot; Lester had gripped her firmly and kissed her soundly. She
                        pushed him away with her strong hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t brush much of it off,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;You can always dust more on with that puff of yours.&quot; He
                        passed on to his own room to dress for dinner. Dressing for dinner was a
                        custom that had been adopted by the Kane family in the last few years.
                        Guests had become so common that in a way it was a necessity, and Louise, in
                        particular, made a point of it. To-night Robert was coming, and a Mr. and
                        Mrs. Burnett, old friends of his father and mother, and so, of course, the
                        meal would be a formal one. Lester knew that his father was around
                        somewhere, but he did not trouble to look him up now. He was thinking of his
                        last two days in Cleveland and wondering when he would see Jennie again.</p>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>CHAPTER XX</head>
                    <p>AS Lester came down-stairs after making his toilet he found his father in the
                        library reading.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, Lester,&quot; he said, looking up from his paper over
                        the top of his glasses and extending his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where do you come from?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cleveland,&quot; replied his son, shaking hands heartily, and
                        smiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Robert tells me you&apos;ve been to New York.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I was there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did you find my old friend Arnold?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just about the same,&quot; returned Lester. &quot;He
                        doesn&apos;t look any older.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose not,&quot; said Archibald Kane genially, as if the
                        report were a compliment to his own hardy condition. &quot;He&apos;s
                        been a temperate man. A fine old gentleman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He led the way back to the sitting-room where they chatted over business and
                        home news until the chime of the clock in the hall warned the guests
                        up-stairs that dinner had been served.</p>
                    <p>Lester sat down in great comfort amid the splendors of the great Louis Quinze
                        dining-room. He liked this homey home atmospherehis mother and father and
                        his sistersthe old family friends. So he smiled and was exceedingly genial.</p>
                    <p>Louise announced that the Leverings were going to give a dance on Tuesday,
                        and inquired whether he into ded to go.</p>
                    <p>You know I don&apos;t dance,&quot; he returned dryly, &quot;Why
                            <unclear>she-ald</unclear> I go?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-157" n="150"/>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t dance? Won&apos;t dance, you mean.
                        You&apos;re getting too lazy to move. If Robert is willing to dance
                        occasionally I think you might.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Robert&apos;s got it on me in lightness,&quot; Lester
                        replied, airily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And politeness,&quot; retorted Louise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be that as it may,&quot; said Lester.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t try to stir up a fight, Louise,&quot; observed
                        Robert, sagely.</p>
                    <p>After dinner they adjourned to the library, and Robert talked with his
                        brother a little on business. There were some contracts coming up for
                        revision. He wanted to see what suggestions Lester had to make. Louise was
                        going to a party, and the carriage was now announced. &quot;So you are
                        not coming?&quot; she asked, a trifle complainingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Too tired,&quot; said Lester lightly. &quot;Make my excuses
                        to Mrs. Knowles.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Letty Pace asked about you the other night,&quot; Louise called
                        back from the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kind,&quot; replied Lester. &quot;I&apos;m greatly
                        obliged.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s a nice girl, Lester,&quot; put in his father,
                        who was standing near the open fire. &quot;I only wish you would marry
                        her and settle down. You&apos;d have a good wife in her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s charming,&quot; testified Mrs. Kane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is this?&quot; asked Lester jocularly&quot;a
                        conspiracy? You know I&apos;m not strong on the matrimonial
                        business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I well know it,&quot; replied his mother semiseriously.
                        &quot;I wish you were.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester changed the subject. He really could not stand for this sort of thing
                        any more, he told himself. And as he thought his mind wandered back to
                        Jennie and her peculiar &quot;Oh no, no!&quot; There was some
                            <unclear>-e</unclear> that appealed to him. That was a type of woman
                            <unclear>-d</unclear> worth while. Not sophisticated, not self-seeking,
                        not <pb id="VAA2406-158" n="[151]"/> watched over and set like a man-trap in
                        the path of men, but a sweet little girlsweet as a flower, who was without
                        anybody, apparently, to watch over her. That night in his room he composed a
                        letter, which he dated a week later, because he did not want to appear too
                        urgent and because he could not again leave Cincinnati for at least two
                        weeks. <text>

                                        impression I gave of myself very bad? I will make it better
                                        from now on, for I love you, little girlI really do. There
                                        is a flower on my table which reminds me of you very
                                        muchwhite, delicate, beautiful. Your personality, lingering
                                        with me, is just that. You are the essence of everything
                                        beautiful to me. It is in your power to strew flowers in my
                                        path if you will.</p>
                                    <p>&quot;But what I want to say here is that I shall be in
                                        Cleveland on the 18th, and I shall expect to see you. I
                                        arrive Thursday night, and I want you to meet me in the
                                        ladies&apos; parlor of the Dornton at noon Friday. Will
                                        you? You can lunch with me.</p>
                                    <p>&quot;You see, I respect your suggestion that I should
                                        not call. (I will noton condition.) These separations are
                                        dangerous to good friendship. Write me that you will. I
                                        throw myself on your generosity. But I can&apos;t take

                    <head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
                    <p>THE arrival of this letter, coming after a week of silence and after she had
                        had a chance to think, moved Jennie deeply. What did she want to do? What
                        ought she to do? How did she truly feel about this man? Did she sincerely
                        wish to answer his letter? If she did so, what should she say? Heretofore
                        all her movements, even the one in which she had sought to sacrifice herself
                        for the sake of Bass in Columbus, had not seemed to involve any one but
                        herself. Now, there seemed to be others to consider her family, above all,
                        her child. The little Vesta was now eighteen months of age; she was an
                        interesting child; her large, blue eyes and light hair giving promise of a
                        comeliness which would closely approximate that of her mother, while her
                        mential traits indicated a clear and intelligent mind. Mrs. Gerhardt had
                        become very fond of her. Gerhardt had unbended so gradually that his
                        interest was not even yet clearly discernible, but he had a distinct feeling
                        of kindliness toward her. And this readjustment of her father&apos;s
                        attitude had aroused in Jennie an ardent desire to so conduct herself that
                        no pain should ever come to him again. Any new folly on her part would not
                        only be base ingratitude to her father, but would tend to injure the
                        prospects of her little one. Her life was a failure, she fancied, but
                        Vesta&apos;s was a thing apart; she must do nothing to spoil it. She
                        wondered whether it would not be better to write Lester and explain
                        everything. She had told him that she did not wish to do wrong. Suppose she
                        went on to inform him <pb id="VAA2406-160" n="153"/> that she had a child,
                        and beg him to leave her in peace. Would he obey her? She doubted it. Did
                        she really want him to take her at her word?</p>
                    <p>The need of making this confession was a painful thing to Jennie. It caused
                        her to hesitate, to start a letter in which she tried to explain, and then
                        to tear it up. Finally, fate intervened in the sudden home-coming of her
                        father, who had been seriously injured by an accident at the glass-works in
                        Youngstown where he worked.</p>
                    <p>It was on a Wednesday afternoon, in the latter part of August, when a letter
                        came from Gerhardt. But instead of the customary fatherly communication,
                        written in German and inclosing the regular weekly remittance of five
                        dollars, there was only a brief note, written by another hand, and
                        explaining that the day before Gerhardt had received a severe burn on both
                        hands, due to the accidental overturning of a dipper of molten glass. The
                        letter added that he would be home the next morning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you think of that?&quot; exclaimed William, his mouth
                        wide open.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poor papa!&quot; said Veronica, tears welling up in her eyes.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt sat down, clasped her hands in her lap, and stared at the
                        floor. &quot;Now, what to do?&quot; she nervously exclaimed. The
                        possibility that Gerhardt was disabled for life opened long vistas of
                        difficulties which she had not the courage to contemplate.</p>
                    <p>Bass came home at half-past six and Jennie at eight. The former heard the
                        news with an astonished face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gee! that&apos;s tough, isn&apos;t it?&quot; he
                        exclaimed. &quot;Did the letter say how bad he was hurt?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Mrs. Gerhardt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I wouldn&apos;t worry about it,&quot; said Bass
                        easily. &quot;It won&apos;t do any good. We&apos;ll get along
                        somehow. I wouldn&apos;t worry like that if I were you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The truth was, he wouldn&apos;t, because his nature was wholly different.
                        Life did not rest heavily upon his <pb id="VAA2406-161" n="154"/> shoulders.
                        His brain was not large enough to grasp the significance and weigh the
                        results of things.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt, endeavoring to recover
                        herself. &quot;I can&apos;t help it, though. To think that just when
                        we were getting along fairly well this new calamity should be added. It
                        seems sometimes as if we were under a curse. We have so much bad
                        luck.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Jennie came her mother turned to her instinctively; here was her one
                        stay.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter, ma?&quot; asked Jennie as she
                        opened the door and observed her mother&apos;s face. &quot;What have
                        you been crying about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt looked at her, and then turned half away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pa&apos;s had his hands burned,&quot; put in Bass solemnly.
                        &quot;He&apos;ll be home to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie turned and stared at him. &quot;His hands burned!&quot; she
                        exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Bass.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did it happen?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A pot of glass was turned over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie looked at her mother, and her eyes dimmed with tears. Instinctively
                        she ran to her and put her arms around her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, don&apos;t you cry, ma,&quot; she said, barely able to
                        control herself. &quot;Don&apos;t you worry. I know how you feel,
                        but we&apos;ll get along. Don&apos;t cry now.&quot; Then her own
                        lips lost their evenness, and she struggled long before she could pluck up
                        courage to contemplate this new disaster. And now without volition upon her
                        part there leaped into her consciousness a new and subtly persistent
                        thought. What about Lester&apos;s offer of assistance now? What about
                        his declaration of love? Somehow it came back to herhis affection, his
                        personality, his desire to help her, his sympathy, so like that which
                        Brander had shown when Bass was in jail. Was she doomed to a second
                        sacrifice? Did it really <pb id="VAA2406-162" n="155"/> make any difference?
                        Wasn&apos;t her life a failure already? She thought this over as she
                        looked at her mother sitting there so silent, haggard, and distraught.
                        &quot;What a pity,&quot; she thought, &quot;that her mother must
                        always suffer! Wasn&apos;t it a shame that she could never have any real
                        happiness?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t feel so badly,&quot; she said, after a
                        time. &quot;Maybe pa isn&apos;t burned so badly as we think. Did the
                        letter say he&apos;d be home in the morning?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt, recovering herself.</p>
                    <p>They talked more quietly from now on, and gradually, as the details were
                        exhausted, a kind of dumb peace settled down upon the household.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One of us ought to go to the train to meet him in the
                        morning,&quot; said Jennie to Bass. &quot;I will. I guess Mrs.
                        Bracebridge won&apos;t mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Bass gloomily, &quot;you mustn&apos;t. I
                        can go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was sour at this new fling of fate, and he looked his feelings; he stalked
                        off gloomily to his room and shut himself in. Jennie and her mother saw the
                        others off to bed, and then sat out in the kitchen talking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see what&apos;s to become of us now,&quot;
                        said Mrs. Gerhardt at last, completely overcome by the financial
                        complications which this new calamity had brought about. She looked so weak
                        and helpless that Jennie could hardly contain herself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry, mamma dear,&quot; she said, softly, a
                        peculiar resolve coming into her heart. The world was wide. There was
                        comfort and ease in it scattered by others with a lavish hand. Surely,
                        surely misfortune could not press so sharply but that they could live!</p>
                    <p>She sat down with her mother, the difficulties of the future seeming to
                        approach with audible and ghastly steps.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you suppose will become of us now?&quot; repeated her
                        mother, who saw how her fanciful conception of this Cleveland home had
                        crumbled before her eyes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-163" n="156"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Jennie, who saw clearly and knew what could be
                        done, &quot;it will be all right. I wouldn&apos;t worry about it.
                        Something will happen. We&apos;ll get something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She realized, as she sat there, that fate had shifted the burden of the
                        situation to her. She must sacrifice herself; there was no other way.</p>
                    <p>Bass met his father at the railway station in the morning. He looked very
                        pale, and seemed to have suffered a great deal. His cheeks were slightly
                        sunken and his bony profile appeared rather gaunt. His hands were heavily
                        bandaged, and altogether he presented such a picture of distress that many
                        stopped to look at him on the way home from the station.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By chops,&quot; he said to Bass, &quot;that was a burn I
                        got. I thought once I couldn&apos;t stand the pain any longer. Such pain
                        I had! Such pain! By chops! I will never forget it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He related just how the accident had occurred, and said that he did not know
                        whether he would ever be able to use his hands again. The thumb on his right
                        hand and the first two fingers on the left had been burned to the bone. The
                        latter had been amputated at the first jointthe thumb he might save, but his
                        hands would be in danger of being stiff.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By chops!&quot; he added, &quot;just at the time when I
                        needed the money most. Too bad! Too bad!&quot;</p>
                    <p>When they reached the house, and Mrs. Gerhardt opened the door, the old
                        mill-worker, conscious of her voiceless sympathy, began to cry. Mrs.
                        Gerhardt sobbed also. Even Bass lost control of himself for a moment or two,
                        but quickly recovered. The other children wept, until Bass called a halt on
                        all of them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t cry now,&quot; he said cheeringly.
                        &quot;What&apos;s the use of crying? It isn&apos;t so bad as all
                        that. You&apos;ll be all right again. We can get along.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bass&apos;s words had a soothing effect, temporarily, and, <pb
                            id="VAA2406-164" n="157"/> now that her husband was home, Mrs. Gerhardt
                        recovered her composure. Though his hands were bandaged, the mere fact that
                        he could walk and was not otherwise injured was some consolation. He might
                        recover the use of his hands and be able to undertake light work again.
                        Anyway, they would hope for the best.</p>
                    <p>When Jennie came home that night she wanted to run to her father and lay the
                        treasury of her services and affection at his feet, but she trembled lest he
                        might be as cold to her as formerly.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt, too, was troubled. Never had he completely recovered from the shame
                        which his daughter had brought upon him. Although he wanted to be kindly,
                        his feelings were so tangled that he hardly knew what to say or do.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Papa,&quot; said Jennie, approaching him timidly.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt looked confused and tried to say something natural, but it was
                        unavailing. The thought of his helplessness, the knowledge of her sorrow and
                        of his own responsiveness to her affectionit was all too much for him; he
                        broke down again and cried helplessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forgive me, papa,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;I&apos;m so
                        sorry. Oh, I&apos;m so sorry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not attempt to look at her, but in the swirl of feeling that their
                        meeting created he thought that he could forgive, and he did.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have prayed,&quot; he said brokenly. &quot;It is all
                        right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When he recovered himself he felt ashamed of his emotion, but a new
                        relationship of sympathy and of understanding had been established. From
                        that time, although there was always a great reserve between them, Gerhardt
                        tried not to ignore her completely, and she endeavored to show him the
                        simple affection of a daughter, just as in the old days.</p>
                    <p>But while the household was again at peace, there were other cares and
                        burdens to be faced. How were they to get along now with five dollars taken
                        from the <pb id="VAA2406-165" n="[158]"/> weekly budget, and with the cost
                        of Gerhardt&apos;s presence added? Bass might have contributed more of
                        his weekly earnings, but he did not feel called upon to do it. And so the
                        small sum of nine dollars weekly must meet as best it could the current
                        expenses of rent, food, and coal, to say nothing of incidentals, which now
                        began to press very heavily. Gerhardt had to go to a doctor to have his
                        hands dressed daily. George needed a new pair of shoes. Either more money
                        must come from some source or the family must beg for credit and suffer the
                        old tortures of want. The situation crystallized the half-formed resolve in
                        Jennie&apos;s mind.</p>
                    <p>Lester&apos;s letter had been left unanswered. The day was drawing near.
                        Should she write? He would help them. Had he not tried to force money on
                        her? She finally decided that it was her duty to avail herself of this
                        proffered assistance. She sat down and wrote him a brief note. She would
                        meet him as he had requested, but he would please not come to the house. She
                        mailed the letter, and then waited, with mingled feelings of trepidation and
                        thrilling expectancy, the arrival of the fateful day.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXII</head>
                    <p>THE fatal Friday came, and Jennie stood face to face with this new and
                        overwhelming complication in her modest scheme of existence. There was
                        really no alternative, she thought. Her own life was a failure. Why go on
                        fighting? If she could make her family happy, if she could give Vesta a good
                        education, if she could conceal the true nature of this older story and keep
                        Vesta in the backgroundperhaps, perhapswell, rich men had married poor girls
                        before this, and Lester was very kind, he certainly liked her. At seven
                        o&apos;clock she went to Mrs. Bracebridge&apos;s; at noon she
                        excused herself on the pretext of some work for her mother and left the
                        house for the hotel.</p>
                    <p>Lester, leaving Cincinnati a few days earlier than he expected, had failed to
                        receive her reply; he arrived at Cleveland feeling sadly out of tune with
                        the world. He had a lingering hope that a letter from Jennie might be
                        awaiting him at the hotel, but there was no word from her. He was a man not
                        easily wrought up, but to-night he felt depressed, and so went gloomily up
                        to his room and changed his linen. After supper he proceeded to drown his
                        dissatisfaction in a game of billiards with some friends, from whom he did
                        not part until he had taken very much more than his usual amount of
                        alcoholic stimulant. The next morning he arose with a vague idea of
                        abandoning the whole affair, but as the hours elapsed and the time of his
                        appointment drew near he decided that it might not be unwise to give her one
                        last chance. She might come. Accordingly, when it still <pb id="VAA2406-167"
                            n="160"/> lacked a quarter of an hour of the time, he went down into the
                        parlor. Great was his delight when he beheld her sitting in a chair and
                        waitingthe outcome of her acquiescence. He walked briskly up, a satisfied,
                        gratified smile on his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you did come after all,&quot; he said, gazing at her with
                        the look of one who has lost and recovered a prize. &quot;What do you
                        mean by not writing me? I thought from the way you neglected me that you had
                        made up your mind not to come at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did write,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To the address you gave me. I wrote three days ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That explains it. It came too late. You should have written me
                        before. How have you been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, all right,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t look it!&quot; he said. &quot;You look
                        worried. What&apos;s the trouble, Jennie? Nothing gone wrong out at your
                        house, has there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a fortuitous question. He hardly knew why he had asked it. Yet it
                        opened the door to what she wanted to say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My father&apos;s sick,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s happened to him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He burned his hands at the glass-works. We&apos;ve been
                        terribly worried. It looks as though he would not be able to use them any
                        more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused, looking the distress she felt, and he saw plainly that she was
                        facing a crisis.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s too bad,&quot; he said. &quot;That
                        certainly is. When did this happen?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, almost three weeks ago now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It certainly is bad. Come in to lunch, though. I want to talk with
                        you. I&apos;ve been wanting to get a better understanding of your family
                        affairs ever since I left.&quot; He led the way into the dining-room and
                        selected <pb id="VAA2406-168" n="161"/> a secluded table. He tried to divert
                        her mind by asking her to order the luncheon, but she was too worried and
                        too shy to do so and he had to make out the menu by himself. Then he turned
                        to her with a cheering air. &quot;Now, Jennie,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;I want you to tell me all about your family. I got a little
                        something of it last time, but I want to get it straight. Your father, you
                        said, was a glass-blower by trade. Now he can&apos;t work any more at
                        that, that&apos;s obvious.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How many other children are there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Six.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you the oldest?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, my brother Sebastian is. He&apos;s twenty-two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what does he do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a clerk in a cigar store.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know how much he makes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think it&apos;s twelve dollars,&quot; she replied
                        thought-fully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the other children?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Martha and Veronica don&apos;t do anything yet.
                        They&apos;re too young. My brother George works at Wilson&apos;s.
                        He&apos;s a cash-boy. He gets three dollars and a half.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And how much do you make?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I make four.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stopped, figuring up mentally just what they had to live on. &quot;How
                        much rent do you pay?&quot; he continued.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Twelve dollars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How old is your mother?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s nearly fifty now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned a fork in his hands back and forth; he was thinking earnestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To tell you the honest truth, I fancied it was something like that,
                        Jennie,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve been thinking about you a
                        lot. Now, I know. There&apos;s only one answer to your problem, and it
                        isn&apos;t such a bad one, if you&apos;ll only believe me.&quot;
                        He paused for an jnquiry, <pb id="VAA2406-169" n="162"/> but she made none.
                        Her mind was running on her own difficulties.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you want to know?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered mechanically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s me,&quot; he replied. &quot;You have to let
                        me help you. I wanted to last time. Now you have to; do you hear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I wouldn&apos;t,&quot; she said simply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew what you thought,&quot; he replied.
                        &quot;That&apos;s all over now. I&apos;m going to &apos;tend
                        to that family of yours. And I&apos;ll do it right now while I think of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He drew out his purse and extracted several ten and twenty-dollar billstwo
                        hundred and fifty dollars in all. &quot;I want you to take
                        this,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s just the beginning. I will
                        see that your family is provided for from now on. Here, give me your
                        hand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; she said. &quot;Not so much. Don&apos;t
                        give me all that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied. &quot;Don&apos;t argue. Here.
                        Give me your hand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She put it out in answer to the summons of his eyes, and he shut her fingers
                        on the money, pressing them gently at the same time. &quot;I want you to
                        have it, sweet. I love you, little girl. I&apos;m not going to see you
                        suffer, nor any one belonging to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes looked a dumb thankfulness, and she bit her lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know how to thank you,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t need to,&quot; he replied. &quot;The
                        thanks are all the other waybelieve me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused and looked at her, the beauty of her face holding him. She looked
                        at the table, wondering what would come next.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would you like to leave what you&apos;re doing and stay at
                        home?&quot; he asked. &quot;That would give you your freedom day
                        times.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t do that,&quot; she replied. &quot;Papa
                        wouldn&apos;t allow it. He knows I ought to work.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-170" n="163"/>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s true enough,&quot; he said. &quot;But
                        there&apos;s so little in what you&apos;re doing. Good heavens! Four
                        dollars a week! I would be glad to give you fifty times that sum if I
                        thought there was any way in which you could use it.&quot; He idly
                        thrummed the cloth with his fingers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t,&quot; she said. &quot;I hardly know
                        how to use this. They&apos;ll suspect. I&apos;ll have to tell
                        mamma.&quot;</p>
                    <p>From the way she said it he judged there must be some bond of sympathy
                        between her and her mother which would permit of a confidence such as this.
                        He was by no means a hard man, and the thought touched him. But he would not
                        relinquish his purpose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s only one thing to be done, as far as I can
                        see,&quot; he went on very gently. &quot;You&apos;re not suited
                        for the kind of work you&apos;re doing. You&apos;re too refined. I
                        object to it. Give it up and come with me down to New York; I&apos;ll
                        take good care of you. I love you and want you. As far as your family is
                        concerned, you won&apos;t have to worry about them any more. You can
                        take a nice home for them and furnish it in any style you please.
                        Wouldn&apos;t you like that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused, and Jennie&apos;s thoughts reverted quickly to her mother, her
                        dear mother. All her life long Mrs. Gerhardt had been talking of this very
                        thinga nice home. If they could just have a larger house, with good
                        furniture and a yard filled with trees, how happy she would be. In such a
                        home she would be free of the care of rent, the discomfort of poor
                        furniture, the wretchedness of poverty; she would be so happy. She hesitated
                        there while his keen eye followed her in spirit, and he saw what a power he
                        had set in motion. It had been a happy inspirationthe suggestion of a decent
                        home for the family. He waited a few minutes longer, and then said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, wouldn&apos;t you better let me do that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It would be very nice,&quot; she said, &quot;but it
                        can&apos;t be done now. I couldn&apos;t leave home. Papa would want
                            <pb id="VAA2406-171" n="164"/> to know all about where I was going. I
                        wouldn&apos;t know what to say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why couldn&apos;t you pretend that you are going down to New
                        York with Mrs. Bracebridge?&quot; he suggested. &quot;There
                        couldn&apos;t be any objection to that, could there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not if they didn&apos;t find out,&quot; she said, her eyes
                        opening in amazement. &quot;But if they should!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They won&apos;t,&quot; he replied calmly.
                        &quot;They&apos;re not watching Mrs. Bracebridge&apos;s affairs.
                        Plenty of mistresses take their maids on long trips. Why not simply tell
                        them you&apos;re invited to gohave to goand then go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think I could?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; he replied. &quot;What is there peculiar
                        about that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She thought it over, and the plan did seem feasible. Then she looked at this
                        man and realized that relationship with him meant possible motherhood for
                        her again. The tragedy of giving birth to a childah, she could not go
                        through that a second time, at least under the same conditions. She could
                        not bring herself to tell him about Vesta, but she must voice this
                        insurmountable objection.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&quot; she said, formulating the first word of her sentence,
                        and then stopping.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Iwhat?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&quot; She paused again.</p>
                    <p>He loved her shy ways, her sweet, hesitating lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it, Jennie?&quot; he asked helpfully.
                        &quot;You&apos;re so delicious. Can&apos;t you tell
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her hand was on the table. He reached over and laid his strong brown one on
                        top of it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t have a baby,&quot; she said, finally, and
                        looked down.</p>
                    <p>He gazed at her, and the charm of her frankness, her innate decency under
                        conditions so anomalous, her simple <pb id="VAA2406-172" n="165"/>
                        unaffected recognition of the primal facts of life lifted her to a plane in
                        his esteem which she had not occupied until that moment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re a great girl, Jennie,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;You&apos;re wonderful. But don&apos;t worry about that. It
                        can be at-ranged. You don&apos;t need to have a child unless you want
                        to, and I don&apos;t want you to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He saw the question written in her wondering, shamed face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s so,&quot; he said. &quot;You believe me,
                        don&apos;t you? You think I know, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she faltered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I do. But anyway, I wouldn&apos;t let any trouble come to
                        you. I&apos;ll take you away. Besides, I don&apos;t want any
                        children. There wouldn&apos;t be any satisfaction in that proposition
                        for me at this time. I&apos;d rather wait. But there won&apos;t
                        bedon&apos;t worry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said faintly. Not for worlds could she have met
                        his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look here, Jennie,&quot; he said, after a time. &quot;You
                        care for me, don&apos;t you? You don&apos;t think I&apos;d sit
                        here and plead with you if I didn&apos;t care for you? I&apos;m
                        crazy about you, and that&apos;s the literal truth. You&apos;re like
                        wine to me. I want you to come with me. I want you to do it quickly. I know
                        how difficult this family business is, but you can arrange it. Come with me
                        down to New York. We&apos;ll work out something later. I&apos;ll
                        meet your family. We&apos;ll pretend a courtship, anything you likeonly
                        come now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t mean right away, do you?&quot; she asked,
                        startled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, to-morrow if possible. Monday sure. You can arrange it. Why,
                        if Mrs. Bracebridge asked you you&apos;d go fast enough, and no one
                        would think anything about it. Isn&apos;t that so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted slowly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, why not now?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-173" n="[166]"/>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s always so much harder to work out a
                        falsehood,&quot; she replied thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know it, but you can come. Won&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you wait a little while?&quot; she pleaded.
                        &quot;It&apos;s so very sudden. I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a day, sweet, that I can help. Can&apos;t you see how I
                        feel? Look in my eyes. Will you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied sorrowfully, and yet with a strange
                        thrill of affection. &quot;I will.&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXIII</head>
                    <p>THE business of arranging for this sudden departure was really not so
                        difficult as it first appeared. Jennie proposed to tell her mother the whole
                        truth, and there was nothing to say to her father except that she was going
                        with Mrs. Bracebridge at the latter&apos;s request. He might question
                        her, but he really could not doubt. Before going home that afternoon she
                        accompanied Lester to a department store, where she was fitted out with a
                        trunk, a suit-case, and a traveling suit and hat. Lester was very proud of
                        his prize. &quot;When we get to New York I am going to get you some real
                        things,&quot; he told her. &quot;I am going to show you what you can
                        be made to look like.&quot; He had all the purchased articles packed in
                        the trunk and sent to his hotel. Then he arranged to have Jennie come there
                        and dress Monday for the trip which began in the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>When she came home Mrs. Gerhardt, who was in the kitchen, received her with
                        her usual affectionate greeting. &quot;Have you been working very
                        hard?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You look tired.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I&apos;m not tired. It
                        isn&apos;t that. I just don&apos;t feel good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the trouble?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I have to tell you something, mamma. It&apos;s so
                        hard.&quot; She paused, looking inquiringly at her mother, and then
                        away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, what is it?&quot; asked her mother nervously. So many
                        things had happened in the past that she was always on the alert for some
                        new calamity. &quot;You haven&apos;t lost your place, have
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-175" n="168"/>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Jennie, with an effort to maintain her mental
                        poise, &quot;but I&apos;m going to leave it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No!&quot; exclaimed her mother. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to New York.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her mother&apos;s eyes opened widely. &quot;Why, when did you decide
                        to do that?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t mean it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do, mamma. Listen. I&apos;ve got something I want to
                        tell you. You know how poor we are. There isn&apos;t any way we can make
                        things come out right. I have found some one who wants to help us. He says
                        he loves me, and he wants me to go to New York with him Monday.
                        I&apos;ve decided to go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Jennie!&quot; exclaimed her mother. &quot;Surely not!
                        You wouldn&apos;t do anything like that after all that&apos;s
                        happened. Think of your father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve thought it all out,&quot; went on Jennie, firmly.
                        &quot;It&apos;s really for the best. He&apos;s a good man. I
                        know he is. He has lots of money. He wants me to go with him, and
                        I&apos;d better go. He will take a new house for us when we come back
                        and help us to get along. No one will ever have me as a wifeyou know that.
                        It might as well be this way. He loves me. And I love him. Why
                        shouldn&apos;t I go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does he know about Vesta?&quot; asked her mother cautiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Jennie guiltily. &quot;I thought
                        I&apos;d better not tell him about her. She oughtn&apos;t to be
                        brought into it if I can help it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re storing up trouble for
                        yourself, Jennie,&quot; said her mother. &quot;Don&apos;t you
                        think he is sure to find it out some time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought maybe that she could be kept here,&quot; suggested
                        Jennie, &quot;until she&apos;s old enough to go to school. Then
                        maybe I could send her somewhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She might,&quot; assented her mother; &quot;but
                        don&apos;t you <pb id="VAA2406-176" n="169"/> think it would be better
                        to tell him now? He won&apos;t think any the worse of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t that. It&apos;s her,&quot; said Jennie
                        passionately. &quot;I don&apos;t want her to be brought into
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her mother shook her head. &quot;Where did you meet him?&quot; she
                        inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At Mrs. Bracebridge&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long ago?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it&apos;s been almost two months now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you never said anything about him,&quot; protested Mrs.
                        Gerhardt reproachfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know that he cared for me this way,&quot;
                        said Jennie defensively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you wait and let him come out here
                        first?&quot; asked her mother. &quot;It will make things so much
                        easier. You can&apos;t go and not have your father find out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I&apos;d say I was going with Mrs. Bracebridge. Papa
                        can&apos;t object to my going with her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; agreed her mother thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>The two looked at each other in silence. Mrs. Gerhardt, with her imaginative
                        nature, endeavored to formulate some picture of this new and wonderful
                        personality that had come into Jennie&apos;s life. He was wealthy; he
                        wanted to take Jennie; he wanted to give them a good home. What a story!</p>
                    <p>&quot;And he gave me this,&quot; put in Jennie, who, with some
                        instinctive psychic faculty, had been following her mother&apos;s mood.
                        She opened her dress at the neck, and took out the two hundred and fifty
                        dollars; she placed the money in her mother&apos;s hands.</p>
                    <p>The latter stared at it wide-eyed. Here was the relief for all her woesfood,
                        clothes, rent, coalall done up in one small package of green and yellow
                        bills. If there were plenty of money in the house Gerhardt need not worry
                        about his burned hands; George and Martha and Veronica could be clothed in
                        comfort and made happy. <pb id="VAA2406-177" n="170"/> Jennie could dress
                        better; there would be a future education for Vesta.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think he might ever want to marry you?&quot; asked her
                        mother finally.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; replied Jennie &quot;he might.
                        I know he loves me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said her mother after a long pause, &quot;if
                        you&apos;re going to tell your father you&apos;d better do it right
                        away. He&apos;ll think it&apos;s strange as it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie realized that she had won. Her mother had acquiesced from sheer force
                        of circumstances. She was sorry, but somehow it seemed to be for the best.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll help you out with it,&quot; her mother had
                        concluded, with a little sigh.</p>
                    <p>The difficulty of telling this lie was very great for Mrs. Gerhardt, but she
                        went through the falsehood with a seeming nonchalance which allayed
                        Gerhardt&apos;s suspicions. The children were also told, and when, after
                        the general discussion, Jennie repeated the falsehood to her father it
                        seemed natural enough.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long do you think you&apos;ll be gone?&quot; he
                        inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;About two or three weeks,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a nice trip,&quot; he said. &quot;I came
                        through New York in 1844. It was a small place then compared to what it is
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Secretly he was pleased that Jennie should have this fine chance. Her
                        employer must like her.</p>
                    <p>When Monday came Jennie bade her parents good-by and left early, going
                        straight to the Dornton, where Lester awaited her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you came,&quot; he said gaily, greeting her as she entered
                        the ladies&apos; parlor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said simply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are my niece,&quot; he went on. &quot;I have engaged a
                        room for you near mine. I&apos;ll call for the key, and you go dress.
                        When you&apos;re ready I&apos;ll have the trunk sent to the depot.
                        The train leaves at one o&apos;clock.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-178" n="171"/>
                    <p>She went to her room and dressed, while he fidgeted about, read, smoked, and
                        finally knocked at her door.</p>
                    <p>She replied by opening to him, fully clad.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You look charming,&quot; he said with a smile.</p>
                    <p>She looked down, for she was nervous and distraught. The whole process of
                        planning, lying, nerving herself to carry out her part had been hard on her.
                        She looked tired and worried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not grieving, are you?&quot; he asked, seeing how things stood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No-o,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come now, sweet. You mustn&apos;t feel this way. It&apos;s
                        coming out all right.&quot; He took her in his arms and kissed her, and
                        they strolled down the hall. He was astonished to see how well she looked in
                        even these simple clothesthe best she had ever had.</p>
                    <p>They reached the depot after a short carriage ride. The accommodations had
                        been arranged for before hand, and Kane had allowed just enough time to make
                        the train. When they settled themselves in a Pullman state-room it was with
                        a keen sense of satisfaction on his part. Life looked rosy. Jennie was
                        beside him. He had succeeded in what he had started out to do. So might it
                        always be.</p>
                    <p>As the train rolled out of the depot and the long reaches of the fields
                        succeeded Jennie studied them wistfully. There were the forests, leafless
                        and bare; the wide, brown fields, wet with the rains of winter; the low
                        farm-houses sitting amid flat stretches of prairie, their low roofs making
                        them look as if they were hugging the ground. The train roared past little
                        hamlets, with cottages of white and yellow and drab, their roofs blackened
                        by frost and rain. Jennie noted one in particular which seemed to recall the
                        old neighborhood where they used to live at Columbus; she put her
                        handkerchief to her eyes and began silently to cry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope you&apos;re not crying, are you, Jennie?&quot; said
                            <pb id="VAA2406-179" n="172"/> Lester, looking up suddenly from the
                        letter he had been reading. &quot;Come, come,&quot; he went on as he
                        saw a faint tremor shaking her. &quot;This won&apos;t do. You have
                        to do better than this. You&apos;ll never get along if you act that
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made no reply, and the depth of her silent grief filled him with strange
                        sympathies.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t cry,&quot; he continued soothingly;
                        &quot;everything will be all right. I told you that. You
                        needn&apos;t worry about anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie made a great effort to recover herself, and began to dry her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t want to give way like that,&quot; he
                        continued. &quot;It doesn&apos;t do you any good. I know how you
                        feel about leaving home, but tears won&apos;t help it any. It
                        isn&apos;t as if you were going away for good, you know. Besides,
                        you&apos;ll be going back shortly. You care for me, don&apos;t you,
                        sweet? I&apos;m something?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, and managed to smile back at him.</p>
                    <p>Lester returned to his correspondence and Jennie fell to thinking of Vesta.
                        It troubled her to realize that she was keeping this secret from one who was
                        already very dear to her. She knew that she ought to tell Lester about the
                        child, but she shrank from the painful necessity. Perhaps later on she might
                        find the courage to do it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll have to tell him something,&quot; she thought
                        with a sudden upwelling of feeling as regarded the seriousness of this duty.
                        &quot;If I don&apos;t do it soon and I should go and live with him
                        and he should find it out he would never forgive me. He might turn me out,
                        and then where would I go? I have no home now. What would I do with
                        Vesta?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned to contemplate him, a premonitory wave of terror sweeping over
                        her, but she only saw that imposing and comfort-loving soul quietly reading
                        his letters, his smoothly shaved red cheek and comfortable head and <pb
                            id="VAA2406-180" n="173"/> body looking anything but militant or like an
                        avenging Nemesis. She was just withdrawing her gaze when he looked up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, have you washed all your sins away?&quot; he inquired
                        merrily.</p>
                    <p>She smiled faintly at the allusion. The touch of fact in it made it slightly
                        piquant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I expect so,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>He turned to some other topic, while she looked out of the window, the
                        realization that one impulse to tell him had proved unavailing dwelling in
                        her mind. &quot;I&apos;ll have to do it shortly,&quot; she
                        thought, and consoled herself with the idea that she would surely find
                        courage before long.</p>
                    <p>Their arrival in New York the next day raised the important question in
                        Lester&apos;s mind as to where he should stop. New York was a very large
                        place, and he was not in much danger of encountering people who would know
                        him, but he thought it just as well not to take chances. Accordingly he had
                        the cabman drive them to one of the more exclusive apartment hotels, where
                        he engaged a suite of rooms; and they settled themselves for a stay of two
                        or three weeks.</p>
                    <p>This atmosphere into which Jennie was now plunged was so wonderful, so
                        illuminating, that she could scarcely believe this was the same world that
                        she had inhabited before. Kane was no lover of vulgar display. The
                        appointments with which he surrounded himself were always simple and
                        elegant. He knew at a glance what Jennie needed, and bought for her with
                        discrimination and care. And Jennie, a woman, took a keen pleasure in the
                        handsome gowns and pretty fripperies that he lavished upon her. Could this
                        be really Jennie Gerhardt, the washerwoman&apos;s daughter, she asked
                        herself, as she gazed in her mirror at the figure of a girl clad in blue
                        velvet, with yellow French lace at her throat and upon <pb id="VAA2406-181"
                            n="174"/> her arms? Could these be her feet, clad in soft shapely shoes
                        at ten dollars a pair, these her hands adorned with flashing jewels? What
                        wonderful good fortune she was enjoying! And Lester had promised that her
                        mother would share in it. Tears sprang to her eyes at the thought. The dear
                        mother, how she loved her!</p>
                    <p>It was Lester&apos;s pleasure in these days to see what he could do to
                        make her look like some one truly worthy of him. He exercised his most
                        careful judgment, and the result surprised even himself. People turned in
                        the halls, in the dining-rooms, and on the street to gaze at Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A stunning woman that man has with him,&quot; was a frequent
                        comment.</p>
                    <p>Despite her altered state Jennie did not lose her judgment of life or her
                        sense of perspective or proportion. She felt as though life were tentatively
                        loaning her something which would be taken away after a time. There was no
                        pretty vanity in her bosom. Lester realized this as he watched her.
                        &quot;You&apos;re a big woman, in your way,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll amount to something. Life hasn&apos;t given
                        you much of a deal up to now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He wondered how he could justify this new relationship to his family, should
                        they chance to hear about it. If he should decide to take a home in Chicago
                        or St. Louis (there was such a thought running in his mind) could he
                        maintain it secretly? Did he want to? He was half persuaded that he really,
                        truly loved her.</p>
                    <p>As the time drew near for their return he began to counsel her as to her
                        future course of action. &quot;You ought to find some way of introducing
                        me, as an acquaintance, to your father,&quot; he said. &quot;It will
                        ease matters up. I think I&apos;ll call. Then if you tell him
                        you&apos;re going to marry me he&apos;ll think nothing of
                        it.&quot; Jennie thought of Vesta, and trembled inwardly. But perhaps
                        her father could be induced to remain silent.</p>
                    <p>Lester had made the wise suggestion that she should <pb id="VAA2406-182"
                            n="[175]"/> retain the clothes she had worn in Cleveland in order that
                        she might wear them home when she reached there. &quot;There
                        won&apos;t be any trouble about this other stuff,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll have it cared for until we make some other
                        arrangement.&quot; It was all very simple and easy; he was a master
                        strategist.</p>
                    <p>Jennie had written her mother almost daily since she had been East. She had
                        inclosed little separate notes to be read by Mrs. Gerhardt only. In one she
                        explained Lester&apos;s desire to call, and urged her mother to prepare
                        the way by telling her father that she had met some one who liked her. She
                        spoke of the difficulty concerning Vesta, and her mother at once began to
                        plan a campaign to have Gerhardt hold his peace. There must be no hitch now.
                        Jennie must be given an opportunity to better herself. When she returned
                        there was great rejoicing. Of course she could not go back to her work, but
                        Mrs. Gerhardt explained that Mrs. Bracebridge had given Jennie a few
                        weeks&apos; vacation in order that she might look for something better,
                        something at which she could make more money.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXIV</head>
                    <p>THE problem of the Gerhardt family and its relationship to himself
                        comparatively settled, Kane betook himself to Cincinnati and to his business
                        duties. He was heartily interested in the immense plant, which occupied two
                        whole blocks in the outskirts of the city, and its conduct and development
                        was as much a problem and a pleasure to him as to either his father or his
                        brother. He liked to feel that he was a vital part of this great and growing
                        industry. When he saw freight cars going by on the railroads labelled
                        &quot;The Kane Manufacturing CompanyCincinnati&quot; or chanced to
                        notice displays of the company&apos;s products in the windows of
                        carriage sales companies in the different cities he was conscious of a warm
                        glow of satisfaction. It was something to be a factor in an institution so
                        stable, so distinguished, so honestly worth while. This was all very well,
                        but now Kane was entering upon a new phase of his personal existencein a
                        word, there was Jennie. He was conscious as he rode toward his home city
                        that he was entering on a relationship which might involve disagreeable
                        consequences. He was a little afraid of his father&apos;s attitude;
                        above all, there was his brother Robert.</p>
                    <p>Robert was cold and conventional in character; an excellent business man;
                        irreproachable in both his public and in his private life. Never
                        overstepping the strict boundaries of legal righteousness, he was neither
                        warm-hearted nor generousin fact, he would turn any trick which could be
                        speciously, or at best necessitously, recommended to his conscience. How he
                        reasoned <pb id="VAA2406-184" n="177"/> Lester did not knowhe could not
                        follow the ramifications of a logic which could combine hard business
                        tactics with moral rigidity, but somehow his brother managed to do it.
                        &quot;He&apos;s got a Scotch Presbyterian conscience mixed with an
                        Asiatic perception of the main chance.&quot; Lester once told somebody,
                        and he had the situation accurately measured. Nevertheless he could not rout
                        his brother from his positions nor defy him, for he had the public
                        conscience with him. He was in line with convention practically, and perhaps
                        sophisticatedly.</p>
                    <p>The two brothers were outwardly friendly; inwardly they were far apart.
                        Robert liked Lester well enough personally, but he did not trust his
                        financial judgment, and, temperamentally, they did not agree as to how life
                        and its affairs should be conducted. Lester had a secret contempt for his
                        brother&apos;s chill, persistent chase of the almighty dollar. Robert
                        was sure that Lester&apos;s easygoing ways were reprehensible, and bound
                        to create trouble sooner or later. In the business they did not quarrel
                        muchthere was not so much chance with the old gentleman still in chargebut
                        there were certain minor differences constantly cropping up which showed
                        which way the wind blew. Lester was for building up trade through friendly
                        relationship, concessions, personal contact, and favors. Robert was for
                        pulling everything tight, cutting down the cost of production, and offering
                        such financial inducements as would throttle competition.</p>
                    <p>The old manufacturer always did his best to pour oil on these troubled
                        waters, but he foresaw an eventual clash. One or the other would have to get
                        out or perhaps both.&quot; If only you two boys could agree!&quot;
                        he used to say.</p>
                    <p>Another thing which disturbed Lester was his father&apos;s attitude on
                        the subject of marriageLester&apos;s marriage, to be specific. Archibald
                        Kane never ceased to insist on the fact that Lester ought to get married,
                        and that he <pb id="VAA2406-185" n="178"/> was making a big mistake in
                        putting it off. All the other children, save Louise, were safely married.
                        Why not his favorite son? It was doing him injury morally, socially,
                        commercially, that he was sure of.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The world expects it of a man in your position,&quot; his
                        father had argued from time to time. &quot;It makes for social solidity
                        and prestige. You ought to pick out a good woman and raise a family. Where
                        will you be when you get to my time of life if you haven&apos;t any
                        children, any home?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if the right woman came along,&quot; said Lester,
                        &quot;I suppose I&apos;d marry her. But she hasn&apos;t come
                        along. What do you want me to do? Take anybody?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, not anybody, of course, but there are lots of good women. You
                        can surely find some one if you try. There&apos;s that Pace girl. What
                        about her? You used to like her. I wouldn&apos;t drift on this way,
                        Lester; it can&apos;t come to any good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His son would only smile. &quot;There, father, let it go now.
                        I&apos;ll come around some time, no doubt. I&apos;ve got to be
                        thirsty when I&apos;m led to water.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old gentleman gave over, time and again, but it was a sore point with
                        him. He wanted his son to settle down and be a real man of affairs.</p>
                    <p>The fact that such a situation as this might militate against any permanent
                        arrangement with Jennie was obvious even to Lester at this time. He thought
                        out his course of action carefully. Of course he would not give Jennie up,
                        whatever the possible consequences. But he must be cautious; he must take no
                        unnecessary risks. Could he bring her to Cincinnati? What a scandal if it
                        were ever found out! Could he install her in a nice home somewhere near the
                        city? The family would probably eventually suspect something. Could he take
                        her along on his numerous business journeys? This first one to New York had
                        been successful. Would it always be so? He turned the question over in his
                            <unclear>mind-</unclear>
                        <pb id="VAA2406-186" n="179"/> The very difficulty gave it zest. Perhaps St.
                        Louis, or Pittsburg, or Chicago would be best after all. He went to these
                        places frequently, and particularly to Chicago. He decided finally that it
                        should be Chicago if he could arrange it. He could always make excuses to
                        run up there, and it was only a night&apos;s ride. Yes, Chicago was
                        best. The very size and activity of the city made concealment easy. After
                        two weeks&apos; stay at Cincinnati Lester wrote Jennie that he was
                        coming to Cleveland soon, and she answered that she thought it would be all
                        right for him to call and see her. Her father had been told about him. She
                        had felt it unwise to stay about the house, and so had secured a position in
                        a store at four dollars a week. He smiled as he thought of her working, and
                        yet the decency and energy of it appealed to him. &quot;She&apos;s
                        all right,&quot; he said. &quot;She&apos;s the best
                        I&apos;ve come across yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He ran up to Cleveland the following Saturday, and, calling at her place of
                        business, he made an appointment to see her that evening. He was anxious
                        that his introduction, as her beau, should be gotten over with as quickly as
                        possible. When he did call the shabbiness of the house and the manifest
                        poverty of the family rather disgusted him, but somehow Jennie seemed as
                        sweet to him as ever. Gerhardt came in the front-room, after he had been
                        there a few minutes, and shook hands with him, as did also Mrs. Gerhardt,
                        but Lester paid little attention to them. The old German appeared to him to
                        be merely commonplacethe sort of man who was hired by hundreds in common
                        capacities in his father&apos;s factory. After some desultory
                        conversation Lester suggested to Jennie that they should go for a drive.
                        Jennie put on her hat, and together they departed. As a matter of fact, they
                        went to an apartment which he had hired for the storage of her clothes. When
                        she returned at eight in the evening the family considered it nothing
                    amiss.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXV</head>
                    <p>A MONTH later Jennie was able to announce that Lester intended to marry her.
                        His visits had of course paved the way for this, and it seemed natural
                        enough. Only Gerhardt seemed a little doubtful. He did not know just how
                        this might be. Perhaps it was all right. Lester seemed a fine enough man in
                        all conscience, and really, after Brander, why not? If a United States
                        Senator could fall in love with Jennie, why not a business man? There was
                        just one thingthe child. &quot;Has she told him about Vesta?&quot;
                        he asked his wife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Mrs. Gerhardt, &quot;not yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet, not yet. Always something underhanded. Do you think he
                        wants her if he knows? That&apos;s what comes of such conduct in the
                        first place. Now she has to slip around like a thief. The child cannot even
                        have an honest name.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt went back to his newspaper reading and brooding. His life seemed a
                        complete failure to him and he was only waiting to get well enough to hunt
                        up another job as watchman. He wanted to get out of this mess of deception
                        and dishonesty.</p>
                    <p>A week or two later Jennie confided to her mother that Lester had written her
                        to join him in Chicago. He was not feeling well, and could not come to
                        Cleveland. The two women explained to Gerhardt that Jennie was going away to
                        be married to Mr. Kane. Gerhardt flared up at this, and his suspicions were
                        again aroused. But he could do nothing but grumble over the situation; it
                        would lead to no good end, of that he was sure.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-188" n="181"/>
                    <p>When the day came for Jennie&apos;s departure she had to go without
                        saying farewell to her father. He was out looking for work until late in the
                        afternoon, and before he had returned she had been obliged to leave for the
                        station. &quot;I will write a note to him when I get there,&quot;
                        she said. She kissed her baby over and over. &quot;Lester will take a
                        better house for us soon,&quot; she went on hopefully. &quot;He
                        wants us to move.&quot; The night train bore her to Chicago; the old
                        life had ended and the new one had begun.</p>
                    <p>The curious fact should be recorded here that, although Lester&apos;s
                        generosity had relieved the stress upon the family finances, the children
                        and Gerhardt were actually none the wiser. It was easy for Mrs. Gerhardt to
                        deceive her husband as to the purchase of necessities and she had not as yet
                        indulged in any of the fancies which an enlarged purse permitted. Fear
                        deterred her. But, after Jennie had been in Chicago for a few days, she
                        wrote to her mother saying that Lester wanted them to take a new home. This
                        letter was shown to Gerhardt, who had been merely biding her return to make
                        a scene. He frowned, but somehow it seemed an evidence of regularity. If he
                        had not married her why should he want to help them? Perhaps Jennie was well
                        married after all. Perhaps she really had been lifted to a high station in
                        life, and was now able to help the family. Gerhardt almost concluded to
                        forgive her everything once and for all.</p>
                    <p>The end of it was that a new house was decided upon, and Jennie returned to
                        Cleveland to help her mother move. Together they searched the streets for a
                        nice, quiet neighborhood, and finally found one. A house of nine rooms, with
                        a yard, which rented for thirty dollars, was secured and suitably furnished.
                        There were comfortable fittings for the dining-room and sitting-room, a
                        handsome parlor set and bedroom sets complete for each room. The kitchen was
                        supplied with every convenience, <pb id="VAA2406-189" n="182"/> and there
                        was even a bath-room, a luxury the Gerhardts had never enjoyed before.
                        Altogether the house was attractive, though plain, and Jennie was happy to
                        know that her family could be comfortable in it.</p>
                    <p>When the time came for the actual moving Mrs. Gerhardt was fairly beside
                        herself with joy, for was not this the realization of her dreams? All
                        through the long years of her life she had been waiting, and now it had
                        come. A new house, new furniture, plenty of roomthings finer than she had
                        ever even imaginedthink of it! Her eyes shone as she looked at the new beds
                        and tables and bureaus and whatnots. &quot;Dear, dear, isn&apos;t
                        this nice!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Isn&apos;t it
                        beautiful!&quot; Jennie smiled and tried to pretend satisfaction without
                        emotion, but there were tears in her eyes. She was so glad for her
                        mother&apos;s sake. She could have kissed Lester&apos;s feet for his
                        goodness to her family.</p>
                    <p>The day the furniture was moved in Mrs. Gerhardt, Martha, and Veronica were
                        on hand to clean and arrange things. At the sight of the large rooms and
                        pretty yard, bare enough in winter, but giving promise of a delightful
                        greenness in spring, and the array of new furniture standing about in
                        excelsior, the whole family fell into a fever of delight. Such beauty, such
                        spaciousness! George rubbed his feet over the new carpets and Bass examined
                        the quality of the furniture critically. &quot;Swell,&quot; was his
                        comment. Mrs. Gerhardt roved to and fro like a person in a dream. She could
                        not believe that these bright bedrooms, this beautiful parlor, this handsome
                        dining-room were actually hers.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt came last of all. Although he tried hard not to show it, he, too,
                        could scarcely refrain from enthusiastic comment. The sight of an
                        opal-globed chandelier over the dining-room table was the finishing touch.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gas, yet!&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>He looked grimly around, under his shaggy eyebrows, <pb id="VAA2406-190"
                            n="[183]"/> at the new carpets under his feet, the long oak extension
                        table covered with a white cloth and set with new dishes, at the pictures on
                        the walls, the bright, clean kitchen. He shook his head. &quot;By chops,
                        it&apos;s fine!&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s very nice.
                        Yes, it&apos;s very nice. We want to be careful now not to break
                        anything. It&apos;s so easy to scratch things up, and then it&apos;s
                        all over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Yes, even Gerhardt was satisfied.</p>

                    <p>IT would be useless to chronicle the events of the three years that
                        followedevents and experiences by which the family grew from an abject
                        condition of want to a state of comparative self-reliance, based, of course,
                        on the obvious prosperity of Jennie and the generosity (through her) of her
                        distant husband. Lester was seen now and then, a significant figure,
                        visiting Cleveland, and sometimes coming out to the house where he occupied
                        with Jennie the two best rooms of the second floor. There were hurried trips
                        on her partin answer to telegraph massagesto Chicago, to St. Louis, to New
                        York. One of his favorite pastimes was to engage quarters at the great
                        resortsHot Springs, Mt. Clemens, Saratogaand for a period of a week or two
                        at a stretch enjoy the luxury of living with Jennie as his wife. There were
                        other times when he would pass through Cleveland only for the privilege of
                        seeing her for a day. All the time he was aware that he was throwing on her
                        the real burden of a rather difficult situation, but he did not see how he
                        could remedy it at this time. He was not sure as yet that he really wanted
                        to. They were getting along fairly well.</p>
                    <p>The attitude of the Gerhardt family toward this condition of affairs was
                        peculiar. At first, in spite of the irregularity of it, it seemed natural
                        enough. Jennie said she was married. No one had seen her marriage
                        certificate, but she said so, and she seemed to carry herself with the air
                        of one who holds that relationship. Still, she never went to Cincinnati,
                        where his family lived, and none <pb id="VAA2406-192" n="185"/> of his
                        relatives ever came near her. Then, too, his attitude, in spite of the money
                        which had first blinded them, was peculiar. He really did not carry himself
                        like a married man. He was so indifferent. There were weeks in which she
                        appeared to receive only perfunctory notes. There were times when she would
                        only go away for a few days to meet him. Then there were the long periods in
                        which she absented herselfthe only worth-while testimony toward a real
                        relationship, and that, in a way, unnatural.</p>
                    <p>Bass, who had grown to be a young man of twenty-five, with some business
                        judgment and a desire to get out in the world, was suspicious. He had come
                        to have a pretty keen knowledge of life, and intuitively he felt that things
                        were not right. George, nineteen, who had gained a slight foothold in a
                        wall-paper factory and was looking forward to a career in that field, was
                        also restless. He felt that something was wrong. Martha, seventeen, was
                        still in school, as were William and Veronica. Each was offered an
                        opportunity to study indefinitely; but there was unrest with life. They knew
                        about Jennie&apos;s child. The neighbors were obviously drawing
                        conclusions for themselves. They had few friends. Gerhardt himself finally
                        concluded that there was something wrong, but he had let himself into this
                        situation, and was not in much of a position now to raise an argument. He
                        wanted to ask her at timesproposed to make her do better if he couldbut the
                        worst had already been done. It depended on the man now, he knew that.</p>
                    <p>Things were gradually nearing a state where a general upheaval would have
                        taken place had not life stepped in with one of its fortuitous solutions.
                        Mrs. Gerhardt&apos;s health failed. Although stout and formerly of a
                        fairly active disposition, she had of late years become decidedly sedentary
                        in her habits and grown weak, which, coupled with a mind naturally given to
                        worry, and weighed upon as it had been by a number of serious and disturbing
                        ills, <pb id="VAA2406-193" n="186"/> seemed now to culminate in a slow but
                        very certain case of systemic poisoning. She became decidedly sluggish in
                        her motions, wearied more quickly at the few tasks left for her to do, and
                        finally complained to Jennie that it was very hard for her to climb stairs.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not feeling well,&quot; she said. &quot;I
                        think I&apos;m going to be sick.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie now took alarm and proposed to take her to some near-by
                        watering-place, but Mrs. Gerhardt wouldn&apos;t go. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t think it would do any good,&quot; she said. She sat about
                        or went driving with her daughter, but the fading autumn scenery depressed
                        her. &quot;I don&apos;t like to get sick in the fall,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;The leaves coming down make me think I am never going to get
                        well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, ma, how you talk!&quot; said Jennie; but she felt
                        frightened, nevertheless.</p>
                    <p>How much the average home depends upon the mother was seen when it was feared
                        the end was near. Bass, who had thought of getting married and getting out
                        of this atmosphere, abandoned the idea temporarily. Gerhardt, shocked and
                        greatly depressed, hung about like one expectant of and greatly awed by the
                        possibility of disaster. Jennie, too inexperienced in death to feel that she
                        could possibly lose her mother, felt as if somehow her living depended on
                        her. Hoping in spite of all opposing circumstances, she hung about, a white
                        figure of patience, waiting and serving.</p>
                    <p>The end came one morning after a month of illness and several days of
                        unconsciousness, during which silence reigned in the house and all the
                        family went about on tiptoe. Mrs. Gerhardt passed away with her dying gaze
                        fastened on Jennie&apos;s face for the last few minutes of consciousness
                        that life vouchsafed her. Jennie stared into her eyes with a yearning
                        horror. &quot;Oh, mamma! mamma!&quot; she cried. &quot;Oh no,
                        no!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt came running in from the yard, and, throwing <pb id="VAA2406-194"
                            n="187"/> himself down by the bedside, wrung his bony hands in anguish.
                        &quot;I should have gone first!&quot; he cried. &quot;I should
                        have gone first!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The death of Mrs. Gerhardt hastened the final breaking up of the family. Bass
                        was bent on getting married at once, having had a girl in town for some
                        time. Martha, whose views of life had broadened and hardened, was anxious to
                        get out also. She felt that a sort of stigma attached to the hometo herself,
                        in fact, so long as she remained there. Martha looked to the public schools
                        as a source of income; she was going to be a teacher. Gerhardt alone
                        scarcely knew which way to turn. He was again at work as a night watchman.
                        Jennie found him crying one day alone in the kitchen, and immediately burst
                        into tears herself. &quot;Now, papa!&quot; she pleaded, &quot;it
                        isn&apos;t as bad as that. You will always have a homeyou know thatas
                        long as I have anything. You can come with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; he protested. He really did not want to go with
                        her. &quot;It isn&apos;t that,&quot; he continued. &quot;My
                        whole life comes to nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was some little time before Bass, George and Martha finally left, but, one
                        by one, they got out, leaving Jennie, her father, Veronica, and William, and
                        one otherJennie&apos;s child. Of course Lester knew nothing of
                        Vesta&apos;s parentage, and curiously enough he had never seen the
                        little girl. During the short periods in which he deigned to visit the
                        housetwo or three days at mostMrs. Gerhardt took good care that Vesta was
                        kept in the background. There was a play-room on the top floor, and also a
                        bedroom there, and concealment was easy. Lester rarely left his rooms, he
                        even had his meals served to him in what might have been called the
                        living-room of the suite. He was not at all inquisitive or anxious to meet
                        any one of the other members of the family. He was perfectly willing to
                        shake hands with them or to exchange a few perfunctory words, but
                        perfunctory <pb id="VAA2406-195" n="188"/> words only. It was generally
                        understood that the child must not appear, and so it did not.</p>
                    <p>There is an inexplicable sympathy between old age and childhood, an affinity
                        which is as lovely as it is pathetic. During that first year in Lorrie
                        Street, when no one was looking, Gerhardt often carried Vesta about on his
                        shoulders and pinched her soft, red cheeks. When she got old enough to walk
                        he it was who, with a towel fastened securely under her arms, led her
                        patiently around the room until she was able to take a few steps of her own
                        accord. When she actually reached the point where she could walk he was the
                        one who coaxed her to the effort, shyly, grimly, but always lovingly. By
                        some strange leading of fate this stigma on his family&apos;s honor,
                        this blotch on conventional morality, had twined its helpless baby fingers
                        about the tendons of his heart. He loved this little outcast ardently,
                        hopefully. She was the one bright ray in a narrow, gloomy life, and Gerhardt
                        early took upon himself the responsibility of her education in religious
                        matters. Was it not he who had insisted that the infant should be baptized?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say &apos;Our Father,&apos;&quot; he used to demand of
                        the lisping infant when he had her alone with him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ow Fowvaw,&quot; was her vowel-like interpretation of his
                        words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Who art in heaven.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;&apos;Ooh ah in aven,&apos;&quot; repeated the child.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you teach her so early?&quot; pleaded Mrs. Gerhardt,
                        overhearing the little one&apos;s struggles with stubborn consonants and
                        vowels.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I want she should learn the Christian faith,&quot;
                        returned Gerhardt determinedly. &quot;She ought to know her prayers. If
                        she don&apos;t begin now she never will know them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt smiled. Many of her husband&apos;s religious idiosyncrasies
                        were amusing to her. At the same <pb id="VAA2406-196" n="189"/> time she
                        liked to see this sympathetic interest he was taking in the child&apos;s
                        upbringing. If he were only not so hard, so narrow at times. He made himself
                        a torment to himself and to every one else.</p>
                    <p>On the earliest bright morning of returning spring he was wont to take her
                        for her first little journeys in the world. &quot;Come, now,&quot;
                        he would say, &quot;we will go for a little walk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Walk,&quot; chirped Vesta.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, walk,&quot; echoed Gerhardt.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerhardt would fasten on one of her little hoods, for in these days
                        Jennie kept Vesta&apos;s wardrobe beautifully replete. Taking her by the
                        hand, Gerhardt would issue forth, satisfied to drag first one foot and then
                        the other in order to accommodate his gait to her toddling steps.</p>
                    <p>One beautiful May day, when Vesta was four years old, they started on one of
                        their walks. Everywhere nature was budding and bourgeoning; the birds
                        twittering their arrival from the south; the insects making the best of
                        their brief span of life. Sparrows chirped in the road; robins strutted upon
                        the grass; bluebirds built in the eaves of the cottages. Gerhardt took a
                        keen delight in pointing out the wonders of nature to Vesta, and she was
                        quick to respond. Every new sight and sound interested her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ooh!ooh!&quot; exclaimed Vesta, catching sight of a low,
                        flashing touch of red as a robin lighted upon a twig nearby. Her hand was
                        up, and her eyes were wide open.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Gerhardt, as happy as if he himself had but
                        newly discovered this marvelous creature. &quot;Robin. Bird. Robin. Say
                        robin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wobin,&quot; said Vesta.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, robin,&quot; he answered. &quot;It is going to look
                        for a worm now. We will see if we cannot find its nest. I think I saw a nest
                        in one of these trees.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He plodded peacefully on, seeking to rediscover an <pb id="VAA2406-197"
                            n="[190]"/> old abandoned nest that he had observed on a former walk.
                        &quot;Here it is,&quot; he said at last, coming to a small and
                        leafless tree, in which a winter-beaten remnant of a home was still
                        clinging. &quot;Here, come now, see,&quot; and he lifted the baby up
                        at arm&apos;s length.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See,&quot; said Gerhardt, indicating the wisp of dead grasses
                        with his free hand, &quot;nest. That is a bird&apos;s nest.
                        See!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ooh!&quot; repeated Vesta, imitating his pointing finger with
                        one of her own. &quot;Nessooh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Gerhardt, putting her down again.
                        &quot;That was a <hi rend="i">wren&apos;s</hi> nest. They have all
                        gone now. They will not come any more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still further they plodded, he unfolding the simple facts of life, she
                        wondering with the wide wonder of a child. When they had gone a block or two
                        he turned slowly about as if the end of the world had been reached.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We must be going back!&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>And so she had come to her fifth year, growing in sweetness, intelligence,
                        and vivacity. Gerhardt was fascinated by the questions she asked, the
                        puzzles she pronounced. &quot;Such a girl!&quot; he would exclaim to
                        his wife. &quot;What is it she doesn&apos;t want to know?
                        &apos;Where is God? What does He do? Where does He keep His
                        feet?&apos; she asks me. &quot;I gotta laugh sometimes.&quot;
                        From rising in the morning, to dress her to laying her down at night after
                        she had said her prayers, she came to be the chief solace and comfort of his
                        days. Without Vesta, Gerhardt would have found his life hard indeed to
                    bear.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXVII</head>
                    <p>FOR three years now Lester had been happy in the companionship of Jennie.
                        Irregular as the connection might be in the eyes of the church and of
                        society, it had brought him peace and comfort, and he was perfectly
                        satisfied with the outcome of the experiment. His interest in the social
                        affairs of Cincinnati was now practically <hi rend="i">nil</hi>, and he had
                        consistently refused to consider any matrimonial proposition which had
                        himself as the object. He looked on his father&apos;s business
                        organization as offering a real chance for himself if he could get control
                        of it; but he saw no way of doing so. Robert&apos;s interests were
                        always in the way, and, if anything, the two brothers were farther apart
                        than ever in their ideas and aims. Lester had thought once or twice of
                        entering some other line of business or of allying himself with another
                        carriage company, but he did not feel that he could conscientiously do this.
                        Lester had his salaryfifteen thousand a year as secretary and treasurer of
                        the company (his brother was vice-president)and about five thousand from
                        some outside investments. He had not been so lucky or so shrewd in
                        speculation as Robert had been; aside from the principal which yielded his
                        five thousand, he had nothing. Robert, on the other hand, was unquestionably
                        worth between three and four hundred thousand dollars, in addition to his
                        future interest in the business, which both brothers shrewdly suspected
                        would be divided somewhat in their favor. Robert and Lester would get a
                        fourth each, they thought; their sisters a sixth. It seemed natural that
                        Kane senior <pb id="VAA2406-199" n="192"/> should take this view, seeing
                        that the brothers were actually in control and doing the work. Still, there
                        was no certainty. The old gentleman might do anything or nothing. The
                        probabilities were that he would be very fair and liberal. At the same time,
                        Robert was obviously beating Lester in the game of life. What did Lester
                        intend to do about it?</p>
                    <p>There comes a time in every thinking man&apos;s life when he pauses and
                        &quot;takes stock&quot; of his condition; when he asks himself how
                        it fares with his individuality as a whole, mental, moral, physical,
                        material. This time comes after the first heedless flights of youth have
                        passed, when the initiative and more powerful efforts have been made, and he
                        begins to feel the uncertainty of results and final values which attaches
                        itself to everything. There is a deadening thought of uselessness which
                        creeps into many men&apos;s mindsthe thought which has been best
                        expressed by the Preacher in Ecclesiastes.</p>
                    <p>Yet Lester strove to be philosophical. &quot;What difference does it
                        make?&quot; he used to say to himself, &quot;whether I live at the
                        White House, or here at home, or at the Grand Pacific?&quot; But in the
                        very question was the implication that there were achievements in life which
                        he had failed to realize in his own career. The White House represented the
                        rise and success of a great public character. His home and the Grand Pacific
                        were what had come to him without effort.</p>
                    <p>He decided for the time beingit was about the period of the death of
                        Jennie&apos;s motherthat he would make some effort to rehabilitate
                        himself. He would cut out idlingthese numerous trips with Jennie had cost
                        him considerable time. He would make some outside investments. If his
                        brother could find avenues of financial profit, so could he. He would
                        endeavor to assert his authorityhe would try to make himself of more
                        importance in the business, rather than let Robert gradually absorb
                        everything. Should he forsake Jennie? <pb id="VAA2406-200" n="193"/> that
                        thought also came to him. She had no claim on him. She could make no
                        protest. Somehow he did not see how it could be done. It seemed cruel,
                        useless; above all (though he disliked to admit it) it would be
                        uncomfortable for himself. He liked herloved her, perhaps, in a selfish way.
                        He didn&apos;t see how he could desert her very well.</p>
                    <p>Just at this time he had a really serious difference with Robert. His brother
                        wanted to sever relations with an old and well established paint company in
                        New York, which had manufactured paints especially for the house, and invest
                        in a new concern in Chicago, which was growing and had a promising future.
                        Lester, knowing the members of the Eastern firm, their reliability, their
                        long and friendly relations with the house, was in opposition. His father at
                        first seemed to agree with Lester. But Robert argued out the question in his
                        cold, logical way, his blue eyes fixed uncompromisingly upon his
                        brother&apos;s face. &quot;We can&apos;t go on
                        forever,&quot; he said, &quot;standing by old friends, just because
                        father here has dealt with them, or you like them. We must have a change.
                        The business must be stiffened up; we&apos;re going to have more and
                        stronger competition.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s just as father feels about it,&quot; said Lester
                        at last. &quot;I have no deep feeling in the matter. It won&apos;t
                        hurt me one way of the other. You say the house is going to profit
                        eventually. I&apos;ve stated the arguments on the other side.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m inclined to think Robert is right,&quot; said
                        Archibald Kane calmly. &quot;Most of the things he has suggested so far
                        have worked out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester colored. &quot;Well, we won&apos;t have any more discussion
                        about it then,&quot; he said. He rose and strolled out of the office.</p>
                    <p>The shock of this defeat, coming at a time when he was considering pulling
                        himself together, depressed Lester considerably. It wasn&apos;t much but
                        it was a straw, and <pb id="VAA2406-201" n="194"/> his father&apos;s
                        remark about his brother&apos;s business acumen was even more
                        irritating. He was beginning to wonder whether his father would discriminate
                        in any way in the distribution of the property. Had he heard anything about
                        his entanglement with Jennie? Had he resented the long vacations he had
                        taken from business? It did not appear to Lester that he could be justly
                        chargeable with either incapacity or indifference, so far as the company was
                        concerned. He had done his work well. He was still the investigator of
                        propositions put up to the house, the student of contracts, the trusted
                        adviser of his father and motherbut he was being worsted. Where would it
                        end? He thought about this, but could reach no conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Later in this same year Robert came forward with a plan for reorganization in
                        the executive department of the business. He proposed that they should build
                        an immense exhibition and storage warehouse on Michigan Avenue in Chicago,
                        and transfer a portion of their completed stock there. Chicago was more
                        central than Cincinnati. Buyers from the West and country merchants could be
                        more easily reached and dealt with there. It would be a big advertisement
                        for the house, a magnificent evidence of its standing and prosperity.
                            <unclear>K--</unclear> senior and Lester immediately approved of this.
                        Both saw its advantages. Robert suggested that Lester should undertake the
                        construction of the new buildings. It would probably be advisable for him to
                        reside in Chicago a part of the time.</p>
                    <p>The idea appealed to Lester, even though it took him away from Cincinnati,
                        largely if not entirely. It was dignified and not unrepresentative of his
                        standing in the company. He could live in Chicago and he could have Jennie
                        with him. The scheme he had for taking an apartment could now be arranged
                        without difficulty. He voted yes. Robert smiled. &quot;I&apos;m sure
                        we&apos;ll get good results from this all around.&quot; he said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-202" n="195"/>
                    <p>As construction work was soon to begin, Lester decided to move to Chicago
                        immediately. He sent word for Jennie to meet him, and together they selected
                        an apartment on the <unclear>Nortl-</unclear> Side, a very comfortable suite
                        of rooms on a side street near the lake, and he had it fitted up to suit his
                        taste. He figured that living in Chicago he could pose as a bachelor. He
                        would never need to invite his friends to his rooms. There were his offices,
                        where he could always be found, his clubs and the hotels. To his way of
                        thinking the arrangement was practically ideal.</p>
                    <p>Of course Jennie&apos;s departure from Cleveland brought the affairs of
                        the Gerhardt family to a climax. Probably the home would be broken up, but
                        Gerhardt himself took the matter philosophically. He was an old man, and it
                        did not matter much where he lived. Bass, Martha, and George were already
                        taking care of themselves. Veronica and William were still in school, but
                        some provision could be made for boarding them with a neighbor. The one real
                        concern of Jennie and Gerhardt was Vesta. It was Gerhardt&apos;s natural
                        thought that Jennie must take the child with her. What else should a mother
                        do?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you told him yet?&quot; he asked her, when the day of her
                        contemplated departure had been set.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; but I&apos;m going to soon,&quot; she assured him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Always soon,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>He shook his head. His throat swelled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s too bad,&quot; he went on.
                        &quot;It&apos;s a great sin. God will punish you, I&apos;m
                        afraid. The child needs some one. I&apos;m getting oldotherwise I would
                        keep her. There is no one here all day now to look after her right, as she
                        should be.&quot; Again he shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Jennie weakly. &quot;I&apos;m going
                        to fix it now. I&apos;m going to have her live with me soon. I
                        won&apos;t neglect heryou know that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the child&apos;s name,&quot; he insisted. &quot;She
                        should have a name. Soon in another year she goes to school. <pb
                            id="VAA2406-203" n="196"/> People will want to know who she is. It
                        can&apos;t go on forever like this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie understood well enough that it couldn&apos;t. She was crazy about
                        her baby. The heaviest cross she had to bear was the constant separations
                        and the silence she was obliged to maintain about Vesta&apos;s very
                        existence. It did seem unfair to the child, and yet Jennie did not see
                        clearly how she could have acted otherwise. Vesta had good clothes,
                        everything she needed. She was at least comfortable. Jennie hoped to give
                        her a good education. If only she had told the truth to Lester in the first
                        place. Now it was almost too late, and yet she felt that she had acted for
                        the best. Finally she decided to find some good woman or family in Chicago
                        who would take charge of Vesta for a consideration. In a Swedish colony to
                        the west of La Salle Avenue she came across an old lady who seemed to embody
                        all the virtues she requiredcleanliness, simplicity, honesty. She was a
                        widow, doing work by the day, but she was glad to make an arrangement by
                        which she should give her whole time to Vesta. The latter was to go to
                        kindergarten when a suitable one should be found. She was to have toys and
                        kindly attention, and Mrs. Olsen was to inform Jennie of any change in the
                        child&apos;s health. Jennie proposed to call every day, and she thought
                        that sometimes, when Lester was out of town, Vesta might be brought to the
                        apartment. She had had her with her at Cleveland, and he had never found out
                        anything.</p>
                    <p>The arrangements completed, Jennie returned at the first opportunity to
                        Cleveland to take Vesta away. Gerhardt, who had been brooding over his
                        approaching loss, appeared most solicitous about her future. &quot;She
                        should grow up to be a fine girl,&quot; he said. &quot;You should
                        give her a good educationshe is so smart.&quot; He spoke of the
                        advisability of sending her to a Lutheran school and church, but Jennie was
                        not so sure of that. Time and association with Lester had led her to think
                        that <pb id="VAA2406-204" n="[197]"/> perhaps the public school was better
                        than any private institution. She had no particular objection to the church,
                        but she no longer depended upon its teachings as a guide in the affairs of
                        life. Why should she?</p>
                    <p>The next day it was necessary for Jennie to return to Chicago. Vesta, excited
                        and eager, was made ready for the journey. Gerhardt had been wandering
                        about, restless as a lost spirit, while the process of dressing was going
                        on; now that the hour had actually struck he was doing his best to control
                        his feelings. He could see that the five-year-old child had no conception of
                        what it meant to him. She was happy and self-interested, chattering about
                        the ride and the train.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be a good little girl,&quot; he said, lifting her up and
                        kissing her. &quot;See that you study your catechism and say your
                        prayers. And you won&apos;t forget the grandpawhat?&quot; He tried
                        to go on, but his voice failed him.</p>
                    <p>Jennie, whose heart ached for her father, choked back her emotion.
                        &quot;There,&quot; she said, &quot;if I&apos;d thought you
                        were going to act like that&quot; she Stopped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go,&quot; said Gerhardt, manfully, &quot;go. It is best
                        this way.&quot; And he stood solemnly by as they went out of the door.
                        Then he turned back to his favorite haunt, the kitchen, and stood there
                        staring at the floor. One by one they were leaving himMrs. Gerhardt, Bass,
                        Martha, Jennie, Vesta. He clasped his hands together, after his old-time
                        fashion, and shook his head again and again. &quot;So it is! So it
                        is!&quot; he repeated. &quot;They all leave me. All my life goes to
                        pieces.&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXVIII</head>
                    <p>DURING the three years in which Jennie and Lester had been associated there
                        had grown up between them a strong feeling of mutual sympathy and
                        understanding. Lester truly loved her in his own way. It was a strong,
                        self-satisfying, determined kind of way, based solidly on a big natural
                        foundation, but rising to a plane of genuine spiritual affinity. The
                        yielding sweetness of her character both attracted and held him. She was
                        true, and good, and womanly to the very center of her being; he had learned
                        to trust her, to depend upon her, and the feeling had but deepened with the
                        passing of the years.</p>
                    <p>On her part Jennie had sincerely, deeply, truly learned to love this man. At
                        first when he had swept her off her feet, overawed her soul, and used her
                        necessity as a chain wherewith to bind her to him, she was a little
                        doubtful, a little afraid of him, although she had always liked him. Now,
                        however, by living with him, by knowing him better, by watching his moods,
                        she had come to love him. He was so big, so vocal, so handsome. His point of
                        view and opinions of anything and everything were so positive. His pet
                        motto, &quot;Hew to the line, let the chips fall where they
                        may,&quot; had clung in her brain as something immensely characteristic.
                        Apparently he was not afraid of anythingGod, man, or devil. He used to look
                        at her, holding her chin between the thumb and fingers of his big brown
                        hand, and say: You&apos;re sweet, all right, but you need courage and
                        defiance. You haven&apos;t enough of those things.&quot; And <pb
                            id="VAA2406-206" n="199"/> her eyes would meet his in dumb appeal.
                        &quot;Never mind,&quot; he would add, &quot;you have other
                        things.&quot; And then he would kiss her.</p>
                    <p>One of the most appealing things to Lester was the simple way in which she
                        tried to avoid exposure of her various social and educational shortcomings.
                        She could not write very well, and once he found a list of words he had used
                        written out on a piece of paper with the meanings opposite. He smiled, but
                        he liked her better for it. Another time in the Southern hotel in St. Louis
                        he watched her pretending a loss of appetite because she thought that her
                        lack of table manners was being observed by nearby diners. She could not
                        always be sure of the right forks and knives, and the strange-looking dishes
                        bothered her; how did one eat asparagus and artichokes?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you eat something?&quot; he asked
                        good-naturedly. &quot;You&apos;re hungry, aren&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not very.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must be. Listen, Jennie. I know what it is. You
                        mustn&apos;t feel that way. Your manners are all right. I
                        wouldn&apos;t bring you here if they weren&apos;t. Your instincts
                        are all right. Don&apos;t be uneasy. I&apos;d tell you quick enough
                        when there was anything wrong.&quot; His brown eyes held a friendly
                        gleam.</p>
                    <p>She smiled gratefully. &quot;I do feel a little nervous at
                        times,&quot; she admitted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t,&quot; he repeated. &quot;You&apos;re
                        all right. Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll show you.&quot; And he
                        did.</p>
                    <p>By degrees Jennie grew into an understanding of the usages and customs of
                        comfortable existence. All that the Gerhardt family had ever had were the
                        bare necessities of life. Now she was surrounded with whatever she
                        wantedtrunks, clothes, toilet articles, the whole varied equipment of
                        comfortand while she liked it all, it did not upset her sense of proportion
                        and her sense of the fitness of things. There was no element of vanity in
                            <pb id="VAA2406-207" n="200"/> her, only a sense of joy in privilege and
                        opportunity. She was grateful to Lester for all that he had done and was
                        doing for her. If only she could hold himalways!</p>
                    <p>The details of getting Vesta established once adjusted, Jennie settled down
                        into the routine of home life. Lester, busy about his multitudinous affairs,
                        was in and out. He had a suite of rooms reserved for himself at the Grand
                        Pacific, which was then the exclusive hotel of Chicago, and this was his
                        ostensible residence. His luncheon and evening appointments were kept at the
                        Union Club. An early patron of the telephone, he had one installed in the
                        apartment, so that he could reach Jennie quickly and at any time. He was
                        home two or three nights a week, sometimes oftener. He insisted at first on
                        Jennie having a girl of general house-work, but acquiesced in the more
                        sensible arrangement which she suggested later of letting some one come in
                        to do the cleaning. She liked to work around her own home. Her natural
                        industry and love of order prompted this feeling.</p>
                    <p>Lester liked his breakfast promptly at eight in the morning. He wanted dinner
                        served nicely at seven. Silverware, cut glass, imported chinaall the little
                        luxuries of life appealed to him. He kept his trunks and wardrobe at the
                        apartment.</p>
                    <p>During the first few months everything went smoothly. He was in the habit of
                        taking Jennie to the theater now and then, and if he chanced to run arcoss
                        an acquaintance he always introduced her as Miss Gerhardt. When he
                        registered her as his wife it was usually under an assumed name; where there
                        was no danger of detection he did not mind using his own signature. Thus far
                        there had been no difficulty or unpleasantness of any kind.</p>
                    <p>The trouble with this situation was that it was criss-crossed with the danger
                        and consequent worry which the deception in regard to Vesta had entailed, as
                        well as with Jennie&apos;s natural anxiety about her father and the <pb
                            id="VAA2406-208" n="201"/> disorganized home. Jennie feared, as Veronica
                        hinted, that she and William would go to live with Martha, who was installed
                        in a boarding-house in Cleveland, and that Gerhardt would be left alone. He
                        was such a pathetic figure to her, with his injured hands and his one
                        abilitythat of being a watchmanthat she was hurt to think of his being left
                        alone. Would he come to her? She knew that he would notfeeling as he did at
                        present. Would Lester have himshe was not sure of that. If he came Vesta
                        would have to be accounted for. So she worried.</p>
                    <p>The situation in regard to Vesta was really complicated. Owing to the feeling
                        that she was doing her daughter a great injustice, Jennie was particularly
                        sensitive in regard to her, anxious to do a thousand things to make up for
                        the one great duty that she could not perform. She daily paid a visit to the
                        home of Mrs. Olsen, always taking with her toys, candy, or whatever came
                        into her mind as being likely to interest and please the child. She liked to
                        sit with Vesta and tell her stories of fairy and giant, which kept the
                        little girl wide-eyed. At last she went so far as to bring her to the
                        apartment, when Lester was away visiting his parents, and she soon found it
                        possible, during his several absences, to do this regularly. After that, as
                        time went on and she began to know his habits, she became more boldalthough
                        bold is scarcely the word to use in connection with Jennie. She became
                        venturesome much as a mouse might; she would risk Vesta&apos;s presence
                        on the assurance of even short absencestwo or three days. She even got into
                        the habit of keeping a few of Vesta&apos;s toys at the apartment, so
                        that she could have something to play with when she came.</p>
                    <p>During these several visits from her child Jennie could not but realize the
                        lovely thing life would be were she only an honored wife and a happy mother.
                        Vesta was a most observant little girl. She could by her innocent <pb
                            id="VAA2406-209" n="202"/> childish questions give a hundred turns to
                        the dagger of self-reproach which was already planted deeply in
                        Jennie&apos;s heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can I come to live with you?&quot; was one of her simplest and
                        most frequently repeated questions. Jennie would reply that mamma could not
                        have her just yet, but that very soon now, just as soon as she possibly
                        could, Vesta should come to stay always.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you know just when?&quot; Vesta would ask.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, dearest, not just when. Very soon now. You won&apos;t mind
                        waiting a little while. Don&apos;t you like Mrs. Olsen?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Vesta; &quot;but then she ain&apos;t
                        got any nice things now. She&apos;s just got old things.&quot; And
                        Jennie, stricken to the heart, would take Vesta to the toy shop. and load
                        her down with a new assortment of playthings.</p>
                    <p>Of course Lester was not in the least suspicious. His observation of things
                        relating to the home were rather casual. He went about his work and his
                        pleasures believing Jennie to be the soul of sincerity and good-natured
                        service, and it never occurred to him that there was anything underhanded in
                        her actions. Once he did come home sick in the afternoon and found her
                        absentan absence which endured from two o&apos;clock to five. He was a
                        little irritated and grumbled on her return, but his annoyance was as
                        nothing to her astonishment and fright when she found him there. She
                        blanched at the thought of his suspecting something, and explained as best
                        she could. She had gone to see her washerwoman. She was slow about her
                        marketing. She didn&apos;t dream he was there. She was sorry, too, that
                        her absence had lost her an opportunity to serve him. It showed her what a
                        mess she was likely to make of it all.</p>
                    <p>It happened that about three weeks after the above occurrence Lester had
                        occasion to return to Cincinnati for a week, and during this time Jennie
                        again brought <pb id="VAA2406-210" n="203"/> Vesta to the flat; for four
                        days there was the happiest goings on between the mother and child.</p>
                    <p>Nothing would have come of this little reunion had it not been for an
                        oversight on Jennie&apos;s part, the far-reaching effects of which she
                        could only afterward regret. This was the leaving of a little toy lamb under
                        the large leather divan in the front room, where Lester was wont to lie and
                        smoke. A little bell held by a thread of blue ribbon was fastened about its
                        neck, and this tinkled feebly whenever it was shaken. Vesta, with the
                        unaccountable freakishness of children had deliberately dropped it behind
                        the divan, an action which Jennie did not notice at the time. When she
                        gathered up the various playthings after Vesta&apos;s departure she
                        overlooked it entirely, and there it rested, its innocent eyes still staring
                        upon the sunlit regions of toyland, when Lester returned.</p>
                    <p>That same evening, when he was lying on the divan, quietly enjoying his cigar
                        and his newspaper, he chanced to drop the former, fully lighted. Wishing to
                        recover it before it should do any damage, he leaned over and looked under
                        the divan. The cigar was not in sight, so he rose and pulled the lounge out,
                        a move which revealed to him the little lamb still standing where Vesta had
                        dropped it. He picked it up, turning it over and over, and wondering how it
                        had come there.</p>
                    <p>A lamb! It must belong to some neighbor&apos;s child in whom Jennie had
                        taken an interest, he thought. He would have to go and tease her about this.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly he held the toy jovially before him, and, coming out into the
                        dining-room, where Jennie was working at the sideboard, he exclaimed in a
                        mock solemn voice, &quot;Where did this come from?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie, who was totally unconscious of the existence of this evidence of her
                        duplicity, turned, and was instantly possessed with the idea that he had
                        suspected all and was about to visit his just wrath upon her. Instantly the
                        blood flamed in her cheeks and as quickly left them.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-211" n="204"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why, why!&quot; she stuttered, &quot;it&apos;s a little
                        toy I bought.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see it is,&quot; he returned genially, her guilty tremor not
                        escaping his observation, but having at the same time no explicable
                        significance to him. &quot;It&apos;s frisking around a mighty lone
                        sheepfold.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He touched the little bell at its throat, while Jennie stood there, unable to
                        speak. It tinkled feebly, and then he looked at her again. His manner was so
                        humorous that she could tell he suspected nothing. However, it was almost
                        impossible for her to recover her self possession.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s ailing you?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You look as though a lamb was a terrible shock to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I forgot to take it out from there, that was all,&quot; she
                        went on blindly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It looks as though it has been played with enough,&quot; he
                        added more seriously, and then seeing that the discussion was evidently
                        painful to her, he dropped it. The lamb had not furnished him the amusement
                        that he had expected.</p>
                    <p>Lester went back into the front room, stretched himself out and thought it
                        over. Why was she nervous? What was there about a toy to make her grow pale?
                        Surely there was no harm in her harboring some youngster of the neighborhood
                        when she was alonehaving it come in and play. Why should she be so nervous?
                        He thought it over, but could come to no conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Nothing more was said about the incident of the toy lamb. Time might have
                        wholly effaced the impression from Lester&apos;s memory had nothing else
                        intervened to arouse his suspicions; but a mishap of any kind seems
                        invariably to be linked with others which follow close upon its heels.</p>
                    <p>One evening when Lester happened to be lingering about the flat later than
                        usual the door bell rang, and, <pb id="VAA2406-212" n="205"/> Jennie being
                        busy in the kitchen, Lester went himself to open the door. He was greeted by
                        a middle-aged lady, who frowned very nervously upon him, and inquired in
                        broken Swedish accents for Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait a moment,&quot; said Lester; and stepping to the rear door
                        he called her.</p>
                    <p>Jennie came, and seeing who the visitor was, she stepped nervously out in the
                        hall and closed the door after her. The action instantly struck Lester as
                        suspicious. He frowned and determined to inquire thoroughly into the matter.
                        A moment later Jennie reappeared. Her face was white and her fingers seemed
                        to be nervously seeking something to seize upon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the trouble?&quot; he inquired, the irritation
                        he had felt the moment before giving his voice a touch of gruffness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got to go out for a little while,&quot; she at
                        last managed to reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; he assented unwillingly. &quot;But you can
                        tell me what&apos;s the trouble with you, can&apos;t you? Where do
                        you have to go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I-I,&quot; began Jennie, stammering. &quot;Ihave&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said grimly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have to go on an errand,&quot; she stumbled on. &quot;II
                        can&apos;t wait. I&apos;ll tell you when I come back, Lester. Please
                        don&apos;t ask me now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked vainly at him, her troubled countenance still marked by
                        preoccupation and anxiety to get away, and Lester, who had never seen this
                        look of intense responsibility in her before, was moved and irritated by it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all right,&quot; he said, &quot;but
                        what&apos;s the use of all this secrecy? Why can&apos;t you come out
                        and tell what&apos;s the matter with you? What&apos;s the use of
                        this whispering behind doors? Where do you have to go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused, checked by his own harshness, and Jennie, who was intensely
                        wrought up by the information she had received, as well as the unwonted
                        verbal castigation <pb id="VAA2406-213" n="[206]"/> she was now enduring,
                        rose to an emotional state never reached by her before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will, Lester, I will,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Only not
                        now. I haven&apos;t time. I&apos;ll tell you everything when I come
                        back. Please don&apos;t stop me now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hurried to the adjoining chamber to get her wraps, and Lester, who had
                        even yet no clear conception of what it all meant, followed her stubbornly
                        to the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See here,&quot; he exclaimed in his vigorous, brutal way,
                        &quot;you&apos;re not acting right. What&apos;s the matter with
                        you? I want to know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stood in the doorway, his whole frame exhibiting the pugnacity and settled
                        determination of a man who is bound to be obeyed. Jennie, troubled and
                        driven to bay, turned at last.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s my child, Lester,&quot; she exclaimed.
                        &quot;It&apos;s dying. I haven&apos;t time to talk. Oh, please
                        don&apos;t stop me. I&apos;ll tell you everything when I come
                        back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your child!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;What the hell are you
                        talking about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t help it,&quot; she returned. &quot;I
                        was afraidI should have told you long ago. I meant to onlyonlyOh, let me go
                        now, and I&apos;ll tell you all when I come back!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stared at her in amazement; then he stepped aside, unwilling to force her
                        any further for the present. &quot;Well, go ahead,&quot; he said
                        quietly. &quot;Don&apos;t you want some one to go along with
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied. &quot;Mrs. Olsen is right here.
                        I&apos;ll go with her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hurried forth, white-faced, and he stood there, pondering. Could this be
                        the woman he had thought he knew? Why, she had been deceiving him for years.
                        Jennie! The white-faced! The simple!</p>
                    <p>He choked a little as he muttered:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll be damned!&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXIX</head>
                    <p>THE reason why Jennie had been called was nothing more than one of those
                        infantile seizures the coming and result of which no man can predict two
                        hours beforehand. Vesta had been seriously taken with membranous croup only
                        a few hours before, and the development since had been so rapid that the
                        poor old Swedish mother was half frightened to death herself, and hastily
                        despatched a neighbor to say that Vesta was very ill and Mrs. Kane was to
                        come at once. This message, delivered as it was in a very nervous manner by
                        one whose only object was to bring her, had induced the soul-racking fear of
                        death in Jennie and caused her to brave the discovery of Lester in the
                        manner described. Jennie hurried on anxiously, her one thought being to
                        reach her child before the arm of death could interfere and snatch it from
                        her, her mind weighed upon by a legion of fears. What if it should already
                        be too late when she got there; what if Vesta already should be no more.
                        Instinctively she quickened her pace and as the street lamps came and
                        receded in the gloom she forgot all the sting of Lester&apos;s words,
                        all fear that he might turn her out and leave her alone in a great city with
                        a little child to care for, and remembered only the fact that her Vesta was
                        very ill, possibly dying, and that she was the direct cause of the
                        child&apos;s absence from her; that perhaps but for the want of her care
                        and attention Vesta might be well to-night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I can only get there,&quot; she kept saying to herself; and
                        then, with that frantic unreason which is the chief <pb id="VAA2406-215"
                            n="208"/> characteristic of the instinct-driven mother: &quot;I
                        might have known that God would punish me for my unnatural conduct. I might
                        have known I might have known.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she reached the gate she fairly sped up the little walk and into the
                        house, where Vesta was lying pale, quiet, and weak, but considerably better.
                        Several Swedish neighbors and a middle-aged physician were in attendance,
                        all of whom looked at her curiously as she dropped beside the
                        child&apos;s bed and spoke to her.</p>
                    <p>Jennie&apos;s mind had been made up. She had sinned, and sinned
                        grievously, against her daughter, but now she would make amends so far as
                        possible. Lester was very dear to her, but she would no longer attempt to
                        deceive him in anything, even if he left hershe felt an agonized stab, a
                        pain at the thoughtshe must still do the one right thing. Vesta must not be
                        an outcast any longer. Her mother must give her a home. Where Jennie was,
                        there must Vesta be.</p>
                    <p>Sitting by the bedside in this humble Swedish cottage, Jennie realized the
                        fruitlessness of her deception, the trouble and pain it had created in her
                        home, the months of suffering it had given her with Lester, the agony it had
                        heaped upon her this nightand to what end? The truth had been discovered
                        anyhow. She sat there and meditated, not knowing what next was to happen,
                        while Vesta quieted down, and then went soundly to sleep.</p>
                    <p>Lester, after recovering from the first heavy import of this discovery, asked
                        himself some perfectly natural questions. &quot;Who was the father of
                        the child? How old was it? How did it chance to be in Chicago, and who was
                        taking care of it? He could ask, but he could not answer; he knew absolutely
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>Curiously, now, as he thought, his first meeting with Jennie at Mrs.
                        Bracebridge&apos;s came back to him. What was it about her then that had
                        attracted him? What made him think, after a few hours&apos; observation,
                        that he <pb id="VAA2406-216" n="209"/> could seduce her to do his will? What
                        was itmoral looseness, or weakness, or what? There must have been art in the
                        sorry affair, the practised art of the cheat, and, in deceiving such a
                        confiding nature as his, she had done even more than practise deceptionshe
                        had been ungrateful.</p>
                    <p>Now the quality of ingratitude was a very objectionable thing to Lesterthe
                        last and most offensive trait of a debased nature, and to be able to
                        discover a trace of it in Jennie was very disturbing. It is true that she
                        had not exhibited it in any other way beforequite to the contrarybut
                        nevertheless he saw strong evidences of it now, and it made him very bitter
                        in his feeling toward her. How could she be guilty of any such conduct
                        toward him? Had he not picked her up out of nothing, so to speak, and
                        befriended her?</p>
                    <p>He moved from his chair in this silent room and began to pace slowly to and
                        fro, the weightiness of this subject exercising to the full his power of
                        decision. She was guilty of a misdeed which he felt able to condemn. The
                        original concealment was evil; the continued deception more. Lastly, there
                        was the thought that her love after all had been divided, part for him, part
                        for the child, a discovery which no man in his position could contemplate
                        with serenity. He moved irritably as he thought of it, shoved his hands in
                        his pockets and walked to and fro across the floor.</p>
                    <p>That a man of Lester&apos;s temperament should consider himself wronged
                        by Jennie merely because she had concealed a child whose existence was due
                        to conduct no more irregular than was involved later in the yielding of
                        herself to him was an example of those inexplicable perversions of judgment
                        to which the human mind, in its capacity of keeper of the honor of others,
                        seems permanently committed. Lester, aside from his own personal conduct
                        (for men seldom judge with that in the balance), had faith in the ideal that
                        a woman should <pb id="VAA2406-217" n="210"/> reveal herself completely to
                        the one man with whom she is in love; and the fact that she had not done so
                        was a grief to him. He had asked her once tentatively about her past. She
                        begged him not to press her. That was the time she should have spoken of any
                        child. Nowhe shook his head.</p>
                    <p>His first impulse, after he had thought the thing over, was to walk out and
                        leave her. At the same time he was curious to hear the end of this business.
                        He did put on his hat and coat, however, and went out, stopping at the first
                        convenient saloon to get a drink. He took a car and went down to the club,
                        strolling about the different rooms and chatting with several people whom he
                        encountered. He was restless and irritated; and finally, after three hours
                        of meditation, he took a cab and returned to his apartment.</p>
                    <p>The distraught Jennie, sitting by her sleeping child, was at last made to
                        realize, by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over. There was
                        nothing more that she could do for Vesta, and now the claims of the home
                        that she had deserted began to reassert themselves, the promise to Lester
                        and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the very end. Lester might
                        possibly be waiting for her. It was just probable that he wished to hear the
                        remainder of her story before breaking with her entirely. Although anguished
                        and frightened by the certainty, as she deemed it, of his forsaking her, she
                        nevertheless felt that it was no more than she deserveda just punishment for
                        all her misdoings.</p>
                    <p>When Jennie arrived at the flat it was after eleven, and the hall light was
                        already out. She first tried the door, and then inserted her key. No one
                        stirred, however, and, opening the door, she entered in the expectation of
                        seeing Lester sternly confronting her. He was not there, however. The
                        burning gas had merely been an oversight on his part. She glanced quickly
                        about, but seeing only the empty room, she came instantly to the other
                        conclusion, <pb id="VAA2406-218" n="211"/> that he had forsaken herand so
                        stood there, a meditative, helpless figure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gone!&quot; she thought.</p>
                    <p>At this moment his footsteps sounded on the stairs. He came in with his derby
                        hat pulled low over his broad forehead, close to his sandy eyebrows and with
                        his overcoat buttoned up closely about his neck. He took off the coat
                        without looking at Jennie and hung it on the rack. Then he deliberately took
                        off his hat and hung that up also. When he was through he turned to where
                        she was watching him with wide eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to know about this thing now from beginning to
                        end,&quot; he began. &quot;Whose child is that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie wavered a moment, as one who might be going to take a leap in the
                        dark, then opened her lips mechanically and confessed:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s Senator Brander&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Senator Brander!&quot; echoed Lester, the familiar name of the
                        dead but still famous statesman ringing with shocking and unexpected force
                        in his ears. &quot;How did you come to know him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We used to do his washing for him,&quot; she rejoined
                        simply&quot;my mother and I.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester paused, the baldness of the statements issuing from her sobering even
                        his rancorous mood. &quot;Senator Brander&apos;s child,&quot; he
                        thought to himself. So that great representative of the interests of the
                        common people was the undoer of hera self-confessed washerwoman&apos;s
                        daughter. A fine tragedy of low life all this was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long ago was this?&quot; he demanded, his face the picture
                        of a darkling mood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s been nearly six years now,&quot; she returned.</p>
                    <p>He calculated the time that had elapsed since he had known her, and then
                        continued:</p>
                    <p>&quot;How old is the child?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s a little over five.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-219" n="212"/>
                    <p>Lester moved a little. The need for serious thought made his tone more
                        peremptory but less bitter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where have you been keeping her all this time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She was at home until you went to Cincinnati last spring. I went
                        down and brought her then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was she there he times I came to Cleveland?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jennie; &quot;but I didn&apos;t let her
                        come out anywhere where you could see her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you said you told your people that you were
                        married,&quot; he exclaimed, wondering how this relationship of the
                        child to the family could have been adjusted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did,&quot; she replied, &quot;but I didn&apos;t want
                        to tell you about her. They thought all the time I intended to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, why didn&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I was afraid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Afraid of what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t know what was going to become of me when I went
                        with you, Lester. I didn&apos;t want to do her any harm if I could help
                        it. I was ashamed, afterward; when you said you didn&apos;t like
                        children I was afraid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Afraid I&apos;d leave you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stopped, the simplicity of her answers removing a part of the suspicion of
                        artful duplicity which had originally weighed upon him. After all, there was
                        not so much of that in it as mere wretchedness of circumstance and cowardice
                        of morals. What a family she must have! What queer non-moral natures they
                        must have to have brooked any such a combination of affairs!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you know that you&apos;d be found out in the
                        long run?&quot; he at last demanded. &quot;Surely you might have
                        seen that you couldn&apos;t raise her that way. Why didn&apos;t you
                        tell me in the first place? I wouldn&apos;t have thought anything of it
                        then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said. &quot;I wanted to protect
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is she now?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-220" n="213"/>
                    <p>Jennie explained.</p>
                    <p>She stood there, the contradictory aspect of these questions and of his
                        attitude puzzling even herself. She did try to explain them after a time,
                        but all Lester could gain was that she had blundered along without any
                        artifice at alla condition that was so manifest that, had he been in any
                        other position than that he was, he might have pitied her. As it was, the
                        revelation concerning Brander was hanging over him, and he finally returned
                        to that.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You say your mother used to do washing for him. How did you come to
                        get in with him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie, who until now had borne his questions with unmoving pain, winced at
                        this. He was now encroaching upon the period that was by far the most
                        distressing memory of her life. What he had just asked seemed to be a demand
                        upon her to make everything clear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was so young, Lester,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I was only
                        eighteen. I didn&apos;t know. I used to go to the hotel where he was
                        stopping and get his laundry, and at the end of the week I&apos;d take
                        it to him again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused, and as he took a chair, looking as if he expected to hear the
                        whole story, she continued: &quot;We were so poor. He used to give me
                        money to give to my mother. I didn&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused again, totally unable to go on, and he, seeing that it would be
                        impossible for her to explain without prompting, took up his questioning
                        againeliciting by degrees the whole pitiful story. Brander had intended to
                        marry her. He had written to her, but before he could come to her he died.</p>
                    <p>The confession was complete. It was followed by a period of five minutes, in
                        which Lester said nothing at all; he put his arm on the mantel and stared at
                        the wall, while Jennie waited, not knowing what would follownot wishing to
                        make a single plea. The clock ticked audibly. Lester&apos;s face
                        betrayed no sign of either thought <pb id="VAA2406-221" n="214"/> or
                        feeling. He was now quite calm, quite sober, wondering what he should do.
                        Jennie was before him as the criminal at the bar. He, the righteous, the
                        moral, the pure of heart, was in the judgment seat. Now to sentence herto
                        make up his mind what course of action he should pursue.</p>
                    <p>It was a disagreeable tangle, to be sure, something that a man of his
                        position and wealth really ought not to have anything to do with. This
                        child, the actuality of it, put an almost unbearable face upon the whole
                        matter and yet he was not quite prepared to speak. He turned after a time,
                        the silvery tinkle of the French clock on the mantel striking three and
                        causing him to become aware of Jennie, pale, uncertain, still standing as
                        she had stood all this while.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better go to bed,&quot; he said at last, and fell again to
                        pondering this difficult problem.</p>
                    <p>But Jennie continued to stand there wide-eyed, expectant, ready to hear at
                        any moment his decision as to her fate. She waited in vain, however. After a
                        long time of musing he turned and went to the clothes-rack near the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better go to bed,&quot; he said, indifferently.
                        &quot;I&apos;m going out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned instinctively, feeling that even in this crisis there was some
                        little service that she might render, but he did not see her. He went out,
                        vouchsafing no further speech.</p>
                    <p>She looked after him, and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she felt as
                        if she were doomed and hearing her own death-knell. What had she done? What
                        would he do now? She stood there a dissonance of despair, and when the lower
                        door clicked moved her hand out of the agony of her suppressed hopelessness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gone!&quot; she thought. &quot;Gone!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the light of a late dawn she was still sitting there pondering, her state
                        far too urgent for idle tears.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXX</head>
                    <p>THE sullen, philosophic Lester was not so determined upon his future course
                        of action as he appeared to be. Stern as was his mood, he did not see, after
                        all, exactly what grounds he had for complaint. And yet the child&apos;s
                        existence complicated matters considerably. He did not like to see the
                        evidence of Jennie&apos;s previous misdeeds walking about in the shape
                        of a human being; but, as a matter of fact, he admitted to himself that long
                        ago he might have forced Jennie&apos;s story out of her if he had gone
                        about it in earnest. She would not have lied, he knew that. At the very
                        outset he might have demanded the history of her past. He had not done so;
                        well, now it was too late. The one thing it did fix in his mind was that it
                        would be useless to ever think of marrying her. It couldn&apos;t be
                        done, not by a man in his position. The best solution of the problem was to
                        make reasonable provision for Jennie and then leave her. He went to his
                        hotel with his mind made up, but he did not actually say to himself that he
                        would do it at once.</p>
                    <p>It is an easy thing for a man to theorize in a situation of this kind, quite
                        another to act. Our comforts, appetites and passions grow with usage, and
                        Jennie was not only a comfort, but an appetite, with him. Almost four years
                        of constant association had taught him so much about her and himself that he
                        was not prepared to let go easily or quickly. It was too much of a wrench.
                        He could think of it bustling about the work of a great organization during
                        the daytime, but when night came it was a different matter. He could be
                        lonely, too, <pb id="VAA2406-223" n="216"/> he discovered much to his
                        surprise, and it disturbed him.</p>
                    <p>One of the things that interested him in this situation was Jennie&apos;s
                        early theory that the intermingling of Vesta with him and her in this new
                        relationship would injure the child. Just how did she come by that feeling,
                        he wanted to know? His place in the world was better than hers, yet it
                        dawned on him after a time that there might have been something in her point
                        of view. She did not know who he was or what he would do with her. He might
                        leave her shortly. Being uncertain, she wished to protect her baby. That
                        wasn&apos;t so bad. Then again, he was curious to know what the child
                        was like. The daughter of a man like Senator Brander might be somewhat of an
                        infant. He was a brilliant man and Jennie was a charming woman. He thought
                        of this, and, while it irritated him, it aroused his curiosity. He ought to
                        go back and see the childhe was really entitled to a view of itbut he
                        hesitated because of his own attitude in the beginning. It seemed to him
                        that he really ought to quit, and here he was parleying with himself.</p>
                    <p>The truth was that he couldn&apos;t. These years of living with Jennie
                        had made him curiously dependent upon her. Who had ever been so close to him
                        before? His mother loved him, but her attitude toward him had not so much to
                        do with real love as with ambition. His fatherwell, his father was a man,
                        like himself. All of his sisters were distinctly wrapped up in their own
                        affairs; Robert and he were temperamentally uncongenial. With Jennie he had
                        really been happy, he had truly lived. She was necessary to him; the longer
                        he stayed away from her the more he wanted her. He finally decided to have a
                        straight-out talk with her, to arrive at some sort of understanding. She
                        ought to get the child and take care of it. She must understand that he
                        might eventually want to quit. She ought to be made to feel that a definite
                        change had taken place, though no immediate <pb id="VAA2406-224" n="217"/>
                        break might occur. That same evening he went out to the apartment. Jennie
                        heard him enter, and her heart began to flutter. Then she took her courage
                        in both hands, and went to meet him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s just one thing to be done about this as far as I
                        can see,&quot; began Lester, with characteristic directness.
                        &quot;Get the child and bring her here where you can take care of her.
                        There&apos;s no use leaving her in the hands of strangers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will, Lester,&quot; said Jennie submissively. &quot;I
                        always wanted to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well, then, you&apos;d better do it at once.&quot; He
                        took an evening newspaper out of his pocket and strolled toward one of the
                        front windows; then he turned to her. &quot;You and I might as well
                        understand each other, Jennie,&quot; he went on. &quot;I can see how
                        this thing came about. It was a piece of foolishness on my part not to have
                        asked you before, and made you tell me. It was silly for you to conceal it,
                        even if you didn&apos;t want the child&apos;s life mixed with mine.
                        You might have known that it couldn&apos;t be done. That&apos;s
                        neither here nor there, though, now. The thing that I want to point out is
                        that one can&apos;t live and hold a relationship such as ours without
                        confidence. You and I had that, I thought. I don&apos;t see my way clear
                        to ever hold more than a tentative relationship with you on this basis. The
                        thing is too tangled. There&apos;s too much cause for scandal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I don&apos;t propose to do anything hasty. For my part I
                        don&apos;t see why things can&apos;t go on about as they
                        arecertainly for the presentbut I want you to look the facts in the
                        face.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie sighed. &quot;I know, Lester,&quot; she said, &quot;I
                        know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went to the window and stared out. There were some trees in the yard,
                        where the darkness was settling. He wondered how this would really come out,
                        for he liked a home atmosphere. Should he leave the apartment and go to his
                        club?</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-225" n="[218]"/>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better get the dinner,&quot; he suggested, after
                        a time, turning toward her irritably; but he did not feel so distant as he
                        looked. It was a shame that life could not be more decently organized. He
                        strolled back to his lounge, and Jennie went about her duties. She was
                        thinking of Vesta, of her ungrateful attitude toward Lester, of his final
                        decision never to marry her. So that was how one dream had been wrecked by
                        folly.</p>
                    <p>She spread the table, lighted the pretty silver candles, made his favorite
                        biscuit, put a small leg of lamb in the oven to roast, and washed some
                        lettuce-leaves for a salad. She had been a diligent student of a cook-book
                        for some time, and she had learned a good deal from her mother. All the time
                        she was wondering how the situation would work out. He would leave her
                        eventuallyno doubt of that. He would go away and marry some one else.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, well,&quot; she thought finally, &quot;he is not going
                        to leave me right awaythat is something. And I can bring Vesta
                        here.&quot; She sighed as she carried the things to the table. If life
                        would only give her Lester and Vesta togetherbut that hope was over.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXXI</head>
                    <p>THERE was peace and quiet for some time after this storm. Jennie went the
                        next day and brought Vesta away with her. The joy of the reunion between
                        mother and child made up for many other worries. &quot;Now I can do by
                        her as I ought,&quot; she thought; and three or four times during the
                        day she found herself humming a little song.</p>
                    <p>Lester came only occasionally at first. He was trying to make himself believe
                        that he ought to do something toward reforming his lifetoward bringing about
                        that eventual separation which he had suggested. He did not like the idea of
                        a child being in this apartmentparticularly that particular child. He fought
                        his way through a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to
                        the apartment more regularly. In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a place
                        of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.</p>
                    <p>During the first days of Lester&apos;s return it was difficult for Jennie
                        to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost uncontrollable
                        child from annoying the staid, emphatic, commercial-minded man. Jennie gave
                        Vesta a severe talking to the first night Lester telephoned that he was
                        coming, telling her that he was a very badtempered man who didn&apos;t
                        like children, and that she mustn&apos;t go near him. &quot;You
                        mustn&apos;t talk,&quot; she said. &quot;You mustn&apos;t
                        ask questions. Let mamma ask you what you want. And don&apos;t reach,
                        ever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Vesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the full
                        significance of the warning.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-227" n="220"/>
                    <p>Lester came at seven. Jennie, who had taken great pains to array Vesta as
                        attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give her own toilet a
                        last touch. Vesta was supposedly in the kitchen. As a matter of fact, she
                        had followed her mother to the door of the sitting-room, where now she could
                        be plainly seen. Lester hung up his hat and coat, then, turning, he caught
                        his first glimpse. The child looked very sweethe admitted that at a glance.
                        She was arrayed in a bluedotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll
                        collar and cuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and
                        shoes. Her corn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face. Blue eyes, rosy
                        lips, rosy cheeks completed the picture. Lester stared, almost inclined to
                        say something, but restrained himself. Vesta shyly retreated.</p>
                    <p>When Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had arrived.
                        &quot;Rather sweet-looking child,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you
                        have much trouble in making her mind?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not much,&quot; she returned.</p>
                    <p>Jennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of their
                        conversation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who are he?&quot; asked Vesta.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sh! That&apos;s your Uncle Lester. Didn&apos;t I tell you
                        you mustn&apos;t talk?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are he your uncle?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, dear. Don&apos;t talk now. Run into the kitchen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are he only my uncle?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Now run along.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In spite of himself Lester had to smile.</p>
                    <p>What might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen, peevish, or
                        all three, can scarcely be conjectured. Had Jennie been less tactful, even
                        in the beginning, he might have obtained a disagreeable impression. As it
                        was, the natural beauty of the child, combined with the mother&apos;s
                        gentle diplomacy in keeping <pb id="VAA2406-228" n="221"/> her in the
                        background, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and youth
                        which is always pleasant. The thought struck him that Jennie had been the
                        mother of a child all these years; she had been separated from it for months
                        at a time; she had never even hinted at its existence, and yet her affection
                        for Vesta was obviously great. &quot;It&apos;s queer,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;She&apos;s a peculiar woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>One morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when he
                        thought he heard something stir. He turned, and was surprised to see a large
                        blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring doorthe effect
                        was most disconcerting. It was not like the ordinary eye, which, under such
                        embarrassing circumstances, would have been immediately withdrawn; it kept
                        its position with deliberate boldness. He turned his paper solemnly and
                        looked again. There was the eye. He turned it again. Still was the eye
                        present. He crossed his legs and looked again. Now the eye was gone.</p>
                    <p>This little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with the saving
                        grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially responsive. Although
                        not in the least inclined to relax his attitude of aloofness, he found his
                        mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by the mysterious appearance; the
                        corners of his mouth were animated by a desire to turn up. He did not give
                        way to the feeling, and stuck by his paper, but the incident remained very
                        clearly in his mind. The young wayfarer had made her first really important
                        impression upon him.</p>
                    <p>Not long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast, calmly
                        eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused by another
                        visitationthis time not quite so simple. Jennie had given Vesta her
                        breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until Lester should leave the
                        house. Jennie was seated at the table, pouring out the coffee, when Vesta
                        suddenly appeared, <pb id="VAA2406-229" n="222"/> very business-like in
                        manner, and marched through the room. Lester looked up, and Jennie colored
                        and arose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it, Vesta?&quot; she inquired, following her.</p>
                    <p>By this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a little broom,
                        and returned, a droll determination lighting her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want my little broom,&quot; she exclaimed and marched
                        sedately past, at which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched
                        internally, this time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play
                        across his mouth.</p>
                    <p>The final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down the feeling
                        of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in its place a sort
                        of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a human being.</p>
                    <p>The developments of the next six months were of a kind to further relax the
                        strain of opposition which still existed in Lester&apos;s mind. Although
                        not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in which he was
                        living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could not persuade
                        himself to give it up. It was too much like a bed of down. Jennie was too
                        worshipful. The condition of unquestioned liberty, so far as all his old
                        social relationships were concerned, coupled with the privilege of quiet,
                        simplicity, and affection in the home was too inviting. He lingered on, and
                        began to feel that perhaps it would be just as well to let matters rest as
                        they were.</p>
                    <p>During this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta insensibly
                        strengthened. He discovered that there was a real flavor of humor about
                        Vesta&apos;s doings, and so came to watch for its development. She was
                        forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie watched over her
                        with a care that was in itself a revelation to him, nevertheless Vesta
                        managed to elude every effort to suppress her and came straight home with
                        her remarks. Once, for example, she was sawing away at a small piece of meat
                        upon her large plate with her big <pb id="VAA2406-230" n="[223]"/> knife,
                        when Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a
                        little breakfast set.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She can hardly handle these knives.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Vesta instantly. &quot;I need a little
                        knife. My hand is just so very little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She held it up. Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow, reached over
                        and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained a desire to laugh.</p>
                    <p>Another morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the lumps of
                        sugar in Lester&apos;s cup, when she broke in with, &quot;I want two
                        lumps in mine, mamma.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, dearest,&quot; replied Jennie, &quot;you don&apos;t
                        need any in yours. You have milk to drink.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Uncle Lester has two,&quot; she protested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Jennie; &quot;but you&apos;re only
                        a little girl. Besides you mustn&apos;t say anything like that at the
                        table. It isn&apos;t nice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Uncle Lester eats too much sugar,&quot; was her immediate
                        rejoinder, at which that fine gourmet smiled broadly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know about that,&quot; he put in, for the
                        first time deigning to answer her directly. &quot;That sounds like the
                        fox and grapes to me.&quot; Vesta smiled back at him, and now that the
                        ice was broken she chattered on unrestrainedly. One thing led to another,
                        and at last Lester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to
                        him; he was willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his
                        position and wealth might make possibleprovided, of course, that he stayed
                        with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement which would not put
                        him hopelessly out of touch with the world which was back of him, and which
                        he had to keep constantly in mind.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXXII</head>
                    <p>THE following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed, and Lester
                        removed his office to the new building. Heretofore, he had been transacting
                        all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the club. From now on he
                        felt himself to be firmly established in Chicagoas if that was to be his
                        future home. A large number of details were thrown upon himthe control of a
                        considerable office force, and the handling of various important
                        transactions. It took away from him the need of traveling, that duty going
                        to Amy&apos;s husband, under the direction of Robert. The latter was
                        doing his best to push his personal interests, not only through the
                        influence he was bringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his
                        reorganization of the factory. Several men whom Lester was personally fond
                        of were in danger of elimination. But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane
                        senior was inclined to give Robert a free hand. Age was telling on him. He
                        was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take charge.
                        Lester did not seem to mind. Apparently he and Robert were on better terms
                        than ever before.</p>
                    <p>Matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact that
                        Lester&apos;s private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be
                        permanently kept under cover. At times he was seen driving with her by
                        people who knew him in a social and commercial way. He was for brazening it
                        out on the ground that he was a single man, and at liberty to associate with
                        anybody he pleased. Jennie might be any young woman of good family in <pb
                            id="VAA2406-232" n="225"/> whom he was interested. He did not propose to
                        introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always made it a point
                        to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others might not attempt to
                        detain and talk to him. At the theater, as has been said, she was simply
                        &quot;Miss Gerhardt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers of life.
                        They had no quarrel to pick with Lester&apos;s conduct. Only he had been
                        seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman. She must be some
                        one whom he was maintaining irregularly. Well, what of it? Wealth and
                        youthful spirits must have their fling. Rumors came to Robert, who, however,
                        kept his own counsel. If Lester wanted to do this sort of thing, well and
                        good. But there must come a time when there would be a show-down.</p>
                    <p>This came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester and Jennie
                        had been living in the north side apartment. It so happened that, during a
                        stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was seized with a mild form
                        of grip. When he felt the first symptoms he thought that his indisposition
                        would be a matter of short duration, and tried to overcome it by taking a
                        hot bath and a liberal dose of quinine. But the infection was stronger than
                        he counted on; by morning he was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a
                        splitting headache.</p>
                    <p>His long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious. Policy
                        would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel and endure
                        his sickness alone. As a matter of fact, he was very glad to be in the house
                        with her. He had to call up the office to say that he was indisposed and
                        would not be down for a day or so; then he yielded himself comfortably to
                        her patient ministrations.</p>
                    <p>Jennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or well. She
                        persuaded him to see a doctor and <pb id="VAA2406-233" n="226"/> have him
                        prescribe. She brought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and
                        hands in cold water over and over. Later, when he was recovering, she made
                        him appetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.</p>
                    <p>It was during this illness that the first real contretemps occurred.
                        Lester&apos;s sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St. Paul,
                        and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on her way,
                        decided upon an earlier return than she had originally planned. While Lester
                        was sick at his apartment she arrived in Chicago. Calling up the office, and
                        finding that he was not there and would not be down for several days, she
                        asked where he could be reached.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific,&quot; said an
                        incautious secretary. &quot;He&apos;s not feeling well.&quot;
                        Louise, a little disturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told
                        that Mr. Kane had not been there for several daysdid not, as a matter of
                        fact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week. Piqued by this, she
                        telephoned his club.</p>
                    <p>It so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had called up
                        the apartment a number of times for Lester himself. He had not been
                        cautioned not to give its numberas a matter of fact, it had never been asked
                        for by any one else. When Louise stated that she was Lester&apos;s
                        sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied, &quot;I think he
                        lives at 19 Schiller Place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whose address is that you&apos;re giving?&quot; Inquired a
                        passing clerk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Kane&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, don&apos;t be giving out addresses. Don&apos;t you
                        know that yet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was gone.</p>
                    <p>About an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her brother,
                        Louise arrived at Schiller Place. Ascending the stepsit was a two-apartment
                        houseshe saw <pb id="VAA2406-234" n="227"/> the name of Kane on the door
                        leading to the second floor. Ringing the bell, she was opened to by Jennie,
                        who was surprised to see so fashionably attired a young woman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is Mr. Kane&apos;s apartment, I believe,&quot; began
                        Louise, condescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie.
                        She was a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were as
                        yet only vaguely aroused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s sick, I believe. I&apos;m his sister. May I come
                        in?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried to make
                        some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and station, swept
                        past before Jennie could say a word. Once inside Louise looked about her
                        inquiringly. She found herself in the sitting-room, which gave into the
                        bedroom where Lester was lying. Vesta happened to be playing in one corner
                        of the room, and stood up to eye the new-comer. The open bedroom showed
                        Lester quite plainly lying in bed, a window to the left of him, his eyes
                        closed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, there you are, old fellow!&quot; exclaimed Louise.
                        &quot;What&apos;s ailing you?&quot; she hurried on.</p>
                    <p>Lester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized in an
                        instant how things were. He pulled himself up on one elbow, but words failed
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, hello, Louise,&quot; he finally forced himself to say.
                        &quot;Where did you come from?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;St. Paul. I came back sooner than I thought,&quot; she answered
                        lamely, a sense of something wrong irritating her. &quot;I had a hard
                        time finding you, too. Who&apos;s your&quot; she was about to say
                        &quot;pretty housekeeper,&quot; but turned to find Jennie dazedly
                        gathering up certain articles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully
                        distraught.</p>
                    <p>Lester cleared his throat hopelessly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-235" n="228"/>
                    <p>His sister swept the place with an observing eye. It took in the home
                        atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive. There was a dress of
                        Jennie&apos;s lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which caused Miss
                        Kane to draw herself up warily. She looked at her brother, who had a rather
                        curious expression in his eyeshe seemed slightly nonplussed, but cool and
                        defiant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You shouldn&apos;t have come out here,&quot; said Lester
                        finally, before Louise could give vent to the rising question in her mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why shouldn&apos;t I?&quot; she exclaimed, angered at the
                        brazen confession. &quot;You&apos;re my brother, aren&apos;t
                        you? Why should you have any place that I couldn&apos;t come. Well, I
                        like thatand from you to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen, Louise,&quot; went on Lester, drawing himself up
                        further on one elbow. &quot;You know as much about life as I do. There
                        is no need of our getting into an argument. I didn&apos;t know you were
                        coming, or I would have made other arrangements.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Other arrangements, indeed,&quot; she sneered. &quot;I
                        should think as much. The idea!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this trap; it was
                        really disgraceful of Lester.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t be so haughty about it,&quot; he declared,
                        his color rising. &quot;I&apos;m not apologizing to you for my
                        conduct. I&apos;m saying I would have made other arrangements, which is
                        a very different thing from begging your pardon. If you don&apos;t want
                        to be civil, you needn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Lester Kane!&quot; she exclaimed, her cheeks flaming.
                        &quot;I thought better of you, honestly I did. I should think you would
                        be ashamed of yourself living here in open&quot; she paused without
                        using the word &quot;and our friends scattered all over the city.
                        It&apos;s terrible! I thought you had more sense of decency and
                        consideration.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Decency nothing,&quot; he flared. &quot;I tell you
                        I&apos;m not <pb id="VAA2406-236" n="229"/> apologizing to you. If you
                        don&apos;t like this you know what you can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;This from my own brother!
                        And for the sake of that creature! Whose child is that?&quot; she
                        demanded, savagely and yet curiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind, it&apos;s not mine. If it were it wouldn&apos;t
                        make any difference. I wish you wouldn&apos;t busy yourself about my
                        affairs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the sitting-room,
                        heard the cutting references to herself. She winced with pain.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t flatter yourself. I won&apos;t any
                        more,&quot; retorted Louise. &quot;I should think, though, that you,
                        of all men, would be above anything like thisand that with a woman so
                        obviously beneath you. Why, I thought she was&quot; she was again going
                        to add &quot;your housekeeper,&quot; but she was interrupted by
                        Lester, who was angry to the point of brutality.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind what you thought she was,&quot; he growled.
                        &quot;She&apos;s better than some who do the so-called superior
                        thinking. I know what you think. It&apos;s neither here nor there, I
                        tell you. I&apos;m doing this, and I don&apos;t care what you think.
                        I have to take the blame. Don&apos;t bother about me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I won&apos;t, I assure you,&quot; she flung back.
                        &quot;It&apos;s quite plain that your family means nothing to you.
                        But if you had any sense of decency, Lester Kane, you would never let your
                        sister be trapped into coming into a place like this. I&apos;m
                        disgusted, that&apos;s all, and so will the others be when they hear of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look being
                        reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door of the
                        dining-room. Vesta had disappeared. Jennie came in a little while later and
                        closed the door. She knew of nothing to say. Lester, his thick hair pushed
                        back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily on his pillow.
                        &quot;What a devilish <pb id="VAA2406-237" n="[230]"/> trick of
                        fortune,&quot; he thought. Now she would go home and tell it to the
                        family. His father would know, and his mother. Robert, Imogene, Amyall would
                        hear. He would have no explanation to makeshe had seen. He stared at the
                        wall meditatively.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for reflection. So
                        this was her real position in another woman&apos;s eyes. Now she could
                        see what the world thought. This family was as aloof from her as if it lived
                        on another planet. To his sisters and brothers, his father and mother, she
                        was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him socially, far beneath him
                        mentally and morally, a creature of the streets. And she had hoped somehow
                        to rehabilitate herself in the eyes of the world. It cut her as nothing
                        before had ever done. The thought tore a great, gaping wound in her
                        sensibilities. She was really low and vile in herLouise&apos;seyes, in
                        the world&apos;s eyes, basically so in Lester&apos;s eyes. How could
                        it be otherwise? She went about numb and still, but the ache of defeat and
                        disgrace was under it all. Oh, if she could only see some way to make
                        herself right with the world, to live honorably, to be decent. How could
                        that possibly be brought about? It ought to beshe knew that. But how?</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXXIII</head>
                    <p>OUTRAGED in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to Cincinnati,
                        where she told the story of her discovery, embellished with many details.
                        According to her, she was met at the door by a &quot;silly-looking,
                        white-faced woman,&quot; who did not even offer to invite her in when
                        she announced her name, but stood there &quot;looking just as guilty as
                        a person possibly could.&quot; Lester also had acted shamefully, having
                        outbrazened the matter to her face. When she had demanded to know whose the
                        child was he had refused to tell her. &quot;It isn&apos;t
                        mine,&quot; was all he would say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh dear, oh dear!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Kane, who was the first
                        to hear the story. &quot;My son, my Lester! How could he have done
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And such a creature!&quot; exclaimed Louise emphatically, as
                        though the words needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I went there solely because I thought I could help him,&quot;
                        continued Louise. &quot;I thought when they said he was indisposed that
                        he might be seriously ill. How should I have known?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poor Lester!&quot; exclaimed her mother. &quot;To think he
                        would come to anything like that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having no
                        previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old Archibald,
                        who came out from the factory and sat through the discussion with a solemn
                        countenance. So Lester was living openly with <pb id="VAA2406-239" n="232"/>
                        a woman of whom they had never heard. He would probably be as defiant and
                        indifferent as his nature was strong. The standpoint of parental authority
                        was impossible. Lester was a centralized authority in himself, and if any
                        overtures for a change of conduct were to be made, they would have to be
                        very diplomatically executed.</p>
                    <p>Archibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but determined
                        that something ought to be done. He held a consultation with Robert, who
                        confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from time to time, but had not
                        wanted to say anything. Mrs. Kane suggested that Robert might go to Chicago
                        and have a talk with Lester.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him
                        irreparable damage,&quot; said Mr. Kane. &quot;He cannot hope to
                        carry it off successfully. Nobody can. He ought to marry her or he ought to
                        quit. I want you to tell him that for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All well and good,&quot; said Robert, &quot;but
                        who&apos;s going to convince him? I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t
                        want the job.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope to,&quot; said old Archibald, &quot;eventually; but
                        you&apos;d better go up and try, anyhow. It can&apos;t do any harm.
                        He might come to his senses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe it,&quot; replied Robert.
                        &quot;He&apos;s a strong man. You see how much good talk does down
                        here. Still, I&apos;ll go if it will relieve your feelings any. Mother
                        wants it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said his father distractedly, &quot;better
                        go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Accordingly Robert went. Without allowing himself to anticipate any
                        particular measure of success in this venture, he rode pleasantly into
                        Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of morality
                        and justice on his side.</p>
                    <p>Upon Robert&apos;s arrival, the third morning after Louise&apos;s
                        interview, he called up the warerooms, but Lester was <pb id="VAA2406-240"
                            n="233"/> not there. He then telephoned to the house, and tactfully made
                        an appointment. Lester was still indisposed, but he preferred to come down
                        to the office, and he did. He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way,
                        and together they talked business for a time. Then followed a pregnant
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here,&quot; began
                        Robert tentatively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I could make a guess at it,&quot; Lester replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They were all very much worried over the fact that you were
                        sickmother particularly. You&apos;re not in any danger of having a
                        relapse, are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar <hi rend="i"
                        >mnage</hi> she ran into up here. You&apos;re not married, are
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The young woman Louise saw is just&quot; Robert waved his hand
                        expressively.</p>
                    <p>Lester nodded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to be inquisitive, Lester. I didn&apos;t
                        come up for that. I&apos;m simply here because the family felt that I
                        ought to come. Mother was so very much distressed that I couldn&apos;t
                        do less than see you for her sake&quot; he paused, and Lester, touched
                        by the fairness and respect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at
                        least made some explanation due.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know that anything I can say will help matters
                        much,&quot; he replied thoughtfully. &quot;There&apos;s really
                        nothing to be said. I have the woman and the family has its objections. The
                        chief difficulty about the thing seems to be the bad luck in being found
                        out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly reasoning in
                        his mind. Lester was very calm about it. He seemed, as usual, to be most
                        convincingly sane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not contemplating marrying her, are you?&quot;
                        queried Robert hesitatingly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-241" n="234"/>
                    <p>&quot;I hadn&apos;t come to that,&quot; answered Lester coolly.</p>
                    <p>They looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert turned his
                        glance to the distant scene of the city.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with
                        her, I suppose,&quot; ventured Robert.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know whether I&apos;d be able to discuss that
                        divine afflatus with you or not,&quot; returned Lester, with a touch of
                        grim humor. &quot;I have never experienced the sensation myself. All I
                        know is that the lady is very pleasing to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s all a question of your own well-being and the
                        family&apos;s, Lester,&quot; went on Robert, after another pause.
                        &quot;Morality does&apos;nt seem to figure in it anywayat least you
                        and I can&apos;t discuss that together. Your feelings on that score
                        naturally relate to you alone. But the matter of your own personal welfare
                        seems to me to be substantial enough ground to base a plea on. The
                        family&apos;s feelings and pride are also fairly important.
                        Father&apos;s the kind of a man who sets more store by the honor of his
                        family than most men. You know that as well as I do, of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know how father feels about it,&quot; returned Lester.
                        &quot;The whole business is as clear to me as it is to any of you,
                        though off-hand I don&apos;t see just what&apos;s to be done about
                        it. These matters aren&apos;t always of a day&apos;s growth, and
                        they can&apos;t be settled in a day. The girl&apos;s here. To a
                        certain extent I&apos;m responsible that she is here. While I&apos;m
                        not willing to go into details, there&apos;s always more in these
                        affairs than appears on the court calendar.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I don&apos;t know what your relations with her have
                        been,&quot; returned Robert, &quot;and I&apos;m not curious to
                        know, but it does look like a bit of injustice all around, don&apos;t
                        you thinkunless you intend to marry her?&quot; This last was put forth
                        as a feeler.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might be willing to agree to that, too,&quot; was
                        Lester&apos;s baffling reply, &quot;if anything were to be gained by
                        it. The <pb id="VAA2406-242" n="235"/> point is, the woman is here, and the
                        family is in possession of the fact. Now if there is anything to be done I
                        have to do it. There isn&apos;t anybody else who can act for me in this
                        matter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor, coming
                        back after a time to say: &quot;You say you haven&apos;t any idea of
                        marrying heror rather you haven&apos;t come to it. I wouldn&apos;t,
                        Lester. It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life, from
                        every point of view. I don&apos;t want to orate, but a man of your
                        position has so much to lose; you can&apos;t afford to do it. Aside from
                        family considerations, you have too much at stake. You&apos;d be simply
                        throwing your life away&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was customary when he
                        was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor and simplicity of this
                        appeal. Robert was not criticizing him now. He was making an appeal to him,
                        and this was somewhat different.</p>
                    <p>The appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began on a new
                        tack, this time picturing old Archibald&apos;s fondness for Lester and
                        the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some well-to-do
                        Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at least worthy of his
                        station. And Mrs. Kane felt the same way; surely Lester must realize that.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know just how all of them feel about it,&quot; Lester
                        interrupted at last, &quot;but I don&apos;t see that
                        anything&apos;s to be done right now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean that you don&apos;t think it would be policy for you
                        to give her up just at present?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean that she&apos;s been exceptionally good to me, and that
                        I&apos;m morally under obligations to do the best I can by her. What
                        that may be, I can&apos;t tell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To live with her?&quot; inquired Robert coolly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been
                        accustomed to live with me,&quot; replied Lester. <pb id="VAA2406-243"
                            n="236"/> Robert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal
                        futile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t family reasons persuade you to make some amicable
                        arrangements with her and let her go?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not without due consideration of the matter; no.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t think you could hold out some hope that the
                        thing will end quicklysomething that would give me a reasonable excuse for
                        softening down the pain of it to the family?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away
                        the edge of this thing for the family, but the truth&apos;s the truth,
                        and I can&apos;t see any room for equivocation between you and me. As
                        I&apos;ve said before, these relationships are involved with things
                        which make it impossible to discuss themunfair to me, unfair to the woman.
                        No one can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in
                        them, and even they can&apos;t always see. I&apos;d be a damned dog
                        to stand up here and give you my word to do anything except the best I
                        can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only to come
                        back after a time and say, &quot;You don&apos;t think
                        there&apos;s anything to be done just at present?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at present.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going. I
                        don&apos;t know that there&apos;s anything else we can talk
                        about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you stay and take lunch with me? I think I might
                        manage to get down to the hotel if you&apos;ll stay.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, thank you,&quot; answered Robert. &quot;I believe I can
                        make that one o&apos;clock train for Cincinnati. I&apos;ll try,
                        anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid, Robert
                        clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the difference
                        time had already made. Robert was the clean, decisive man, Lester the man of
                        doubts. Robert was the spirit of business energy and integrity embodied,
                        Lester the spirit of commercial <pb id="VAA2406-244" n="[237]"/>
                        self-sufficiency, looking at life with an uncertain eye. Together they made
                        a striking picture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that
                        were now running through their minds.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the older brother, after a time, &quot;I
                        don&apos;t suppose there is anything more I can say. I had hoped to make
                        you feel just as we do about this thing, but of course you are your own best
                        judge of this. If you don&apos;t see it now, nothing I could say would
                        make you. It strikes me as a very bad move on your part though.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester listened. He said nothing, but his face expressed an unchanged
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>Robert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door together.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll put the best face I can on it,&quot; said Robert,
                        and walked out.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXXIV</head>
                    <p>IN this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be limited to a
                        plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to the creatures of a
                        planet which is perforce compelled to swing about the sun. A fish, for
                        instance, may not pass out of the circle of the seas without courting
                        annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of the fishes without paying
                        for it dearly. From the parasites of the flowers to the monsters of the
                        jungle and the deep we see clearly the circumscribed nature of their
                        movementsthe emphatic manner in which life has limited them to a sphere; and
                        we are content to note the ludicrous and invariably fatal results which
                        attend any effort on their part to depart from their environment.</p>
                    <p>In the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of limitations has
                        not as yet been so clearly observed. The laws governing our social life are
                        not so clearly understood as to permit of a clear generalization. Still, the
                        opinions, pleas, and judgments of society serve as boundaries which are none
                        the less real for being intangible. When men or women errthat is, pass out
                        from the sphere in which they are accustomed to moveit is not as if the bird
                        had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the haunts of
                        man. Annihilation is not the immediate result. People may do no more than
                        elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh sarcastically, lift up their
                        hands in protest. And yet so well defined is the sphere of social activity
                        that he who departs from it is doomed. Born and bred in this environment,
                            <pb id="VAA2406-246" n="239"/> the individual is practically unfitted
                        for any other state. He is like a bird accustomed to a certain density of
                        atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably at either higher or lower
                        level.</p>
                    <p>Lester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother had gone
                        and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city. Yonder was spread out
                        before him life with its concomitant phases of energy, hope, prosperity, and
                        pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a wind of misfortune and blown
                        aside for the time beinghis prospects and purposes dissipated. Could he
                        continue as cheerily in the paths he had hitherto pursued? Would not his
                        relations with Jennie be necessarily affected by this sudden tide of
                        opposition? Was not his own home now a thing of the past so far as his old
                        easy-going relationship was concerned? All the atmosphere of unstained
                        affection would be gone out of it now. That hearty look of approval which
                        used to dwell in his father&apos;s eyewould it be there any longer?
                        Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part of
                        his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of Louise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s unfortunate,&quot; was all that he thought to
                        himself, and therewith turned from what he considered senseless-brooding to
                        the consideration of what, if anything, was to be done.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m thinking I&apos;d take a run up to Mt. Clemens
                        tomorrow, or Thursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough,&quot; he said to
                        Jennie after he had returned. &quot;I&apos;m not feeling as well as
                        I might. A few days will do me good.&quot; He wanted to get off by
                        himself and think. Jennie packed his bag for him at the given time, and he
                        departed, but he was in a sullen, meditative mood.</p>
                    <p>During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all over, the
                        result of his cogitations being that there was no need of making a decisive
                        move at present. A few weeks more, one way or the other, could not make <pb
                            id="VAA2406-247" n="[240]"/> any practical difference. Neither Robert
                        nor any other member of the family was at all likely to seek another
                        conference with him. His business relations would necessarily go on as
                        usual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;
                        certainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted. But the consciousness
                        that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed upon him.
                        &quot;Bad business,&quot; he meditated&quot;bad
                        business.&quot; But he did not change.</p>
                    <p>For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs
                        continued. Lester did not go home for six months; then an important business
                        conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it off quite as
                        though nothing important had happened. His mother kissed him affectionately,
                        if a little sadly; his father gave him his customary greeting, a hearty
                        hand-shake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene, concertedly, though without any
                        verbal understanding, agreed to ignore the one real issue. But the feeling
                        of estrangement was there, and it persisted. Hereafter his visits to
                        Cincinnati were as few and far between as he could possibly make them.</p>

                    <p>IN the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her own. For
                        the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude, which had
                        afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought of her. She was
                        badshe knew that. She had yielded on two occasions to the force of
                        circumstances which might have been fought out differently. If only she had
                        had more courage! If she did not always have this haunting sense of fear! If
                        she could only make up her mind to do the right thing! Lester would never
                        marry her. Why should he? She loved him, but she could leave him, and it
                        would be better for him. Probably her father would live with her if she went
                        back to Cleveland. He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand. Yet
                        the thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to herhe had been so good.
                        As for her father, she was not sure whether he would receive her or not.</p>
                    <p>After the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a little money,
                        laying it aside as best she could from her allowance. Lester was generous
                        and she had been able to send home regularly fifteen dollars a week to
                        maintain the familyas much as they had lived on before, without any help
                        from the outside. She spent twenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester
                        required the best of everythingfruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what
                        not. The rent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.
                        Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone. She
                        thought how she might economize but this seemed wrong. <pb id="VAA2406-249"
                            n="242"/> Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the
                        thought that came to her. It was the only decent thing to do.</p>
                    <p>She thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise, trying to
                        nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act. Lester was
                        consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that he himself might
                        wish it. He was thoughtful, abstracted. Since the scene with Louise it
                        seemed to her that he had been a little different. If she could only say to
                        him that she was not satisfied with the way she was living, and then leave.
                        But he himself had plainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her
                        feelings on that score could not matter so very much to him, since he
                        thought the presence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever
                        marrying her. It was her presence he wanted on another basis. And he was so
                        forceful, she could not argue with him very well. She decided if she went it
                        would be best to write a letter and tell him why. Then maybe when he knew
                        how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing more about it.</p>
                    <p>The condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving. Since Jennie had left
                        Martha had married. After several years of teaching in the public schools of
                        Cleveland she had met a young architect, and they were united after a short
                        engagement. Martha had been always a little ashamed of her family, and now,
                        when this new life dawned, she was anxious to keep the connection as slight
                        as possible. She barely notified the members of the family of the
                        approaching marriageJennie not at alland to the actual ceremony she invited
                        only Bass and George. Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented the slight.
                        Gerhardt ventured upon no comment. He had had too many rebuffs. But Veronica
                        was angry. She hoped that life would give her an opportunity to pay her
                        sister off. William, of course, did not mind particularly. He was interested
                            <pb id="VAA2406-250" n="243"/> in the possibilities of becoming an
                        electrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had pointed
                        out to him as being attractive and promising.</p>
                    <p>Jennie heard of Martha&apos;s marriage after it was all over, a note from
                        Veronica giving her the main details. She was glad from one point of view,
                        but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away from her.</p>
                    <p>A little while after Martha&apos;s marriage Veronica and William went to
                        reside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of
                        Gerhardt himself. Ever since his wife&apos;s death and the departure of
                        the other children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from
                        which he was not easily aroused. Life, it seemed, was drawing to a close for
                        him, although he was only sixty-five years of age. The earthly ambitions he
                        had once cherished were gone forever. He saw Sebastian, Martha, and George
                        out in the world practically ignoring him, contributing nothing at all to a
                        home which should never have taken a dollar from Jennie. Veronica and
                        William were restless. They objected to leaving school and going to work,
                        apparently preferring to live on money which Gerhardt had long since
                        concluded was not being come by honestly. He was now pretty well satisfied
                        as to the true relations of Jennie and Lester. At first he had believed them
                        to be married, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the
                        humbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of telling him
                        about Vestasomehow it all pointed to the same thing. She had not been
                        married at home. Gerhardt had never had sight of her marriage certificate.
                        Since she was away she might have been married, but he did not believe it.</p>
                    <p>The real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and crotchety,
                        and it was becoming impossible for young people to live with him. Veronica
                        and William felt it. They resented the way in which he took charge of the
                        expenditures after Martha left. He accused <pb id="VAA2406-251" n="244"/>
                        them of spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a
                        smaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of the
                        money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess. As a
                        matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order to repay
                        Jennie eventually. He thought it was sinful to go on in this way, and this
                        was his one method, outside of his meager earnings, to redeem himself. If
                        his other children had acted rightly by him he felt that he would not now be
                        left in his old age the recipient of charity from one, who, despite her
                        other good qualities, was certainly not leading a righteous life. So they
                        quarreled.</p>
                    <p>It ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his complaining
                        brother and sister on condition that they should get something to do.
                        Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited them to take the furniture
                        and go their way. His generosity shamed them for the moment; they even
                        tentatively invited him to come and live with them, but this he would not
                        do. He would ask the foreman of the mill he watched for the privilege of
                        sleeping in some out-of-the-way garret. He was always liked and trusted. And
                        this would save him a little money.</p>
                    <p>So in a fit of pique he did this, and there was seen the spectacle of an old
                        man watching through a dreary season of nights, in a lonely trafficless
                        neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere. He had a wee small
                        corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from the tear and grind of
                        the factory proper. Here Gerhardt slept by day. In the afternoon he would
                        take a little walk, strolling toward the business center, or out along the
                        banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake. As a rule his hands were below his back,
                        his brow bent in meditation. He would even talk to himself a littlean
                        occasional &quot;By chops!&quot; or &quot;So it is&quot;
                        being indicative of his dreary mood. At dusk he would return, taking his <pb
                            id="VAA2406-252" n="245"/> stand at the lonely gate which was his post
                        of duty. His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen&apos;s
                        boarding-house, such as he felt he must have.</p>
                    <p>The nature of the old German&apos;s reflections at this time were of a
                        peculiarly subtle and somber character. What was this thinglife? What did it
                        all come to after the struggle, and the worry, and the grieving? Where does
                        it all go to? People die; you hear nothing more from them. His wife, now,
                        she had gone. Where had her spirit taken its flight?</p>
                    <p>Yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions. He believed
                        there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there. How about Mrs.
                        Gerhardt? How about Jennie? He believed that both had sinned woefully. He
                        believed that the just would be rewarded in heaven. But who were the just?
                        Mrs. Gerhardt had not had a bad heart. Jennie was the soul of generosity.
                        Take his son Sebastian. Sebastian was a good boy, but he was cold, and
                        certainly indifferent to his father. Take Marthashe was ambitious, but
                        obviously selfish. Somehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed
                        self-centered. Bass walked off when he got married, and did nothing more for
                        anybody. Martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on. George had
                        contributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.
                        Veronica and William had been content to live on Jennie&apos;s money so
                        long as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right. His very
                        existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his children? And
                        he was getting so old. He shook his head. Mystery of mysteries. Life was
                        truly strange, and dark, and uncertain. Still he did not want to go and live
                        with any of his children. Actually they were not worthy of himnone but
                        Jennie, and she was not good. So he grieved.</p>
                    <p>This woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for some time.
                        She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her leaving, Jennie had
                        been <pb id="VAA2406-253" n="[246]"/> writing directly to Gerhardt. After
                        Veronica&apos;s departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was
                        no need of sending any more money. Veronica and William were going to live
                        with George. He himself had a good place in a factory, and would live there
                        a little while. He returned her a moderate sum that he had savedone hundred
                        and fifteen dollarswith the word that he would not need it.</p>
                    <p>Jennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was not sure
                        but what it might be all righther father was so determined. But by degrees,
                        however, a sense of what it really must mean overtook hera sense of
                        something wrong, and she worried, hesitating between leaving Lester and
                        going to see about her father, whether she left him or not. Would he come
                        with her? Not here certainly. If she were married, yes, possibly. If she
                        were aloneprobably. Yet if she did not get some work which paid well they
                        would have a difficult time. It was the same old problem. What could she do?
                        Nevertheless, she decided to act. If she could get five or six dollars a
                        week they could live. This hundred and fifteen dollars which Gerhardt had
                        saved would tide them over the worst difficulties perhaps.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXXVI</head>
                    <p>THE trouble with Jennie&apos;s plan was that it did not definitely take
                        into consideration Lester&apos;s attitude. He did care for her in an
                        elemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the conventional
                        world in which he had been reared. To say that he loved her well enough to
                        take her for better or worseto legalize her anomalous position and to face
                        the world bravely with the fact that he had chosen a wife who suited himwas
                        perhaps going a little too far, but he did really care for her, and he was
                        not in a mood, at this particular time, to contemplate parting with her for
                        good.</p>
                    <p>Lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of womanhood
                        were fixed and not subject to change. Thus far, on his own plane and within
                        the circle of his own associates, he had met no one who appealed to him as
                        did Jennie. She was gentle, intelligent, gracious, a handmaiden to his every
                        need; and he had taught her the little customs of polite society, until she
                        was as agreeable a companion as he cared to have. He was comfortable, he was
                        satisfiedwhy seek further?</p>
                    <p>But Jennie&apos;s restlessness increased day by day. She tried writing
                        out her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally worded
                        one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings. It was a long
                        letter for her, and it ran as follows: <text>
                            <body>
                                <div type="letter">
                                    <p>&quot;Lester dear,When you get this I won&apos;t be
                                        here, and I want you not to think harshly of me until you
                                        have read it all. I am taking Vesta and leaving, and I think
                                            <pb id="VAA2406-255" n="248"/> it is really better that
                                        I should. Lester, I ought to do it. You know when you met me
                                        we were very poor, and my condition was such that I
                                        didn&apos;t think any good man would ever want me. When
                                        you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly able to
                                        think just what I ought to do. You made me love you, Lester,
                                        in spite of myself.</p>
                                    <p>&quot;You know I told you that I oughtn&apos;t to do
                                        anything wrong any more and that I wasn&apos;t good, but
                                        somehow when you were near me I couldn&apos;t think just
                                        right, and I didn&apos;t see just how I was to get away
                                        from you. Papa was sick at home that time, and there was
                                        hardly anything in the house to eat. We were all doing so
                                        poorly. My brother George didn&apos;t have good shoes,
                                        and mamma was so worried. I have often thought, Lester, if
                                        mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she might be
                                        alive to-day. I thought if you liked me and I really liked
                                        youI love you, Lester-maybe it wouldn&apos;t make so
                                        much difference about me. You know you told me right away
                                        you would like to help my family, and I felt that maybe that
                                        would be the right thing to do. We were so terribly poor.</p>
                                    <p>&quot;Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way;
                                        it seems so mean, but if you knew how I have been feeling
                                        these days you would forgive me. Oh, I love you, Lester, I
                                        do, I do. But for months pastever since your sister cameI
                                        felt that I was doing wrong, and that I oughtn&apos;t to
                                        go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is. It was
                                        wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator
                                        Brander, but I was such a girl thenI hardly knew what I was
                                        doing. It was wrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I
                                        first met you, though I thought I was doing right when I did
                                        it. It was terribly wrong of me to keep her here all that
                                        time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of you thenafraid
                                        of what you would say and do. When your sister Louise came
                                        it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never been
                                            <pb id="VAA2406-256" n="249"/> able to think right about
                                        it since. It can&apos;t be right, Lester, but I
                                        don&apos;t blame you. I blame myself.</p>
                                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t ask you to marry me, Lester. I
                                        know how you feel about me and how you feel about your
                                        family, and I don&apos;t think it would be right. They
                                        would never want you to do it, and it isn&apos;t right
                                        that I should ask you. At the same time I know I
                                        oughtn&apos;t to go on living this way. Vesta is getting
                                        along where she understands everything. She thinks you are
                                        her really truly uncle. I have thought of it all so much. I
                                        have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to
                                        you about it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and
                                        I don&apos;t seem to be able to say what I want to. So I
                                        thought if I could just write you this and then go you would
                                        understand. You do, Lester, don&apos;t you? You
                                        won&apos;t be angry with me? I know it&apos;s for
                                        the best for you and for me. I ought to do it. Please
                                        forgive me, Lester, please; and don&apos;t think of me
                                        any more. I will get along. But I love youoh yes, I doand I
                                        will never be grateful enough for all you have done for me.
                                        I wish you all the luck that can come to you. Please forgive
                                        me. Lester. I love you, yes, I do. I love you.</p>

                    <p>&quot;P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa. He needs me. He is all
                        alone. But don&apos;t come for me, Lester. It&apos;s best that you
                        shouldn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in her bosom,
                        for the time being, awaited the hour when she could conveniently take her
                        departure.</p>
                    <p>It was several days before she could bring herself to the actual execution of
                        the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned that he would not be
                        home for a day or two, she packed some necessary garments for herself and
                        Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an expressman. She thought of
                        telegraphing her father <pb id="VAA2406-257" n="250"/> that she was coming;
                        but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as well to go and
                        find him. George and Veronica had not taken all the furniture. The major
                        portion of it was in storageso Gerhardt had written. She might take that and
                        furnish a little home or flat. She was ready for the end, waiting for the
                        expressman, when the door opened and in walked Lester.</p>
                    <p>For some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind. He was not in the least
                        psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings had served him a
                        peculiar turn. He had thought of going for a day&apos;s duck-shooting
                        with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of Chicago, but had finally
                        changed his mind; he even decided to go out to the house early. What
                        prompted this he could not have said.</p>
                    <p>As he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home so early;
                        then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle of the room he
                        stood dumfounded. What did it meanJennie dressed and ready to depart? And
                        Vesta in a similar condition? He stared in amazement, his brown eyes keen in
                        inquiry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whywhy&quot; she began, falling back. &quot;I was going
                        away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I would go to Cleveland,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;WhywhyI meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn&apos;t think I
                        ought to stay here any longer this way. I didn&apos;t think it was
                        right. I thought I&apos;d tell you, but I couldn&apos;t. I wrote you
                        a letter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A letter,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;What the deuce are you
                        talking about? Where is the letter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There,&quot; she said, mechanically pointing to a small
                        center-table where the letter lay conspicuous on a large book.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-258" n="251"/>
                    <p>&quot;And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a
                        letter?&quot; said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke.
                        &quot;I swear to heaven you are beyond me. What&apos;s the
                        point?&quot; He tore open the envelope and looked at the beginning.
                        &quot;Better send Vesta from the room,&quot; he suggested.</p>
                    <p>She obeyed. Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed, looking at
                        the wall, at the trunks, and at him. Lester read the letter thoughtfully. He
                        shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the paper on the floor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll tell you, Jennie,&quot; he said finally,
                        looking at her curiously and wondering just what he was going to say. Here
                        again was his chance to end this relationship if he wished. He
                        couldn&apos;t feel that he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things
                        were running. They had gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit
                        now. He truly loved herthere was no doubt of that. Still he did not want to
                        marry hercould not very well. She knew that. Her letter said as much.
                        &quot;You have this thing wrong,&quot; he went on slowly.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t know what comes over you at times, but you
                        don&apos;t view the situation right. I&apos;ve told you before that
                        I can&apos;t marry younot now, anyhow. There are too many big things
                        involved in this, which you don&apos;t know anything about. I love you,
                        you know that. But my family has to be taken into consideration, and the
                        business. You can&apos;t see the difficulties raised on these scores,
                        but I can. Now I don&apos;t want you to leave me. I care too much about
                        you. I can&apos;t prevent you, of course. You can go if you want to. But
                        I don&apos;t think you ought to want to. You don&apos;t really, do
                        you? Sit down a minute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen, was now
                        thoroughly nonplussed. To have him begin a quiet argumenta plea as it were.
                        It hurt her. He, Lester, pleading with her, and she loved him so.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-259" n="252"/>
                    <p>She went over to him, and he took her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, listen,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s really
                        nothing to be gained by your leaving me at present. Where did you say you
                        were going?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To Cleveland,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, how did you expect to get along?&quot; &quot;I
                        thought I&apos;d take papa, if he&apos;d come with mehe&apos;s
                        alone nowand get something to do, maybe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have
                        done? You wouldn&apos;t expect to be a lady&apos;s maid again, would
                        you? Or clerk in a store?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper,&quot; she
                        suggested. She had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most
                        promising idea that had occurred to her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; he grumbled, shaking his head.
                        &quot;There&apos;s nothing to that. There&apos;s nothing in this
                        whole move of yours except a notion. Why, you won&apos;t be any better
                        off morally than you are right now. You can&apos;t undo the past. It
                        doesn&apos;t make any difference, anyhow. I can&apos;t marry you
                        now. I might in the future, but I can&apos;t tell anything about that,
                        and I don&apos;t want to promise anything. You&apos;re not going to
                        leave me though with my consent, and if you were going I wouldn&apos;t
                        have you dropping back into any such thing as you&apos;re contemplating.
                        I&apos;ll make some provision for you. You don&apos;t really want to
                        leave me, do you, Jennie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Against Lester&apos;s strong personality and vigorous protest
                        Jennie&apos;s own conclusions and decisions went to pieces. Just the
                        pressure of his hand was enough to upset her. Now she began to cry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t cry, Jennie,&quot; he said. &quot;This thing
                        may work out better than you think. Let it rest for a while. Take off your
                        things. You&apos;re not going to leave me any more, are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No-o-o!&quot; she sobbed.</p>
                    <p>He took her in his lap. &quot;Let things rest as they <pb
                            id="VAA2406-260" n="253"/> are,&quot; he went on.
                        &quot;It&apos;s a curious world. Things can&apos;t be adjusted
                        in a minute. They may work out. I&apos;m putting up with some things
                        myself that I ordinarily wouldn&apos;t stand for.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly through
                        her tears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now you put those things away,&quot; he said genially, pointing
                        to the trunks. &quot;Besides, I want you to promise me one
                        thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; asked Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No more concealment of anything, do you hear? No more thinking
                        things out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about it. If
                        you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it. I&apos;m
                        not going to eat you! Talk to me about whatever is troubling you.
                        I&apos;ll help you solve it, or, if I can&apos;t, at least there
                        won&apos;t be any concealment between us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know, Lester,&quot; she said earnestly, looking him straight
                        in the eyes. &quot;I promise I&apos;ll never conceal anything any
                        moretruly I won&apos;t. I&apos;ve been afraid, but I won&apos;t
                        be now. You can trust me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That sounds like what you ought to be,&quot; he replied.
                        &quot;I know you will.&quot; And he let her go.</p>
                    <p>A few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future of
                        Gerhardt came up for discussion. Jennie had been worrying about him for
                        several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to talk over
                        with Lester. Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner what had
                        happened in Cleveland. &quot;I know he is very unhappy there all
                        alone,&quot; she said, &quot;and I hate to think of it. I was going
                        to get him if I went back to Cleveland. Now I don&apos;t know what to do
                        about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you send him some money?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He won&apos;t take any more money from me, Lester,&quot;
                        she explained. &quot;He thinks I&apos;m not goodnot acting right. He
                        doesn&apos;t believe I&apos;m married.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-261" n="254"/>
                    <p>&quot;He has pretty good reason, hasn&apos;t he?&quot; said
                        Lester calmly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory. He&apos;s so old
                        and lonely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with the rest of the family in
                        Cleveland? Won&apos;t they do anything for him? Where&apos;s your
                        brother Bass?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think maybe they don&apos;t want him, he&apos;s so
                        cross,&quot; she said simply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hardly know what to suggest in that case,&quot; smiled
                        Lester. &quot;The old gentleman oughtn&apos;t to be so
                        fussy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; she said, &quot;but he&apos;s old now,
                        and he has had so much trouble.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        tell you what I&apos;ve been thinking, Jennie,&quot; he said
                        finally. &quot;There&apos;s no use living this way any longer, if
                        we&apos;re going to stick it out. I&apos;ve been thinking that we
                        might take a house out in Hyde Park. It&apos;s something of a run from
                        the office, but I&apos;m not much for this apartment life. You and Vesta
                        would be better off for a yard. In that case you might bring your father on
                        to live with us. He couldn&apos;t do any harm pottering about; indeed,
                        he might help keep things straight.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that would just suit papa, if he&apos;d come,&quot; she
                        replied. &quot;He loves to fix things, and he&apos;d cut the grass
                        and look after the furnace. But he won&apos;t come unless he&apos;s
                        sure I&apos;m married.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know how that could be arranged unless you could
                        show the old gentleman a marriage certificate. He seems to want something
                        that can&apos;t be produced very well. A steady job he&apos;d have
                        running the furnace of a country house,&quot; he added meditatively.</p>
                    <p>Jennie did not notice the grimness of the jest. She was too busy thinking
                        what a tangle she had made of her life. Gerhardt would not come now, even if
                        they had a lovely home to share with him. And yet he ought to be with Vesta
                        again. She would make him happy.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-262" n="[255]"/>
                    <p>She remained lost in a sad abstraction, until Lester, following the drift of
                        her thoughts, said: &quot;I don&apos;t see how it can be arranged.
                        Marriage certificate blanks aren&apos;t easily procurable. It&apos;s
                        bad businessa criminal offense to forge one, I believe. I wouldn&apos;t
                        want to be mixed up in that sort of thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t want you to do anything like that, Lester.
                        I&apos;m just sorry papa is so stubborn. When he gets a notion you
                        can&apos;t change him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suppose we wait until we get settled after moving,&quot; he
                        suggested. &quot;Then you can go to Cleveland and talk to him
                        personally. You might be able to persuade him.&quot; He liked her
                        attitude toward her father. It was so decent that he rather wished he could
                        help her carry out her scheme. While not very interesting, Gerhardt was not
                        objectionable to Lester, and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around
                        a big place, why not?</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXXVII</head>
                    <p>THE plan for a residence in Hyde Park was not long in taking shape. After
                        several weeks had passed, and things had quieted down again, Lester invited
                        Jennie to go with him to South Hyde Park to look for a house. On the first
                        trip they found something which seemed to suit admirablyan old-time home of
                        eleven large rooms, set in a lawn fully two hundred feet square and shaded
                        by trees which had been planted when the city was young. It was ornate,
                        homelike, peaceful. Jennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country,
                        although depressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home
                        under the right auspices. She had vaguely hoped that in planning to go away
                        she was bringing about a condition under which Lester might have come after
                        her and married her. Now all that was over. She had promised to stay, and
                        she would have to make the best of it. She suggested that they would never
                        know what to do with so much room, but he waved that aside. &quot;We
                        will very likely have people in now and then,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;We can furnish it up anyhow, and see how it looks.&quot; He
                        had the agent make out a five-year lease, with an option for renewal, and
                        set at once the forces to work to put the establishment in order.</p>
                    <p>The house was painted and decorated, the lawn put in order, and everything
                        done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance. There was a
                        large, comfortable library and sitting-room, a big dining-room, a handsome
                        reception-hall, a parlor, a large kitchen, serving-room, and in fact, all
                        the ground-floor essentials of a comfortable <pb id="VAA2406-264" n="257"/>
                        home. On the second floor were bedrooms, baths, and the maid&apos;s
                        room. It was all very comfortable and harmonious, and Jennie took an immense
                        pride and pleasure in getting things in order.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after moving in, Jennie, with Lester&apos;s permission, wrote
                        to her father asking him to come to her. She did not say that she was
                        married, but left it to be inferred. She descanted on the beauty of the
                        neighborhood, the size of the yard, and the manifold conveniences of the
                        establishment. &quot;It is so very nice,&quot; she added,
                        &quot;you would like it, papa. Vesta is here and goes to school every
                        day. Won&apos;t you come and stay with us? It&apos;s so much better
                        than living in a factory. And I would like to have you so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance. Was it really true?
                        Would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently united?
                        After all these years and all this lying? Could he have been mistaken? Well,
                        it was high timebut should he go? He had lived alone this long time
                        nowshould he go to Chicago and live with Jennie? Her appeal did touch him,
                        but somehow he decided against it. That would be too generous an
                        acknowledgment of the fact that there had been fault on his side as well as
                        on hers.</p>
                    <p>Jennie was disappointed at Gerhardt&apos;s refusal. She talked it over
                        with Lester, and decided that she would go on to Cleveland and see him.
                        Accordingly, she made the trip, hunted up the factory, a great rumbling
                        furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city, and inquired
                        at the office for her father. The clerk directed her to a distant warehouse,
                        and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see him. He crawled out of
                        his humble cot and came down, curious as to who it could be. When Jennie saw
                        him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair gray, his eye brows shaggy, coming
                        out of the dark door, a keen sense of the pathetic moved her again.
                        &quot;Poor papa!&quot; she thought. He came toward her, his <pb
                            id="VAA2406-265" n="[258]"/> inquisitorial eye softened a little by his
                        consciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit. &quot;What
                        are you come for?&quot; he asked cautiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to come home with me, papa,&quot; she pleaded
                        yearningly. &quot;I don&apos;t want you to stay here any more. I
                        can&apos;t think of you living alone any longer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So,&quot; he said, nonplussed, &quot;that brings
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied; &quot;Won&apos;t you?
                        Don&apos;t stay here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have a good bed,&quot; he explained by way of apology for his
                        state.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; she replied, &quot;but we have a good home
                        now and Vesta is there. Won&apos;t you come? Lester wants you
                        to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me one thing,&quot; he demanded. &quot;Are you
                        married?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, lying hopelessly. &quot;I have been
                        married a long time. You can ask Lester when you come.&quot; She could
                        scarcely look him in the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;it is time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you come, papa?&quot; she pleaded.</p>
                    <p>He threw out his hands after his characteristic manner. The urgency of her
                        appeal touched him to the quick. &quot;Yes, I come,&quot; he said,
                        and turned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening. He was crying.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, papa?&quot; she pleaded.</p>
                    <p>For answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his things.</p>

                    <p>GERHARDT, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once bestirred
                        himself about the labors which he felt instinctively concerned him. He took
                        charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at the thought that good money
                        should be paid to any outsider when he had nothing to do. The trees, he
                        declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful condition. If Lester would get him a
                        pruning knife and a saw he would attend to them in the spring. In Germany
                        they knew how to care for such things, but these Americans were so
                        shiftless. Then he wanted tools and nails, and in time all the closets and
                        shelves were put in order. He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away,
                        and declared that it was better than the one in Cleveland. The pastor, of
                        course, was a heaven-sent son of divinity. And nothing would do but that
                        Vesta must go to church with him regularly.</p>
                    <p>Jennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with some
                        misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise. On the North Side it
                        had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing. Now they were
                        occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate neighbors would feel
                        it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to play the part of an
                        experienced hostess. She and Lester had talked this situation over. It might
                        as well be understood here, he said, that they were husband and wife. Vesta
                        was to be introduced as <unclear>-ie&apos;s</unclear> daughter by her
                        first marriage, her husband, a <unclear>-Stover</unclear> (her
                        mother&apos;s maiden name), having died <pb id="VAA2406-267" n="260"/>
                        immediately after the child&apos;s birth. Lester, of course, was the
                        stepfather. This particular neighborhood was so far from the fashionable
                        heart of Chicago that Lester did not expect to run into many of his friends.
                        He explained to Jennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so
                        that when the first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.
                        Within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs. Jacob
                        Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular section. She
                        lived five doors from Jenniethe houses of the neighborhood were all set in
                        spacious lawnsand drove up in her carriage, on her return from her shopping,
                        one afternoon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Mrs. Kane in?&quot; she asked of Jeannette, the new maid.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think so, mam,&quot; answered the girl.
                        &quot;Won&apos;t you let me have your card?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it curiously.</p>
                    <p>When Jennie came into the parlor Mrs. Stendahl, a tall dark,
                        inquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you,&quot;
                        she said most winningly. &quot;I am one of your neighbors. I live on the
                        other side of the street, some few doors up. Perhaps you have seen the
                        housethe one with the white stone gate-posts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes indeed,&quot; replied Jennie. &quot;I know it well.
                        Mr. Kane and I were admiring it the first day we came out here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know of your husband, of course, by reputation. My husband is
                        connected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie bowed her head. She knew that the latter concern must be something
                        important and profitable from the way in which Mrs. Stendahl spoke of it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We have lived here quite a number of years, <pb id="VAA2406-268"
                            n="261"/> know how you must feel coming as a total stranger to a new
                        section of the city. I hope you will find time to come in and see me some
                        afternoon. I shall be most pleased. My regular reception day is
                        Thursday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I shall,&quot; answered Jennie, a little nervously, for
                        the ordeal was a trying one. &quot;I appreciate your goodness in
                        calling. Mr. Kane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure
                        he would be most pleased to meet you and your husband.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must both come over some evening,&quot; replied Mrs.
                        Stendahl. &quot;We lead a very quiet life. My husband is not much for
                        social gatherings. But we enjoy our neighborhood friends.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie smiled her assurances of good-will. She accompanied Mrs. Stendahl to
                        the door, and shook hands with her. &quot;I&apos;m so glad to find
                        you so charming,&quot; observed Mrs. Stendahl frankly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; said Jennie flushing a little.
                        &quot;I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t deserve so much
                        praise.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now I will expect you some afternoon. Goodby,&quot; and
                        she waved a gracious farewell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That wasn&apos;t so bad,&quot; thought Jennie as she
                        watched Mrs. Stendahl drive away. &quot;She is very nice, I think.
                        I&apos;ll tell Lester about her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Among the other callers were a Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael Burke, a Mrs. Hanson
                        Field, and a Mrs. Timothy Ballingerall of whom left cards, or stayed to chat
                        a few minutes. Jennie found herself taken quite seriously as a woman of
                        importance, and she did her best to support the dignity of her position.
                        And, indeed, she did exceptionally well. She was most hospitable and
                        gracious. She had a kindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded
                        in making a most favorable impression. She explained to her guests that she
                        had been living on the North Side until recently, that <hi rend="i">her
                            husband,</hi> Mr. Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park,
                        that her father and daughter were living here, and that Lester <pb
                            id="VAA2406-269" n="262"/> was the child&apos;s stepfather. She said
                        she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and to be a good neighbor.</p>
                    <p>Lester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care to meet
                        these people. Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way. She liked making new
                        friends, and she was hoping that something definite could be worked out here
                        which would make Lester look upon her as a good wife and an ideal companion.
                        Perhaps, some day, he might really want to marry her.</p>
                    <p>First impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to discover.
                        The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too hastily, and now
                        rumors began to fly about. A Mrs. Sommerville, calling on Mrs. Craig, one of
                        Jennie&apos;s near neighbors, intimated that she knew who Lester
                        was&quot;oh, yes, indeed. You know, my dear,&quot; she went on,
                        &quot;his reputation is just a little&quot; she raised her eyebrows
                        and her hand at the same time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t say!&quot; commented her friend curiously.
                        &quot;He looks like such a staid, conservative person.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is,&quot; went on Mrs. Sommerville.
                        &quot;His family is of the very best. There was some young woman he went
                        withso my husband tells me. I don&apos;t know whether this is the one or
                        not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such name as that,
                        when they were living together as husband and wife on the North
                        Side.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tst! Tst! Tst!&quot; clicked Mrs. Craig with her tongue at this
                        astonishing news. &quot;You don&apos;t tell me! Come to think of it,
                        it must be the same woman. Her father&apos;s name is Gerhardt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gerhardt!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Sommerville. &quot;Yes,
                        that&apos;s the name. It seems to me that there was some earlier scandal
                        in connection with herat least there was a child. Whether he married her
                        afterward or not, I don&apos;t know. Anyhow, I understand his family
                        will not have anything to do with her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How very interesting!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Craig. &quot;And
                            <pb id="VAA2406-270" n="263"/> to think he should have married her
                        afterward, if he really did. I&apos;m sure you can&apos;t tell with
                        whom you&apos;re coming in contact these days, can you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s so true. Life does get badly mixed at times. She
                        appears to be a charming woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Delightful!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Craig. &quot;Quite nave. I
                        was really taken with her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it may be,&quot; went on her guest, &quot;that this
                        isn&apos;t the same woman after all. I may be mistaken.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I hardly think so. Gerhardt! She told me they had been living
                        on the North Side.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I&apos;m sure it&apos;s the same person. How curious
                        that you should speak of her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is, indeed,&quot; went on Mrs. Craig, who was speculating as
                        to what her attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.</p>
                    <p>Other rumors came from other sources. There were people who had seen Jennie
                        and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been introduced to her as
                        Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family thought. Of course her present
                        position, the handsome house, the wealth of Lester, the beauty of Vestaall
                        these things helped to soften the situation. She was apparently too
                        circumspect, too much the good wife and mother, too really nice to be angry
                        with; but she had a past, and that had to be taken into consideration.</p>
                    <p>An opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when Vesta,
                        returning from school, suddenly asked: &quot;Mamma, who was my
                        papa?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;His name was Stover, dear,&quot; replied her mother, struck at
                        once by the thought that there might have been some criticismthat some one
                        must have been saying something. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where was I born?&quot; continued Vesta, ignoring the last
                        inquiry, and interested in clearing up her own identity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In Columbus, Ohio, pet. Why?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-271" n="264"/>
                    <p>&quot;Anita Ballinger said I didn&apos;t have any papa, and that you
                        weren&apos;t ever married when you had me. She said I wasn&apos;t a
                        really, truly girl at alljust a nobody. She made me so mad I slapped
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie&apos;s face grew rigid. She sat staring straight before her. Mrs.
                        Ballinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious and
                        helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter had said
                        this to Vesta. Where did the child hear it?</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t pay any attention to her, dearie,&quot;
                        said Jennie at last. &quot;She doesn&apos;t know. Your papa was Mr.
                        Stover, and you were born in Columbus. You mustn&apos;t fight other
                        little girls. Of course they say nasty things when they fightsometimes
                        things they don&apos;t really mean. Just let her alone and
                        don&apos;t go near her any more. Then she won&apos;t say anything to
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time being.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll slap her if she tries to slap me,&quot; she
                        persisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t go near her, pet, do you hear? Then she
                        can&apos;t try to slap you,&quot; returned her mother.
                        &quot;Just go about your studies, and don&apos;t mind her. She
                        can&apos;t quarrel with you if you don&apos;t let her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Vesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words. The neighbors were
                        talking. Her history was becoming common gossip. How had they found out.</p>
                    <p>It is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound opened
                        from time to time by additional stabs. One day Jennie, having gone to call
                        on Mrs. Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met a Mrs. Williston
                        Baker, who was there taking tea. Mrs. Baker knew of the Kanes, of
                        Jennie&apos;s history on the North Side, and of the attitude of the Kane
                        family. She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman, somewhat on the order
                        of Mrs. Bracebridge, and very careful of her social connections. She had
                        always considered Mrs. Field a woman of the same rigid circumspectness of
                        attitude, <pb id="VAA2406-272" n="265"/> and when she found Jennie calling
                        there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated. &quot;This is Mrs.
                        Kane, Mrs. Baker,&quot; said Mrs. Field, introducing her guests with a
                        smiling countenance. Mrs. Baker looked at Jennie ominously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mrs. Lester Kane?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Mrs. Fields.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; she went on freezingly. &quot;I&apos;ve
                        heard a great deal about Mrs.&quot; accenting the word&quot;Mrs.
                        Lester Kane.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned to Mrs. Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started an intimate
                        conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share. Jennie stood
                        helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would be suitable to so
                        trying a situation. Mrs. Baker soon announced her departure, although she
                        had intended to stay longer. &quot;I can&apos;t remain another
                        minute,&quot; she said; &quot;I promised Mrs. Neil that I would stop
                        in to see her today. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve bored you enough
                        already as it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she was nearly
                        out of the room. Then she looked in her direction, and gave her a frigid
                        nod.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We meet such curious people now and again,&quot; she observed
                        finally to her hostess as she swept away.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was in no
                        notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other middle-class
                        woman of means, to get along. She did not care to offend Mrs. Williston
                        Baker, who was socially so much more important than Jennie. She came back to
                        where Jennie was sitting, smiling apologetically, but she was a little bit
                        flustered. Jennie was out of countenance, of course. Presently she excused
                        herself and went home. She had been cut deeply by the slight offered her,
                        and she felt that Mrs. Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever
                        taking her up. There would be no additional exchange of visits therethat she
                        knew. The old hopeless feeling came <pb id="VAA2406-273" n="266"/> over her
                        that her life was a failure. It couldn&apos;t be made right, or, if it
                        could, it wouldn&apos;t be. Lester was not inclined to marry her and put
                        her right.</p>
                    <p>Time went on and matters remained very much as they were. To look at this
                        large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its vines clambering
                        about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing themselves into a
                        tranpsarent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering about the yard, Vesta
                        coming home from school, Lester leaving in the morning in his smart trapone
                        would have said that here is peace and plenty, no shadow of unhappiness
                        hangs over this charming home.</p>
                    <p>And as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run smoothly. It
                        is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only a very few of
                        them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the deprivation was
                        hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to please and interest.
                        Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play quite well. She had a good
                        ear for music. Jennie was a charming figure in blue, lavender, and
                        olive-green house-gowns as she went about her affairs, sewing, dusting,
                        getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that things generally were put to
                        rights. Gerhardt busied himself about his multitudinous duties, for he was
                        not satisfied unless he had his hands into all the domestic economies of the
                        household. One of his self-imposed tasks was to go about the house after
                        Lester, or the servants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs
                        which might accidentally have been left burning. That was a sinful
                        extravagance.</p>
                    <p>Again, Lester&apos;s expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside
                        after a few month&apos;s use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old
                        German. Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of a few
                        wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole. Gerhardt was
                        for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old man&apos;s
                        querulous inquiry as to what was wrong &quot;with <pb id="VAA2406-274"
                            n="267"/> them shoes&quot; by saying that they weren&apos;t
                        comfortable any more.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Such extravagance!&quot; Gerhardt complained to Jennie.
                        &quot;Such waste! No good can come of anything like that. It will mean
                        want one of these days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He can&apos;t help it, papa,&quot; Jennie excused.
                        &quot;That&apos;s the way he was raised.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ha! A fine way to be raised. These Americans, they know nothing of
                        economy. They ought to live in Germany awhile. Then they would know what a
                        dollar can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled. Gerhardt
                        was amusing to him.</p>
                    <p>Another grievance was Lester&apos;s extravagant use of matches. He had
                        the habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of
                        lighting his cigar, and then throwing it away. Sometimes he would begin to
                        light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually do so, tossing
                        aside match after match. There was a place out in one corner of the veranda
                        where he liked to sit of a spring or summer evening, smoking and throwing
                        away half-burned matches. Jennie would sit with him, and a vast number of
                        matches would be lit and flung out on the lawn. At one time, while engaged
                        in cutting the grass, Gerhardt found, to his horror, not a handful, but
                        literally boxes of half-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying
                        under the fallen blades. He was discouraged, to say the least. He gathered
                        up this damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the
                        sitting-room where Jennie was sewing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See here, what I find!&quot; he demanded. &quot;Just look
                        at that! That man, he has no more sense of economy than athan a&quot;
                        the right term failed him. &quot;He sits and smokes, and this is the way
                        he uses matches. Five cents a box they costfive cents. How can a man hope to
                        do well and carry on like that, I like to know. Look at them.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-275" n="268"/>
                    <p>Jennie looked. She shook her head. &quot; Lester is
                        extravagant,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt carried them to the basement. At least they should be burned in the
                        furnace. He would have used them as lighters for his own pipe, sticking them
                        in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers were better, and he had
                        stacks of theseanother evidence of his lord and master&apos;s wretched,
                        spendthrift disposition. It was a sad world to work in. Almost everything
                        was against him. Still he fought as valiantly as he could against waste and
                        shameless extravagance. His own economies were rigid. He would wear the same
                        suit of blackcut down from one of Lester&apos;s expensive investments of
                        years beforeevery Sunday for a couple of years. Lester&apos;s shoes, by
                        a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit, and these
                        he wore. His old ties alsothe black onesthey were fine. If he could have cut
                        down Lester&apos;s shirts he would have done so; he did make over the
                        underwear, with the friendly aid of the cook&apos;s needle.
                        Lester&apos;s socks, of course, were just right. There was never any
                        expense for Gerhardt&apos;s clothing.</p>
                    <p>The remaining stock of Lester&apos;s discarded clothingshoes, shirts,
                        collars, suits, ties, and what nothe would store away for weeks and months,
                        and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he would call in a tailor, or
                        an oldshoe man, or a ragman, and dispose of the lot at the best price he
                        could. He learned that all second-hand clothes men were sharks; that there
                        was no use in putting the least faith in the protests of any rag dealer or
                        old-shoe man. They all lied. They all claimed to be very poor, when as a
                        matter of fact they were actually rolling in wealth. Gerhardt had
                        investigated these stories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they
                        were doing with the things he sold them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Scoundrels!&quot; he declared. &quot;They offer me ten
                        cents for a pair of shoes, and then I see them hanging out in <pb
                            id="VAA2406-276" n="269"/> front of their places marked two dollars.
                        Such robbery! My God! They could afford to give me a dollar.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie smiled. It was only to her that he complained, for he could expect no
                        sympathy from Lester. So far as his own meager store of money was concerned,
                        he gave the most of it to his beloved church, where he was considered to be
                        a model of propriety, honesty, faithin fact, the embodiment of all the
                        virtues.</p>
                    <p>And so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially, Jennie
                        was now leading the dream years of her existence. Lester, in spite of the
                        doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of his career, was
                        invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to enjoy his home life.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everything all right?&quot; she would ask when he came in of an
                        evening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure!&quot; he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.</p>
                    <p>She would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take his coat
                        and hat. In the winter-time they would sit in the library before the big
                        grate-fire. In the spring, summer, or fall Lester preferred to walk out on
                        the porch, one corner of which commanded a sweeping view of the lawn and the
                        distant street, and light his before-dinner cigar. Jennie would sit on the
                        side of his chair and stroke his head. &quot;Your hair is not getting
                        the least bit thin, Lester; aren&apos;t you glad?&quot; she would
                        say; or, &quot;Oh, see how your brow is wrinkled now. You
                        mustn&apos;t do that. You didn&apos;t change your tie mister, this
                        morning. Why didn&apos;t you? I laid one out for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I forgot,&quot; he would answer, or he would cause the
                        wrinkles to disappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting
                        bald if he wasn&apos;t so now.</p>
                    <p>In the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was not less
                        loving, though a little more circumspect. She loved odd puzzles like pigs in
                        clover, the spider&apos;s hole, baby billiards, and the like. Lester
                        shared in these simple amusements. He would work by <pb id="VAA2406-277"
                            n="270"/> the hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right.
                        Jennie was clever at solving these mechanical problems. Sometimes she would
                        have to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely pleased
                        with herself. At other times she would stand behind him watching, her chin
                        on his shoulder, her arms about his neck. He seemed not to mindindeed, he
                        was happy in the wealth of affection she bestowed. Her cleverness, her
                        gentleness, her tact created an atmosphere which was immensely pleasing;
                        above all her youth and beauty appealed to him. It made him feel young, and
                        if there was one thing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up
                        into an aimless old age. &quot;I want to keep young, or die
                        young,&quot; was one of his pet remarks; and Jennie came to understand.
                        She was glad that she was so much younger now for his sake.</p>
                    <p>Another pleasant feature of the home life was Lester&apos;s steadily
                        increasing affection for Vesta. The child would sit at the big table in the
                        library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would sew, and
                        Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran papers. It
                        grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go to a German
                        Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to nothing of the sort.
                        &quot;We&apos;ll not have any thick-headed German training in
                        this,&quot; he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had
                        complained. &quot;The public schools are good enough for any child. You
                        tell him to let her alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There were really some delightful hours among the four. Lester liked to take
                        the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees and tease her. He
                        liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to propound its paradoxes, and
                        watch how the child&apos;s budding mind took them.
                        &quot;What&apos;s water?&quot; he would ask; and being informed
                        that it was &quot;what we drink,&quot; he would stare and say,
                        &quot;That&apos;s so, but what is it? Don&apos;t they teach you
                        any better than that?&quot; <pb id="VAA2406-278" n="271"/>
                        &quot;Well, it is what we drink, isn&apos;t it?&quot; persisted
                        Vesta.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The fact that we drink it doesn&apos;t explain what it
                        is,&quot; he would retort. &quot;You ask your teacher what water
                        is&quot;; and then he would leave her with this irritating problem
                        troubling her young soul.</p>
                    <p>Food, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its chemical
                        constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these dark suggestions
                        of something else back of the superficial appearance of things until she was
                        actually in awe of him. She had a way of showing him how nice she looked
                        before she started to school in the morning, a habit that arose because of
                        his constant criticism of her appearance. He wanted her to look smart, he
                        insisted on a big bow of blue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her
                        shoes be changed from low quarter to high boots with the changing character
                        of the seasons&apos; and that her clothing be carried out on a color
                        scheme suited to her complexion and disposition.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That child&apos;s light and gay by disposition. Don&apos;t
                        put anything somber on her,&quot; he once remarked.</p>
                    <p>Jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and would say,
                        &quot;Run to your papa and show him how you look.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Vesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,
                        &quot;See.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. You&apos;re all right. Go on&quot;; and on she would
                        go.</p>
                    <p>He grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when they drove he
                        would always have her in between them. He insisted that Jennie send her to
                        dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself with rage and grief.
                        &quot;Such irreligion!&quot; he complained to Jennie. &quot;Such
                        devil&apos;s fol-de-rol. Now she goes to dance. What for? To make a
                        no-good out of hera creature to be ashamed of?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh no, papa,&quot; replied Jennie. &quot;It isn&apos;t
                        as bad as that. This is an awful nice school. Lester says she has to
                        go.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-279" n="[272]"/>
                    <p>&quot;Lester, Lester; that man! A fine lot he knows about what is good
                        for a child. A card-player, a whisky-drinker!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, hush, papa; I won&apos;t have you talk like
                        that,&quot; Jennie would reply warmly. &quot;He&apos;s a good
                        man, and you know it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, yes, a good man. In some things, maybe. Not in this.
                        No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went away groaning. When Lester was near he said nothing, and Vesta could
                        wind him around her finger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh you,&quot; she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his
                        grizzled cheek. There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this. He
                        lost control of himselfsomething welled up and choked his throat.
                        &quot;Yes, I know how you do,&quot; he would exclaim.</p>
                    <p>Vesta would tweak his ear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop now!&quot; he would say. &quot;That is
                        enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless she herself
                        willed it. Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do anything with him; he
                        was always her devoted servitor.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XXXIX</head>
                    <p>DURING this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with
                        Lester&apos;s irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger. That it
                        could not help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was
                        sufficiently obvious to them. Rumors were already going about. People seemed
                        to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said directly. Kane
                        senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to fly in the face of
                        conventions in this manner. If the woman had been some one of
                        distinctionsome sorceress of the stage, or of the world of art, or letters,
                        his action would have been explicable if not commendable, but with this
                        creature of very ordinary capabilities, as Louise had described her, this
                        putty-faced nobodyhe could not possibly understand it.</p>
                    <p>Lester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had not settled
                        down in the ordinary way. Look at the women in Cincinnati who knew him and
                        liked him. Take Letty Pace, for instance. Why in the name of common sense
                        had he not married her? She was good looking, sympathetic, talented. The old
                        man grieved bitterly, and then, by degrees, he began to harden. It seemed a
                        shame that Lester should treat him so. It wasn&apos;t natural, or
                        justifiable, or decent. Archibald Kane brooded over it until he felt that
                        some change ought to be enforced, but just what it should be he could not
                        say. Lester was his own boss, and he would resent any criticism of his
                        actions. Apparently, nothing could be done.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-281" n="274"/>
                    <p>Certain changes helped along an approaching denouement. Louise married not
                        many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago, and then the home
                        property was fairly empty except for visiting grandchildren. Lester did not
                        attend the wedding, though he was invited. For another thing, Mrs. Kane
                        died, making a readjustment of the family will necessary. Lester came home
                        on this occasion, grieved to think he had lately seen so little of his
                        motherthat he had caused her so much painbut he had no explanation to make.
                        His father thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because of
                        his obvious gloom. He went back to Chicago, and there were more months of
                        silence.</p>
                    <p>After Mrs. Kane&apos;s death and Louise&apos;s marriage, the father
                        went to live with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his
                        greatest pleasure in his old age. The business, except for the final
                        adjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert&apos;s hands.
                        The latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their husbands and
                        to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped to obtain. He was
                        not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a shrewd, cold business man,
                        far shrewder than his brother gave him credit for. He was already richer
                        than any two of the other children put together, but he chose to keep his
                        counsel and to pretend modesty of fortune. He realized the danger of envy,
                        and preferred a Spartan form of existence, putting all the emphasis on
                        inconspicuous but very ready and very hard cash. While Lester was drifting
                        Robert was workingworking all the time.</p>
                    <p>Robert&apos;s scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in
                        the control of the business was really not very essential, for his father,
                        after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation, had come to
                        the definite conclusion that any large share of his property ought not to go
                        to Lester. Obviously, Lester was not so strong a man as he had thought him
                        to be. Of the two <pb id="VAA2406-282" n="275"/> brothers, Lester might be
                        the bigger intellectually or sympatheticallyartistically and socially there
                        was no comparisonbut Robert got commercial results in a silent, effective
                        way. If Lester was not going to pull himself together at this stage of the
                        game, when would he? Better leave his property to those who would take care
                        of it. Archibald Kane thought seriously of having his lawyer revise his will
                        in such a way that, unless Lester should reform, he would be cut off with
                        only a nominal income. But he decided to give Lester one more chance to make
                        a plea, in fact, that he should abandon his false way of living, and put
                        himself on a sound basis before the world. It wasn&apos;t too late. He
                        really had a great future. Would he deliberately choose to throw it away?
                        Old Archibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at his
                        convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was in
                        Cincinnati.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I&apos;d have one more talk with you, Lester, on a
                        subject that&apos;s rather difficult for me to bring up,&quot; began
                        the elder Kane. &quot;You know what I&apos;m referring to?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; replied Lester, calmly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I used to think, when I was much younger that my son&apos;s
                        matrimonial ventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that
                        score when I got a little farther along. I began to see through my business
                        connections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and then I
                        got rather anxious that my boys should marry well. I used to worry about
                        you, Lester, and I&apos;m worrying yet. This recent connection
                        you&apos;ve made has caused me no end of trouble. It worried your mother
                        up to the very last. It was her one great sorrow. Don&apos;t you think
                        you have gone far enough with it? The scandal has reached down here. What it
                        is in Chicago I don&apos;t know, but it can&apos;t be a secret. That
                        can&apos;t help the house in business there. It certainly can&apos;t
                        help you. The whole thing has gone on so long that you have in <pb
                            id="VAA2406-283" n="276"/> jured your prospects all around, and yet you
                        continue. Why do you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose because I love her,&quot; Lester replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t be serious in that,&quot; said his father.
                        &quot;If you had loved her, you&apos;d have married her in the first
                        place. Surely you wouldn&apos;t take a woman and live with her as you
                        have with this woman for years, disgracing her and yourself, and still claim
                        that you love her. You may have a passion for her, but it isn&apos;t
                        love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you know I haven&apos;t married her?&quot; inquired
                        Lester coolly. He wanted to see how his father would take to that idea.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not serious!&quot; The old gentleman propped
                        himself up on his arms and looked at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;m not,&quot; replied Lester, &quot;but I
                        might be. I might marry her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Impossible!&quot; exclaimed his father vigorously. &quot;I
                        can&apos;t believe it. I can&apos;t believe a man of your
                        intelligence would do a thing like that, Lester. Where is your judgment?
                        Why, you&apos;ve lived in open adultery with her for years, and now you
                        talk of marrying her. Why, in heaven&apos;s name, if you were going to
                        do anything like that, didn&apos;t you do it in the first place?
                        Disgrace your parents, break your mother&apos;s heart, injure the
                        business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause of it? I
                        don&apos;t believe it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Old Archibald got up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t get excited, father,&quot; said Lester quickly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We won&apos;t get anywhere that way. I say I might marry her.
                        She&apos;s not a bad woman, and I wish you wouldn&apos;t talk about
                        her as you do. You&apos;ve never seen her. You know nothing about
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know enough,&quot; insisted old Archibald, determinedly.
                        &quot;I know that no good woman would act as she has done. Why, man,
                        she&apos;s after your money. What else could she want? It&apos;s as
                        plain as the nose on your face.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-284" n="277"/>
                    <p>&quot;Father,&quot; said Lester, his voice lowering ominously,
                        &quot;why do you talk like that? You never saw the woman. You
                        wouldn&apos;t know her from Adam&apos;s off ox. Louise comes down
                        here and gives an excited report, and you people swallow it whole. She
                        isn&apos;t as bad as you think she is, and I wouldn&apos;t use the
                        language you&apos;re using about her if I were you. You&apos;re
                        doing a good woman an injustice, and you won&apos;t, for some reason, be
                        fair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fair! Fair!&quot; interrupted Archibald. &quot;Talk about
                        being fair. Is it fair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a
                        woman of the streets and live with her? Is it&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop now, father,&quot; exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand.
                        &quot;I warn you. I won&apos;t listen to talk like that.
                        You&apos;re talking about the woman that I&apos;m living withthat I
                        may marry. I love you, but I won&apos;t have you saying things that
                        aren&apos;t so. She isn&apos;t a woman of the streets. You know, as
                        well as you know anything, that I wouldn&apos;t take up with a woman of
                        that kind. We&apos;ll have to discuss this in a calmer mood, or I
                        won&apos;t stay here. I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m awfully sorry.
                        But I won&apos;t listen to any such language as that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Old Archibald quieted himself. In spite of his opposition, he respected his
                        son&apos;s point of view. He sat back in his chair and stared at the
                        floor. &quot;How was he to handle this thing?&quot; he asked
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you living in the same place?&quot; he finally inquired.
                        &quot;No, we&apos;ve moved out to Hyde Park. I&apos;ve taken a
                        house out there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hear there&apos;s a child. Is that yours?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you any children of your own?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s a God&apos;s blessing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester merely scratched his chin.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you insist you will marry her?&quot; Archibald went on.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-285" n="278"/>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say that,&quot; replied his son. &quot;I
                        said I might.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Might! Might!&quot; exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling
                        again. &quot;What a tragedy! You with your prospects! Your outlook! How
                        do you suppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my
                        fortune to a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as
                        right and proper? Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family, your
                        personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you. I can&apos;t
                        understand what has happened to your pride. It seems like some wild,
                        impossible fancy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s pretty hard to explain, father, and I can&apos;t
                        do it very well. I simply know that I&apos;m in this affair, and that
                        I&apos;m bound to see it through. It may come out all right. I may not
                        marry herI may. I&apos;m not prepared now to say what I&apos;ll do.
                        You&apos;ll have to wait. I&apos;ll do the best I can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Old Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve made a bad mess of this, Lester,&quot; he said
                        finally. &quot;Surely you have. But I suppose you are determined to go
                        your way. Nothing that I have said appears to move you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not now, father. I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration
                        for the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will make a
                        difference in my will. I can&apos;t go on countenancing this thing, and
                        not be a party to it morally and every other way. I won&apos;t do it.
                        You can leave her, or you can marry her. You certainly ought to do one or
                        the other. If you leave her, everything will be all right. You can make any
                        provision for her you like. I have no objection to that. I&apos;ll
                        gladly pay whatever you agree to. You will share with the rest of the
                        children, just as I had planned. If you marry her it will make a difference.
                        Now do as you please. But don&apos;t blame me. I love you. I&apos;m
                        your father.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-286" n="[279]"/>
                    <p>I&apos;m doing what I think is my bounden duty. Now you think that over
                        and let me know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester sighed. He saw how hopeless this argument was. He felt that his father
                        probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie, and justify
                        himself to himself? Would his father really cut him off? Surely not. The old
                        gentleman loved him even nowhe could see it. Lester felt troubled and
                        distressed; this attempt at coercion irritated him. The ideahe, ester Kane,
                        being made to do such a thingto throw Jennie down. He stared at the floor.</p>
                    <p>Old Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Lester finally, &quot;there&apos;s no
                        use of our discussing it any further nowthat&apos;s certain,
                        isn&apos;t it? I can&apos;t say what I&apos;ll do. I&apos;ll
                        have to take time and think. I can&apos;t decide this offhand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two looked at each other. Lester was sorry for the world&apos;s
                        attitude and for his father&apos;s keen feeling about the affair. Kane
                        senior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing
                        through. He wasn&apos;t sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but
                        he was hopeful. Maybe he would come around yet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-by, father,&quot; said Lester, holding out his hand.
                        &quot;I think I&apos;ll try and make that two-ten train. There
                        isn&apos;t anything else you wanted to see me about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply. What a twisted
                        career! What an end to great possibilities? What a foolhardy persistence in
                        evil and error! He shook his head. Robert was wiser. He was the one to
                        control a business. He was cool and conservative. If Lester were only like
                        that. He thought and thought. It was a long time before he stirred. And
                        still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring son continued to appeal to
                        him.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XL</head>
                    <p>LESTER returned to Chicago. He realized that he had offended his father
                        seriously, how seriously he could not say. In all his personal relations
                        with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up. But even now Lester
                        did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he hardly realized that it was
                        necessary for him to act decisively if he hoped to retain his
                        father&apos;s affection and confidence. As for the world at large, what
                        did it matter how much people talked or what they said. He was big enough to
                        stand alone. But was he? People turn so quickly from weakness or the shadow
                        of it. To get away from failureeven the mere suspicion of that seems to be a
                        subconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid
                        non-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious. Lester was soon
                        to feel the force of this prejudice.</p>
                    <p>One day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire head of
                        Dodge, Holbrook &amp; Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the dry-goods
                        world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world. Dodge had been
                        one of Lester&apos;s best friends. He knew him as intimately as he knew
                        Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of Cincinnati. He
                        visited at his handsome home on the North Shore Drive, and they met
                        constantly in a business and social way. But since Lester had moved out to
                        Hyde Park, the old intimacy had lapsed. Now they came face to face on
                        Michigan Avenue near the Kane building.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Lester, I&apos;m glad to see you again,&quot; said
                        Dodge.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-288" n="281"/>
                    <p>He extended a formal hand, and seemed just a little cool. &quot;I hear
                        you&apos;ve gone and married since I saw you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, nothing like that,&quot; replied Lester, easily, with the
                        air of one who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why so secret about it, if you have?&quot; asked Dodge,
                        attempting to smile, but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth. He
                        was trying to be nice, and to go through a difficult situation gracefully.
                        &quot;We fellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing. You ought
                        to let your friends know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Lester, feeling the edge of the social blade
                        that was being driven into him, &quot;I thought I&apos;d do it in a
                        new way. I&apos;m not much for excitement in that direction,
                        anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is a matter of taste, isn&apos;t it?&quot; said Dodge a
                        little absently. &quot;You&apos;re living in the city, of
                        course?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In Hyde Park.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a pleasant territory. How are things
                        otherwise?&quot; And he deftly changed the subject before waving him a
                        perfunctory farewell.</p>
                    <p>Lester missed at once the inquiries which a man like Dodge would have made if
                        he had really believed that he was married. Under ordinary circumstances his
                        friend would have wanted to know a great deal about the new Mrs. Kane. There
                        would have been all those little familiar touches common to people living on
                        the same social plane. Dodge would have asked Lester to bring his wife over
                        to see them, would have definitely promised to call. Nothing of the sort
                        happened, and Lester noticed the significant omission.</p>
                    <p>It was the same with the Burnham Moores, the Henry Aldriches, and a score of
                        other people whom he knew equally well. Apparently they all thought that he
                        had married and settled down. They were interested to know where he was
                        living, and they were rather disposed <pb id="VAA2406-289" n="282"/> to joke
                        him about being so very secretive on the subject, but they were not willing
                        to discuss the supposed Mrs. Kane. He was beginning to see that this move of
                        his was going to tell against him notably.</p>
                    <p>One of the worst stabsit was the cruelest because, in a way, it was the most
                        unintentionalhe received from an old acquaintance, Will Whitney, at the
                        Union Club. Lester was dining there one evening, and Whitney met him in the
                        main reading-room as he was crossing from the cloak-room to the cigar-stand.
                        The latter was a typical society figure, tall, lean, smoothfaced,
                        immaculately garbed, a little cynical, and to-night a little the worse for
                        liquor. &quot;Hi, Lester!&quot; he called out,
                        &quot;what&apos;s this talk about a <hi rend="i">menage</hi> of
                        yours out in Hyde Park? Say, you&apos;re going some. How are you going
                        to explain all this to your wife when you get married?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t have to explain it,&quot; replied Lester
                        irritably. &quot;Why should you be so interested in my affairs?
                        You&apos;re not living in a stone house, are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say, ha! ha! that&apos;s pretty good now, isn&apos;t it?
                        You didn&apos;t marry that little beauty you used to travel around with
                        on the North Side, did you? Eh, now! Ha, ha! Well, I swear. You married! You
                        didn&apos;t, now, did you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cut it out, Whitney,&quot; said Lester roughly.
                        &quot;You&apos;re talking wild.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pardon, Lester,&quot; said the other aimlessly, but sobering.
                        &quot;I beg your pardon. Remember, I&apos;m just a little warm.
                        Eight whisky-sours straight in the other room there. Pardon. I&apos;ll
                        talk to you some time when I&apos;m all right. See, Lester? Eh! Ha! ha!
                        I&apos;m a little loose, that&apos;s right. Well, so long! Ha!
                        ha!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester could not get over that cacaphonous &quot;ha! ha!&quot; It cut
                        him, even though it came from a drunken man&apos;s mouth. &quot;That
                        little beauty you used to travel with on the North Side. You didn&apos;t
                        marry her, did you?&quot; He <pb id="VAA2406-290" n="[283]"/> quoted
                        Whitney&apos;s impertinences resentfully. George! But this was getting a
                        little rough! He had never endured anything like this beforehe, Lester Kane.
                        It set him thinking. Certainly he was paying dearly for trying to do the
                        kind thing by Jennie.</p>

                    <p>BUT worse was to follow. The American public likes gossip about well - known
                        people, and the Kanes were wealthy and socially prominent. The report was
                        that Lester, one of its principal heirs, had married a servant girl. He, an
                        heir to millions! Could it be possible? What a piquant morsel for the
                        newspapers! Very soon the paragraphs began to appear. A small society paper,
                        called the <hi rend="i">South Side Budget,</hi> referred to him anonymously
                        as &quot;the son of a famous and wealthy carriage manufacturer of
                        Cincinnati,&quot; and outlined briefly what it knew of the story.
                        &quot;Of Mrs.&quot;it went on, sagely, &quot;not so much is
                        known, except that she once worked in a well-known Cleveland society family
                        as a maid and was, before that, a working-girl in Columbus, Ohio. After such
                        a picturesque love-affair in high society, who shall say that romance is
                        dead?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester saw this item. He did not take the paper, but some kind soul took good
                        care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him. It irritated him
                        greatly, for he suspected at once that it was a scheme to blackmail him. But
                        he did not know exactly what to do about it. He preferred, of course, that
                        such comments should cease, but he also thought that if he made any effort
                        to have them stopped he might make matters worse. So he did nothing.
                        Naturally, the paragraph in the <hi rend="i">Budget</hi> attracted the
                        attention of other newspapers. It sounded like a good story, and one Sunday
                        editor, more enterprising than the others, conceived the notion of having
                        this romance written up. A full-page Sunday story with a scare-head such as
                        &quot;Sacrifices Mil <pb id="VAA2406-292" n="285"/> lions for His
                        Servant Girl Love,&quot; pictures of Lester, Jennie, the house at Hyde
                        Park, the Kane manufactory at Cincinnati, the warehouse on Michigan
                        Avenuecertainly, such a display would make a sensation. The Kane Company was
                        not an advertiser in any daily or Sunday paper. The newspaper owed him
                        nothing. If Lester had been forewarned he might have put a stop to the whole
                        business by putting an advertisement in the paper or appealing to the
                        publisher. He did not know, however, and so was without power to prevent the
                        publication. The editor made a thorough job of the business. Local newspaper
                        men in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus were instructed to report by wire
                        whether anything of Jennie&apos;s history was known in their city. The
                        Bracebridge family in Cleveland was asked whether Jennie had ever worked
                        there. A garbled history of the Gerhardts was obtained from Columbus.
                        Jennie&apos;s residence on the North Side, for several years prior to
                        her supposed marriage, was discovered and so the whole story was nicely
                        pieced together. It was not the idea of the newspaper editor to be cruel or
                        critical, but rather complimentary. All the bitter things, such as the
                        probable illegitimacy of Vesta, the suspected immorality of Lester and
                        Jennie in residing together as man and wife, the real grounds of the
                        well-known objections of his family to the match, were ignored. The idea was
                        to frame up a Romeo and Juliet story in which Lester should appear as an
                        ardent, self-sacrificing lover, and Jennie as a poor and lovely
                        working-girl, lifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion
                        of her millionaire lover. An exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to
                        make scenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing
                        was handled in the most approved yellow-journal style. There was a picture
                        of Lester obtained from his Cincinnati photographer for a consideration;
                        Jennie had been surreptitiously &quot;snapped&quot; by a staff
                        artist while she was out walking.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-293" n="286"/>
                    <p>And so, apparently out of a clear sky, the story appearedhighly
                        complimentary, running over with sugary phrases, but with all the dark, sad
                        facts looming up in the background. Jennie did not see it at first. Lester
                        came across the page accidentally, and tore it out. He was stunned and
                        chagrined beyond words. &quot;To think the damned newspaper would do
                        that to a private citizen who was quietly minding his own
                        business!&quot; he thought. He went out of the house, the better to
                        conceal his deep inward mortification. He avoided the more populous parts of
                        the town, particularly the down-town section, and rode far out on Cottage
                        Grove Avenue to the open prairie. He wondered, as the trolley-car rumbled
                        along, what his friends were thinkingDodge, and Burnham Moore, and Henry
                        Aldrich, and the others. This was a smash, indeed. The best he could do was
                        to put a brave face on it and say nothing, or else wave it off with an
                        indifferent motion of the hand. One thing was surehe would prevent further
                        comment. He returned to the house calmer, his selfpoise restored, but he was
                        eager for Monday to come in order that he might get in touch with his
                        lawyer, Mr. Watson. But when he did see Mr. Watson it was soon agreed
                        between the two men that it would be foolish to take any legal action. It
                        was the part of wisdom to let the matter drop. &quot;But I
                        won&apos;t stand for anything more,&quot; concluded Lester.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll attend to that,&quot; said the lawyer,
                        consolingly.</p>
                    <p>Lester got up. &quot;It&apos;s amazingthis damned country of
                        ours!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;A man with a little money
                        hasn&apos;t any more privacy than a public monument.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A man with a little money,&quot; said Mr. Watson, &quot;is
                        just like a cat with a bell around its neck. Every rat knows exactly where
                        it is and what it is doing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s an apt simile,&quot; assented Lester, bitterly.</p>
                    <p>Jennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days. Lester felt
                        that he could not talk it over, <pb id="VAA2406-294" n="287"/> and Gerhardt
                        never read the wicked Sunday newspapers. Finally, one of Jennie&apos;s
                        neighborhood friends, less tactful than the others, called her attention to
                        the fact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it. Jennie did
                        not understand at first. &quot;A story about me?&quot; she
                        exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You and Mr. Kane, yes,&quot; replied her guest. &quot;Your
                        love romance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie colored swiftly. &quot;Why, I hadn&apos;t seen it,&quot;
                        she said. &quot;Are you sure it was about us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, of course,&quot; laughed Mrs. Stendahl. &quot;How
                        could I be mistaken? I have the paper over at the house. I&apos;ll send
                        Marie over with it when I get back. You look very sweet in your
                        picture.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie winced.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you would,&quot; she said, weakly.</p>
                    <p>She was wondering where they had secured her picture, what the article said.
                        Above all, she was dismayed to think of its effect upon Lester. Had he seen
                        the article? Why had he not spoken to her about it?</p>
                    <p>The neighbor&apos;s daughter brought over the paper, and
                        Jennie&apos;s heart stood still as she glanced at the title-page. There
                        it all wasuncompromising and direct. How dreadfully conspicuous the
                        headline&quot;This Millionaire Fell in Love With This Lady&apos;s
                        Maid,&quot; which ran between a picture of Lester on the left and Jennie
                        on the right. There was an additional caption which explained how Lester,
                        son of the famous carriage family of Cincinnati, had sacrificed great social
                        opportunity and distinction to marry his heart&apos;s desire. Below were
                        scattered a number of other picturesLester addressing Jennie in the mansion
                        of Mrs. Bracebridge, Lester standing with her before an imposing and
                        conventional-looking parson. Lester driving with her in a handsome victoria,
                        Jennie standing beside the window of an imposing mansion (the fact that it
                        was a mansion being indicated by most sumptuous-looking hangings) and gazing
                        out on a very <pb id="VAA2406-295" n="[288]"/> modest working-man&apos;s
                        cottage pictured in the distance. Jennie felt as though she must die for
                        very shame. She did not so much mind what it meant to her, but Lester,
                        Lester, how must he feel? And his family? Now they would have another club
                        with which to strike him and her. She tried to keep calm about it, to exert
                        emotional control, but again the tears would rise, only this time they were
                        tears of opposition to defeat. She did not want to be hounded this way. She
                        wanted to be let alone. She was trying to do right now. Why
                        couldn&apos;t the world help her, instead of seeking to push her
                    down?</p>

                        that evening, for he brought it home himself, having concluded, after mature

                        concealment between them, and this thing, coming so brutally to disturb
                        their peace, was nevertheless a case in point. He had decided to tell her
                        not to think anything of itthat it did not make much difference, though to
                        him it made all the difference in the world. The effect of this chill
                        history could never be undone. The wiseand they included all his social
                        world and many who were not of itcould see just how he had been living. The
                        article which accompanied the pictures told how he had followed Jennie from
                        Cleveland to Chicago, how she had been coy and distant and that he had to
                        court her a long time to win her consent. This was to explain their living
                        together on the North Side. Lester realized that this was an asinine attempt
                        to sugarcoat the true story and it made him angry. Still he preferred to
                        have it that way rather than in some more brutal vein. He took the paper out
                        of his pocket when he arrived at the house, spreading it on the library
                        table. Jennie, who was close by, watched him, for she knew what was coming.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here&apos;s something that will interest you, Jennie,&quot;
                        he said dryly, pointing to the array of text and pictures.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve already seen it, Lester,&quot; she said wearily.
                        &quot;Mrs. Stendahl showed it to me this afternoon. I was wondering
                        whether you had.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-297" n="290"/>
                    <p>&quot;Rather high-flown description of my attitude, isn&apos;t it? I
                        didn&apos;t know I was such an ardent Romeo.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m awfully sorry, Lester,&quot; said Jennie, reading
                        behind the dry face of humor the serious import of this affair to him. She
                        had long since learned that Lester did not express his real feeling, his big
                        ills in words. He was inclined to jest and make light of the inevitable, the
                        inexorable. This light comment merely meant &quot;this matter cannot be
                        helped, so we will make the best of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, don&apos;t feel badly about it,&quot; he went on.
                        &quot;It isn&apos;t anything which can be adjusted now. They
                        probably meant well enough. We just happen to be in the limelight.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said Jennie, coming over to him.
                        &quot;I&apos;m sorry, though, anyway.&quot; Dinner was announced
                        a moment later and the incident was closed.</p>
                    <p>But Lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting in a bad
                        way. His father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at the last
                        interview, and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the climax. He might
                        as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his old world. It would have
                        none of him, or at least the more conservative part of it would not. There
                        were a few bachelors, a few gay married men, some sophisticated women,
                        single and married, who saw through it all and liked him just the same, but
                        they did not make society. He was virtually an outcast, and nothing could
                        save him but to reform his ways; in other words, he must give up Jennie once
                        and for all.</p>
                    <p>But he did not want to do this. The thought was painful to himobjectionable
                        in every way. Jennie was growing in mental acumen. She was beginning to see
                        things quite as clearly as he did. She was not a cheap, ambitious, climbing
                        creature. She was a big woman and a good one. It would be a shame to throw
                        her down, and besides she was good-lookng. He was forty-six <pb
                            id="VAA2406-298" n="291"/> and she was twenty-nine; and she looked
                        twenty-four or five. It is an exceptional thing to find beauty, youth,
                        compatibility, intelligence, your own point of viewsoftened and charmingly
                        emotionalizedin another. He had made his bed, as his father had said. He had
                        better lie on it.</p>
                    <p>It was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper incident that
                        Lester had word that his father was quite ill and failing; it might be
                        necessary for him to go to Cincinnati at any moment. Pressure of work was
                        holding him pretty close when the news came that his father was dead.
                        Lester, of course, was greatly shocked and grieved, and he returned to
                        Cincinnati in a retrospective and sorrowful mood. His father had been a
                        great character to hima fine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside
                        from his relationship to him as his son. He remembered him now dandling him
                        upon his knee as a child, telling him stories of his early life in Ireland,
                        and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a little older,
                        impressing the maxims of his business career and his commercial wisdom on
                        him as he grew to manhood. Old Archibald had been radically honest. It was
                        to him that Lester owed his instincts for plain speech and direct statement
                        of fact. &quot;Never lie,&quot; was Archibald&apos;s constant,
                        reiterated statement. &quot;Never try to make a thing look different
                        from what it is to you. It&apos;s the breath of lifetruthit&apos;s
                        the basis of real worth, while commercial successit will make a notable
                        character of any one who will stick to it.&quot; Lester believed this.
                        He admired his father intensely for his rigid insistence on truth, and now
                        that he was really gone he felt sorry. He wished he might have been spared
                        to be reconciled to him. He half fancied that old Archibald would have liked
                        Jennie if he had known her. He did not imagine that he would ever have had
                        the opportunity to straighten things out, although he still felt that
                        Archibald would have liked her.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-299" n="292"/>
                    <p>When he reached Cincinnati it was snowing, a windy, blustery snow. The flakes
                        were coming down thick and fast. The traffic of the city had a muffled
                        sound. When he stepped down from the train he was met by Amy, who was glad
                        to see him in spite of all their past differences. Of all the girls she was
                        the most tolerant. Lester put his arms about her, and kissed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems like old times to see you, Amy,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;your coming to meet me this way. How&apos;s the family? I
                        suppose they&apos;re all here. Well, poor father, his time had to come.
                        Still, he lived to see everything that he wanted to see. I guess he was
                        pretty well satisfied with the outcome of his efforts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Amy, &quot;and since mother died he was
                        very lonely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They rode up to the house in kindly good feeling, chatting of old times and
                        places. All the members of the immediate family, and the various relatives,
                        were gathered in the old family mansion. Lester exchanged the customary
                        condolences with the others, realizing all the while that his father had
                        lived long enough. He had had a successful life, and had fallen like a ripe
                        apple from the tree. Lester looked at him where he lay in the great parlor,
                        in his black coffin, and a feeling of the old-time affection swept over him.
                        He smiled at the clean-cut, determined, conscientious face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The old gentleman was a big man all the way through,&quot; he
                        said to Robert, who was present. &quot;We won&apos;t find a better
                        figure of a man soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will not,&quot; said his brother, solemnly.</p>
                    <p>After the funeral it was decided to read the will at once. Louise&apos;s
                        husband was anxious to return to Buffalo; Lester was compelled to be in
                        Chicago. A conference of the various members of the family was called for
                        the second day after the funeral, to be held at the offices of Messrs.
                        Knight, Keatley &amp; O&apos;Brien, counselors of the late
                        manufacturer.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-300" n="293"/>
                    <p>As Lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father had not
                        acted in any way prejudicial to his interests. It had not been so very long
                        since they had had their last conversation; he had been taking his time to
                        think about things, and his father had given him time. He always felt that
                        he had stood well with the old gentleman, except for his alliance with
                        Jennie. His business judgment had been valuable to the company. Why should
                        there be any discrimination against him? He really did not think it
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>When they reached the offices of the law firm, Mr. O&apos;Brien, a short,
                        fussy, albeit comfortable-looking little person, greeted all the members of
                        the family and the various heirs and assigns with a hearty handshake. He had
                        been personal counsel to Archibald Kane for twenty years. He knew his whims
                        and idiosyncrasies, and considered himself very much in the light of a
                        father confessor. He liked all the children, Lester especially.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now I believe we are all here,&quot; he said, finally,
                        extracting a pair of large horn reading-glasses from his coat pocket and
                        looking sagely about. &quot;Very well. We might as well proceed to
                        business. I will just read the will without any preliminary
                        remarks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned to his desk, picked up a paper lying upon it, cleared his throat,
                        and began.</p>
                    <p>It was a peculiar document, in some respects, for it began with all the minor
                        bequests; first, small sums to old employes, servants, and friends. It then
                        took up a few institutional bequests, and finally came to the immediate
                        family, beginning with the girls. Imogene, as a faithful and loving daughter
                        was left a sixth of the stock of the carriage company and a fourth of the
                        remaining properties of the deceased, which roughly aggregated (the
                        estatenot her share) about eight hundred thousand dollars. Amy and Louise
                        were provided for in exactly the same proportion. The grandchildren were
                        given certain little bonuses for good conduct, when they <pb
                            id="VAA2406-301" n="294"/> should come of age. Then it took up the cases
                        of Robert and Lester.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of
                        my son Lester,&quot; it began, &quot;I deem it my duty to make
                        certain conditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of
                        my property, to wit: One-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing
                        Company and one-fourth of the remainder of my various properties, real,
                        personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to go to my beloved son Robert, in
                        recognition of the faithful performance of his duty, and one-fourth of the
                        stock of the Kane Manufacturing Company and the remaining fourth of my
                        various properties, real, personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to be held in
                        trust by him for the benefit of his brother Lester, until such time as such
                        conditions as may hereinafter be set forth shall have been complied with.
                        And it is my wish and desire that my children shall concur in his direction
                        of the Kane Manufacturing Company, and of such other interests as are
                        entrusted to him, until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such
                        control, or shall indicate another arrangement which shall be
                        better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester swore under his breath. His cheeks changed color, but he did not move.
                        He was not inclined to make a show. It appeared that he was not even
                        mentioned separately.</p>
                    <p>The conditions &quot;hereinafter set forth&quot; dealt very fully
                        with his case, however, though they were not read aloud to the family at the
                        time, Mr. O&apos;Brien stating that this was in accordance with their
                        father&apos;s wish. Lester learned immediately afterward that he was to
                        have ten thousand a year for three years, during which time he had the
                        choice of doing either one of two things: First, he was to leave Jennie, if
                        he had not already married her, and so bring his life into moral conformity
                        with the wishes of his father. In this event Lester&apos;s share of the
                        estate was to <pb id="VAA2406-302" n="295"/> be immediately turned over to
                        him. Secondly, he might elect to marry Jennie, if he had not already done
                        so, in which case the ten thousand a year, specifically set aside to him for
                        three years, was to be continued for lifebut for his life only. Jennie was
                        not to have anything of it after his death. The ten thousand in question
                        represented the annual interest on two hundred shares of L. S. and M. S.
                        stock which were also to be held in trust until his decision had been
                        reached and their final disposition effected. If Lester refused to marry
                        Jennie, or to leave her, he was to have nothing at all after the three years
                        were up. At Lester&apos;s death the stock on which his interest was
                        drawn was to be divided pro rata among the surviving members of the family.
                        If any heir or assign contested the will, his or her share was thereby
                        forfeited entirely.</p>
                    <p>It was astonishing to Lester to see how thoroughly his father had taken his
                        case into consideration. He half suspected, on reading these conditions,
                        that his brother Robert had had something to do with the framing of them,
                        but of course he could not be sure. Robert had not given any direct evidence
                        of enmity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who drew this will?&quot; he demanded of O&apos;Brien, a
                        little later.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we all had a hand in it,&quot; replied O&apos;Brien,
                        a little shamefacedly. &quot;It was a very difficult document to draw
                        up. You know, Mr. Kane, there was no budging your father. He was adamant. He
                        has come very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses. Of
                        course, you know, we had nothing to do with its spirit. That was between you
                        and him. I hated very much to have to do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I understand all that!&quot; said Lester.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t let that worry you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. O&apos;Brien was very grateful.</p>
                    <p>During the reading of the will Lester had sat as stolid as an ox.</p>

                    <p>He got up after a time, as did the others, assuming an air of nonchalance.
                        Robert, Amy, Louise and Imogene all felt shocked, but not exactly, not
                        unqualifiedly regretful. Certainly Lester had acted very badly. He had given
                        his father great provocation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think the old gentleman has been a little rough in
                        this,&quot; said Robert, who had been sitting next him. &quot;I
                        certainly did not expect him to go as far as that. So far as I am concerned
                        some other arrangement would have been satisfactory.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester smiled grimly. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Imogene, Amy, and Louise were anxious to be consolatory, but they did not
                        know what to say. Lester had brought it all on himself. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t think papa acted quite right, Lester,&quot; ventured Amy,
                        but Lester waved her away almost gruffly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can stand it,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>He figured out, as he stood there, what his income would be in case he
                        refused to comply with his father&apos;s wishes. Two hundred shares of
                        L. S. and M. S., in open market, were worth a little over one thousand each.
                        They yielded from five to six per cent., sometimes more, sometimes less. At
                        this rate he would have ten thousand a year, not more.</p>
                    <p>The family gathering broke up, each going his way, and Lester returned to his
                        sister&apos;s house. He wanted to get out of the city quickly, gave
                        business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one, and caught the
                        earliest train back to Chicago. As he rode he meditated.</p>
                    <p>So this was how much his father really cared for him! Could it really be so?
                        He, Lester Kane, ten thousand a year, for only three years, and then longer
                        only on condition that he married Jennie! &quot;Ten thousand a
                        year,&quot; he thought, &quot;and that for three years! Good Lord!
                        Any smart clerk can earn that. To think he should have done that to
                        me!&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XLIII</head>
                    <p>THIS attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely set Lester
                        in opposition to his family, at least for the time being. He had realized
                        clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake; first in not having
                        married Jennie, thus avoiding scandal; and in the second place in not having
                        accepted her proposition at the time when she wanted to leave him; There
                        were no two ways about it, he had made a mess of this business. He could not
                        afford to lose his fortune entirely. He did not have enough money of his
                        own. Jennie was unhappy, he could see that. Why shouldn&apos;t she be?
                        He was unhappy. Did he want to accept the shabby ten thousand a year, even
                        if he were willing to marry her? Finally, did he want to lose Jennie, to
                        have her go out of his life once and for all? He could not make up his mind;
                        the problem was too complicated.</p>
                    <p>When Lester returned to his home, after the funeral, Jennie saw at once that
                        something was amiss with him, something beyond a son&apos;s natural
                        grief for his father&apos;s death was weighing upon his spirits. What
                        was it, she wondered. She tried to draw near to him sympathetically, but his
                        wounded spirit could not be healed so easily. When hurt in his pride he was
                        savage and sullen he could have struck any man who irritated him. She
                        watched him interestedly, wishing to do something for him, but he would not
                        give her his confidence. He grieved, and she could only grieve with him.</p>
                    <p>Days passed, and now the financial situation which had been created by his
                        father&apos;s death came up for careful <pb id="VAA2406-305" n="298"/>
                        consideration. The factory management had to be reorganized. Robert would
                        have to be made president, as his father wished. Lester&apos;s own
                        relationship to the business would have to come up for adjudication. Unless
                        he changed his mind about Jennie, he was not a stockholder. As a matter of
                        fact, he was not anything. To continue to be secretary and treasurer, it was
                        necessary that he should own at least one share of the company&apos;s
                        stock. Would Robert give him any? Would Amy, Louise, or Imogene? Would they
                        sell him any? Would the other members of the family care to do anything
                        which would infringe on Robert&apos;s prerogatives under the will? They
                        were all rather unfriendly to Lester at present, and he realized that he was
                        facing a ticklish situation. The solution wasto get rid of Jennie. If he did
                        that he would not need to be begging for stock. If he didn&apos;t, he
                        was flying in the face of his father&apos;s last will and testament. He
                        turned the matter over in his mind slowly and deliberately. He could quite
                        see how things were coming out. He must abandon either Jennie or his
                        prospects in life. What a dilemma!</p>
                    <p>Despite Robert&apos;s assertion, that so far as he was concerned another
                        arrangement would have been satisfactory, he was really very well pleased
                        with the situation; his dreams were slowly nearing completion. Robert had
                        long had his plans perfected, not only for a thorough reorganization of the
                        company proper, but for an extension of the business in the direction of a
                        combination of carriage companies. If he could get two or three of the
                        larger organizations in the East and West to join with him, selling costs
                        could be reduced, overproduction would be avoided, and the general expenses
                        could be materially scaled down. Through a New York representative, he had
                        been picking up stock in outside carriage companies for some time and he was
                        almost ready to act. In the first place he would have himself <pb
                            id="VAA2406-306" n="299"/> elected president of the Kane Company, and
                        since Lester was no longer a factor, he could select Amy&apos;s husband
                        as vice-president, and possibly some one other than Lester as secretary and
                        treasurer. Under the conditions of the will, the stock and other properties
                        set aside temporarily for Lester, in the hope that he would come to his
                        senses, were to be managed and voted by Robert. His father had meant,
                        obviously, that he, Robert, should help him coerce his brother. He did not
                        want to appear mean, but this was such an easy way. It gave him a righteous
                        duty to perform. Lester must come to his senses or he must let Robert run
                        the business to suit himself.</p>
                    <p>Lester, attending to his branch duties in Chicago, foresaw the drift of
                        things. He realized now that he was permanently out of the company, a branch
                        manager at his brother&apos;s sufferance, and the thought irritated him
                        greatly. Nothing had been said by Robert to indicate that such a change had
                        taken placethings went on very much as beforebut Robert&apos;s
                        suggestions were now obviously law. Lester was really his brother&apos;s
                        employe at so much a year. It sickened his soul.</p>
                    <p>There came a time, after a few weeks, when he felt as if he could not stand
                        this any longer. Hitherto he had been a free and independent agent. The
                        approaching annual stockholder&apos;s meeting which hitherto had been a
                        one-man affair and a formality, his father doing all the voting, would be
                        now a combination of voters, his brother presiding, his sisters very likely
                        represented by their husbands, and he not there at all. It was going to be a
                        great come-down, but as Robert had not said anything about offering to give
                        or sell him any stock which would entitle him to sit as a director or hold
                        any official position in the company, he decided to write and resign. That
                        would bring matters to a crisis. It would show his brother that he felt no
                        desire to be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which
                            <pb id="VAA2406-307" n="300"/> was not hisand gladly soby right of
                        ability and the desire of those with whom he was associated. If he wanted to
                        move back into the company by deserting Jennie he would come in a very
                        different capacity from that of branch manager. He dictated a simple,
                        straightforward business letter, saying: <text>
                            <body>

                                        know the time is drawing near when the company must be
                                        reorganized under your direction. Not having any stock, I am
                                        not entitled to sit as a director, or to hold the joint
                                        position of secretary and treasurer. I want you to accept
                                        this letter as formal notice of my resignation from both
                                        positions, and I want to have your directors consider what
                                        disposition should be made of this position and my services.
                                        I am not anxious to retain the branch-managership as a
                                        branch-managership merely; at the same time I do not want to
                                        do anything which will embarrass you in your plans for the
                                        future. You see by this that I am not ready to accept the

                                        at present. I would like a definite understanding of how you
                                        feel in this matter. Will you write and let me know?</p>

                    <p>Robert, sitting in his office at Cincinnati, considered this letter gravely.
                        It was like his brother to come down to &quot;brass tacks.&quot; If
                        Lester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct, what a
                        man he would be! But there was no guile in the manno subtlety. He would
                        never do a snaky thingand Robert knew, in his own soul, that to succeed
                        greatly one must. &quot;You have to be ruthless at timesyou have to be
                        subtle,&quot; Robert would say to himself. &quot;Why not face the
                        facts to yourself when you are playing for big stakes?&quot; He would,
                        for one, and he did.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-308" n="301"/>
                    <p>Robert felt that although Lester was a tremendously decent fellow and his
                        brother, he wasn&apos;t pliable enough to suit his needs. He was too
                        outspoken, too inclined to take issue. If Lester yielded to his
                        father&apos;s wishes, and took possession of his share of the estate, he
                        would become, necessarily, an active partner in the affairs of the company.
                        Lester would be a barrier in Robert&apos;s path. Did Robert want this?
                        Decidedly he did not. He much preferred that Lester should hold fast to
                        Jennie, for the present at least, and so be quictly shelved by his own act.</p>
                    <p>After long consideration, Robert dictated a politic letter. He
                        hadn&apos;t made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do. He did not
                        know what his sisters&apos; husbands would like. A consultation would
                        have to be held. For his part, he would be very glad to have Lester remain
                        as secretary and treasurer, if it could be arranged. Perhaps it would be
                        better to let the matter rest for the present.</p>
                    <p>Lester cursed. What did Robert mean by beating around the bush? He knew well
                        enough how it could be arranged. One share of stock would be enough for
                        Lester to qualify. Robert was afraid of himthat was the basic fact. Well, he
                        would not retain any branchmanagership, depend on that. He would resign at
                        once. Lester accordingly wrote back, saying that he had considered all
                        sides, and had decided to look after some interests of his own, for the time
                        being. If Robert could arrange it, he would like to have some one come on to
                        Chicago and take over the branch agency. Thirty days would be time enough.
                        In a few days came a regretful reply, saying that Robert was awfully sorry,
                        but that if Lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any
                        plans he might have in view. Imogene&apos;s husband, Jefferson Midgely,
                        had long thought he would like to reside in Chicago. He could undertake the
                        work for the time being.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-309" n="[302]"/>
                    <p>Lester smiled. Evidently Robert was making the best of a very subtle
                        situation. Robert knew that he, Lester, could sue and tie things up, and
                        also that he would be very loath to do so. The newspapers would get hold of
                        the whole story. This matter of his relationship to Jennie was in the air,
                        anyhow. He could best solve the problem by leaving her. So it all came back
                        to that.</p>

                    <p>FOR a man of Lester&apos;s yearshe was now forty-sixto be tossed out in
                        the world without a definite connection, even though he did have a present
                        income (including this new ten thousand) of fifteen thousand a year, was a
                        disturbing and discouraging thing. He realized now that, unless he made some
                        very fortunate and profitable arrangements in the near future, his career
                        was virtually at an end. Of course he could marry Jennie. That would give
                        him the ten thousand for the rest of his life, but it would also end his
                        chance of getting his legitimate share of the Kane estate. Again, he might
                        sell out the seventy-five thousand dollars&apos; worth of moderate
                        interest-bearing stocks, which now yielded him about five thousand, and try
                        a practical investment of some kindsay a rival carriage company. But did he
                        want to jump in, at this stage of the game, and begin a running fight on his
                        father&apos;s old organization? Moreover, it would be a hard row to hoe.
                        There was the keenest rivalry for business as it was, with the Kane Company
                        very much in the lead. Lester&apos;s only available capital was his
                        seventy-five thousand dollars. Did he want to begin in a picayune, obscure
                        way? It took money to get a foothold in the carriage business as things were
                        now.</p>
                    <p>The trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine imagination and
                        considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless, narrow-minded insistence on
                        his individual superiority which is a necessary element in almost every
                        great business success. To be a forceful figure in the <pb id="VAA2406-311"
                            n="304"/> business world means, as a rule, that you must be an
                        individual of one idea, and that idea the God-given one that life has
                        destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field you have
                        chosen. It means that one thing, a cake of soap, a new can-opener, a safety
                        razor, or speed-accelerator, must seize on your imagination with tremendous
                        force, burn as a raging flame, and make itself the be-all and end-all of
                        your existence. As a rule, a man needs poverty to help him to this
                        enthusiasm, and youth. The thing he has discovered, and with which he is
                        going to busy himself, must be the door to a thousand opportunities and a
                        thousand joys. Happiness must be beyond or the fire will not burn as
                        brightly as it mightthe urge will not be great enough to make a great
                        success.</p>
                    <p>Lester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm. Life had
                        already shown him the greater part of its so-called joys. He saw through the
                        illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled pleasure. Money, of
                        course, was essential, and he had already had moneyenough to keep him
                        comfortably. Did he want to risk it? He looked about him thoughtfully.
                        Perhaps he did. Certainly he could not comfortably contemplate the thought
                        of sitting by and watching other people work for the rest of his days.</p>
                    <p>In the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into things. He
                        was, as he said to himself, in no hurry; he was not going to make a mistake.
                        He would first give the trade, the people who were identified with the
                        manufacture and sale of carriages, time to realize that he was out of the
                        Kane Company, for the time being, anyhow, and open to other connections. So
                        he announced that he was leaving the Kane Company and going to Europe,
                        ostensibly for a rest. He had never been abroad, and Jennie, too, would
                        enjoy it. Vesta could be left at home with Gerhardt and a maid, and he and
                        Jennie would travel around a bit, seeing what Europe had to show. He wanted
                        to visit Venice and <pb id="VAA2406-312" n="305"/> Baden-Baden, and the
                        great watering-places that had been recommended to him. Cairo and Luxor and
                        the Parthenon had always appealed to his imagination. After he had had his
                        outing he could come back and seriously gather up the threads of his
                        intentions.</p>
                    <p>The spring after his father died, he put his plan into execution. He had
                        wound up the work of the ware-rooms and with a pleasant deliberation had
                        studied out a tour. He made Jennie his confidante, and now, having gathered
                        together their traveling comforts they took a steamer from New York to
                        Liverpool. After a few weeks in the British Isles they went to Egypt. From
                        there they came back, through Greece and Italy, into Austria and
                        Switzerland, and then later, through France and Paris, to Germany and
                        Berlin. Lester was diverted by the novelty of the experience and yet he had
                        an uncomfortable feeling that he was wasting his time. Great business
                        enterprises were not built by travelers, and he was not looking for health.</p>
                    <p>Jennie, on the other hand, was transported by what she saw, and enjoyed the
                        new life to the full. Before Luxor and Karnakplaces which Jennie had never
                        dreamed existedshe learned of an older civilization, powerful, complex,
                        complete. Millions of people had lived and died here, believing in other
                        gods, other forms of government, other conditions of existence. For the
                        first time in her life Jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is.
                        Now from this point of viewof decayed Greece, of fallen Rome, of forgotten
                        Egypt, she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties, our minor beliefs.
                        Her father&apos;s Lutheranismit did not seem so significant any more;
                        and the social economy of Columbus, Ohiorather pointless, perhaps. Her
                        mother had worried so of what peopleher neighborsthought, but here were dead
                        worlds of people, some bad, some good. Lester explained that their
                        differences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate, sometimes
                        to religious <pb id="VAA2406-313" n="[306]"/> beliefs, and sometimes to the
                        rise of peculiar personalities like Mohammed. Lester liked to point out how
                        small conventions bulked in this, the larger world, and vaguely she began to
                        see. Admitting that she had been badlocally it was important, perhaps, but
                        in the sum of civilization, in the sum of big forces, what did it all amount
                        to? They would be dead after a little while, she and Lester and all these
                        people. Did anything matter except goodnessgoodness of heart? What else was
                        there that was real?</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XLV</head>
                    <p>IT was while traveling abroad that Lester came across, first at the Carlton
                        in London and later at Shepheards in Cairo, the one girl, before Jennie,
                        whom it might have been said he truly admiredLetty Pace. He had not seen her
                        for a long time, and she had been Mrs. Malcolm Gerald for nearly four years,
                        and a charming widow for nearly two years more. Malcolm Gerald had been a
                        wealthy man, having amassed a fortune in banking and stock-brokering in
                        Cincinnati, and he had left Mrs. Malcolm Gerald very well off. She was the
                        mother of one child, a little girl, who was safely in charge of a nurse and
                        maid at all times, and she was invariably the picturesque center of a group
                        of admirers recruited from every capital of the civilized world. Letty
                        Gerald was a talented woman, beautiful, graceful, artistic, a writer of
                        verse, an omnivorous reader, a student of art, and a sincere and ardent
                        admirer of Lester Kane.</p>
                    <p>In her day she had truly loved him, for she had been a wise observer of men
                        and affairs, and Lester had always appealed to her as a real man. He was so
                        sane, she thought, so calm. He was always intolerant of sham, and she liked
                        him for it. He was inclined to wave aside the petty little frivolities of
                        common society conversation, and to talk of simple and homely things. Many
                        and many a time, in years past, they had deserted a dance to sit out on a
                        balcony somewhere, and talk while Lester smoked. He had argued philosophy
                        with her, discussed books, described political and social conditions in
                        other citiesin a word, he had treated her like a sensible <pb
                            id="VAA2406-315" n="308"/> human being, and she had hoped and hoped and
                        hoped that he would propose to her. More than once she had looked at his
                        big, solid head with its short growth of hardy brown hair, and wished that
                        she could stroke it. It was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to
                        Chicago; at that time she knew nothing of Jennie, but she felt instinctively
                        that her chance of winning him was gone.</p>
                    <p>Then Malcolm Gerald, always an ardent admirer, proposed for something like
                        the sixty-fifth time, and she took him. She did not love him, but she was
                        getting along, and she had to marry some one. He was forty-four when he
                        married her, and he lived only four yearsjust long enough to realize that he
                        had married a charming, tolerant, broad-minded woman. Then he died of
                        pneumonia and Mrs. Gerald was a rich widow, sympathetic, attractive,
                        delightful in her knowledge of the world, and with nothing to do except to
                        live and to spend her money.</p>
                    <p>She was not inclined to do either indifferently. She had long since had her
                        ideal of a man established by Lester. These whipper-snappers of counts,
                        earls, lords, barons, whom she met in one social world and another (for her
                        friendship and connections had broadened notably with the years), did not
                        interest her a particle. She was terribly weary of the superficial veneer of
                        the titled fortune-hunter whom she met abroad. A good judge of character, a
                        student of men and manners, a natural reasoner along sociologic and
                        psychologic lines, she saw through them and through the civilization which
                        they represented. &quot;I could have been happy in a cottage with a man
                        I once knew out in Cincinnati,&quot; she told one of her titled women
                        friends who had been an American before her marriage. &quot;He was the
                        biggest, cleanest, sanest fellow. If he had proposed to me I would have
                        married him if I had had to work for a living myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was he so poor?&quot; asked her friend.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-316" n="309"/>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed he wasn&apos;t. He was comfortably rich, but that did
                        not make any difference to me. It was the man I wanted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It would have made a difference in the long run,&quot; said the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You misjudge me,&quot; replied Mrs. Gerald. &quot;I waited
                        for him for a number of years, and I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories of Letty
                        Pace, or Mrs. Gerald, as she was now. He had been fond of her in a way, very
                        fond. Why hadn&apos;t he married her? He had asked himself that question
                        time and again. She would have made him an ideal wife, his father would have
                        been pleased, everybody would have been delighted. Instead he had drifted
                        and drifted, and then he had met Jennie; and somehow, after that, he did not
                        want her any more. Now after six years of separation he met her again. He
                        knew she was married. She was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an
                        affairshe had heard that he had subsequently married the woman and was
                        living on the South Side. She did not know of the loss of his fortune. She
                        ran across him first in the Carlton one June evening. The windows were open,
                        and the flowers were blooming everywhere, odorous with that sense of new
                        life in the air which runs through the world when spring comes back. For the
                        moment she was a little beside herself. Something choked in her throat; but
                        she collected herself and extended a graceful arm and hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Lester Kane,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;How <hi
                            rend="i">do</hi> you do! I am so glad. And this is Mrs. Kane? Charmed,
                        I&apos;m sure. It seems truly like a breath of spring to see you again.
                        I hope you&apos;ll excuse me, Mrs. Kane, but I&apos;m delighted to
                        see your husband. I&apos;m ashamed to say how many years it is, Lester,
                        since I saw you last! I feel quite old when I think of it. Why, Lester,
                        think; it&apos;s been all of six or seven years! And I&apos;ve been
                        married and had a child, and poor Mr. Gerald has died, and <pb
                            id="VAA2406-317" n="310"/> oh, dear, I don&apos;t know what all
                        hasn&apos;t happened to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t look it,&quot; commented Lester, smiling. He
                        was pleased to see her again, for they had been good friends. She liked him
                        stillthat was evident, and he truly liked her.</p>
                    <p>Jennie smiled. She was glad to see this old friend of Lester&apos;s. This
                        woman, trailing a magnificent, yellow lace train over pale, mother-of-pearl
                        satin, her round, smooth arms bare to the shoulder, her corsage cut low and
                        a dark red rose blowing at her waist, seemed to her the ideal of what a
                        woman should be. She liked looking at lovely women quite as much as Lester;
                        she enjoyed calling his attention to them, and teasing him, in the mildest
                        way, about their charms. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t you like to run and
                        talk to her, Lester, instead of to me?&quot; she would ask when some
                        particularly striking or beautiful woman chanced to attract her attention.
                        Lester would examine her choice critically, for he had come to know that her
                        judge of feminine charms was excellent. &quot;Oh, I&apos;m pretty
                        well off where I am,&quot; he would retort, looking into her eyes; or,
                        jestingly, &quot;I&apos;m not as young as I used to be, or
                        I&apos;d get in tow of that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Run on,&quot; was her comment. &quot;I&apos;ll wait for
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What would you do if I really should?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Lester, I wouldn&apos;t do anything. You&apos;d come
                        back to me, maybe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wouldn&apos;t you care?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know I&apos;d care. But if you felt that you wanted to, I
                        wouldn&apos;t try to stop you. I wouldn&apos;t expect to be all in
                        all to one man, unless he wanted me to be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where do you get those ideas, Jennie?&quot; he asked her once,
                        curious to test the breadth of her philosophy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know, why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re so broad, so good-natured, so charitable.
                        They&apos;re not common, that&apos;s sure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I don&apos;t think we ought to be selfish, Lester.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-318" n="311"/>
                    <p>I don&apos;t know why. Some women think differently, I know, but a man
                        and a woman ought to want to live together, or they ought not
                        todon&apos;t you think? It doesn&apos;t make so much difference if a
                        man goes off for a little whilejust so long as he doesn&apos;t stayif he
                        wants to come back at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester smiled, but he respected her for the sweetness of her point of viewhe
                        had to.</p>
                    <p>To-night, when she saw this woman so eager to talk to Lester, she realized at
                        once that they must have a great deal in common to talk over; whereupon she
                        did a characteristic thing. &quot;Won&apos;t you excuse me for a
                        little while?&quot; she asked, smiling. &quot;I left some things
                        uncared for in our rooms. I&apos;ll be back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She went away, remaining in her room as long as she reasonably could, and
                        Lester and Letty fell to discussing old times in earnest. He recounted as
                        much of his experiences as he deemed wise, and Letty brought the history of
                        her life up to date. &quot;Now that you&apos;re safely married,
                        Lester,&quot; she said daringly, &quot;I&apos;ll confess to you
                        that you were the one man I always wanted to have propose to meand you never
                        did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe I never dared,&quot; he said, gazing into her superb
                        black eyes, and thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not
                        married. He felt that she had grown more beautiful in every way. She seemed
                        to him now to be an ideal society figureperfection itselfgracious, natural,
                        witty, the type of woman who mixes and mingles well, meeting each new-comer
                        upon the plane best suited to him or her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you thought! I know what you thought. Your real thought just
                        left the table.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tut, tut, my dear. Not so fast. You don&apos;t know what I
                        thought.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyhow, I allow you some credit. She&apos;s charming.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jennie has her good points,&quot; he replied simply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And are you happy?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-319" n="312"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, fairly so. Yes, I suppose I&apos;m happyas happy as any one
                        can be who sees life as it is. You know I&apos;m not troubled with many
                        illusions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not any, I think, kind sir, if I know you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very likely, not any, Letty; but sometimes I wish I had a few. I
                        think I would be happier.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I, too, Lester. Really, I look on my life as a kind of failure,
                        you know, in spite of the fact that I&apos;m almost as rich as
                        Craesusnot quite. I think he had some more than I have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What talk from youyou, with your beauty and talent, and moneygood
                        heavens!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what can I do with it? Travel, talk, shoo away silly
                        fortune-hunters. Oh, dear, sometimes I get so tired!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Letty looked at Lester. In spite of Jennie, the old feeling came back. Why
                        should she have been cheated of him? They were as comfortable together as
                        old married people, or young lovers. Jennie had had no better claim. She
                        looked at him, and her eyes fairly spoke. He smiled a little sadly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here comes my wife,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ll
                        have to brace up and talk of other things. You&apos;ll find her
                        interestingreally.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; she replied, and turned on Jennie a radiant
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>Jennie felt a faint sense of misgiving. She thought vaguely that this might
                        be one of Lester&apos;s old flames. This was the kind of woman he should
                        have chosennot her. She was suited to his station in life, and he would have
                        been as happyperhaps happier. Was he beginning to realize it? Then she put
                        away the uncomfortable thought; pretty soon she would be getting jealous,
                        and that would be contemptible.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward the Kanes.
                        She invited them the next day to join her on a drive through Rotten Row.
                        There <pb id="VAA2406-320" n="313"/> was a dinner later at
                        Claridge&apos;s, and then she was compelled to keep some engagement
                        which was taking her to Paris. She bade them both an affectionate farewell,
                        and hoped that they would soon meet again. She was envious, in a sad way, of
                        Jennie&apos;s good fortune. Lester had lost none of his charm for her.
                        If anything, he seemed nicer, more considerate, more wholesome. She wished
                        sincerely that he were free. And Lestersubconsciously perhapswas thinking
                        the same thing.</p>
                    <p>No doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it, he had been led
                        over mentally all of the things which might have happened if he had married
                        her. They were so congenial now, philosophically, artistically, practically.
                        There was a natural flow of conversation between them all the time, like two
                        old comrades among men. She knew everybody in his social sphere, which was
                        equally hers, but Jennie did not. They could talk of certain subtle
                        characteristics of life in a way which was not possible between him and
                        Jennie, for the latter did not have the vocabulary. Her ideas did not flow
                        as fast as those of Mrs. Gerald. Jennie had actually the deeper, more
                        comprehensive, sympathetic, and emotional note in her nature, but she could
                        not show it in light conversation. Actually she was living the thing she
                        was, and that was perhaps the thing which drew Lester to her. Just now, and
                        often in situations of this kind, she seemed at a disadvantage, and she was.
                        It seemed to Lester for the time being as if Mrs. Gerald would perhaps have
                        been a better choice after allcertainly as good, and he would not now have
                        this distressing thought as to his future.</p>
                    <p>They did not see Mrs. Gerald again until they reached Cairo. In the gardens
                        about the hotel they suddenly encountered her, or rather Lester did, for he
                        was alone at the time, strolling and smoking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, this is good luck,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Where do
                        you come from?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-321" n="314"/>
                    <p>&quot;Madrid, if you please. I didn&apos;t know I was coming until
                        last Thursday. The Ellicotts are here. I came over with them. You know I
                        wondered where you might be. Then I remembered that you said you were going
                        to Egypt. Where is your wife?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In her bath, I fancy, at this moment. This warm weather makes
                        Jennie take to water. I was thinking of a plunge myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They strolled about for a time. Letty was in light blue silk, with a blue and
                        white parasol held daintily over her shoulder, and looked very pretty.
                        &quot;Oh, dear!&quot; she suddenly ejaculated, &quot;I wonder
                        sometimes what I am to do with myself. I can&apos;t loaf always this
                        way. I think I&apos;ll go back to the States to live.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What good would it do me? I don&apos;t want to get married. I
                        haven&apos;t any one to marry nowthat I want.&quot; She glanced at
                        Lester significantly, then looked away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll find some one eventually,&quot; he said,
                        somewhat awkwardly. &quot;You can&apos;t escape for longnot with
                        your looks and money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Lester, hush!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right! Have it otherwise, if you want. I&apos;m telling
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you still dance?&quot; she inquired lightly, thinking of a
                        ball which was to be given at the hotel that evening. He had danced so well
                        a few years before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do I look it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Lester, you don&apos;t mean to say that you have gone and
                        abandoned that last charming art. I still love to dance. Doesn&apos;t
                        Mrs. Kane?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, she doesn&apos;t care to. At least she hasn&apos;t
                        taken it up. Come to think of it, I suppose that is my fault. I
                        have&apos;nt thought of dancing in some time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It occurred to him that he hadn&apos;t been going to functions of any
                        kind much for some time. The opposition <pb id="VAA2406-322" n="[315]"/> his
                        entanglement had generated had put a stop to that.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come and dance with me to-night. Your wife won&apos;t object.
                        It&apos;s a splendid floor. I saw it this morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll have to think about that,&quot; replied Lester.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not much in practice. Dancing will probably go hard
                        with me at my time of life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, hush, Lester,&quot; replied Mrs. Gerald. &quot;You make
                        me feel old. Don&apos;t talk so sedately. Merey alive, you&apos;d
                        think you were an old man!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am in experience, my dear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pshaw, that simply makes us more attractive,&quot; replied his
                        old flame.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XLVI</head>
                    <p>THAT night after dinner the music was already sounding in the ball-room of
                        the great hotel adjacent to the palm-gardens when Mrs. Gerald found Lester
                        smoking on one of the verandas with Jennie by his side. The latter was in
                        white satin and white slippers, her hair lying a heavy, enticing mass about
                        her forehead and ears. Lester was brooding over the history of Egypt, its
                        successive tides or waves of rather weak-bodied people; the thin, narrow
                        strip of soil along either side of the Nile that had given these successive
                        waves of population sustenance; the wonder of heat and tropic life, and this
                        hotel with its modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among
                        ancient, soul-weary, almost despairing conditions. He and Jennie had looked
                        this morning on the pyramids. They had taken a trolley to the Sphinx! They
                        had watched swarms of ragged, half-clad, curiously costumed men and boys
                        moving through narrow, smelly, albeit brightly colored, lanes and alleys.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It all seems such a mess to me,&quot; Jennie had said at one
                        place. &quot;They are so dirty and oily. I like it, but somehow they
                        seem tangled up, like a lot of worms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester chuckled. &quot;You&apos;re almost right. But climate does it.
                        Heat. The tropics. Life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions.
                        They can&apos;t help it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I know that. I don&apos;t blame them. They&apos;re just
                        queer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To-night he was brooding over this, the moon shining down into the grounds
                        with an exuberant, sensuous luster.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-324" n="317"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, at last I&apos;ve found you!&quot; Mrs. Gerald
                        exclaimed. &quot;I couldn&apos;t get down to dinner, after all. Our
                        party was so late getting back. I&apos;ve made your husband agree to
                        dance with me, Mrs. Kane,&quot; she went on smilingly. She, like Lester
                        and Jennie, was under the sensuous influence of the warmth, the spring, the
                        moonlight. There were rich odors abroad, floating subtly from groves and
                        gardens; from the remote distance camel-bells were sounding and exotic
                        cries, <hi rend="i">&quot;Ayah!</hi>&quot; and <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;oosh! oosh!</hi>&quot; as though a drove of strange
                        animals were being rounded up and driven through the crowded streets.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re welcome to him,&quot; replied Jennie
                        pleasantly. &quot;He ought to dance. I sometimes wish I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to take lessons right away then,&quot; replied Lester
                        genially. &quot;I&apos;ll do my best to keep you company.
                        I&apos;m not as light on my feet as I was once, but I guess I can get
                        around.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t want to dance that badly,&quot; smiled
                        Jennie. &quot;But you two go on, I&apos;m going up-stairs in a
                        little while, anyway.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you come sit in the ball-room? I can&apos;t
                        do more than a few rounds. Then we can watch the others,&quot; said
                        Lester rising.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I think I&apos;ll stay here. It&apos;s so pleasant. You
                        go. Take him, Mrs. Gerald.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester and Letty strolled away. They made a striking pairMrs. Gerald in dark
                        wine-colored silk, covered with glistening black beads, her shapely arms and
                        neck bare, and a flashing diamond of great size set just above her forehead
                        in her dark hair. Her lips were red, and she had an engaging smile, showing
                        an even row of white teeth between wide, full, friendly lips.
                        Lester&apos;s strong, vigorous figure was well set off by his evening
                        clothes; he looked distinguished.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is the woman he should have married,&quot; said Jennie to
                        herself as he disappeared. She fell into a <pb id="VAA2406-325" n="318"/>
                        reverie, going over the steps of her past life. Sometimes it seemed to her
                        now as if she had been living in a dream. At other times she felt as though
                        she were in that dream yet. Life sounded in her ears much as this night did.
                        She heard its cries. She knew its large-mass features. But back of it were
                        subtleties that shaded and changed one into the other like the shifting of
                        dreams. Why had she been so attractive to men? Why had Lester been so eager
                        to follow her? Could she have prevented him? She thought of her life in
                        Columbus, when she carried coal; to-night she was in Egypt, at this great
                        hotel, the chatelaine of a suite of rooms, surrounded by every luxury,
                        Lester still devoted to her. He had endured so many things for her! Why? Was
                        she so wonderful? Brander had said so. Lester had told her so. Still she
                        felt humble, out of place, holding handfuls of jewels that did not belong to
                        her. Again she experienced that peculiar feeling which had come over her the
                        first time she went to New York with Lesternamely, that this fairy existence
                        could not endure. Her life was fated. Something would happen. She would go
                        back to simple things, to a side street, a poor cottage, to old clothes.</p>
                    <p>And then as she thought of her home in Chicago, and the attitude of his
                        friends, she knew it must be so. She would never be received, even if he
                        married her. And she could understand why. She could look into the charming,
                        smiling face of this woman who was now with Lester, and see that she
                        considered her very nice, perhaps, but not of Lester&apos;s class. She
                        was saying to herself now no doubt as she danced with Lester that he needed
                        some one like her. He needed some one who had been raised in the atmosphere
                        of the things to which he had been accustomed. He couldn&apos;t very
                        well expect to find in her, Jennie, the familiarity with, the appreciation
                        of the niceties to, which he had always been accustomed. She understood what
                        they were. Her mind had awakened rapidly to details of furniture, clothing,
                        arrangement, <pb id="VAA2406-326" n="319"/> decorations, manner, forms,
                        customs, butshe was not to the manner born.</p>
                    <p>If she went away Lester would return to his old world, the world of the
                        attractive, well-bred, clever woman who now hung upon his arm. The tears
                        came into Jennie&apos;s eyes; she wished, for the moment, that she might
                        die. It would be better so. Meanwhile Lester was dancing with Mrs. Gerald,
                        or sitting out between the waltzes talking over old times, old places, and
                        old friends. As he looked at Letty he marveled at her youth and beauty. She
                        was more developed than formerly, but still as slender and shapely as Diana.
                        She had strength, too, in this smooth body of hers, and her black eyes were
                        liquid and lusterful.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I swear, Letty,&quot; he said impulsively,
                        &quot;you&apos;re really more beautiful than ever. You&apos;re
                        exquisite. You&apos;ve grown younger instead of older.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think so?&quot; she smiled, looking up into his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know I do, or I wouldn&apos;t say so. I&apos;m not much
                        on philandering.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Lester, you bear, can&apos;t you allow a woman just a
                        little coyness? Don&apos;t you know we all love to sip our praise, and
                        not be compelled to swallow it in one great mouthful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the point?&quot; he asked. &quot;What did I
                        say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nothing. You&apos;re such a bear. You&apos;re such a
                        big, determined, straightforward boy. But never mind. I like you.
                        That&apos;s enough, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It surely is,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>They strolled into the garden as the music ceased, and he squeezed her arm
                        softly. He couldn&apos;t help it; she made him feel as if he owned her.
                        She wanted him to feel that way. She said to herself, as they sat looking at
                        the lanterns in the gardens, that if ever he were free, and would come to
                        her, she would take him. She was almost ready to take him anyhowonly he
                        probably wouldn&apos;t. He was so straight-laced, so considerate. He <pb
                            id="VAA2406-327" n="[320]"/> wouldn&apos;t, like so many other men
                        she knew, do a mean thing. He couldn&apos;t. Finally Lester rose and
                        excused himself. He and Jennie were going farther up the Nile in the
                        morningtoward Karnak and Thebes and the water-washed temples at Phyl. They
                        would have to start at an unearthly early hour, and he must get to bed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When are you going home?&quot; asked Mrs. Gerald, ruefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In September.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you engaged your passage?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; we sail from Hamburg on the ninththe <hi rend="i"
                        >Fulda.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I may be going back in the fall,&quot; laughed Letty.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t be surprised if I crowd in on the same boat with
                        you. I&apos;m very unsettled in my mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come along, for goodness sake,&quot; replied Lester.
                        &quot;I hope you do. . . . I&apos;ll see you to-morrow before we
                        leave.&quot; He paused, and she looked at him wistfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cheer up,&quot; he said, taking her hand. &quot;You never
                        can tell what life will do. We sometimes find ourselves right when we
                        thought we were all wrong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was thinking that she was sorry to lose him, and he was sorry that she was
                        not in a position to have what she wanted. As for himself, he was saying
                        that here was one solution that probably he would never accept; yet it was a
                        solution. Why had he not seen this years before?</p>
                    <p>&quot;And yet she wasn&apos;t as beautiful then as she is now, nor as
                        wise, nor as wealthy.&quot; Maybe! Maybe! But he couldn&apos;t be
                        unfaithful to Jennie nor wish her any bad luck. She had had enough without
                        his willing, and had borne it bravely.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XLVII</head>
                    <p>THE trip home did bring another week with Mrs. Gerald, for after mature
                        consideration she had decided to venture to America for a while. Chicago and
                        Cincinnati were her destinations, and she hoped to see more of Lester. Her
                        presence was a good deal of a surprise to Jennie, and it started her
                        thinking again. She could see what the point was. If she were out of the way
                        Mrs. Gerald would marry Lester; that was certain. As it waswell, the
                        question was a complicated one. Letty was Lester&apos;s natural mate, so
                        far as birth, breeding, and position went. And yet Jennie felt instinctively
                        that, on the large human side, Lester preferred her. Perhaps time would
                        solve the problem; in the mean time the little party of three continued to
                        remain excellent friends. When they reached Chicago Mrs. Gerald went her
                        way, and Jennie and Lester took up the customary thread of their existence.</p>
                    <p>On his return from Europe Lester set to work in earnest to find a business
                        opening. None of the big companies made him any overtures, principally
                        because he was considered a strong man who was looking for a control in
                        anything he touched. The nature of his altered fortunes had not been made
                        public. All the little companies that he investigated were having a
                        hand-to-mouth existence, or manufacturing a product which was not
                        satisfactory to him. He did find one company in a small town in northern
                        Indiana which looked as though it might have a future. It was controlled by
                        a practical builder of wagons and carriages <pb id="VAA2406-329" n="322"/>
                        such as Lester&apos;s father had been in his daywho, however, was not a
                        good business man. He was making some small money on an investment of
                        fifteen thousand dollars and a plant worth, say, twenty-five thousand.
                        Lester felt that something could be done here if proper methods were pursued
                        and business acumen exercised. It would be slow work. There would never be a
                        great fortune in it. Not in his lifetime. He was thinking of making an offer
                        to the small manufacturer when the first rumors of a carriage trust reached
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Robert had gone ahead rapidly with his scheme for reorganizing the carriage
                        trade. He showed his competitors how much greater profits could be made
                        through consolidation than through a mutually destructive rivalry. So
                        convincing were his arguments that one by one the big carriage manufacturing
                        companies fell into line. Within a few months the deal had been pushed
                        through, and Robert found himself president of the United Carriage and Wagon
                        Manufacturers&apos; Association, with a capital stock of ten million
                        dollars, and with assets aggregating nearly three-fourths of that sum at a
                        forced sale. He was a happy man.</p>
                    <p>While all this was going forward Lester was completely in the dark. His trip
                        to Europe prevented him from seeing three or four minor notices in the
                        newspapers of some of the efforts that were being made to unite the various
                        carriage and wagon manufactories. He returned to Chicago to learn that
                        Jefferson Midgely, Imogene&apos;s husband, was still in full charge of
                        the branch and living in Evanston, but because of his quarrel with his
                        family he was in no position to get the news direct. Accident brought it
                        fast enough, however, and that rather irritatingly.</p>
                    <p>The individual who conveyed this information was none other than Mr. Henry
                        Bracebridge, of Cleveland, into whom he ran at the Union Club one evening
                        after he had been in the city a month.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-330" n="323"/>
                    <p>&quot;I hear you&apos;re out of the old company,&quot;
                        Bracebridge remarked, smiling blandly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Lester, &quot;I&apos;m out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you up to now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I have a deal of my own under consideration. I&apos;m
                        thinking something of handling an independent concern.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Surely you won&apos;t run counter to your brother? He has a
                        pretty good thing in that combination of his.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Combination! I hadn&apos;t heard of it,&quot; said Lester.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve just got back from Europe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you want to wake up, Lester,&quot; replied Bracebridge.
                        &quot;He&apos;s got the biggest thing in your line. I thought you
                        knew all about it. The Lyman-Winthrop Company, the Myer - Brooks Company,
                        the Woods Companyin fact, five or six of the big companies are all in. Your
                        brother was elected president of the new concern. I dare say he cleaned up a
                        couple of millions out of the deal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester stared. His glance hardened a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;s fine for Robert. I&apos;m glad of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Bracebridge could see that he had given him a vital stab.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, so long, old man,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;When
                        you&apos;re in Cleveland look us up. You know how fond my wife is of
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; replied Lester. &quot;By-by.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He strolled away to the smoking-room, but the news took all the zest out of
                        his private venture. Where would he be with a shabby little wagon company
                        and his brother president of a carriage trust? Good heavens! Robert could
                        put him out of business in a year. Why, he himself had dreamed of such a
                        combination as this. Now his brother had done it.</p>
                    <p>It is one thing to have youth, courage, and a fighting spirit to meet the
                        blows with which fortune often afflicts the talented. It is quite another to
                        see middle age coming <pb id="VAA2406-331" n="324"/> on, your principal
                        fortune possibly gone, and avenue after avenue of opportunity being sealed
                        to you on various sides. Jennie&apos;s obvious social insufficiency, the
                        quality of newspaper reputation which had now become attached to her, his
                        father&apos;s opposition and death, the loss of his fortune, the loss of
                        his connection with the company, his brother&apos;s attitude, this
                        trust, all combined in a way to dishearten and discourage him. He tried to
                        keep a brave faceand he had succeeded thus far, he thought, admirably, but
                        this last blow appeared for the time being a little too much. He went home,
                        the same evening that he heard the news, sorely disheartened. Jennie saw it.
                        She realized it, as a matter of fact, all during the evening that he was
                        away. She felt blue and despondent herself. When he came home she saw what
                        it wassomething had happened to him. Her first impulse was to say,
                        &quot;What is the matter, Lester?&quot; but her next and sounder one
                        was to ignore it until he was ready to speak, if ever. She tried not to let
                        him see that she saw, coming as near as she might affectionately without
                        disturbing him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Vesta is so delighted with herself to-day,&quot; she
                        volunteered by way of diversion. &quot;She got such nice marks in
                        school.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s good,&quot; he replied solemnly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And she dances beautifully these days. She showed me some of her
                        new dances to-night. You haven&apos;t any idea how sweet she
                        looks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad of it,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;I always
                        wanted her to be perfect in that. It&apos;s time she was going into some
                        good girls&apos; school, I think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And papa gets in such a rage. I have to laugh. She teases him about
                        itthe little imp. She offered to teach him to dance to-night. If he
                        didn&apos;t love her so he&apos;d box her ears.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can see that,&quot; said Lester, smiling. &quot;Him
                        dancing! That&apos;s pretty good!&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s not the least bit disturbed by his storming,
                        either.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good for her,&quot; said Lester. He was very fond of Vesta, who
                        was now quite a girl.</p>
                    <p>So Jennie tripped on until his mood was modified a little, and then some
                        inkling of what had happened came out. It was when they were retiring for
                        the night. &quot;Robert&apos;s formulated a pretty big thing in a
                        financial way since we&apos;ve been away,&quot; he volunteered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Jennie, all ears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;s gotten up a carriage trust. It&apos;s
                        something which will take in every manufactory of any importance in the
                        country. Bracebridge was telling me that Robert was made president, and that
                        they have nearly eight millions in capital.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t say!&quot; replied Jennie. &quot;Well,
                        then you won&apos;t want to do much with your new company, will
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; there&apos;s nothing in that, just now,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Later on I fancy it may be all right. I&apos;ll wait and see
                        how this thing comes out. You never can tell what a trust like that will
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie was intensely sorry. She had never heard Lester complain before. It
                        was a new note. She wished sincerely that she might do something to comfort
                        him, but she knew that her efforts were useless. &quot;Oh,
                        well,&quot; she said, &quot;there are so many interesting things in
                        this world. If I were you I wouldn&apos;t be in a hurry to do anything,
                        Lester. You have so much time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She didn&apos;t trust herself to say anything more, and he felt that it
                        was useless to worry. Why should he? After all, he had an ample income that
                        was absolutely secure for two years yet. He could have more if he wanted it.
                        Only his brother was moving so dazzlingly onward, while he was standing
                        stillperhaps &quot;drifting&quot; would be the better word. It did
                        seem a pity; worst of all, he was beginning to feel a little uncertain of
                        himself.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XLVIII</head>
                    <p>LESTER had been doing some pretty hard thinking, but so far he had been
                        unable to formulate any feasible plan for his re-entrance into active life.
                        The successful organization of Robert&apos;s carriage trade trust had
                        knocked in the head any further thought on his part of taking an interest in
                        the small Indiana wagon manufactory. He could not be expected to sink his
                        sense of pride and place, and enter a petty campaign for business success
                        with a man who was so obviously his financial superior. He had looked up the
                        details of the combination, and he found that Bracebridge had barely
                        indicated how wonderfully complete it was. There were millions in the
                        combine. It would have every little manufacturer by the throat. Should he
                        begin now in a small way and &quot;pike along&quot; in the shadow of
                        his giant brother? He couldn&apos;t see it. It was too ignominious. He
                        would be running around the country trying to fight a new trust, with his
                        own brother as his tolerant rival and his own rightful capital arrayed
                        against him. It couldn&apos;t be done. Better sit still for the time
                        being. Something else might show up. If notwell, he had his independent
                        income and the right to come back into the Kane Company if he wished. Did he
                        wish? The question was always with him.</p>
                    <p>It was while Lester was in this mood, drifting, that he received a visit from
                        Samuel E. Ross, a real estate dealer, whose great, wooden signs might be
                        seen everywhere on the windy stretches of prairie about the city. Lester had
                        seen Ross once or twice at the Union Club, where he <pb id="VAA2406-334"
                            n="327"/> had been pointed out as a daring and successful real estate
                        speculator, and he had noticed his rather conspicuous offices at La Salle
                        and Washington streets. Ross was a magnetic-looking person of about
                        fifty-years of age, tall, black-bearded, black-eyed, an arched,
                        wide-nostriled nose, and hair that curled naturally, almost electrically.
                        Lester was impressed with his lithe, cat-like figure, and his long, thin,
                        impressive white hands.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ross had a real estate proposition to lay before Mr. Kane. Of course Mr.
                        Kane knew who he was. And Mr. Ross admitted fully that he knew all about Mr.
                        Kane. Recently, in conjunction with Mr. Norman Yale, of the wholesale
                        grocery firm of Yale, Simpson &amp; Rice, he had developed
                        &quot;Yalewood.&quot; Mr. Kane knew of that?</p>
                    <p>Yes, Mr. Kane knew of that.</p>
                    <p>Only within six weeks the last lots in the Ridgewood section of
                        &quot;Yalewood&quot; had been closed out at a total profit of
                        forty-two per cent. He went over a list of other deals in real estate which
                        he had put through, all well-known properties. He admitted frankly that
                        there were failures in the business; he had had one or two himself. But the
                        successes far outnumbered the bad speculations, as every one knew. Now
                        Lester was no longer connected with the Kane Company. He was probably
                        looking for a good investment, and Mr. Ross had a proposition to lay before
                        him. Lester consented to listen, and Mr. Ross blinked his cat-like eyes and
                        started in.</p>
                    <p>The idea was that he and Lester should enter into a one-deal partnership,
                        covering the purchase and development of a forty-acre tract of land lying
                        between Fifty-fifth, Seventy-first, Halstead streets, and Ashland Avenue, on
                        the southwest side. There were indications of a genuine real estate boom
                        therehealthy, natural, and permanent. The city was about to pave Fifty-fifth
                        Street. There was a plan to extend the Halstead Street <pb id="VAA2406-335"
                            n="328"/> car line far below its present terminus. The Chicago,
                        Burlington &amp; Quincy, which ran near there, would be glad to put a
                        passenger station on the property. The initial cost of the land would be
                        forty thousand dollars which they would share equally. Grading, paving,
                        lighting, tree planting, surveying would cost, roughly, an additional
                        twenty-five thousand. There would be expenses for advertisingsay ten per
                        cent. of the total investment for two years, or perhaps threea total of
                        nineteen thousand five hundred or twenty thousand dollars. All told, they
                        would stand to invest jointly the sum of ninety-five thousand, or possibly
                        one hundred thousand dollars, of which Lester&apos;s share would be
                        fifty thousand. Then Mr. Ross began to figure on the profits.</p>
                    <p>The character of the land, its salability, and the likelihood of a rise in
                        value could be judged by the property adjacent, the sales that had been made
                        north of Fiftyfifth Street and east of Halstead. Take, for instance, the
                        Mortimer plot, at Halstead and Fifty-fifth streets, on the southeast corner.
                        Here was a piece of land that in 1882 was held at forty-five dollars an
                        acre. In 1886 it had risen to five hundred dollars an acre, as attested by
                        its sale to a Mr. John L. Slosson at that time. In 1889, three years later,
                        it had been sold to Mr. Mortimer for one thousand per acre, precisely the
                        figure at which this tract was now offered. It could be parceled out into
                        lots fifty by one hundred feet at five hundred dollars per lot. Was there
                        any profit in that?</p>
                    <p>Lester admitted that there was.</p>
                    <p>Ross went on, somewhat boastfully, to explain just how real estate profits
                        were made. It was useless for any outsider to rush into the game, and
                        imagine that he could do in a few weeks or years what trained real estate
                        speculators like himself had been working on for a quarter of a century.
                        There was something in prestige, something in taste, something in psychic
                        apprehension.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-336" n="[329]"/>
                    <p>Supposing that they went into the deal, he, Ross, would be the presiding
                        genius. He had a trained staff, he controlled giant contractors, he had
                        friends in the tax office, in the water office, and in the various other
                        city departments which made or marred city improvements. If Lester would
                        come in with him he would make him some moneyhow much he would not say
                        exactlyfifty thousand dollars at the lowestone hundred and fifty to two
                        hundred thousand in all likelihood. Would Lester let him go into details,
                        and explain just how the scheme could be worked out? After a few days of
                        quiet cogitation, Lester decided to accede to Mr. Ross&apos;s request;
                        he would look into this thing.</p>
                </div2>
                <pb id="VAA2406-337" n="330"/>
                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>CHAPTER XLIX</head>
                    <p>THE peculiarity of this particular proposition was that it had the basic
                        elements of success. Mr. Ross had the experience and the judgment which were
                        quite capable of making a success of almost anything he undertook. He was in
                        a field which was entirely familiar. He could convince almost any able man
                        if he could get his ear sufficiently long to lay his facts before him.</p>
                    <p>Lester was not convinced at first, although, generally speaking, he was
                        interested in real estate propositions. He liked land. He considered it a
                        sound investment providing you did not get too much of it. He had never
                        invested in any, or scarcely any, solely because he had not been in a realm
                        where real estate propositions were talked of. As it was he was landless
                        and, in a way, jobless.</p>
                    <p>He rather liked Mr. Ross and his way of doing business. It was easy to verify
                        his statements, and he did verify them in several particulars. There were
                        his signs out on the prairie stretches, and here were his ads in the daily
                        papers. It seemed not a bad way at all in his idleness to start and make
                        some money.</p>
                    <p>The trouble with Lester was that he had reached the time where he was not as
                        keen for details as he had formerly been. All his work in recent yearsin
                        fact, from the very beginninghad been with large propositions, the
                        purchasing of great quantities of supplies, the placing of large orders, the
                        discussion of things which were wholesale and which had very little to do
                        with the minor details which make up the special interests of the <pb
                            id="VAA2406-338" n="331"/> smaller traders of the world. In the factory
                        his brother Robert had figured the pennies and nickels of labor-cost, had
                        seen to it that all the little leaks were shut off. Lester had been left to
                        deal with larger things, and he had consistently done so. When it came to
                        this particular proposition his interest was in the wholesale phases of it,
                        not the petty details of selling. He could not help seeing that Chicago was
                        a growing city, and that land values must rise. What was now far-out prairie
                        property would soon, in the course of a few years, be well built-up suburban
                        residence territory. Scarcely any land that could be purchased now would
                        fall in value. It might drag in sales or increase, but it couldn&apos;t
                        fall. Ross convinced him of this. He knew it of his own judgment to be true.</p>
                    <p>The several things on which he did not speculate sufficiently were the life
                        or health of Mr. Ross; the chance that some obnoxious neighborhood growth
                        would affect the territory he had selected as residence territory; the fact
                        that difficult money situations might reduce real estate valuesin fact,
                        bring about a flurry of real estate liquidation which would send prices
                        crashing down and cause the failure of strong promoters, even such promoters
                        for instance, as Mr. Samuel E. Ross.</p>
                    <p>For several months he studied the situation as presented by his new guide and
                        mentor, and then, having satisfied himself that he was reasonably safe,
                        decided to sell some of the holdings which were netting him a beggarly six
                        per cent and invest in this new proposition. The first cash outlay was
                        twenty thousand dollars for the land, which was taken over under an
                        operative agreement between himself and Ross; this was run indefinitelyso
                        long as there was any of this land left to sell. The next thing was to raise
                        twelve thousand five hundred dollars for improvements, which he did, and
                        then to furnish some twenty-five hundred dollars more for taxes and
                        unconsidered expenses, items which had <pb id="VAA2406-339" n="332"/> come
                        up in carrying out the improvement work which had been planned. It seemed
                        that hard and soft earth made a difference in grading costs, that trees
                        would not always flourish as expected, that certain members of the city
                        water and gas departments had to be &quot;seen&quot; and
                        &quot;fixed&quot; before certain other improvements could be
                        effected. Mr. Ross attended to all this, but the cost of the proceedings was
                        something which had to be discussed, and Lester heard it all.</p>
                    <p>After the land was put in shape, about a year after the original
                        conversation, it was necessary to wait until spring for the proper
                        advertising and booming of the new section; and this advertising began to
                        call at once for the third payment. Lester disposed of an additional fifteen
                        thousand dollars worth of securities in order to follow this venture to its
                        logical and profitable conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Up to this time he was rather pleased with his venture. Ross had certainly
                        been thorough and business-like in his handling of the various details. The
                        land was put in excellent shape. It was given a rather attractive
                        title&quot;Inwood,&quot; although, as Lester noted, there was
                        precious little wood anywhere around there. But Ross assured him that people
                        looking for a suburban residence would be attracted by the name; seeing the
                        vigorous efforts in tree-planting that had been made to provide for shade in
                        the future, they would take the will for the deed. Lester smiled.</p>
                    <p>The first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the form of a
                        rumor that the International Packing Company, one of the big constituent
                        members of the packing house combination at Halstead and Thirty-ninth
                        streets, had determined to desert the old group and lay out a new packing
                        area for itself. The papers explained that the company intended to go
                        farther south, probably below Fifty-fifth Street and west of Ashland Avenue.
                        This was the territory that was located due <pb id="VAA2406-340" n="333"/>
                        west of Lester&apos;s property, and the mere suspicion that the packing
                        company might invade the territory was sufficient to blight the prospects of
                        any budding real estate deal.</p>
                    <p>Ross was beside himself with rage. He decided, after quick deliberation, that
                        the best thing to do would be to boom the property heavily, by means of
                        newspaper advertising, and see if it could not be disposed of before any
                        additional damage was likely to be done to it. He laid the matter before
                        Lester, who agreed that this would be advisable. They had already expended
                        six thousand dollars in advertising, and now the additional sum of three
                        thousand dollars was spent in ten days, to make it appear that Inwood was an
                        ideal residence section, equipped with every modern convenience for the
                        home-lover, and destined to be one of the most exclusive and beautiful
                        suburbs of the city. It was &quot;no go.&quot; A few lots were sold,
                        but the rumor that the International Packing Company might come was
                        persistent and deadly; from any point of view, save that of a foreign
                        population neighborhood, the enterprise was a failure.</p>
                    <p>To say that Lester was greatly disheartened by this blow is to put it mildly.
                        Practically fifty thousand dollars, two-thirds of all his earthly
                        possessions, outside of his stipulated annual income, was tied up here; and
                        there were taxes to pay, repairs to maintain, actual depreciation in value
                        to face. He suggested to Ross that the area might be sold at its cost value,
                        or a loan raised on it, and the whole enterprise abandoned; but that
                        experienced real estate dealer was not so sanguine. He had had one or two
                        failures of this kind before. He was superstitious about anything which did
                        not go smoothly from the beginning. If it didn&apos;t go it was a
                        hoodooa black shadowand he wanted no more to do with it. Other real estate
                        men, as he knew to his cost, were of the same opinion.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-341" n="[334]"/>
                    <p>Some three years later the property was sold under the sheriff&apos;s
                        hammer. Lester, having put in fifty thousand dollars all told, recovered a
                        trifle more than eighteen thousand; and some of his wise friends assured him
                        that he was lucky in getting off so easily.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER L</head>
                    <p>WHILE the real estate deal was in progress Mrs. Gerald decided to move to
                        Chicago. She had been staying in Cincinnati for a few months, and had
                        learned a great deal as to the real facts of Lester&apos;s irregular
                        mode of life. The question whether or not he was really married to Jennie
                        remained an open one. The garbled details of Jennie&apos;s early years,
                        the fact that a Chicago paper had written him up as a young millionaire who
                        was sacrificing his fortune for love of her, the certainty that Robert had
                        practically eliminated him from any voice in the Kane Company, all came to
                        her ears. She hated to think that Lester was making such a sacrifice of
                        himself. He had let nearly a year slip by without doing anything. In two
                        more years his chance would be gone. He had said to her in London that he
                        was without many illusions. Was Jennie one? Did he really love her, or was
                        he just sorry for her? Letty wanted very much to find out for sure.</p>
                    <p>The house that Mrs. Gerald leased in Chicago was a most imposing one on
                        Drexel Boulevard. &quot;I&apos;m going to take a house in your town
                        this winter, and I hope to see a lot of you,&quot; she wrote to Lester.
                        &quot;I&apos;m awfully bored with life here in Cincinnati. After
                        Europe it&apos;s sowell, you know. I saw Mrs. Knowles on Saturday. She
                        asked after you. You ought to know that you have a loving friend in her. Her
                        daughter is going to marry Jimmy Severance in the spring.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester thought of her coming with mingled feelings of pleasure and
                        uncertainty. She would be entertaining <pb id="VAA2406-343" n="336"/>
                        largely, of course. Would she foolishly begin by attempting to invite him
                        and Jennie? Surely not. She must know the truth by this time. Her letter
                        indicated as much. She spoke of seeing a lot of him. That meant that Jennie
                        would have to be eliminated. He would have to make a clean breast of the
                        whole affair to Letty. Then she could do as she pleased about their future
                        intimacy. Seated in Letty&apos;s comfortable boudoir one afternoon,
                        facing a vision of loveliness in pale yellow, he decided that he might as
                        well have it out with her. She would understand. Just at this time he was
                        beginning to doubt the outcome of the real estate deal, and consequently he
                        was feeling a little blue, and, as a concomitant, a little confidential. He
                        could not as yet talk to Jennie about his troubles.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know, Lester,&quot; said Letty, by way of helping him to
                        his confessionthe maid had brought tea for her and some brandy and soda for
                        him, and departed&quot;that I have been hearing a lot of things about
                        you since I&apos;ve been back in this country. Aren&apos;t you going
                        to tell me all about yourself? You know I have your real interests at
                        heart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have you been hearing, Letty?&quot; he asked, quietly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, about your father&apos;s will for one thing, and the fact
                        that you&apos;re out of the company, and some gossip about Mrs. Kane
                        which doesn&apos;t interest me very much. You know what I mean.
                        Aren&apos;t you going to straighten things out, so that you can have
                        what rightfully belongs to you? It seems to me such a great sacrifice,
                        Lester, unless, of course, you are very much in love. Are you?&quot; she
                        asked archly.</p>
                    <p>Lester paused and deliberated before replying. &quot;I really
                        don&apos;t know how to answer that last question, Letty,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;Sometimes I think that I love her; sometimes I wonder
                        whether I do or not. I&apos;m going to be perfectly frank with you. I
                        was never in such a curious <pb id="VAA2406-344" n="337"/> position in my
                        life before. You like me so much, and Iwell, I don&apos;t say what I
                        think of you,&quot; he smiled. &quot;But anyhow, I can talk to you
                        frankly. I&apos;m not married.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought as much,&quot; she said, as he paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I&apos;m not married because I have never been able to make
                        up my mind just what to do about it. When I first met Jennie I thought her
                        the most entrancing girl I had ever laid eyes on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That speaks volumes for my charms at that time,&quot;
                        interrupted his <hi rend="i">vis-a-vis.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t interrupt me if you want to hear this,&quot; he
                        smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me one thing,&quot; she questioned, &quot;and then I
                        won&apos;t. Was that in Cleveland?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So I heard,&quot; she assented.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There was something about her so&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Love at first sight,&quot; again interpolated Letty foolishly.
                        Her heart was hurting her. &quot;I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you going to let me tell this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pardon me, Lester. I can&apos;t help a twinge or two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, anyhow, I lost my head. I thought she was the most perfect
                        thing under the sun, even if she was a little out of my world. This is a
                        democratic country. I thought that I could just take her, and thenwell, you
                        know. That is where I made my mistake. I didn&apos;t think that would
                        prove as serious as it did. I never cared for any other woman but you before
                        andI&apos;ll be frankI didn&apos;t know whether I wanted to marry
                        you. I thought I didn&apos;t want to marry any woman. I said to myself
                        that I could just take Jennie, and then, after a while, when things had
                        quieted down some, we could separate. She would be well provided for. I
                        wouldn&apos;t care very much. She wouldn&apos;t care. You
                        understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I understand,&quot; replied his confessor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you see, Letty, it hasn&apos;t worked out that way. <pb
                            id="VAA2406-345" n="338"/> She&apos;s a woman of a curious
                        temperament. She possesses a world of feeling and emotion. She&apos;s
                        not educated in the sense in which we understand that word, but she has
                        natural refinement and tact. She&apos;s a good housekeeper.
                        She&apos;s an ideal mother. She&apos;s the most affectionate
                        creature under the sun. Her devotion to her mother and father was beyond
                        words. Her love for her daughtershe&apos;s hers, not mineis perfect. She
                        hasn&apos;t any of the graces of the smart society woman. She
                        isn&apos;t quick at repartee. She can&apos;t join in any rapid-fire
                        conversation. She thinks rather slowly, I imagine. Some of her big thoughts
                        never come to the surface at all, but you can feel that she is thinking and
                        that she is feeling.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You pay her a lovely tribute, Lester,&quot; said Letty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ought to,&quot; he replied. &quot;She&apos;s a good
                        woman, Letty; but, for all that I have said, I sometimes think that
                        it&apos;s only sympathy that&apos;s holding me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be too sure,&quot; she said warningly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but I&apos;ve gone through with a great deal. The thing
                        for me to have done was to have married her in the first place. There have
                        been so many entanglements since, so much rowing and discussion, that
                        I&apos;ve rather lost my bearings. This will of father&apos;s
                        complicates matters. I stand to lose eight hundred thousand if I marry
                        herreally, a great deal more, now that the company has been organized into a
                        trust. I might better say two millions. If I don&apos;t marry her, I
                        lose everything outright in about two more years. Of course, I might pretend
                        that I have separated from her, but I don&apos;t care to lie. I
                        can&apos;t work it out that way without hurting her feelings, and
                        she&apos;s been the soul of devotion. Right down in my heart, at this
                        minute, I don&apos;t know whether I want to give her up. Honestly, I
                        don&apos;t know what the devil to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester looked, lit a cigar in a far-off, speculative fashion, and looked out
                        of the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was there ever such a problem?&quot; questioned Letty, <pb
                            id="VAA2406-346" n="339"/> staring at the floor. She rose, after a few
                        moments of silence, and put her hands on his round, solid head. Her yellow,
                        silken house-gown, faintly scented, touched his shoulders. &quot;Poor
                        Lester,&quot; she said. &quot;You certainly have tied yourself up in
                        a knot. But it&apos;s a Gordian knot, my dear, and it will have to be
                        cut. Why don&apos;t you discuss this whole thing with her, just as you
                        have with me, and see how she feels about it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems such an unkind thing to do,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must take some action, Lester dear,&quot; she insisted.
                        &quot;You can&apos;t just drift. You are doing yourself such a great
                        injustice. Frankly, I can&apos;t advise you to marry her; and
                        I&apos;m not speaking for myself in that, though I&apos;ll take you
                        gladly, even if you did forsake me in the first place. I&apos;ll be
                        perfectly honestwhether you ever come to me or notI love you, and always
                        shall love you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know it,&quot; said Lester, getting up. He took her hands in
                        his, and studied her face curiously. Then he turned away. Letty paused to
                        get her breath. His action discomposed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;re too big a man, Lester, to settle down on ten
                        thousand a year,&quot; she continued. &quot;You&apos;re too much
                        of a social figure to drift. You ought to get back into the social and
                        financial world where you belong. All that&apos;s happened
                        won&apos;t injure you, if you reclaim your interest in the company. You
                        can dictate your own terms. And if you tell her the truth she won&apos;t
                        object, I&apos;m sure. If she cares for you, as you think she does, she
                        will be glad to make this sacrifice. I&apos;m positive of that. You can
                        provide for her handsomely, of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t the money that Jennie wants,&quot; said
                        Lester, gloomily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, even if it isn&apos;t, she can live without you; and she
                        can live better for having an ample income.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She will never want if I can help it,&quot; he said solemnly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must leave her,&quot; she urged, with a new touch of <pb
                            id="VAA2406-347" n="340"/> decisiveness. &quot;You must. Every day
                        is precious with you, Lester! Why don&apos;t you make up your mind to
                        act at onceto-day, for that matter? Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so fast,&quot; he protested. &quot;This is a ticklish
                        business. To tell you the truth, I hate to do it. It seems so brutalso
                        unfair. I&apos;m not one to run around and discuss my affairs with other
                        people. I&apos;ve refused to talk about this to any one heretoforemy
                        father, my mother, any one. But somehow you have always seemed closer to me
                        than any one else, and, since I met you this time, I have felt as though I
                        ought to explainI have really wanted to. I care for you. I don&apos;t
                        know whether you understand how that can be under the circumstances. But I
                        do. You&apos;re nearer to me intellectually and emotionally than I
                        thought you were. Don&apos;t frown. You want the truth, don&apos;t
                        you? Well, there you have it. Now explain me to myself, if you
                        can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to argue with you, Lester,&quot; she said
                        softly, laying her hand on his arm. &quot;I merely want to love you. I
                        understand quite well how it has all come about. I&apos;m sorry for
                        myself. I&apos;m sorry for you. I&apos;m sorry&quot; she
                        hesitated&quot; for Mrs. Kane. She&apos;s a charming woman. I like
                        her. I really do. But she isn&apos;t the woman for you, Lester; she
                        really isn&apos;t. You need another type. It seems so unfair for us two
                        to discuss her in this way, but really it isn&apos;t. We all have to
                        stand on our merits. And I&apos;m satisfied, if the facts in this case
                        were put before her, as you have put them before me, she would see just how
                        it all is, and agree. She can&apos;t want to harm you. Why, Lester, if I
                        were in her position I would let you go. I would, truly. I think you know
                        that I would. Any good woman would. It would hurt me, but I&apos;d do
                        it. It will hurt her, but she&apos;ll do it. Now, mark you my words, she
                        will. I think I understand her as well as you dobetterfor I am a woman.
                        Oh,&quot; she said, pausing, &quot;I wish I were in a position to
                        talk to her. I could make her understand.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-348" n="[341]"/>
                    <p>Lester looked at Letty, wondering at her eagerness. She was beautiful,
                        magnetic, immensely worth while.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not so fast,&quot; he repeated. &quot;I want to think about
                        this. I have some time yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused, a little crestfallen but determined.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is the time to act,&quot; she repeated, her whole soul in
                        her eyes. She wanted this man, and she was not ashamed to let him see that
                        she wanted him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll think of it,&quot; he said uneasily, then,
                        rather hastily, he bade her good-by and went away.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LI</head>
                    <p>LESTER had thought of his predicament earnestly enough, and he would have
                        been satisfied to act soon if it had not been that one of those disrupting
                        influences which sometimes complicate our affairs entered into his Hyde Park
                        domicile. Gerhardt&apos;s health began rapidly to fail.</p>
                    <p>Little by little he had been obliged to give up his various duties about the
                        place; finally he was obliged to take to his bed. He lay in his room,
                        devotedly attended by Jennie and visited constantly by Vesta, and
                        occasionally by Lester. There was a window not far from his bed, which
                        commanded a charming view of the lawn and one of the surrounding streets,
                        and through this he would gaze by the hour, wondering how the world was
                        getting on without him. He suspected that Woods, the coachman, was not
                        looking after the horses and harnesses as well as he should, that the
                        newspaper carrier was getting negligent in his delivery of the papers, that
                        the furnace man was wasting coal, or was not giving them enough heat. A
                        score of little petty worries, which were nevertheless real enough to him.
                        He knew how a house should be kept. He was always rigid in his performance
                        of his self-appointed duties, and he was so afraid that things would not go
                        right. Jennie made for him a most imposing and sumptuous dressing-gown of
                        basted wool, covered with dark-blue silk, and bought him a pair of soft,
                        thick, wool slippers to match, but he did not wear them often. He preferred
                        to lie in bed, read his Bible and the Lutheran papers, and ask Jennie how
                        things were getting along.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-350" n="343"/>
                    <p>&quot;I want you should go down in the basement and see what that feller
                        is doing. He&apos;s not giving us any heat,&quot; he would complain.
                        &quot;I bet I know what he does. He sits down there and reads, and then
                        he forgets what the fire is doing until it is almost out. The beer is right
                        there where he can take it. You should lock it up. You don&apos;t know
                        what kind of a man he is. He may be no good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie would protest that the house was fairly comfortable, that the man was
                        a nice, quiet, respectable looking Americanthat if he did drink a little
                        beer it would not matter. Gerhardt would immediately become incensed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is always the way,&quot; he declared vigorously.
                        &quot;You have no sense of economy. You are always so ready to let
                        things go if I am not there. He is a nice man! How do you know he is a nice
                        man? Does he keep the fire up? No! Does he keep the walks clean? If you
                        don&apos;t watch him he will be just like the others, no good. You
                        should go around and see how things are for yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right, papa,&quot; she would reply in a genial effort to
                        soothe him, &quot;I will. Please don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ll
                        lock up the beer. Don&apos;t you want a cup of coffee now and some
                        toast?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; Gerhardt would sigh immediately, &quot;my stomach
                        it don&apos;t do right. I don&apos;t know how I am going to come out
                        of this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dr. Makin, the leading physician of the vicinity, and a man of considerable
                        experience and ability, called at Jennie&apos;s request and suggested a
                        few simple thingshot milk, a wine tonic, rest, but he told Jennie that she
                        must not expect too much. &quot;You know he is quite well along in years
                        now. He is quite feeble. If he were twenty years younger we might do a great
                        deal for him. As it is he is quite well off where he is. He may live for
                        some time. He may get up and be around again, and <pb id="VAA2406-351"
                            n="344"/> then he may not. We must all expect these things. I have never
                        any care as to what may happen to me. I am too old myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie felt sorry to think that her father might die, but she was pleased to
                        think that if he must it was going to be under such comfortable
                        circumstances. Here at least he could have every care.</p>
                    <p>It soon became evident that this was Gerhardt&apos;s last illness, and
                        Jennie thought it her duty to communicate with her brothers and sisters. She
                        wrote Bass that his father was not well, and had a letter from him saying
                        that he was very busy and couldn&apos;t come on unless the danger was an
                        immediate one. He went on to say that George was in Rochester, working for a
                        wholesale wall-paper housethe Sheff-Jefferson Company, he thought. Martha
                        and her husband had gone to Boston. Her address was a little suburb named
                        Belmont, just outside the city. William was in Omaha, working for a local
                        electric company. Veronica was married to a man named Albert Sheridan, who
                        was connected with a wholesale drug company in Cleveland. &quot;She
                        never comes to see me,&quot; complained Bass, &quot;but
                        I&apos;ll let her know.&quot; Jennie wrote each one personally. From
                        Veronica and Martha she received brief replies. They were very sorry, and
                        would she let them know if anything happened. George wrote that he could not
                        think of coming to Chicago unless his father was very ill indeed, but that
                        he would like to be informed from time to time how he was getting along.
                        William, as he told Jennie some time afterward, did not get her letter.</p>
                    <p>The progress of the old German&apos;s malady toward final dissolution
                        preyed greatly on Jennie&apos;s mind; for, in spite of the fact that
                        they had been so far apart in times past, they had now grown very close
                        together. Gerhardt had come to realize clearly that his outcast daughter was
                        goodness itselfat least, so far as he was concerned. She never quarreled
                        with him, never crossed <pb id="VAA2406-352" n="345"/> him in any way. Now
                        that he was sick, she was in and out of his room a dozen times in an evening
                        or an afternoon, seeing whether he was &quot;all right,&quot; asking
                        how he liked his breakfast, or his lunch, or his dinner. As he grew weaker
                        she would sit by him and read, or do her sewing in his room. One day when
                        she was straightening his pillow he took her hand and kissed it. He was
                        feeling very weak and despondent. She looked up in astonishment, a lump in
                        her throat. There were tears in his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re a good girl, Jennie,&quot; he said brokenly.
                        &quot;You&apos;ve been good to me. I&apos;ve been hard and
                        cross, but I&apos;m an old man. You forgive me, don&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, papa, please don&apos;t,&quot; she pleaded, tears
                        welling from her eyes. &quot;You know I have nothing to forgive.
                        I&apos;m the one who has been all wrong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; he said; and she sank down on her knees beside
                        him and cried. He put his thin, yellow hand on her hair. &quot;There,
                        there,&quot; he said brokenly, &quot;I understand a lot of things I
                        didn&apos;t. We get wiser as we get older.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She left the room, ostensibly to wash her face and hands, and cried her eyes
                        out. Was he really forgiving her at last? And she had lied to him so! She
                        tried to be more attentive, but that was impossible. But after this
                        reconciliation he seemed happier and more contented, and they spent a number
                        of happy hours together, just talking. Once he said to her, &quot;You
                        know I feel just like I did when I was a boy. If it wasn&apos;t for my
                        bones I could get up and dance on the grass.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie fairly smiled and sobbed in one breath. &quot;You&apos;ll get
                        stronger, papa,&quot; she said. &quot;You&apos;re going to get
                        well. Then I&apos;ll take you out driving.&quot; She was so glad she
                        had been able to make him comfortable these last few years.</p>
                    <p>As for Lester, he was affectionate and considerate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, how is it to-night?&quot; he would ask the moment <pb
                            id="VAA2406-353" n="346"/> he entered the house, and he would always
                        drop in for a few minutes before dinner to see how the old man was getting
                        along. &quot;He looks pretty well,&quot; he would tell Jennie.
                        &quot;He&apos;s apt to live some time yet. I wouldn&apos;t
                        worry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Vesta also spent much time with her grandfather, for she had come to love him
                        dearly. She would bring her books, if it didn&apos;t disturb him too
                        much, and recite some of her lessons, or she would leave his door open, and
                        play for him on the piano. Lester had bought her a handsome music-box also,
                        which she would sometimes carry to his room and play for him. At times he
                        wearied of everything and everybody save Jennie; he wanted to be alone with
                        her. She would sit beside him quite still and sew. She could see plainly
                        that the end was only a little way off.</p>
                    <p>Gerhardt, true to his nature, took into consideration all the various
                        arrangements contingent upon his death. He wished to be buried in the little
                        Lutheran cemetery, which was several miles farther out on the South Side,
                        and he wanted the beloved minister of his church to officiate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want everything plain,&quot; he said. &quot;Just my black
                        suit and those Sunday shoes of mine, and that black string tie. I
                        don&apos;t want anything else. I will be all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie begged him not to talk of it, but he would. One day at four
                        o&apos;clock he had a sudden sinking spell, and at five he was dead.
                        Jennie held his hands, watching his labored breathing; once or twice he
                        opened his eyes to smile at her. &quot;I don&apos;t mind
                        going,&quot; he said, in this final hour. &quot;I&apos;ve done
                        what I could.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t talk of dying, papa,&quot; she pleaded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s the end,&quot; he said. &quot;You&apos;ve
                        been good to me. You&apos;re a good woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She heard no other words from his lips.</p>
                    <p>The finish which time thus put to this troubled life <pb id="VAA2406-354"
                            n="347"/> affected Jennie deeply. Strong in her kindly, emotional
                        relationships, Gerhardt had appealed to her not only as her father, but as a
                        friend and counselor. She saw him now in his true perspective, a
                        hard-working, honest, sincere old German, who had done his best to raise a
                        troublesome family and lead an honest life. Truly she had been his one great
                        burden, and she had never really dealt truthfully with him to the end. She
                        wondered now if where he was he could see that she had lied. And would he
                        forgive her? He had called her a good woman.</p>
                    <p>Telegrams were sent to all the children. Bass wired that he was coming, and
                        arrived the next day. The others wired that they could not come, but asked
                        for details, which Jennie wrote. The Lutheran minister was called in to say
                        prayers and fix the time of the burial service. A fat, smug undertaker was
                        commissioned to arrange all the details. Some few neighborhood friends
                        calledthose who had remained most faithfuland on the second morning
                        following his death the services were held. Lester accompanied Jennie and
                        Vesta and Bass to the little red brick Lutheran church, and sat stolidly
                        through the rather dry services. He listened wearily to the long discourse
                        on the beauties and rewards of a future life and stirred irritably when
                        reference was made to a hell. Bass was rather bored, but considerate. He
                        looked upon his father now much as he would on any other man. Only Jennie
                        wept sympathetically. She saw her father in perspective, the long years of
                        trouble he had had, the days in which he had had to saw wood for a living,
                        the days in which he had lived in a factory loft, the little shabby house
                        they had been compelled to live in in Thirteenth Street, the terrible days
                        of suffering they had spent in Lorrie Street, in Cleveland, his grief over
                        her, his grief over Mrs. Gerhardt, his love and care of Vesta, and finally
                        these last days.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-355" n="348"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he was a good man,&quot; she thought. &quot;He meant so
                        well.&quot; They sang a hymn, &quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our
                        God,&quot; and then she sobbed.</p>
                    <p>Lester pulled at her arm. He was moved to the danger-line himself by her
                        grief. &quot;You&apos;ll have to do better than this,&quot; he
                        whispered. &quot;My God, I can&apos;t stand it. I&apos;ll have
                        to get up and get out.&quot; Jennie quieted a little, but the fact that
                        the last visible ties were being broken between her and her father was
                        almost too much.</p>
                    <p>At the grave in the Cemetery of the Redeemer, where Lester had immediately
                        arranged to purchase a lot, they saw the plain coffin lowered and the earth
                        shoveled in. Lester looked curiously at the bare trees, the brown dead
                        grass, and the brown soil of the prairie turned up at this simple graveside.
                        There was no distinction to this burial plot. It was commonplace and shabby,
                        a workingman&apos;s resting-place, but so long as he wanted it, it was
                        all right. He studied Bass&apos;s keen, lean face, wondering what sort
                        of a career he was cutting out for himself. Bass looked to him like some one
                        who would run a cigar store successfully. He watched Jennie wiping her red
                        eyes, and then he said to himself again, &quot;Well, there is something
                        to her.&quot; The woman&apos;s emotion was so deep, so real.
                        &quot;There&apos;s no explaining a good woman,&quot; he said to
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>On the way home, through the wind-swept, dusty streets, he talked of life in
                        general, Bass and Vesta being present. &quot;Jennie takes things too
                        seriously,&quot; he said. &quot;She&apos;s inclined to be
                        morbid. Life isn&apos;t as bad as she makes out with her sensitive
                        feelings. We all have our troubles, and we all have to stand them, some
                        more, some less. We can&apos;t assume that any one is so much better or
                        worse off than any one else. We all have our share of troubles.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t help it,&quot; said Jennie. &quot;I feel
                        so sorry for some people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jennie always was a little gloomy,&quot; put in Bass. <pb
                            id="VAA2406-356" n="[349]"/> He was thinking what a fine figure of a man
                        Lester was, how beautifully they lived, how Jennie had come up in the world.
                        He was thinking that there must be a lot more to her than he had originally
                        thought. Life surely did turn out queer. At one time he thought Jennie was a
                        hopeless failure and no good.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to try to steel yourself to take things as they come
                        without going to pieces this way,&quot; said Lester finally.</p>
                    <p>Bass thought so too.</p>
                    <p>Jennie stared thoughtfully out of the carriage window. There was the old
                        house now, large and silent without Gerhardt. Just think, she would never
                        see him any more. They finally turned into the drive and entered the
                        library. Jeannette, nervous and sympathetic, served tea. Jennie went to look
                        after various details. She wondered curiously where she would be when she
                        died.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LII</head>
                    <p>THE fact that Gerhardt was dead made no particular difference to Lester,
                        except as it affected Jennie. He had liked the old German for his many
                        sterling qualities, but beyond that he thought nothing of him one way or the
                        other. He took Jennie to a watering-place for ten days to help her recover
                        her spirits, and it was soon after this that he decided to tell her just how
                        things stood with him; he would put the problem plainly before her. It would
                        be easier now, for Jennie had been informed of the disastrous prospects of
                        the real-estate deal. She was also aware of his continued interest in Mrs.
                        Gerald. Lester did not hesitate to let Jennie know that he was on very
                        friendly terms with her. Mrs. Gerald had, at first, formally requested him
                        to bring Jennie to see her, but she never had called herself, and Jennie
                        understood quite clearly that it was not to be. Now that her father was
                        dead, she was beginning to wonder what was going to become of her; she was
                        afraid that Lester might not marry her. Certainly he showed no signs of
                        intending to do so.</p>
                    <p>By one of those curious coincidences of thought, Robert also had reached the
                        conclusion that something should be done. He did not, for one moment,
                        imagine that he could directly work upon Lesterhe did not care to trybut he
                        did think that some influence might be brought to bear on Jennie. She was
                        probably amenable to reason. If Lester had not married her already, she must
                        realize full well that he did not intend to do so. Suppose that some
                        responsible third person were to <pb id="VAA2406-358" n="351"/> approach
                        her, and explain how things were, including, of course, the offer of an
                        independent income? Might she not be willing to leave Lester, and end all
                        this trouble? After all, Lester was his brother, and he ought not to lose
                        his fortune. Robert had things very much in his own hands now, and could
                        afford to be generous. He finally decided that Mr. O&apos;Brien, of
                        Knight, Keatley &amp; O&apos;Brien, would be the proper
                        intermediary, for O&apos;Brien was suave, good-natured, and
                        well-meaning, even if he was a lawyer. He might explain to Jennie very
                        delicately just how the family felt, and how much Lester stood to lose if he
                        continued to maintain his connection with her. If Lester had married Jennie,
                        O&apos;Brien would find it out. A liberal provision would be made for
                        hersay fifty or one hundred thousand, or even one hundred and fifty thousand
                        dollars. He sent for Mr. O&apos;Brien and gave him his instructions. As
                        one of the executors of Archibald Kane&apos;s estate, it was really the
                        lawyer&apos;s duty to look into the matter of Lester&apos;s ultimate
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. O&apos;Brien journeyed to Chicago. On reaching the city, he called up
                        Lester, and found out to his satisfaction that he was out of town for the
                        day. He went out to the house in Hyde Park, and sent in his card to Jennie.
                        She came down-stairs in a few minutes quite unconscious of the import of his
                        message; he greeted her most blandly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is Mrs. Kane?&quot; he asked, with an interlocutory jerk
                        of his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Jennie.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am, as you see by my card, Mr. O&apos;Brien, of Knight,
                        Keatley &amp; O&apos;Brien,&quot; he began. &quot;We are the
                        attorneys and executors of the late Mr. Kane, yourahMr. Kane&apos;s
                        father. You&apos;ll think it&apos;s rather curious, my coming to
                        you, but under your husband&apos;s father&apos;s will there were
                        certain conditions stipulated which affect you and Mr. Kane very materially.
                        These provisions are so important that I think you ought to know about them
                            <pb id="VAA2406-359" n="352"/> that is if Mr. Kane hasn&apos;t
                        already told you. Ipardon mebut the peculiar nature of them makes me
                        conclude thatpossiblyhe hasn&apos;t.&quot; He paused, a very
                        question-mark of a manevery feature of his face an interrogation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t quite understand,&quot; said Jennie.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t know anything about the will. If there&apos;s
                        anything that I ought to know, I suppose Mr. Kane will tell me. He
                        hasn&apos;t told me anything as yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; breathed Mr. O&apos;Brien, highly gratified.
                        &quot;Just as I thought. Now, if you will allow me I&apos;ll go into
                        the matter briefly. Then you can judge for yourself whether you wish to hear
                        the full particulars. Won&apos;t you sit down?&quot; They had both
                        been standing. Jennie seated herself, and Mr. O&apos;Brien pulled up a
                        chair near to hers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now to begin,&quot; he said. &quot;I need not say to you,
                        of course, that there was considerable opposition on the part of Mr.
                        Kane&apos;s father, to thisahunion between yourself and his
                        son.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know&quot; Jennie started to say, but checked herself. She
                        was puzzled, disturbed, and a little apprehensive.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Before Mr. Kane senior died,&quot; he went on, &quot;he
                        indicated to yourahto Mr. Lester Kane, that he felt this way. In his will he
                        made certain conditions governing the distribution of his property which
                        made it rather hard for his son, yourahhusband, to come into his rightful
                        share. Ordinarily, he would have inherited one-fourth of the Kane
                        Manufacturing Company, worth to-day in the neighborhood of a million
                        dollars, perhaps more; also one-fourth of the other properties, which now
                        aggregate something like five hundred thousand dollars. I believe Mr. Kane
                        senior was really very anxious that his son should inherit this property.
                        But owing to the conditions which yourahwhich Mr. Kane&apos;s father
                        made, Mr. Lester Kane cannot possibly obtain his share, except by complying
                        with awith acertain wish which his father had expressed.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-360" n="353"/>
                    <p>Mr. O&apos;Brien paused, his eyes moving back and forth sidewise in their
                        sockets. In spite of the natural prejudice of the situation, he was
                        considerably impressed with Jennie&apos;s pleasing appearance. He could
                        see quite plainly why Lester might cling to her in the face of all
                        opposition. He continued to study her furtively as he sat there waiting for
                        her to speak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what was that wish?&quot; she finally asked, her nerves
                        becoming just a little tense under the strain of the silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad you were kind enough to ask me that,&quot; he went
                        on. &quot;The subject is a very difficult one for me to introducevery
                        difficult. I come as an emissary of the estate, I might say as one of the
                        executors under the will of Mr. Kane&apos;s father. I know how keenly
                        your-ahhow keenly Mr. Kane feels about it. I know how keenly you will
                        probably feel about it. But it is one of those very difficult things which
                        cannot be helpedwhich must be got over somehow. And while I hesitate very
                        much to say so, I must tell you that Mr. Kane senior stipulated in his will
                        that unless, unless&quot;again his eyes were moving sidewise to and
                        fro&quot; he saw fit to separate fromahyou&quot;he paused to get
                        breath&quot; he could not inherit this or any other sumor, at least,
                        only a very minor income of ten thousand a year; and that only on condition
                        that he should marry you.&quot; He paused again. &quot;I should
                        add,&quot; he went on, &quot;that under the will he was given three
                        years in which to indicate his intentions. That time is now drawing to a
                        close.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused, half expecting some outburst of feeling from Jennie, but she only
                        looked at him fixedly, her eyes clouded with surprise, distress,
                        unhappiness. Now she understood. Lester was sacrificing his fortune for her.
                        His recent commercial venture was an effort to rehabilitate himself, to put
                        himself in an independent position. The recent periods of preoccupation, of
                        subtle unrest, and of dissatisfaction over which she had grieved were <pb
                            id="VAA2406-361" n="354"/> now explained. He was unhappy, he was
                        brooding over this prospective loss, and he had never told her. So his
                        father had really disinherited him!</p>
                    <p>Mr. O&apos;Brien sat before her, troubled himself. He was very sorry for
                        her, now that he saw the expression of her face. Still the truth had to come
                        out. She ought to know.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; he said, when he saw that she was not
                        going to make any immediate reply, &quot;that I have been the bearer of
                        such unfortunate news. It is a very painful situation that I find myself in
                        at this moment, I assure you. I bear you no ill will personallyof course you
                        understand that. The family really bears you no ill will nowI hope you
                        believe that. As I told yourahas I told Mr. Kane, at the time the will was
                        read, I considered it most unfair, but, of course, as a mere executive under

                        that you should know how things stand, in order that you may help youryour
                        husband&quot;he paused, significantly&quot;if possible, to some
                        solution. It seems a pity to me, as it does to the various other members of
                        his family, that he should lose all this money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie had turned her head away and was staring at the floor. She faced him
                        now steadily. &quot;He mustn&apos;t lose it,&quot; she said;
                        &quot;it isn&apos;t fair that he should.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am most delighted to hear you say that, Mrs.Mrs. Kane,&quot;
                        he went on, using for the first time her improbable title as
                        Lester&apos;s wife, without hesitation. &quot;I may as well be very
                        frank with you, and say that I feared you might take this information in
                        quite another spirit. Of course you know to begin with that the Kane family
                        is very clannish. Mrs. Kane, yourahyour husband&apos;s mother, was a
                        very proud and rather distant woman, and his sisters and brothers are rather
                        set in their notions as to what constitute proper family connections. They
                        look upon his relationship to you as irregular, and <pb id="VAA2406-362"
                            n="355"/> pardon me if I appear to be a little cruelas not generally
                        satisfactory. As you know, there had been so much talk in the last few years
                        that Mr. Kane senior did not believe that the situation could ever be nicely
                        adjusted, so far as the family was concerned. He felt that his son had not
                        gone about it right in the first place. One of the conditions of his will
                        was that if your husbandpardon meif his son did not accept the proposition
                        in regard to separating from you and taking up his rightful share of the
                        estate, then to inherit anything at allthe mere ten thousand a year I
                        mentioned beforehe mustahhe mustpardon me, I seem a little brutal, but not
                        intentionally somarry you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie winced. It was such a cruel thing to say this to her face. This whole
                        attempt to live together illegally had proved disastrous at every step.
                        There was only one solution to the unfortunate businessshe could see that
                        plainly. She must leave him, or he must leave her. There was no other
                        alternative. Lester living on ten thousand dollars a year! It seemed silly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. O&apos;Brien was watching her curiously. He was thinking that Lester
                        both had and had not made a mistake. Why had he not married her in the first
                        place? She was charming.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is just one other point which I wish to make in this
                        connection, Mrs. Kane,&quot; he went on softly and easily. &quot;I
                        see now that it will not make any difference to you, but I am commissioned
                        and in a way constrained to make it. I hope you will take it in the manner
                        in which it is given. I don&apos;t know whether you are familiar with
                        your husband&apos;s commercial interests or not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Jennie simply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, in order to simplify matters, and to make it easier for you,
                        should you decide to assist your husband to a solution of this very
                        difficult situationfrankly, in case you might possibly decide to leave on
                        your own account, and maintain a separate establishment of your <pb

                        sayah&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie rose and walked dazedly to one of the windows, clasping her hands as
                        she went. Mr. O&apos;Brien rose also.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, be that as it may. In the event of your deciding to end the
                        connection it has been suggested that any reasonable sum you might name,
                        fifty, seventy-five, a hundred thousand dollars&quot;Mr.
                        O&apos;Brien was feeling very generous toward her&quot; would be
                        gladly set aside for your benefitput in trust, as it were, so that you would
                        have it whenever you needed it. You would never want for anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please don&apos;t,&quot; said Jennie, hurt beyond the power
                        to express herself, unable mentally and physically to listen to another
                        word. &quot;Please don&apos;t say any more. Please go away. Let me
                        alone now, please. I can go away. I will. It will be arranged. But please
                        don&apos;t talk to me any more, will you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand how you feel, Mrs. Kane,&quot; went on Mr.
                        O&apos;Brien, coming to a keen realization of her sufferings.
                        &quot;I know exactly, believe me. I have said all I intend to say. It
                        has been very hard for me to do thisvery hard. I regret the necessity. You
                        have my card. Please note the name. I will come any time you suggest, or you
                        can write me. I will not detain you any longer. I am sorry. I hope you will
                        see fit to say nothing to your husband of my visitit will be advisable that
                        you should keep your own counsel in the matter. I value his friendship very
                        highly, and I am sincerely sorry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie only stared at the floor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. O&apos;Brien went out into the hall to get his coat. Jennie touched
                        the electric button to summon the maid, and Jeannette came. Jennie went back
                        into the library, and Mr. O&apos;Brien paced briskly down the front
                        walk. When she was really alone she put her doubled hands to her chin, and
                        stared at the floor, the queer design of the silken Turkish rug resolving
                        itself into some curious <pb id="VAA2406-364" n="[357]"/> picture. She saw
                        herself in a small cottage somewhere, alone with Vesta; she saw Lester
                        living in another world and beside him Mrs. Gerald. She saw this house
                        vacant, and then a long stretch of time, and then</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she sighed, choking back a desire to cry. With her
                        hands she brushed away a hot tear from each eye. Then she got up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It must be,&quot; she said to herself in thought. &quot;It
                        must be. It should have been so long ago.&quot; And then&quot; Oh,
                        thank God that papa is dead! Anyhow, he did not live to see
                    this.&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LIII</head>
                    <p>THE explanation which Lester had concluded to be inevitable, whether it led
                        to separation or legalization of their hitherto banal condition, followed
                        quickly upon the appearance of Mr. O&apos;Brien. On the day Mr.
                        O&apos;Brien called he had gone on a journey to Hegewisch, a small
                        manufacturing town in Wisconsin, where he had been invited to witness the
                        trial of a new motor intended to operate elevatorswith a view to possible
                        investment. When he came out to the house, interested to tell Jennie
                        something about it even in spite of the fact that he was thinking of leaving
                        her, he felt a sense of depression everywhere, for Jennie, in spite of the
                        serious and sensible conclusion she had reached, was not one who could
                        conceal her feelings easily. She was brooding sadly over her proposed
                        action, realizing that it was best to leave but finding it hard to summon
                        the courage which would let her talk to him about it. She could not go
                        without telling him what she thought. He ought to want to leave her. She was
                        absolutely convinced that this one course of actionseparationwas necessary
                        and advisable. She could not think of him as daring to make a sacrifice of
                        such proportions for her sake even if he wanted to. It was impossible. It
                        was astonishing to her that he had let things go along as dangerously and
                        silently as he had.</p>
                    <p>When he came in Jennie did her best to greet him with her accustomed smile,
                        but it was a pretty poor imitation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everything all right?&quot; she asked, using her customary
                        phrase of inquiry.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-366" n="359"/>
                    <p>&quot;Quite,&quot; he answered. &quot;How are things with
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, just the same.&quot; She walked with him to the library,
                        and he poked at the open fire with a long-handled poker before turning
                        around to survey the room generally. It was five o&apos;clock of a
                        January afternoon. Jennie had gone to one of the windows to lower the shade.
                        As she came back he looked at her critically. &quot;You&apos;re not
                        quite your usual self, are you?&quot; he asked, sensing something out of
                        the common in her attitude.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, yes, I feel all right,&quot; she replied, but there was a
                        peculiar uneven motion to the movement of her lipsa rippling tremor which
                        was unmistakable to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I know better than that,&quot; he said, still gazing at
                        her steadily. &quot;What&apos;s the trouble? Anything
                        happened?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned away from him a moment to get her breath and collect her senses.
                        Then she faced him again. &quot;There is something,&quot; she
                        managed to say. &quot;I have to tell you something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know you have,&quot; he agreed, half smiling, but with a
                        feeling that there was much of grave import back of this. &quot;What is
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was silent for a moment, biting her lips. She did not quite know how to
                        begin. Finally she broke the spell with: &quot;There was a man here
                        yesterdaya Mr. O&apos;Brien, of Cincinnati. Do you know him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know him. What did he want?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He came to talk to me about you and your father&apos;s
                        will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused, for his face clouded immediately. &quot;Why the devil should
                        he be talking to you about my father&apos;s will!&quot; he
                        exclaimed. &quot;What did he have to say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please don&apos;t get angry, Lester,&quot; said Jennie
                        calmly, for she realized that she must remain absolute mistress of herself
                        if anything were to be accomplished toward the resolution of her problem.
                        &quot;He wanted to tell me what a sacrifice you are making,&quot;
                        she went on. &quot;He <pb id="VAA2406-367" n="360"/> wished to show me
                        that there was only a little time left before you would lose your
                        inheritance. Don&apos;t you want to act pretty soon? Don&apos;t you
                        want to leave me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Damn him!&quot; said Lester fiercely. &quot;What the devil
                        does he mean by putting his nose in my private affairs? Can&apos;t they
                        let me alone?&quot; He shook himself angrily. &quot;Damn
                        them!&quot; he exclaimed again. &quot;This is some of
                        Robert&apos;s work. Why should Knight, Keatley &amp;
                        O&apos;Brien be meddling in my affairs? This whole business is getting
                        to be a nuisance!&quot; He was in a boiling rage in a moment, as was
                        shown by his darkening skin and sulphurous eyes.</p>
                    <p>Jennie trembled before his anger. She did not know what to say.</p>
                    <p>He came to himself sufficiently after a time to add:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well. Just what did he tell you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He said that if you married me you would only get ten thousand a
                        year. That if you didn&apos;t and still lived with me you would get
                        nothing at all. If you would leave me, or I would leave you, you would get
                        all of a million and a half. Don&apos;t you think you had better leave
                        me now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had not intended to propound this leading question so quickly, but it
                        came out as a natural climax to the situation. She realized instantly that
                        if he were really in love with her he would answer with an emphatic
                        &quot;no.&quot; If he didn&apos;t care, he would hesitate, he
                        would delay, he would seek to put off the evil day of reckoning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see that,&quot; he retorted irritably.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t see that there&apos;s any need for either
                        interference or hasty action. What I object to is their coming here and
                        mixing in my private affairs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie was cut to the quick by his indifference, his wrath instead of
                        affection. To her the main point at issue was her leaving him or his leaving
                        her. To him this recent interference was obviously the chief matter for
                        discussion and consideration. The meddling of <pb id="VAA2406-368" n="361"/>
                        others before he was ready to act was the terrible thing. She had hoped, in
                        spite of what she had seen, that possibly, because of the long time they had
                        lived together and the things which (in a way) they had endured together, he
                        might have come to care for her deeplythat she had stirred some emotion in
                        him which would never brook real separation, though some seeming separation
                        might be necessary. He had not married her, of course, but then there had
                        been so many things against them. Now, in this final hour, anyhow, he might
                        have shown that he cared deeply, even if he had deemed it necessary to let
                        her go. She felt for the time being as if, for all that she had lived with
                        him so long, she did not understand him, and yet, in spite of this feeling,
                        she knew also that she did. He cared, in his way. He could not care for any
                        one enthusiastically and demonstratively. He could care enough to seize her
                        and take her to himself as he had, but he could not care enough to keep her
                        if something more important appeared. He was debating her fate now. She was
                        in a quandary, hurt, bleeding, but for once in her life, determined. Whether
                        he wanted to or not, she must not let him make this sacrifice. She must
                        leave himif he would not leave her. It was not important enough that she
                        should stay. There might be but one answer. But might he not show affection?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think you had better act soon?&quot; she
                        continued, hoping that some word of feeling would come from him.
                        &quot;There is only a little time left, isn&apos;t there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie nervously pushed a book to and fro on the table, her fear that she
                        would not be able to keep up appearances troubling her greatly. It was hard
                        for her to know what to do or say. Lester was so terrible when he became
                        angry. Still it ought not to be so hard for him to go, now that he had Mrs.
                        Gerald, if he only wished to do soand he ought to. His fortune was so much
                        more important to him than anything she could be.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-369" n="362"/>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry about that,&quot; he replied stubbornly,
                        his wrath at his brother, and his family, and O&apos;Brien still holding
                        him. &quot;There&apos;s time enough. I don&apos;t know what I
                        want to do yet. I like the effrontery of these people! But I won&apos;t
                        talk any more about it; isn&apos;t dinner nearly ready?&quot; He was
                        so injured in his pride that he scarcely took the trouble to be civil. He
                        was forgetting all about her and what she was feeling. He hated his brother
                        Robert for this affront. He would have enjoyed wringing the necks of Messrs.
                        Knight, Keatley &amp; O&apos;Brien, singly and collectively.</p>
                    <p>The question could not be dropped for good and all, and it came up again at
                        dinner, after Jennie had done her best to collect her thoughts and quiet her
                        nerves. They could not talk very freely because of Vesta and Jeannette, but
                        she managed to get in a word or two.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could take a little cottage somewhere,&quot; she suggested
                        softly, hoping to find him in a modified mood. &quot;I would not want to
                        stay here. I would not know what to do with a big house like this
                        alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you wouldn&apos;t discuss this business any longer,
                        Jennie,&quot; he persisted. &quot;I&apos;m in no mood for it. I
                        don&apos;t know that I&apos;m going to do anything of the sort. I
                        don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do.&quot; He was so sour
                        and obstinate, because of O&apos;Brien, that she finally gave it up.
                        Vesta was astonished to see her stepfather, usually so courteous, in so grim
                        a mood.</p>
                    <p>Jennie felt a curious sense that she might hold him if she would, for he was
                        doubting; but she knew also that she should not wish. It was not fair to
                        him. It was not fair to herself, or kind, or decent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh yes, Lester, you must,&quot; she pleaded, at a later time.
                        &quot;I won&apos;t talk about it any more, but you must. I
                        won&apos;t let you do anything else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There were hours when it came up afterwardevery day, in factin their boudoir,
                        in the library, in the diningroom, at breakfast, but not always in words.
                        Jennie <pb id="VAA2406-370" n="363"/> was worried. She was looking the worry
                        she felt. She was sure that he should be made to act. Since he was showing
                        more kindly consideration for her, she was all the more certain that he
                        should act soon. Just how to go about it she did not know, but she looked at
                        him longingly, trying to help him make up his mind. She would be happy, she
                        assured herselfshe would be happy thinking that he was happy once she was
                        away from him. He was a good man, most delightful in everything, perhaps,
                        save his gift of love. He really did not love hercould not perhaps, after
                        all that had happened, even though she loved him most earnestly. But his
                        family had been most brutal in their opposition, and this had affected his
                        attitude. She could understand that, too. She could see now how his big,
                        strong brain might be working in a circle. He was too decent to be
                        absolutely brutal about this thing and leave her, too really considerate to
                        look sharply after his own interests as he should, or hersbut he ought to.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must decide, Lester,&quot; she kept saying to him, from
                        time to time. &quot;You must let me go. What difference does it make? I
                        will be all right. Maybe, when this thing is all over you might want to come
                        back to me. If you do, I will be there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not ready to come to a decision,&quot; was his
                        invariable reply. &quot;I don&apos;t know that I want to leave you.
                        This money is important, of course, but money isn&apos;t everything. I
                        can live on ten thousand a year if necessary. I&apos;ve done it in the
                        past.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, but you&apos;re so much more placed in the world now,
                        Lester,&quot; she argued. &quot;You can&apos;t do it. Look how
                        much it costs to run this house alone. And a million and a half of
                        dollarswhy, I wouldn&apos;t let you think of losing that. I&apos;ll
                        go myself first.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where would you think of going if it came to that?&quot; he
                        asked curiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;d find some place. Do you remember that <pb
                            id="VAA2406-371" n="[364]"/> little town of Sandwood, this side of
                        Kenosha? I have often thought it would be a pleasant place to
                        live.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t like to think of this,&quot; he said finally
                        in an outburst of frankness. &quot;It doesn&apos;t seem fair. The
                        conditions have all been against this union of ours. I suppose I should have
                        married you in the first place. I&apos;m sorry now that I
                        didn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie choked in her throat, but said nothing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyhow, this won&apos;t be the last of it, if I can help
                        it,&quot; he concluded. He was thinking that the storm might blow over;
                        once he had the money, and thenbut he hated compromises and subterfuges.</p>
                    <p>It came by degrees to be understood that, toward the end of February, she
                        should look around at Sandwood and see what she could find. She was to have
                        ample means, he told her, everything that she wanted. After a time he might
                        come out and visit her occasionally. And he was determined in his heart that
                        he would make some people pay for the trouble they had caused him. He
                        decided to send for Mr. O&apos;Brien shortly and talk things over. He
                        wanted for his personal satisfaction to tell him what he thought of him.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, in the background of his mind, moved the shadowy figure of
                        Mrs. Geraldcharming, sophisticated, well placed in every sense of the word.
                        He did not want to give her the broad reality of full thought, but she was
                        always there. He thought and thought. &quot;Perhaps I&apos;d
                        better,&quot; he half concluded. When February came he was ready to
                    act.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LIV</head>
                    <p>THE little town of Sandwood, &quot;this side of Kenosha,&quot; as
                        Jennie had expressed it, was only a short distance from Chicago, an hour and
                        fifteen minutes by the local train. It had a population of some three
                        hundred families, dwelling in small cottages, which were scattered over a
                        pleasant area of lake-shore property. They were not rich people. The houses
                        were not worth more than from three to five thousand dollars each, but, in
                        most cases, they were harmoniously constructed, and the surrounding trees,
                        green for the entire year, gave them a pleasing summery appearance. Jennie,
                        at the time they had passed by thereit was an outing taken behind a pair of
                        fast horseshad admired the look of a little white church steeple, set down
                        among green trees, and the gentle rocking of the boats upon the summer
                        water.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should like to live in a place like this some time,&quot; she
                        had said to Lester, and he had made the comment that it was a little too
                        peaceful for him. &quot;I can imagine getting to the place where I might
                        like this, but not now. It&apos;s too withdrawn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie thought of that expression afterward. It came to her when she thought
                        that the world was trying. If she had to be alone ever and could afford it
                        she would like to live in a place like Sandwood. There she would have a
                        little garden, some chickens, perhaps, a tall pole with a pretty bird-house
                        on it, and flowers and trees and green grass everywhere about. If she could
                        have a little cottage in a place like this which commanded a view of the
                        lake she could sit of a summer evening and sew. <pb id="VAA2406-373" n="366"
                        /> Vesta could play about or come home from school. She might have a few
                        friends, or not any. She was beginning to think that she could do very well
                        living alone if it were not for Vesta&apos;s social needs. Books were
                        pleasant thingsshe was finding that outbooks like Irving&apos;s <hi
                            rend="i">Sketch Book</hi>, Lamb&apos;s <hi rend="i">Elia</hi>, and
                        Hawthorne&apos;s <hi rend="i">Twice Told Tales.</hi> Vesta was coming to
                        be quite a musician in her way, having a keen sense of the delicate and
                        refined in musical composition. She had a natural sense of harmony and a
                        love for those songs and instrumental compositions which reflect sentimental
                        and passionate moods, and she could sing and play quite well. Her voice was,
                        of course, quite untrainedshe was only fourteenbut it was pleasant to listen
                        to. She was beginning to show the combined traits of her mother and
                        fatherJennie&apos;s gentle, speculative turn of mind, combined with
                        Brander&apos;s vivacity of spirit and innate executive capacity. She
                        could talk to her mother in a sensible way about things, nature, books,
                        dress, love, and from her developing tendencies Jennie caught keen glimpses
                        of the new worlds which Vesta was to explore. The nature of modern school
                        life, its consideration of various divisions of knowledge, music, science,
                        all came to Jennie watching her daughter take up new themes. Vesta was
                        evidently going to be a woman of considerable abilitynot irritably
                        aggressive, but self-constructive. She would be able to take care of
                        herself. All this pleased Jennie and gave her great hopes for
                        Vesta&apos;s future.</p>
                    <p>The cottage which was finally secured at Sandwood was only a story and a half
                        in height, but it was raised upon red brick piers between which were set
                        green lattices and about which ran a veranda. The house was long and narrow,
                        its full lengthsome five rooms in a rowfacing the lake. There was a
                        dining-room with windows opening even with the floor, a large library with
                        built-in shelves for books, and a parlor whose three large windows afforded
                        air and sunshine at all times. <pb id="VAA2406-374" n="367"/> The plot of
                        ground in which this cottage <unclear>s-</unclear> was one hundred feet
                        square and ornamented with <unclear>-w</unclear> trees. The former owner had
                        laid out flower-beds, and <unclear>-nged</unclear> green hardwood tubs for
                        the reception of various <unclear/> plants and vines. The house was painted
                        white, with green shutters and green shingles.</p>
                    <p>It had been Lester&apos;s idea, since this thing must be, that Jennie
                        might keep the house in Hyde Park just as it was, but she did not want to do
                        that. She could not think of living there alone. The place was too full of
                        memories. At first, she did not think she would take anything much with her,
                        but she finally saw that it was advisable to do as Lester suggestedto fit
                        out the new place with a selection of silverware, hangings, and furniture
                        from the Hyde Park house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have no idea what you will or may want,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;Take everything. I certainly don&apos;t want any of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A lease of the cottage was taken for two years, together with an option for
                        an additional five years, including the privilege of purchase. So long as he
                        was letting her go, Lester wanted to be generous. He could not think of her
                        as wanting for anything, and he did not propose that she should. His one
                        troublesome thought was, what explanation was to be made to Vesta. He liked
                        her very much and wanted her life kept free of complications.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not send her off to a boarding-school until spring?&quot;
                        he suggested once; but owing to the lateness of the season this was
                        abandoned as inadvisable. Later they agreed that business affairs made it
                        necessary for him to travel and for Jennie to move. Later Vesta could be
                        told that Jennie had left him for any reason she chose to give. It was a
                        trying situation, all the more bitter to Jennie because she realized that in
                        spite of the wisdom of it indifference to her was involved. He really did
                        not care <hi rend="i">enough</hi>, as much as he cared.</p>
                    <p>The relationship of man and woman which we study so <pb id="VAA2406-375"
                            n="368"/> passionately in the hope of finding heaven knows what key to
                        the mystery of existence holds no more difficult or trying situation than
                        this of mutual compatibility broken or disrupted by untoward conditions
                        which in themselves have so little to do with the real force and beauty of
                        the relationship itself. These days of final dissolution in which this
                        household, so charmingly arranged, the scene of so many pleasant activities,
                        was literally going to pieces was a period of great trial to both Jennie and
                        Lester. On her part it was one of intense suffering, for she was of that
                        stable nature that rejoices to fix itself in a serviceable and harmonious
                        relationship, and then stay so. For her life was made up of those mystic
                        chords of sympathy and memory which bind up the transient elements of nature
                        into a harmonious and enduring scene. One of those chordsthis home was her
                        home, united and made beautiful by her affection and consideration for each
                        person and every object. Now the time had come when it must cease.</p>
                    <p>If she had ever had anything before in her life which had been like this it
                        might have been easier to part with it now, though, as she had proved,
                        Jennie&apos;s affections were not based in any way upon material
                        considerations. Her love of life and of personality were free from the taint
                        of selfishness. She went about among these various rooms selecting this rug,
                        that set of furniture, this and that ornament, wishing all the time with all
                        her heart and soul that it need not be. Just to think, in a little while
                        Lester would not come any more of an evening! She would not need to get up
                        first of a morning and see that coffee was made for her lord, that the table
                        in the dining-room looked just so. It had been a habit of hers to arrange a
                        bouquet for the table out of the richest blooming flowers of the
                        conservatory, and she had always felt in doing it that it was particularly
                        for him. Now it would not be necessary any morenot for him. When one is
                        accustomed to wait for the sound of a certain <pb id="VAA2406-376" n="369"/>
                        carriage-wheel of an evening grating upon your carriage drive, when one is
                        used to listen at eleven, twelve, and one, waking naturally and joyfully to
                        the echo of a certain step on the stair, the separation, the ending of these
                        things, is keen with pain. These were the thoughts that were running through
                        Jennie&apos;s brain hour after hour and day after day.</p>
                    <p>Lester on his part was suffering in another fashion. His was not the sorrow
                        of lacerated affection, of discarded and despised love, but of that painful
                        sense of unfairness which comes to one who knows that he is making a
                        sacrifice of the virtueskindness, loyalty, affectionto policy. Policy was
                        dietating a very splendid course of action from one point of view. Free of
                        Jennie, providing for her admirably, he was free to go his way, taking to
                        himself the mass of affairs which come naturally with great wealth. He could
                        not help thinking of the thousand and one little things which Jennie had
                        been accustomed to do for him, the hundred and one comfortable and pleasant
                        and delightful things she meant to him. The virtues which she possessed were
                        quite dear to his mind. He had gone over them time and again. Now he was
                        compelled to go over them finally, to see that she was suffering without
                        making a sign. Her manner and attitude toward him in these last days were
                        quite the same as they had always beenno more, no less. She was not
                        indulging in private hysterics, as another woman might have done; she was
                        not pretending a fortitude in suffering she did not feel, showing him one
                        face while wishing him to see another behind it. She was calm, gentle,
                        consideratethoughtful of himwhere he would go and what he would do, without
                        irritating him by her inquiries. He was struck quite favorably by her
                        ability to take a large situation largely, and he admired her. There was
                        something to this woman, let the world think what it might. It was a shame
                        that her life was passed under such a troubled star. Still <pb
                            id="VAA2406-377" n="370"/> a great world was calling him. The sound of
                        its voice was in his ears. It had on occasion shown him its bared teeth. Did
                        he really dare to hesitate?</p>
                    <p>The last hour came, when having made excuses to this and that neighbor, when
                        having spread the information that they were going abroad, when Lester had
                        engaged rooms at the Auditorium, and the mass of furniture which could not
                        be used had gone to storage, that it was necessary to say farewell to this
                        Hyde Park domicile. Jennie had visited Sandwood in company with Lester
                        several times. He had carefully examined the character of the place. He was
                        satisfied that it was nice but lonely. Spring was at hand, the flowers would
                        be something. She was going to keep a gardener and man of all work. Vesta
                        would be with her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; he said, &quot;only I want you to be
                        comfortable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the mean time Lester had been arranging his personal affairs. He had
                        notified Messrs. Knight, Keatley &amp; O&apos;Brien through his own
                        attorney, Mr. Watson, that he would expect them to deliver his share of his
                        father&apos;s securities on a given date. He had made up his mind that
                        as long as he was compelled by circumstances to do this thing he would do a
                        number of other things equally ruthless. He would probably marry Mrs.
                        Gerald. He would sit as a director in the United Carriage Companywith his
                        share of the stock it would be impossible to keep him out. If he had Mrs.
                        Gerald&apos;s money he would become a controlling factor in the United
                        Traction of Cincinnati, in which his brother was heavily interested, and in
                        the Western Steel Works, of which his brother was now the leading adviser.
                        What a different figure he would be now from that which he had been during
                        the past few years!</p>
                    <p>Jennie was depressed to the point of despair. She was tremendously lonely.
                        This home had meant so much to her. When she first came here and neighbors
                            <pb id="VAA2406-378" n="371"/> had begun to drop in she had imagined
                        herself on the threshold of a great career, that some day, possibly, Lester
                        would marry her. Now, blow after blow had been delivered, and the home and
                        dream were a ruin. Gerhardt was gone. Jeannette, Harry Ward, and Mrs.
                        Frissell had been discharged, the furniture for a good part was in storage,
                        and for her, practically, Lester was no more. She realized clearly that he
                        would not come back. If he could do this thing now, even considerately, he
                        could do much more when he was free and away later. Immersed in his great
                        affairs, he would forget, of course. And why not? She did not fit in. Had
                        not everythingeverything illustrated that to her? Love was not enough in
                        this worldthat was so plain. One needed education, wealth, training, the
                        ability to fight and scheme. She did not want to do that. She could not.</p>
                    <p>The day came when the house was finally closed and the old life was at an
                        end. Lester traveled with Jennie to Sandwood. He spent some little while in
                        the house trying to get her used to the idea of changeit was not so bad. He
                        intimated that he would come again soon, but he went away, and all his words
                        were as nothing against the fact of the actual and spiritual separation.
                        When Jennie saw him going down the brick walk that afternoon, his solid,
                        conservative figure clad in a new tweed suit, his overcoat on his arm,
                        self-reliance and prosperity written all over him, she thought that she
                        would die. She had kissed Lester good-by and had wished him joy, prosperity,
                        peace; then she made an excuse to go to her bedroom. Vesta came after a
                        time, to seek her, but now her eyes were quite dry; everything had subsided
                        to a dull ache. The new life was actually begun for hera life without
                        Lester, without Gerhardt, without any one save Vesta.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What curious things have happened to me!&quot; she thought, as
                        she went into the kitchen, for she had determined <pb id="VAA2406-379"
                            n="[372]"/> to do at least some of her own work. She needed the
                        distraction. She did not want to think. If it were not for Vesta she would
                        have sought some regular outside employment. Anything to keep from brooding,
                        for in that direction lay madness.</p>

                    <p>THE social and business worlds of Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and other
                        cities saw, during the year or two which followed the breaking of his
                        relationship with Jennie, a curious rejuvenation in the social and business
                        spirit of Lester Kane. He had become rather distant and indifferent to
                        certain personages and affairs while he was living with her, but now he
                        suddenly appeared again, armed with authority from a number of sources,
                        looking into this and that matter with the air of one who has the privilege
                        of power, and showing himself to be quite a personage from the point of view
                        of finance and commerce. He was older of course. It must be admitted that he
                        was in some respects a mentally altered Lester. Up to the time he had met
                        Jennie he was full of the assurance of the man who has never known defeat.
                        To have been reared in luxury as he had been, to have seen only the pleasant
                        side of society, which is so persistent and so deluding where money is
                        concerned, to have been in the run of big affairs not because one has
                        created them, but because one is a part of them and because they are
                        one&apos;s birthright, like the air one breathes, could not help but
                        create one of those illusions of solidarity which is apt to befog the
                        clearest brain. It is so hard for us to know what we have not seen. It is so
                        difficult for us to feel what we have not experienced. Like this world of
                        ours, which seems so solid and persistent solely because we have no
                        knowledge of the power which creates it, Lester&apos;s world seemed
                        solid and persistent and real enough to him. It was only when the storms set
                        in and the winds of adversity blew and he found himself facing <pb
                            id="VAA2406-381" n="374"/> the armed forces of convention that he
                        realized he might be mistaken as to the value of his personality, that his
                        private desires and opinions were as nothing in the face of a public
                        conviction; that he was wrong. The race spirit, or social avatar, the
                        &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; as the Germans term it, manifested itself as
                        something having a system in charge, and the organization of society began
                        to show itself to him as something based on possibly a spiritual, or, at
                        least, superhuman counterpart. He could not fly in the face of it. He could
                        not deliberately ignore its mandates. The people of his time believed that
                        some particular form of social arrangement was necessary, and unless he
                        complied with that he could, as he saw, readily become a social outcast. His
                        own father and mother had turned on himhis brother and sisters, society, his
                        friends. Dear heaven, what a to-do this action of his had created! Why, even
                        the fates seemed adverse. His real estate venture was one of the most
                        fortuitously unlucky things he had ever heard of. Why? Were the gods
                        battling on the side of a to him unimportant social arrangement? Apparently.
                        Anyhow, he had been compelled to quit, and here he was, vigorous,
                        determined, somewhat battered by the experience, but still forceful and
                        worth while.</p>
                    <p>And it was a part of the penalty that he had become measurably soured by what
                        had occurred. He was feeling that he had been compelled to do the first
                        ugly, brutal thing of his life. Jennie deserved better of him. It was a
                        shame to forsake her after all the devotion she had manifested. Truly she
                        had played a finer part than he. Worst of all, his deed could not be excused
                        on the grounds of necessity. He could have lived on ten thousand a year; he
                        could have done without the million and more which was now his. He could
                        have done without the society, the pleasures of which had always been a
                        lure. He could have, but he had not, and he had complicated it all with the
                        thought of another woman.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-382" n="375"/>
                    <p>Was she as good as Jennie? That was a question which always rose before him.
                        Was she as kindly? Wasn&apos;t she deliberately scheming under his very
                        eyes to win him away from the woman who was as good as his wife? Was that
                        admirable? Was it the thing a truly big woman would do? Was she good enough
                        for him after all? Ought he to marry her? Ought he to marry any one seeing
                        that he really owed a spiritual if not a legal allegiance to Jennie? Was it
                        worth while for any woman to marry him? These things turned in his brain.
                        They haunted him. He could not shut out the fact that he was doing a cruel
                        and unlovely thing.</p>
                    <p>Material error in the first place was now being complicated with spiritual
                        error. He was attempting to right the first by committing the second. Could
                        it be done <hi rend="i">to his own satisfaction?</hi> Would it pay mentally
                        and spiritually? Would it bring him peace of mind? He was thinking,
                        thinking, all the while he was readjusting his life to the old (or perhaps
                        better yet, new) conditions, and he was not feeling any happier. As a matter
                        of fact he was feeling worsegrim, revengeful. If he married Letty he thought
                        at times it would be to use her fortune as a club to knock other enemies
                        over the head, and he hated to think he was marrying her for that. He took
                        up his abode at the Auditorium, visited Cincinnati in a distant and
                        aggressive spirit, sat in council with the board of directors, wishing that
                        he was more at peace with himself, more interested in life. But he did not
                        change his policy in regard to Jennie.</p>
                    <p>Of course Mrs. Gerald had been vitally interested in Lester&apos;s
                        rehabilitation. She waited tactfully some little time before sending him any
                        word; finally she ventured to write to him at the Hyde Park address (as if
                        she did not know where he was), asking, &quot;Where are you?&quot;
                        By this time Lester had become slightly accustomed to the change in his
                        life. He was saying to himself that he needed sympathetic companionship, the
                        companionship <pb id="VAA2406-383" n="376"/> of a woman, of course. Social
                        invitations had begun to come to him now that he was alone and that his
                        financial connections were so obviously restored. He had made his
                        appearance, accompanied only by a Japanese valet, at several country houses,
                        the best sign that he was once more a single man. No reference was made by
                        any one to the past.</p>
                    <p>On receiving Mrs. Gerald&apos;s note he decided that he ought to go and
                        see her. He had treated her rather shabbily. For months preceding his
                        separation from Jennie he had not gone near her. Even now he waited until
                        time brought a &apos;phoned invitation to dinner. This he accepted.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Gerald was at her best as a hostess at her perfectly appointed
                        dinner-table. Alboni, the pianist, was there on this occasion, together with
                        Adam Rascavage, the sculptor, a visiting scientist from England, Sir Nelson
                        Keyes, and, curiously enough, Mr. and Mrs. Berry Dodge, whom Lester had not
                        met socially in several years. Mrs. Gerald and Lester exchanged the joyful
                        greetings of those who understand each other thoroughly and are happy in
                        each other&apos;s company. &quot;Aren&apos;t you ashamed of
                        yourself, sir,&quot; she said to him when he made his appearance,
                        &quot;to treat me so indifferently? You are going to be punished for
                        this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the damage?&quot; he smiled.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been extremely rushed. I suppose something like
                        ninety stripes will serve me about right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ninety stripes, indeed!&quot; she retorted.
                        &quot;You&apos;re letting yourself off easy. What is it they do to
                        evildoers in Siam?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Boil them in oil, I suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, anyhow, that&apos;s more like. I&apos;m thinking of
                        something terrible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be sure and tell me when you decide,&quot; he laughed, and
                        passed on to be presented to distinguished strangers by Mrs. De Lincum who
                        aided Mrs. Gerald in receiving. <pb id="VAA2406-384" n="377"/> The talk was
                        stimulating. Lester was always at his ease intellectually, and this mental
                        atmosphere revived him. Presently he turned to greet Berry Dodge, who was
                        standing at his elbow.</p>
                    <p>Dodge was all cordiality. &quot;Where are you now?&quot; he asked.
                        &quot;We haven&apos;t seen you inoh, when? Mrs. Dodge is waiting to
                        have a word with you.&quot; Lester noticed the change in
                        Dodge&apos;s attitude.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Some time, that&apos;s sure,&quot; he replied easily.
                        &quot;I&apos;m living at the Auditorium.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was asking after you the other day. You know Jackson Du Bois? Of
                        course you do. We were thinking of running up into Canada for some hunting.
                        Why don&apos;t you join us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t,&quot; replied Lester. &quot;Too many
                        things on hand just now. Later, surely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dodge was anxious to continue. He had seen Lester&apos;s election as a
                        director of the C. H. &amp; D. Obviously he was coming back into the
                        world. But dinner was announced and Lester sat at Mrs. Gerald&apos;s
                        right hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aren&apos;t you coming to pay me a dinner call some afternoon
                        after this?&quot; asked Mrs. Gerald confidentially when the conversation
                        was brisk at the other end of the table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am, indeed,&quot; he replied, &quot;and shortly.
                        Seriously, I&apos;ve been wanting to look you up. You understand though
                        how things are now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do. I&apos;ve heard a great deal. That&apos;s why I want
                        you to come. We need to talk together.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ten days later he did call. He felt as if he must talk with her; he was
                        feeling bored and lonely; his long home life with Jennie had made hotel life
                        objectionable. He felt as though he must find a sympathetic, intelligent
                        ear, and where better than here? Letty was all ears for his troubles. She
                        would have pillowed his solid head upon her breast in a moment if that had
                        been possible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, when the usual fencing preliminaries were
                        over, &quot;what will you have me say in explanation?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-385" n="378"/>
                    <p>&quot;Have you burned your bridges behind you?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not so sure,&quot; he replied gravely.
                        &quot;And I can&apos;t say that I&apos;m feeling any too joyous
                        about the matter as a whole.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought as much,&quot; she replied. &quot;I knew how it
                        would be with you. I can see you wading through this mentally, Lester. I
                        have been watching you, every step of the way, wishing you peace of mind.
                        These things are always so difficult, but don&apos;t you know I am still
                        sure it&apos;s for the best. It never was right the other way. It never
                        could be. You couldn&apos;t afford to sink back into a mere shell-fish
                        life. You are not organized temperamentally for that any more than I am. You
                        may regret what you are doing now, but you would have regretted the other
                        thing quite as much and more. You couldn&apos;t work your life out that
                        waynow, could you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know about that, Letty. Really, I don&apos;t.
                        I&apos;ve wanted to come and see you for a long time, but I
                        didn&apos;t think that I ought to. The fight was outsideyou know what I
                        mean.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed, I do,&quot; she said soothingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s still inside. I haven&apos;t gotten over it. I
                        don&apos;t know whether this financial business binds me sufficiently or
                        not. I&apos;ll be frank and tell you that I can&apos;t say I love
                        her entirely; but I&apos;m sorry, and that&apos;s
                        something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s comfortably provided for, of course,&quot; she
                        commented rather than inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Every thing she wants. Jennie is of a peculiar disposition. She
                        doesn&apos;t want much. She&apos;s retiring by nature and
                        doesn&apos;t care for show. I&apos;ve taken a cottage for her at
                        Sandwood, a little place north of here on the lake; and there&apos;s
                        plenty of money in trust, but, of course, she knows she can live anywhere
                        she pleases.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand exactly how she feels, Lester. I know how you feel.
                        She is going to suffer very keenly for a whilewe all do when we have to give
                        up the thing we <pb id="VAA2406-386" n="379"/> love. But we can get over it,
                        and we do. At least, we can live. She will. It will go hard at first, but
                        after a while she will see how it is, and she won&apos;t feel any the
                        worse toward you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jennie will never reproach me, I know that,&quot; he replied.
                        &quot;I&apos;m the one who will do the reproaching. I&apos;ll be
                        abusing myself for some time. The trouble is with my particular turn of
                        mind. I can&apos;t tell, for the life of me, how much of this disturbing
                        feeling of mine is habitthe condition that I&apos;m accustomed toand how
                        much is sympathy. I sometimes think I&apos;m the the most pointless
                        individual in the world. I think too much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poor Lester!&quot; she said tenderly. &quot;Well, I
                        understand for one. You&apos;re lonely living where you are,
                        aren&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am that,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not come and spend a few days down at West Baden? I&apos;m
                        going there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Next Tuesday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me see,&quot; he replied. &quot;I&apos;m not sure
                        that I can.&quot; He consulted his notebook. &quot;I could come
                        Thursday, for a few days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not do that? You need company. We can walk and talk things out
                        down there. Will you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>She came toward him, trailing a lavender lounging robe.
                        &quot;You&apos;re such a solemn philosopher, sir,&quot; she
                        observed comfortably, &quot;working through all the ramifications of
                        things. Why do you? You were always like that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t help it,&quot; he replied.
                        &quot;It&apos;s my nature to think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, one thing I know&quot; and she tweaked his ear gently.
                        &quot;You&apos;re not going to make another mistake through sympathy
                        if I can help it,&quot; she said daringly. &quot;You&apos;re
                        going to stay disentangled long enough to give <pb id="VAA2406-387"
                            n="[380]"/> yourself a chance to think out what you want to do. You
                        must. And I wish for one thing you&apos;d take over the management of my
                        affairs. You could advise me so much better than my lawyer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He arose and walked to the window, turning to look back at her solemnly.
                        &quot;I know what you want,&quot; he said doggedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And why shouldn&apos;t I?&quot; she demanded, again
                        approaching him. She looked at him pleadingly, defiantly. &quot;Yes, why
                        shouldn&apos;t I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing,&quot; he
                        grumbled; but he kept on looking at her; she stood there, attractive as a
                        woman of her age could be, wise, considerate, full of friendship and
                        affection.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Letty,&quot; he said. &quot;You ought not to want to marry
                        me. I&apos;m not worth it. Really I&apos;m not. I&apos;m too
                        cynical. Too indifferent. It won&apos;t be worth anything in the long
                        run.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It will be worth something to me,&quot; she insisted.
                        &quot;I know what you are. Anyhow, I don&apos;t care. I want
                        you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He took her hands, then her arms. Finally he drew her to him, and put his
                        arms about her waist. &quot;Poor Letty!&quot; he said;
                        &quot;I&apos;m not worth it. You&apos;ll be sorry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;ll not,&quot; she replied. &quot;I know what
                        I&apos;m doing. I don&apos;t care what you think you are
                        worth.&quot; She laid her cheek on his shoulder. &quot;I want
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you keep on I venture to say you&apos;ll have me,&quot;
                        he returned. He bent and kissed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she exclaimed, and hid her hot face against his
                        breast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is bad business,&quot; he thought, even as he held her
                        within the circle of his arms. &quot;It isn&apos;t what I ought to
                        be doing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still he held her, and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he kissed her
                        again and again.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LVI</head>
                    <p>IT is difficult to say whether Lester might not have returned to Jennie after
                        all but for certain influential factors. After a time, with his control of
                        his portion of the estate firmly settled in his hands and the storm of
                        original feeling forgotten, he was well aware that diplomacyif he ignored
                        his natural tendency to fulfil even implied obligationscould readily bring
                        about an arrangement whereby he and Jennie could be together. But he was
                        haunted by the sense of what might be called an important social opportunity
                        in the form of Mrs. Gerald. He was compelled to set over against his natural
                        tendency toward Jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the
                        personality and fortunes of her rival, who was one of the most significant
                        and interesting figures on the social horizon. For think as he would, these
                        two women were now persistently opposed in his consciousness. The one
                        polished, sympathetic, philosophicschooled in all the niceties of polite
                        society, and with the means to gratify her every wish; the other natural,
                        sympathetic, emotional, with no schooling in the ways of polite society, but
                        with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely things in human
                        relationship which made her beyond any question an exceptional woman. Mrs.
                        Gerald saw it and admitted it. Her criticism of Lester&apos;s
                        relationship with Jennie was not that she was not worth while, but that
                        conditions made it impolitie. On the other hand, union with her was an ideal
                        climax for his social aspirations. This would bring everything out right. He
                        would be as happy with her as he would <pb id="VAA2406-389" n="382"/> be
                        with Jenniealmostand he would have the satisfaction of knowing that this
                        Western social and financial world held no more significant figure than
                        himself. It was not wise to delay either this latter excellent solution of
                        his material problems, and after thinking it over long and seriously he
                        finally concluded that he would not. He had already done Jennie the
                        irreparable wrong of leaving her. What difference did it make if he did this
                        also? She was possessed of everything she could possibly want outside of
                        himself. She had herself deemed it advisable for him to leave. By such
                        figments of the brain, in the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions,
                        he was becoming used to the idea of a new alliance.</p>
                    <p>The thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in some form
                        with Jennie was the constant presence of Mrs. Gerald. Circumstances
                        conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental quandary at this
                        time. Alone he could do nothing save to make visits here and there, and he
                        did not care to do that. He was too indifferent mentally to gather about him
                        as a bachelor that atmosphere which he enjoyed and which a woman like Mrs.
                        Gerald could so readily provide. United with her it was simple enough. Their
                        home then, wherever it was, would be full of clever people. He would need to
                        do little save to appear and enjoy it. She understood quite as well as any
                        one how he liked to live. She enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting.
                        There were so many things they could do together nicely. He visited West
                        Baden at the same time she did, as she suggested. He gave himself over to
                        her in Chicago for dinners, parties, drives. Her house was quite as much his
                        own as hersshe made him feel so. She talked to him about her affairs,
                        showing him exactly how they stood and why she wished him to intervene in
                        this and that matter. She did not wish him to be much alone. She did not
                        want him to think or regret. She came to represent to him comfort,
                        forgetfulness, rest from care. With the others he <pb id="VAA2406-390"
                            n="[383]"/> visited at her house occasionally, and it gradually became
                        rumored about that he would marry her. Because of the fact that there had
                        been so much discussion of his previous relationship, Letty decided that if
                        ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair. She wanted a simple
                        explanation in the papers of how it had come about, and then afterward, when
                        things were normal again and gossip had subsided, she would enter on a
                        dazzling social display for his sake.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not let us get married in April and go abroad for the
                        summer?&quot; she asked once, after they had reached a silent
                        understanding that marriage would eventually follow.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s go to Japan. Then we can come back in the fall, and
                        take a house on the drive.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester had been away from Jennie so long now that the first severe wave of
                        self-reproach had passed. He was still doubtful, but he preferred to stifle
                        his misgivings. &quot;Very well,&quot; he replied, almost jokingly.
                        &quot;Only don&apos;t let there be any fuss about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you really mean that, sweet?&quot; she exclaimed, looking
                        over at him; they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and
                        chatting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve thought about it a long while,&quot; he replied.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t see why not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She came over to him and sat on his knee, putting her arms upon his
                        shoulders.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can scarcely believe you said that,&quot; she said, looking
                        at him curiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I take it back?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no. It&apos;s agreed for April now. And we&apos;ll go
                        to Japan. You can&apos;t change your mind. There won&apos;t be any
                        fuss. But my, what a trousseau I will prepare!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head; there was a missing
                        note somewhere in this gamut of happiness; perhaps it was because he was
                        getting old.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LVII</head>
                    <p>IN the meantime Jennie was going her way, settling herself in the markedly
                        different world in which henceforth she was to move. It seemed a terrible
                        thing at firstthis life without Lester. Despite her own strong
                        individuality, her ways had become so involved with his that there seemed to
                        be no possibility of distentangling them. Constantly she was with him in
                        thought and action, just as though they had never separated. Where was he
                        now? What was he doing? What was he saying? How was he looking? In the
                        mornings when she woke it was with the sense that he must be beside her. At
                        night as if she could not go to bed alone. He would come after a while
                        surelyah, no, of course he would not come. Dear heaven, think of that! Never
                        any more. And she wanted him so.</p>
                    <p>Again there were so many little trying things to adjust, for a change of this
                        nature is too radical to be passed over lightly. The explanation she had to
                        make to Vesta was of all the most important. This little girl, who was old
                        enough now to see and think for herself, was not without her surmises and
                        misgivings. Vesta recalled that her mother had been accused of not being
                        married to her father when she was born. She had seen the article about
                        Jennie and Lester in the Sunday paper at the time it had appearedit had been
                        shown to her at schoolbut she had had sense enough to say nothing about it,
                        feeling somehow that Jennie would not like it. Lester&apos;s
                        disappearance was a complete surprise; but she had learned in the last two
                        or three years that her mother <pb id="VAA2406-392" n="385"/> was very
                        sensitive, and that she could hurt her in unexpected ways. Jennie was
                        finally compelled to tell Vesta that Lester&apos;s fortune had been
                        dependent on his leaving her, solely because she was not of his station.
                        Vesta listened soberly and half suspected the truth. She felt terribly sorry
                        for her mother, and, because of Jennie&apos;s obvious distress, she was
                        trebly gay and courageous. She refused outright the suggestion of going to a
                        boarding-school and kept as close to her mother as she could. She found
                        interesting books to read with her, insisted that they go to see plays
                        together, played to her on the piano, and asked for her mother&apos;s
                        criticisms on her drawing and modeling. She found a few friends in the
                        excellent Sandwood school, and brought them home of an evening to add
                        lightness and gaiety to the cottage life. Jennie, through her growing
                        appreciation of Vesta&apos;s fine character, became more and more drawn
                        toward her. Lester was gone, but at least she had Vesta. That prop would
                        probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence.</p>
                    <p>There was also her history to account for to the residents of Sandwood. In
                        many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life it is not necessary
                        to say much of one&apos;s past, but as a rule something must be said.
                        People have the habit of inquiringif they are no more than butchers and
                        bakers. By degrees one must account for this and that fact, and it was so
                        here. She could not say that her husband was dead. Lester might come back.
                        She had to say that she had left himto give the impression that it would be
                        she, if any one, who would permit him to return. This put her in an
                        interesting and sympathetic light in the neighborhood. It was the most
                        sensible thing to do. She then settled down to a quiet routine of existence,
                        waiting what dnouement to her life she could not guess.</p>
                    <p>Sandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature, and this,
                        with the devotion of Vesta, offered some <pb id="VAA2406-393" n="386"/>
                        slight solace. There was the beauty of the lake, which, with its passing
                        boats, was a never-ending source of joy, and there were many charming drives
                        in the surrounding country. Jennie had her own horse and carryallone of the
                        horses of the pair they had used in Hyde Park. Other household pets appeared
                        in due course of time, including a collie, that Vesta named Rats; she had
                        brought him from Chicago as a puppy, and he had grown to be a sterling
                        watch-dog, sensible and affectionate. There was also a cat, Jimmy Woods, so
                        called after a boy Vesta knew, and to whom she insisted the cat bore a
                        marked resemblance. There was a singing thrush, guarded carefully against a
                        roving desire for bird-food on the part of Jimmy Woods, and a jar of
                        goldfish. So this little household drifted along quietly and dreamily
                        indeed, but always with the undercurrent of feeling which ran so still
                        because it was so deep.</p>
                    <p>There was no word from Lester for the first few weeks following his
                        departure; he was too busy following up the threads of his new commercial
                        connections and too considerate to wish to keep Jennie in a state of mental
                        turmoil over communications which, under the present circumstances, could
                        mean nothing. He preferred to let matters rest for the time being; then a
                        little later he would write her sanely and calmly of how things were going.
                        He did this after the silence of a month, saying that he had been pretty
                        well pressed by commercial affairs, that he had been in and out of the city
                        frequently (which was the truth), and that he would probably be away from
                        Chicago a large part of the time in the future. He inquired after Vesta and
                        the condition of affairs generally at Sandwood. &quot;I may get up there
                        one of these days,&quot; he suggested, but he really did not mean to
                        come, and Jennie knew that he did not.</p>
                    <p>Another month passed, and then there was a second letter from him, not so
                        long as the first one. Jennie had written him frankly and fully, telling him
                        just how <pb id="VAA2406-394" n="387"/> things stood with her. She concealed
                        entirely her own feelings in the matter, saying that she liked the life very
                        much, and that she was glad to be at Sandwood. She expressed the hope that
                        now everything was coming out for the best for him, and tried to show him
                        that she was really glad matters had been settled. &quot;You
                        mustn&apos;t think of me as being unhappy,&quot; she said in one
                        place, &quot;for I&apos;m not. I am sure it ought to be just as it
                        is, and I wouldn&apos;t be happy if it were any other way. Lay out your
                        life so as to give yourself the greatest happiness, Lester,&quot; she
                        added. &quot;You deserve it. Whatever you do will be just right for me.
                        I won&apos;t mind.&quot; She had Mrs. Gerald in mind, and he
                        suspected as much, but he felt that her generosity must be tinged greatly
                        with selfsacrifice and secret unhappiness. It was the one thing which made
                        him hesitate about taking that final step.</p>
                    <p>The written word and the hidden thoughthow they conflict! After six months
                        the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on his part, and at eight it
                        had ceased temporarily.</p>
                    <p>One morning, as she was glancing over the daily paper, she saw among the
                        society notes the following item:</p>
                    <p>The engagement of Mrs. Malcolm Gerald, of 4044 Drexel Boulevard, to Lester
                        Kane, second son of the late Archibald Kane, of Cincinnati, was formally
                        announced at a party given by the prospective bride on Tuesday to a circle
                        of her immediate friends. The wedding will take place in April.</p>
                    <p>The paper fell from her hands. For a few minutes she sat perfectly still,
                        looking straight ahead of her. Could this thing be so? she asked herself.
                        Had it really come at last? She had known that it must come, and yetand yet
                        she had always hoped that it would not. Why had she hoped? Had not she
                        herself sent him away? Had not she herself suggested this very thing in a
                        roundabout way? It had come now. What must she do? Stay <pb id="VAA2406-395"
                            n="[388]"/> here as a pensioner? The idea was objectionable to her. And
                        yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers absolutely. In the hands of a
                        trust company in La Salle Street were railway certificates aggregating
                        seventy-five thousand dollars, which yielded four thousand five hundred
                        annually, the income being paid to her direct. Could she refuse to receive
                        this money? There was Vesta to be considered.</p>
                    <p>Jennie felt hurt through and through by this dnouement, and yet as she sat
                        there she realized that it was foolish to be angry. Life was always doing
                        this sort of a thing to her. It would go on doing so. She was sure of it. If
                        she went out in the world and earned her own living what difference would it
                        make to him? What difference would it make to Mrs. Gerald? Here she was
                        walled in this little place, leading an obscure existence, and there was he
                        out in the great world enjoying life in its fullest and freest sense. It was
                        too bad. But why cry? Why?</p>
                    <p>Her eyes indeed were dry, but her very soul seemed to be torn in pieces
                        within her. She rose carefully, hid the newspaper at the bottom of a trunk,
                        and turned the key upon it.</p>
                </div2>

                    <head>CHAPTER LVIII</head>
                    <p>NOW that his engagement to Mrs. Gerald was an accomplished. fact, Lester
                        found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the new order of
                        things; undoubtedly it was all for the best. He was sorry for Jennievery
                        sorry. So was Mrs. Gerald: but there was a practical unguent to her grief in
                        the thought that it was best for both Lester and the girl. He would be
                        happierwas so now. And Jennie would eventually realize that she had done a
                        wise and kindly thing; she would be glad in the consciousness that she had
                        acted so unselfishly. As for Mrs. Gerald, because of her indifference to the
                        late Malcolm Gerald, and because she was realizing the dreams of her youth
                        in getting Lester at lasteven though a little lateshe was intensely happy.
                        She could think of nothing finer than this daily life with himthe places
                        they would go, the things they would see. Her first season in Chicago as
                        Mrs. Lester Kane the following winter was going to be something worth
                        remembering. And as for Japanthat was almost too good to be true.</p>
                    <p>Lester wrote to Jennie of his coming marriage to Mrs. Gerald. He said that he
                        had no explanation to make. It wouldn&apos;t be worth anything if he did
                        make it. He thought he ought to marry Mrs. Gerald. He thought he ought to
                        let her (Jennie) know. He hoped she was well. He wanted her always to feel
                        that he had her real interests at heart. He would do anything in his power
                        to make life as pleasant and agrreable for her as possible. He hoped she
                        would forgive him. And would <pb id="VAA2406-397" n="390"/> she remember him
                        affectionately to Vesta? She ought to be sent to a finishing school.</p>
                    <p>Jennie understood the situation perfectly. She knew that Lester had been
                        drawn to Mrs. Gerald from the time he met her at the Carlton in London. She
                        had been angling for him. Now she had him. It was all right. She hoped he
                        would be happy. She was glad to write and tell him so, explaining that she
                        had seen the announcement in the papers. Lester read her letter
                        thoughtfully; there was more between the lines than the written words
                        conveyed. Her fortitude was a charm to him even in this hour. In spite of
                        all he had done and what he was now going to do, he realized that he still
                        cared for Jennie in a way. She was a noble and a charming woman. If
                        everything else had been all right he would not be going to marry Mrs.
                        Gerald at all. And yet he did marry her.</p>
                    <p>The ceremony was performed on April fifteenth, at the residence of Mrs.
                        Gerald, a Roman Catholic priest officiating. Lester was a poor example of
                        the faith he occasionally professed. He was an agnostic, but because he had
                        been reared in the church he felt that he might as well be married in it.
                        Some fifty guests, intimate friends, had been invited. The ceremony went off
                        with perfect smoothness. There were jubilant congratulations and showers of
                        rice and confetti. While the guests were still eating and drinking Lester
                        and Letty managed to escape by a side entrance into a closed carriage, and
                        were off. Fifteen minutes later there was pursuit pell-mell on the part of
                        the guests to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific depot; but by that time
                        the happy couple were in their private car, and the arrival of the rice
                        throwers made no difference. More champagne was opened; then the starting of
                        the train ended all excitement, and the newly wedded pair were at last
                        safely off.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now you have me,&quot; said Lester, cheerfully pulling
                        Letty down beside him into a seat, &quot;what of it?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-398" n="391"/>
                    <p>&quot;This of it,&quot; she exclaimed, and hugged him close, kissing
                        him fervently. In four days they were in San Francisco, and two days later
                        on board a fast steamship bound for the land of the Mikado.</p>
                    <p>In the meanwhile Jennie was left to brood. The original announcement in the
                        newspapers had said that he was to be married in April, and she had kept
                        close watch for additional information. Finally she learned that the wedding
                        would take place on April fifteenth at the residence of the prospective
                        bride, the hour being high noon. In spite of her feeling of resignation,
                        Jennie followed it all hopelessly, like a child, hungry and forlorn, looking
                        into a lighted window at Christmas time.</p>
                    <p>On the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve o&apos;clock to
                        strike; it seemed as though she were really present and looking on. She
                        could see in her mind&apos;s eye the handsome residence, the carriages,
                        the guests, the feast, the merriment, the ceremonyall. Telepathically and
                        psychologically she received impressions of the private car and of the
                        joyous journey they were going to take. The papers had stated that they
                        would spend their honeymoon in Japan. Their honeymoon! Her Lester! And Mrs.
                        Gerald was so attractive. She could see her nowthe new Mrs. Kanethe only <hi
                            rend="i">Mrs.</hi> Kane that ever was, lying in his arms. He had held
                        her so once. He had loved her. Yes, he had! There was a solid lump in her
                        throat as she thought of this. Oh, dear! She sighed to herself, and clasped
                        her hands forcefully; but it did no good. She was just as miserable as
                        before.</p>
                    <p>When the day was over she was actually relieved; anyway, the deed was done
                        and nothing could change it. Vesta was sympathetically aware of what was
                        happening, but kept silent. She too had seen the report in the newspaper.
                        When the first and second day after had passed Jennie was much calmer
                        mentally, for now she was face to face with the inevitable. But it was weeks
                            <pb id="VAA2406-399" n="392"/> before the sharp pain dulled to the old
                        familiar ache. Then there were months before they would be back again,
                        though, of course, that made no difference now. Only Japan seemed so far
                        off, and somehow she had liked the thought that Lester was near hersomewhere
                        in the city.</p>
                    <p>The spring and summer passed, and now it was early in October. One chilly day
                        Vesta came home from school complaining of a headache. When Jennie had given
                        her hot milka favorite remedy of her mother&apos;sand had advised a cold
                        towel for the back of her head, Vesta went to her room and lay down. The
                        following morning she had a slight fever. This lingered while the local
                        physician, Dr. Emory, treated her tentatively, suspecting that it might be
                        typhoid, of which there were several cases in the village. This doctor told
                        Jennie that Vesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it
                        off, but it might be that she would have a severe siege. Mistrusting her own
                        skill in so delicate a situation, Jennie sent to Chicago for a trained
                        nurse, and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination of
                        fear, longing, hope, and courage.</p>
                    <p>Now there could be no doubt; the disease was typhoid. Jennie hesitated about
                        communicating with Lester, who was supposed to be in New York; the papers
                        had said that he intended to spend the winter there. But when the doctor,
                        after watching the case for a week, pronounced it severe, she thought she
                        ought to write anyhow, for no one could tell what would happen. Lester had
                        been so fond of Vesta. He would probably want to know.</p>
                    <p>The letter sent to him did not reach him, for at the time it arrived he was
                        on his way to the West Indies. Jennie was compelled to watch alone by
                        Vesta&apos;s sickbed, for although sympathetic neighbors, realizing the
                        pathos of the situation were attentive, they could not supply the spiritual
                        consolation which only those who <pb id="VAA2406-400" n="393"/> truly love
                        us can give. There was a period when Vesta appeared to be rallying, and both
                        the physician and the nurse were hopeful; but afterward she became weaker.
                        It was said by Dr. Emory that her heart and kidneys had become affected.</p>
                    <p>There came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was imminent. The
                        doctor&apos;s face was grave, the nurse was non-committal in her
                        opinion. Jennie hovered about, praying the only prayer that is prayerthe
                        fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one issuethat Vesta should
                        get well. The child had come so close to her during the last few years! She
                        understood her mother. She was beginning to realize clearly what her life
                        had been. And Jennie, through her, had grown to a broad understanding of
                        responsibility. She knew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have
                        children. If Lester had not objected to it, and she had been truly married,
                        she would have been glad to have others. Again, she had always felt that she
                        owed Vesta so muchat least a long and happy life to make up to her for the
                        ignominy of her birth and rearing. Jennie had been so happy during the past
                        few years to see Vesta growing into beautiful, graceful, intelligent
                        womanhood. And now she was dying. Dr. Emory finally sent to Chicago for a
                        physician friend of his, who came to consider the case with him. He was an
                        old man, grave, sympathetic, understanding. He shook his head. &quot;The
                        treatment has been correct,&quot; he said. &quot;Her system does not
                        appear to be strong enough to endure the strain. Some physiques are more
                        susceptible to this malady than others.&quot; It was agreed that if
                        within three days a change for the better did not come the end was close at
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>No one can conceive the strain to which Jennie&apos;s spirit was
                        subjected by this intelligence, for it was deemed best that she should know.
                        She hovered about white-facedfeeling intensely, but scarcely thinking. She
                        seemed <pb id="VAA2406-401" n="394"/> to vibrate consciously with
                        Vesta&apos;s altering states. If there was the least improvement she
                        felt it physically. If there was a decline her barometric temperament
                        registered the fact.</p>
                    <p>There was a Mrs. Davis, a fine, motherly soul of fifty, stout and
                        sympathetic, who lived four doors from Jennie, and who understood quite well
                        how she was feeling. She had co-operated with the nurse and doctor from the
                        start to keep Jennie&apos;s mental state as nearly normal as possible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, you just go to your room and lie down, Mrs. Kane,&quot;
                        she would say to Jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the
                        bedside or wandering to and fro, wondering what to do.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll take charge of everything. I&apos;ll do just
                        what you would do. Lord bless you, don&apos;t you think I know?
                        I&apos;ve been the mother of seven and lost three. Don&apos;t you
                        think I understand?&quot;. Jennie put her head on her big, warm shoulder
                        one day and cried. Mrs. Davis cried with her. &quot;I
                        understand,&quot; she said. &quot;There, there, you poor dear. Now
                        you come with me.&quot; And she led her to her sleeping-room.</p>
                    <p>Jennie could not be away long. She came back after a few minutes unrested and
                        unrefreshed. Finally one midnight, when the nurse had persuaded her that all
                        would be well until morning anyhow, there came a hurried stirring in the
                        sick-room. Jennie was lying down for a few minutes on her bed in the
                        adjoining room. She heard it and arose. Mrs. Davis had come in, and she and
                        the nurse were conferring as to Vesta&apos;s conditionstanding close
                        beside her.</p>
                    <p>Jennie understood. She came up and looked at her daughter keenly.
                        Vesta&apos;s pale, waxen face told the story. She was breathing faintly,
                        her eyes closed. &quot;She&apos;s very weak,&quot; whispered the
                        nurse. Mrs. Davis took Jennie&apos;s hand.</p>
                    <p>The moments passed, and after a time the clock in the hall struck one. Miss
                        Murfree, the nurse, moved to the medicine-table several times, wetting a
                        soft piece of <pb id="VAA2406-402" n="[395]"/> cotton cloth with alcohol and
                        bathing Vesta&apos;s lips. At the striking of the half-hour there was a
                        stir of the weak bodya profound sigh. Jennie bent forward eagerly, but Mrs.
                        Davis drew her back. The nurse came and motioned them away. Respiration had
                        ceased.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Davis seized Jennie firmly. &quot;There, there, you poor
                        dear,&quot; she whispered when she began to shake. &quot;It
                        can&apos;t be helped. Don&apos;t cry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed Vesta&apos;s still
                        warm hand. &quot;Oh no, Vesta,&quot; she pleaded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not you! Not you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There, dear, come now,&quot; soothed the voice of Mrs. Davis.
                        &quot;Can&apos;t you leave it all in God&apos;s hands?
                        Can&apos;t you believe that everything is for the best?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie felt as if the earth had fallen. All ties were broken. There was no
                        light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LIX</head>
                    <p>THIS added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to throw Jennie
                        back into that state of hyper-melancholia from which she had been drawn with
                        difficulty during the few years of comfort and affection which she had
                        enjoyed with Lester in Hyde Park. It was really weeks before she could
                        realize that Vesta was gone. The emaciated figure which she saw for a day or
                        two after the end did not seem like Vesta. Where was the joy and lightness,
                        the quickness of motion, the subtle radiance of health? All gone. Only this
                        pale, lily-hued shelland silence. Jennie had no tears to shed; only a deep,
                        insistent pain to feel. If only some counselor of eternal wisdom could have
                        whispered to her that obvious and convincing truththere are no dead.</p>
                    <p>Miss Murfree, Dr. Emory, Mrs. Davis, and some others among the neighbors were
                        most sympathetic and considerate. Mrs. Davis sent a telegram to Lester
                        saying that Vesta was dead, but, being absent, there was no response. The
                        house was looked after with scrupulous care by others, for Jennie was
                        incapable of attending to it herself. She walked about looking at things
                        which Vesta had owned or likedthings which Lester or she had given
                        hersighing over the fact that Vesta would not need or use them any more. She
                        gave instructions that the body should be taken to Chicago and buried in the
                        Cemetery of the Redeemer, for Lester, at the time of Gerhardt&apos;s
                        death, had purchased a small plot of ground there. She also expressed her
                        wish that the <pb id="VAA2406-404" n="397"/> minister of the little Lutheran
                        church in Cottage Grove Avenue, where Gerhardt had attended, should be
                        requested to say a few words at the grave. There were the usual preliminary
                        services at the house. The local Methodist minister read a portion of the
                        first epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, and a body of Vesta&apos;s
                        classmates sang &quot;Nearer My God to Thee.&quot; There were
                        flowers, a white coffin, a world of sympathetic expressions, and then Vesta
                        was taken away. The coffin was properly incased for transportation, put on
                        the train, and finally delivered at the Lutheran cemetery in Chicago.</p>
                    <p>Jennie moved as one in a dream. She was dazed, almost to the point of
                        insensibility. Five of her neighborhood friends, at the solicitation of Mrs.
                        Davis, were kind enough to accompany her. At the grave-side when the body
                        was finally lowered she looked at it, one might have thought indifferently,
                        for she was numb from suffering. She returned to Sandwood after it was all
                        over, saying that she would not stay long. She wanted to come back to
                        Chicago, where she could be near Vesta and Gerhardt.</p>
                    <p>After the funeral Jennie tried to think of her future. She fixed her mind on
                        the need of doing something, even though she did not need to. She thought
                        that she might like to try nursing, and could start at once to obtain the
                        training which was required. She also thought of William. He was unmarried,
                        and perhaps he might be willing to come and live with her. Only she did not
                        know where he was, and Bass was also in ignorance of his whereabouts. She
                        finally concluded that she would try to get work in a store. Her disposition
                        was against idleness. She could not live alone here, and she could not have
                        her neighbors sympathetically worrying over what was to become of her.
                        Miserable as she was, she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in
                        Chicago, and looking for something to do, or living in a cottage somewhere
                        near the Cemetery of the <pb id="VAA2406-405" n="398"/> Redeemer. It also
                        occurred to her that she might adopt a homeless child. There were a number
                        of orphan asylums in the city.</p>
                    <p>Some three weeks after Vesta&apos;s death Lester returned to Chicago with
                        his wife, and discovered the first letter, the telegram, and an additional
                        note telling him that Vesta was dead. He was truly grieved, for his
                        affection for the girl had been real. He was very sorry for Jennie, and he
                        told his wife that he would have to go out and see her. He was wondering
                        what she would do. She could not live alone. Perhaps he could suggest
                        something which would help her. He took the train to Sandwood, but Jennie
                        had gone to the Hotel Tremont in Chicago. He went there, but Jennie had gone
                        to her daughter&apos;s grave; later he called again and found her in.
                        When the boy presented his card she suffered an upwelling of feelinga wave
                        that was more intense than that with which she had received him in the olden
                        days, for now her need of him was greater.</p>
                    <p>Lester, in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the restoration of
                        his wealth, power, and dignities, had had time to think deeply of what he
                        had done. His original feeling of doubt and dissatisfaction with himself had
                        never wholly quieted. It did not ease him any to know that he had left
                        Jennie comfortably fixed, for it was always so plain to him that money was
                        not the point at issue with her. Affection was what she craved. Without it
                        she was like a rudderless boat on an endless sea, and he knew it. She needed
                        him, and he was ashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his
                        sense of self-preservation and his desire for material advantage. To-day as
                        the elevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry, though he knew
                        now that no act of his could make things right. He had been to blame from
                        the very beginning, first for taking her, then for failing to stick by a bad
                        bargain. Well, it could <pb id="VAA2406-406" n="399"/> not be helped now.
                        The best thing he could do was to be fair, to counsel with her, to give her
                        the best of his sympathy and advice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, Jennie,&quot; he said familiarly as she opened the door
                        to him in her hotel room, his glance taking in the ravages which death and
                        suffering had wrought. She was thinner, her face quite drawn and colorless,
                        her eyes larger by contrast. &quot;I&apos;m awfully sorry about
                        Vesta,&quot; he said a little awkwardly. &quot;I never dreamed
                        anything like that could happen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her since Vesta
                        diedsince Lester had left her, in fact. It touched her that he had come to
                        sympathize; for the moment she could not speak. Tears welled over her
                        eyelids and down upon her cheeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t cry, Jennie,&quot; he said, putting his arm
                        around her and holding her head to his shoulder. &quot;I&apos;m
                        sorry. I&apos;ve been sorry for a good many things that can&apos;t
                        be helped now. I&apos;m intensely sorry for this. Where did you bury
                        her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Beside papa,&quot; she said, sobbing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Too bad,&quot; he murmured, and held her in silence. She
                        finally gained control of herself sufficiently to step away from him; then
                        wiping her eyes with her handkerchief, she asked him to sit down.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m so sorry,&quot; he went on, &quot;that this
                        should have happened while I was away. I would have been with you if I had
                        been here. I suppose you won&apos;t want to live out at Sandwood
                        now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t, Lester,&quot; she replied. &quot;I
                        couldn&apos;t stand it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you thinking of going?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know yet. I didn&apos;t want to be a
                        bother to those people out there. I thought I&apos;d get a little house
                        somewhere and adopt a baby maybe, or get something to do. I don&apos;t
                        like to be alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That isn&apos;t a bad idea,&quot; he said, &quot;that
                        of adopting a <pb id="VAA2406-407" n="400"/> baby. It would be a lot of
                        company for you. You know how to go about getting one?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You just ask at one of these asylums, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think there&apos;s something more than that,&quot; he
                        replied thoughtfully. &quot;There are some formalitiesI don&apos;t
                        know what they are. They try to keep control of the child in some way. You
                        had better consult with Watson and get him to help you. Pick out your baby,
                        and then let him do the rest. I&apos;ll speak to him about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester saw that she needed companionship badly. &quot;Where is your
                        brother George?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s in Rochester, but he couldn&apos;t come. Bass
                        said he was married,&quot; she added.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There isn&apos;t any other member of the family you could
                        persuade to come and live with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might get William, but I don&apos;t know where he
                        is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park,&quot; he
                        suggested, &quot;if you want a house here in Chicago? I see some nice
                        cottages out that way. You needn&apos;t buy. just rent until you see how
                        well you&apos;re satisfied.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester. It was good of
                        him to take this much interest in her affairs. She wasn&apos;t entirely
                        separated from him after all. He cared a little. She asked him how his wife
                        was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he was going to stay in
                        Chicago. All the while he was thinking that he had treated her badly. He
                        went to the window and looked down into Dearborn Street, the world of
                        traffic below holding his attention. The great mass of trucks and vehicles,
                        the counter streams of hurrying pedestrians, seemed like a puzzle. So
                        shadows march in a dream. It was growing dusk, and lights were springing up
                        here and there.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to tell you something, Jennie,&quot; said Lester,
                        finally rousing himself from his fit of abstraction. &quot;I may seem
                        peculiar to you, after all that has happened, but I still care for youin my
                        way. I&apos;ve thought of you <pb id="VAA2406-408" n="401"/> right along
                        since I left. I thought it good business to leave youthe way things were. I
                        thought I liked Letty well enough to marry her. From one point of view it
                        still seems best, but I&apos;m not so much happier. I was just as happy
                        with you as I ever will be. It isn&apos;t myself that&apos;s
                        important in this transaction apparently; the individual doesn&apos;t
                        count much in the situation. I don&apos;t know whether you see what
                        I&apos;m driving at, but all of us are more or less pawns.
                        We&apos;re moved about like chessmen by circumstances over which we have
                        no control.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand, Lester,&quot; she answered.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not complaining. I know it&apos;s for the
                        best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;After all, life is more or less of a farce,&quot; he went on a
                        little bitterly. &quot;It&apos;s a silly show. The best we can do is
                        to hold our personality intact. It doesn&apos;t appear that integrity
                        has much to do with it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew it meant
                        that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry for her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry over me, Lester,&quot; she consoled.
                        &quot;I&apos;m all right; I&apos;ll get along. It did seem
                        terrible to me for a whilegetting used to being alone. I&apos;ll be all
                        right now. I&apos;ll get along.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to feel that my attitude hasn&apos;t
                        changed,&quot; he continued eagerly. &quot;I&apos;m interested
                        in what concerns you. Mrs.Letty understands that. She knows just how I feel.
                        When you get settled I&apos;ll come in and see how you&apos;re
                        fixed. I&apos;ll come around here again in a few days. You understand
                        how I feel, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>He took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; he said. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t want you to do that. I&apos;ll do the best I can.
                        You&apos;re still Jennie to me, if you don&apos;t mind. I&apos;m
                        pretty bad, but I&apos;m not all bad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all right, Lester. I wanted you to do as you did.
                        It&apos;s for the best. You probably are happy since&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-409" n="[402]"/>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Jennie,&quot; he interrupted; then he pressed
                        affectionately her hand, her arm, her shoulder. &quot;Want to kiss me
                        for old times&apos; sake?&quot; he smiled.</p>
                    <p>She put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes, then kissed
                        him. When their lips met she trembled. Lester also felt unsteady. Jennie saw
                        his agitation, and tried hard to speak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better go now,&quot; she said firmly.
                        &quot;It&apos;s getting dark.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to remain; she
                        was still the one woman in the world for him. And Jennie felt comforted even
                        though the separation still existed in all its finality. She did not
                        endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and ethical entanglements of the
                        situation. She was not, like so many, endeavoring to put the ocean into a
                        tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting universe in a mess of strings called law.
                        Lester still cared for her a little. He cared for Letty too. That was all
                        right. She had hoped once that he might want her only. Since he did not, was
                        his affection worth nothing? She could not think, she could not feel that.
                        And neither could he.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LX</head>
                    <p>THE drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and Jennie
                        still farther apart; they settled naturally into their respective spheres,
                        without the renewal of the old time relationship which their several
                        meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to foreshadow. Lester was in the
                        thick of social and commercial affairs; he walked in paths to which
                        Jennie&apos;s retiring soul had never aspired. Jennie&apos;s own
                        existence was quiet and uneventful. There was a simple cottage in a very
                        respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson Park, on the South Side,
                        where she lived in retirement with a little foster-childa chestnut-haired
                        girl taken from the Western Home for the Friendlessas her sole companion.
                        Here she was known as Mrs. J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to
                        abandon the name of Kane. Mr. and Mrs. Lester Kane when resident in Chicago
                        were the occupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where
                        parties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times almost
                        pyrotechnic succession.</p>
                    <p>Lester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and
                        well-entertained existence. He had cut from his list of acquaintances and
                        associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or overfamiliar
                        or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which to him was a
                        memory merely. He was a director, and in several cases the chairman of a
                        board of directors, in nine of the most important financial and commercial
                        organizations of the WestThe United Traction Company of Cincinnati, The
                        Western Crucible Company, The United <pb id="VAA2406-411" n="404"/> Carriage
                        Company. The Second National Bank of Chicago, the First National Bank of
                        Cincinnati, and several others of equal importance. He was never a personal
                        factor in the affairs of The United Carriage Company, preferring to be
                        represented by counselMr. Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in
                        its affairs. He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven
                        years. He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three. Louise, Amy,
                        their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances were practically
                        strangers. The firm of Knight, Keatley &amp; O&apos;Brien had
                        nothing whatever to do with his affairs.</p>
                    <p>The truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little phlegmatic, was
                        becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life. He could not make out
                        what it was all about. In distant ages a queer thing had come to pass. There
                        had started on its way in the form of evolution a minute cellular organism
                        which had apparently reproduced itself by division, had early learned to
                        combine itself with others, to organize itself into bodies, strange forms of
                        fish, animals, and birds, and had finally learned to organize itself into
                        man. Man, on his part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was
                        pushing himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by
                        means of union and organization with other men. Why? Heaven only knew. Here
                        he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of talent, and he
                        had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now scarcely believed he
                        deserved, only luck had favored him. But he could not see that any one else
                        might be said to deserve this wealth any more than himself, seeing that his
                        use of it was as conservative and constructive and practical as the next
                        one&apos;s. He might have been born poor, in which case he would have
                        been as well satisfied as the next onenot more so. Why should he complain,
                        why worry, why speculate?the world was going steadily forward of its own
                        volition, whether he <pb id="VAA2406-412" n="405"/> would or no. Truly it
                        was. And was there any need for him to disturb himself about it? There was
                        not. He fancied at times that it might as well never have been started at
                        all. &quot;The one divine, far-off event&quot; of the poet did not
                        appeal to him as having any basis in fact. Mrs. Lester Kane was of very much
                        the same opinion.</p>
                    <p>Jennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose Perpetua, was
                        of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life. She had not the incisive
                        reasoning capacity of either Mr. or Mrs. Lester Kane. She had seen a great
                        deal, suffered a great deal, and had read some in a desultory way. Her mind
                        had never grasped the nature and character of specialized knowledge.
                        History, physics, chemistry, botany, geology, and sociology were not fixed
                        departments in her brain as they were in Lester&apos;s and
                        Letty&apos;s. Instead there was the feeling that the world moved in some
                        strange, unstable way. Apparently no one knew clearly what it was all about.
                        People were born and died. Some believed that the world had been made six
                        thousand years before; some that it was millions of years old. Was it all
                        blind chance, or was there some guiding intelligencea God? Almost in spite
                        of herself she felt there must be somethinga higher power which produced all
                        the beautiful thingsthe flowers, the stars, the trees, the grass. Nature was
                        so beautiful! If at times life seemed cruel, yet this beauty still
                        persisted. The thought comforted her: she fed upon it in her hours of secret
                        loneliness.</p>
                    <p>It has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn. She liked
                        to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked. She was of
                        matronly proportions in these daysnot disagreeably large, but full bodied,
                        shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her cares. Her eyes were gray and
                        appealing. Her hair was still of a rich brown, but there were traces of gray
                        in it. Her neighbors spoke of her as sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable.
                        They knew nothing of her <pb id="VAA2406-413" n="406"/> history, except that
                        she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before that in Cleveland. She was
                        very reticent as to her past.</p>
                    <p>Jennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care of sick
                        people, that she might get to be a trained nurse. But she was obliged to
                        abandon that idea, for she found that only young people were wanted. She
                        also thought that some charitable organization might employ her, but she did
                        not understand the new theory of charity which was then coming into general
                        acceptance and practicenamely, only to help others to help themselves. She
                        believed in giving, and was not inclined to look too closely into the
                        credentials of those who asked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at
                        one relief agency after another met with indifference, if not unqualified
                        rebuke. She finally decided to adopt another child for Rose
                        Perpetua&apos;s sake; she succeeded in securing a boy, four years old,
                        who was known as Henry Henry Stover. Her support was assured, for her income
                        was paid to her through a trust company. She had no desire for speculation
                        or for the devious ways of trade. The care of flowers, the nature of
                        children, the ordering of a home were more in her province.</p>
                    <p>One of the interesting things in connection with this separation once it had
                        been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for these two since
                        the reading of the will a number of years before had never met. Robert had
                        thought of his brother often. He had followed his success since he had left
                        Jennie with interest. He read of his marriage to Mrs. Gerald with pleasure;
                        he had always considered her an ideal companion for his brother. He knew by
                        many signs and tokens that his brother, since the unfortunate termination of
                        their father&apos;s attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain
                        control of the Kane Company, did not like him. Still they had never been so
                        far apart mentallycertainly not in commercial judgment. Lester was
                        prosperous <pb id="VAA2406-414" n="407"/> now. He could afford to be
                        generous. He could afford to make up. And after all, he had done his best to
                        aid his brother to come to his sensesand with the best intentions. There
                        were mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends. He
                        wondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with him.</p>
                    <p>Time passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the friends with
                        whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore in order to see the
                        splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied. He knew its location from hearsay
                        and description.</p>
                    <p>When he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to him.
                        Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a conservatory built
                        on one side not unlike the one at home in Cincinnati. That same night he sat
                        down and wrote Lester asking if he would not like to dine with him at the
                        Union Club. He was only in town for a day or two, and he would like to see
                        him again. There was some feeling he knew, but there was a proposition he
                        would like to talk to him about. Would he come, say, on Thursday?</p>
                    <p>On the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown study. He
                        had never really been healed of the wound that his father had given him. He
                        had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert had deserted him so
                        summarily. He realized now that the stakes his brother had been playing for
                        were big. But, after all, he had been his brother, and if he had been in
                        Robert&apos;s place at the time, he would not have done as he had done;
                        at least he hoped not. Now Robert wanted to see him.</p>
                    <p>He thought once of not answering at all. Then he thought he would write and
                        say no. But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear what he had to
                        say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came over him; he decided
                        to write yes. It could do no harm. He <pb id="VAA2406-415" n="408"/> knew it
                        could do no good. They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but the
                        damage had been done. Could a broken bowl be mended and called whole? It
                        might be <hi rend="i">called</hi> whole, but what of it? Was it not broken
                        and mended? He wrote and intimated that he would come.</p>
                    <p>On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to remind
                        him of the engagement. Lester listened curiously to the sound of his voice.
                        &quot;All right,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;ll be with
                        you.&quot; At noon he went down-town, and there, within the exclusive
                        precincts of the Union Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other
                        again. Robert was thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little
                        grayer. His eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow&apos;s-feet
                        on either side. His manner was quick, keen, dynamic. Lester was noticeably
                        of another typesolid, brusque, and indifferent. Men spoke of Lester these
                        days as a little hard. Robert&apos;s keen blue eyes did not disturb him
                        in the leastdid not affect him in any way. He saw his brother just as he
                        was, for he had the larger philosophic and interpretative insight; but
                        Robert could not place Lester exactly. He could not fathom just what had
                        happened to him in these years. Lester was stouter, not gray, for some
                        reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking like a man who was fairly well
                        satisfied to take life as he found it. Lester looked at his brother with a
                        keen, steady eye. The latter shifted a little, for he was restless. He could
                        see that there was no loss of that mental force and courage which had always
                        been predominant characteristics in Lester&apos;s make-up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I&apos;d like to see you again, Lester,&quot;
                        Robert remarked, after they had clasped hands in the customary grip.
                        &quot;It&apos;s been a long time nownearly eight years,
                        hasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About that,&quot; replied Lester. &quot;How are things with
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-416" n="409"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, about the same. You&apos;ve been fairly well, I
                        see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never sick,&quot; said Lester. &quot;A little cold now and
                        then. I don&apos;t often go to bed with anything. How&apos;s your
                        wife?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Margaret&apos;s fine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the children?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We don&apos;t see much of Ralph and Berenice since they
                        married, but the others are around more or less. I suppose your wife is all
                        right,&quot; he said hesitatingly. It was difficult ground for Robert.</p>
                    <p>Lester eyed him without a change of expression. &quot;Yes,&quot; he
                        replied. &quot;She enjoys pretty fair health. She&apos;s quite well
                        at present.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired after the
                        business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene. He admitted frankly that he neither
                        saw nor heard from them nowadays. Robert told him what he could.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you,
                        Lester,&quot; said Robert finally,&quot; is this matter of the
                        Western Crucible Steel Company. You haven&apos;t been sitting there as a
                        director in person I notice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for
                        you. Clever man, that. The management isn&apos;t rightwe all know that.
                        We need a practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going
                        to pay properly. I have voted my stock with yours right along because the
                        propositions made by Watson have been right. He agrees with me that things
                        ought to be changed. Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares held by
                        Rossiter&apos;s widow. That with yours and mine would give us control of
                        the company. I would like to have you take them, though it doesn&apos;t
                        make a bit of difference so long as it&apos;s in the family. You can put
                        any one you please in for president, and we&apos;ll make the thing come
                        out right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester smiled. It was a pleasant proposition. Watson had told him that
                        Robert&apos;s interests were co-operating <pb id="VAA2406-417" n="410"/>
                        with him. Lester had long suspected that Robert would like to make up. This
                        was the olive branchthe control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a
                        million and a half.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s very nice of you,&quot; said Lester solemnly.
                        &quot;It&apos;s a rather liberal thing to do. What makes you want to
                        do it now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester,&quot; replied
                        Robert, &quot;I never did feel right about that will business. I never
                        did feel right about that secretary-treasurership and some other things that
                        have happened. I don&apos;t want to rake up the pastyou smile at thatbut
                        I can&apos;t help telling you how I feel. I&apos;ve been pretty
                        ambitious in the past. I was pretty ambitious just about the time that
                        father died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was afraid
                        you might not like it. I have thought since that I ought not to have done
                        it, but I did. I suppose you&apos;re not anxious to hear any more about
                        that old affair. This other thing though&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Might be handed out as a sort of compensation,&quot; put in
                        Lester quietly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not exactly that, Lesterthough it may have something of that in it.
                        I know these things don&apos;t matter very much to you now. I know that
                        the time to do things was years agonot now. Still I thought sincerely that
                        you might be interested in this proposition. It might lead to other things.
                        Frankly, I thought it might patch up matters between us. We&apos;re
                        brothers after all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Lester, &quot;we&apos;re
                        brothers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation. How much had
                        this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past? Robert had practically
                        forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie had been really
                        the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling angry. It was true that
                        Robert had not cut him out of <pb id="VAA2406-418" n="411"/> his one-fourth
                        of his father&apos;s estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get
                        it, and now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things. It
                        hurt himLestera little. It irritated him. Life was strange.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t see it, Robert,&quot; he said finally and
                        determinedly. &quot;I can appreciate the motive that prompts you to make
                        this offer. But I can&apos;t see the wisdom of my taking it. Your
                        opportunity is your opportunity. I don&apos;t want it. We can make all
                        the changes you suggest if you take the stock. I&apos;m rich enough
                        anyhow. Bygones are bygones. I&apos;m perfectly willing to talk with you
                        from time to time. That&apos;s all you want. This other thing is simply
                        a sop with which to plaster an old wound. You want my friendship and so far
                        as I&apos;m concerned you have that. I don&apos;t hold any grudge
                        against you. I won&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Robert looked at him fixedly. He half smiled. He admired Lester in spite of
                        all that he had done to himin spite of all that Lester was doing to him now.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know but what you&apos;re right,
                        Lester,&quot; he admitted finally. &quot;I didn&apos;t make this
                        offer in any petty spirit though. I wanted to patch up this matter of
                        feeling between us. I won&apos;t say anything more about it.
                        You&apos;re not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t expect to,&quot; replied Lester.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you do I&apos;d like to have you come and stay with us.
                        Bring your wife. We could talk over old times.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lester smiled an enigmatic smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be glad to,&quot; he said, without emotion. But
                        he remembered that in the days of Jennie it was different. They would never
                        have receded from their position regarding her. &quot;Well,&quot; he
                        thought, &quot;perhaps I can&apos;t blame them. Let it go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They talked on about other things. Finally Lester remembered an appointment.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll have to leave you soon,&quot; he said, looking
                        at his watch.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ought to go, too,&quot; said Robert. They rose.
                        &quot;Well, <pb id="VAA2406-419" n="[412]"/> anyhow,&quot; he added,
                        as they walked toward the cloakroom, &quot;we won&apos;t be absolute
                        strangers in the future, will we?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said Lester. &quot;I&apos;ll see
                        you from time to time.&quot; They shook hands and separated amicably.
                        There was a sense of unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in
                        Robert&apos;s mind as he saw his brother walking briskly away. Lester
                        was an able man. Why was it that there was so much feeling between themhad
                        been even before Jennie had appeared? Then he remembered his old thoughts
                        about &quot;snaky deeds.&quot; That was what his brother lacked, and
                        that only. He was not crafty; not darkly cruel, hence. &quot;What a
                        world!&quot; he thought.</p>
                    <p>On his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition to, but
                        also of sympathy for, his brother. He was not so terribly bad-not different
                        from other men. Why criticize? What would he have done if he had been in
                        Robert&apos;s place? Robert was getting along. So was he. He could see
                        now how it all came aboutwhy he had been made the victim, why his brother
                        had been made the keeper of the great fortune. &quot;It&apos;s the
                        way the world runs,&quot; he thought. &quot;What difference does it
                        make? I have enough to live on. Why not let it go at that?&quot;</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LXI</head>
                    <p>THE days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according to that
                        supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore years and ten.
                        It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by mouth-to-mouth utterance
                        that it seems the profoundest of truths. As a matter of fact, man, even
                        under his mortal illusion, is organically built to live five times the
                        period of his maturity, and would do so if he but knew that it is spirit
                        which endures, that age is an illusion, and that there is no death. Yet the
                        race-thought, gained from what dream of materialism we know not, persists,
                        and the death of man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is
                        daily registered.</p>
                    <p>Lester was one of those who believed in this formula. He was nearing sixty.
                        He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost to liveperhaps not
                        so long. Well, he had lived comfortably. He felt that he could not complain.
                        If death was coming, let it come. He was ready at any time. No complaint or
                        resistance would issue from him. Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly
                        show anyhow.</p>
                    <p>He admitted that it was mostly illusioneasily proved to be so. That it might
                        all be one he sometimes suspected. It was very much like a dream in its
                        composition trulysometimes like a very bad dream. All he had to sustain him
                        in his acceptance of its reality from hour to hour and day to day was
                        apparent contact with this material proposition and thatpeople, meetings of
                        boards of directors, individuals and organizations <pb id="VAA2406-421"
                            n="414"/> planning to do this and that, his wife&apos;s social
                        functions. Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a philosopher. She
                        admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined, phlegmatic attitude in the
                        face of troubled circumstance. All the winds of fortune or misfortune could
                        not apparently excite or disturb Lester. He refused to be frightened. He
                        refused to budge from his beliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed
                        away from them, still believing, if he were gotten away at all. He refused
                        to do anything save as he always said, &quot;Look the facts in the
                        face&quot; and fight. He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed
                        upon, but only in a stubborn, resisting way. His plan was to resist every
                        effort to coerce him to the last ditch. If he had to let go in the end he
                        would when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go were
                        quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.</p>
                    <p>His views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in creature
                        comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of everything. If
                        the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he was for having them
                        torn out and sold and the house done over. If he traveled, money must go
                        ahead of him and smooth the way. He did not want argument, useless talk, or
                        silly palaver as he called it. Every one must discuss interesting topics
                        with him or not talk at all. Letty understood him thoroughly. She would
                        chuck him under the chin mornings, or shake his solid head between her
                        hands, telling him he was a brute, but a nice kind of a brute.
                        &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he would growl. &quot; I know.
                        I&apos;m an animal, I suppose. You&apos;re a seraphic suggestion of
                        attenuated thought.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No; you hush,&quot; she would reply, for at times he could cut
                        like a knife without really meaning to be unkind. Then he would pet her a
                        little, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized that
                        she was more or less dependent upon him. It was always so plain to <pb
                            id="VAA2406-422" n="415"/> her that he could get along without her. For
                        reasons of kindliness he was trying to conceal this, to pretend the
                        necessity of her presence, but it was so obvious that he really could
                        dispense with her easily enough. Now Letty did depend upon Lester. It was
                        something, in so shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and
                        determined a quantity as this bear-man. It was like being close to a warmly
                        glowing lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold. Lester was
                        not afraid of anything. He felt that he knew how to live and to die.</p>
                    <p>It was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its solid,
                        material manifestation at every point. Having his financial affairs well in
                        hand, most of his holding being shares of big companies, where boards of
                        solemn directors merely approved the strenuous efforts of ambitious
                        executives to &quot;make good,&quot; he had leisure for living. He
                        and Letty were fond of visiting the various American and European
                        watering-places. He gambled a little, for he found that there was
                        considerable diversion in risking interesting sums on the spin of a wheel or
                        the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he took more and more to drinking, not in
                        the sense that a drunkard takes to it, but as a high liver, socially, and
                        with all his friends. He was inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did
                        not take straight whiskeychampagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and
                        effervescent white wines. When he drank he could drink a great deal, and he
                        ate in proportion. Nothing must be served but the bestsoup, fish, entre,
                        roast, game, desserteverything that made up a showy dinnerand he had long
                        since determined that only a high-priced chef was worth while. They had
                        found an old <hi rend="i">cordon bleu,</hi> Louis Berdot, who had served in
                        the house of one of the great dry goods princes, and this man he engaged. He
                        cost Lester a hundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that
                        he only had one life to live.</p>
                    <p>The trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted <pb id="VAA2406-423"
                            n="416"/> nothing, improved nothing, left everything to drift on toward
                        an indefinite end. If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the
                        comparatively meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained
                        the same attitude to the end. It would have led him to a stolid indifference
                        to the social world of which now necessarily he was a part. He would have
                        drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have accepted
                        him for what he wasa good fellowand Jennie in the end would not have been so
                        much better off than she was now.</p>
                    <p>One of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes transferred their
                        residence to New York. Mrs. Kane had become very intimate with a group of
                        clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or nine hundred, and had been
                        advised and urged to transfer the scene of her activities to New York. She
                        finally did so, leasing a house in Seventy-eighth Street, near Madison
                        Avenue. She installed a novelty for her, a complete staff of liveried
                        servants, after the English fashion, and had the rooms of her house done in
                        correlative periods. Lester smiled at her vanity and love of show.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You talk about your democracy,&quot; he grunted one day.
                        &quot;You have as much democracy as I have religion, and that&apos;s
                        none at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, how you talk!&quot; she denied. &quot;I am democratie.
                        We all run in classes. You do. I&apos;m merely accepting the logic of
                        the situation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The logic of your grandmother! Do you call a butler and doorman in
                        red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I certainly do,&quot; she replied. &quot;Maybe not the
                        necessity exactly, but the spirit surely. Why should you quarrel?
                        You&apos;re the first one to insist on perfectionto quarrel if there is
                        any flaw in the order of things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You never heard me quarrel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t mean that literally. But you demand <pb
                            id="VAA2406-424" n="417"/> perfectionthe exact spirit of the occasion,
                        and you know it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am democratic. I insist on it. I&apos;m as democratic in
                        spirit as any woman. Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as
                        possible for comfort&apos;s sake, and so do you. Don&apos;t you
                        throw rocks at my glass house, Mister Master. Yours is so transparent I can
                        see every move you make inside.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m democratic and you&apos;re not,&quot; he
                        teased; but he approved thoroughly of everything she did. She was, he
                        sometimes fancied, a better executive in her world than he was in his.</p>
                    <p>Drifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of this
                        curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking no physical
                        exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous, quick-moving,
                        well-balanced organism into one where plethora of substance was clogging
                        every essential function. His liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreasevery organ,
                        in facthad been overtaxed for some time to keep up the process of digestion
                        and elimination. In the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy.
                        His kidneys were weak, and so were the arteries of his brain. By dieting,
                        proper exercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty
                        or ninety. As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into a
                        physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous. The
                        result was inevitable, and it came.</p>
                    <p>It so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a cruise with
                        a party of friends. Lester, in order to attend to some important business,
                        decided to return to Chicago late in November; he arranged to have his wife
                        meet him in New York just before the Christmas holidays. He wrote Watson to
                        expect him, and engaged rooms at the Auditorium, for he had sold <pb
                            id="VAA2406-425" n="418"/> the Chicago residence some two years before
                        and was now living permanently in New York.</p>
                    <p>One late November day, after having attended to a number of details and
                        cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with what the
                        doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in the intestinesa
                        disturbance usually symptomatic of some other weakness, either of the blood
                        or of some organ. He suffered great pain, and the usual remedies in that
                        case were applied. There were bandages of red flannel with a mustard
                        dressing, and specifics were also administered. He experienced some relief,
                        but he was troubled with a sense of impending disaster. He had Watson cable
                        his wifethere was nothing serious about it, but he was ill. A trained nurse
                        was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door to prevent annoyance
                        of any kind. It was plain that Letty could not reach Chicago under three
                        weeks. He had the feeling that he would not see her again.</p>
                    <p>Curiously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because he had
                        never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking about her
                        constantly at this time. He had intended to go out and see her just as soon
                        as he was through with his business engagements and before he left the city.
                        He had asked Watson how she was getting along, and had been informed that
                        everything was well with her. She was living quietly and looking in good
                        health, so Watson said. Lester wished he could see her.</p>
                    <p>This thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better. He was suffering
                        from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that seemed to tie
                        his viscera into knots, and left him very weak. Several times the physician
                        administered cocaine with a needle in order to relieve him of useless pain.</p>
                    <p>After one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told him to
                        send the nurse away, and then said: <pb id="VAA2406-426" n="419"/>
                        &quot;Watson, I&apos;d like to have you do me a favor. Ask Mrs.
                        Stover if she won&apos;t come here to see me. You&apos;d better go
                        and get her. Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet) away for the
                        afternoon, or while she&apos;s here. If she comes at any other time
                        I&apos;d like to have her admitted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Watson understood. He liked this expression of sentiment. He was sorry for
                        Jennie. He was sorry for Lester. He wondered what the world would think if
                        it could know of this bit of romance in connection with so prominent a man.
                        Lester was decent. He had made Watson prosperous. The latter was only too
                        glad to serve him in any way.</p>
                    <p>He called a carriage and rode out to Jennie&apos;s residence. He found
                        her watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his unusual
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs. Stover,&quot; he
                        said, using her assumed name. &quot;Yourthat is, Mr. Kane is quite sick
                        at the Auditorium. His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I
                        wouldn&apos;t come out here and ask you to come and see him. He wanted
                        me to bring you, if possible. Could you come with me now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why yes,&quot; said Jennie, her face a study. The children were
                        in school. An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen. She could go as
                        well as not. But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she had had
                        several nights before. It had seemed to her that she was out on a dark,
                        mystic body of water over which was hanging something like a fog, or a pall
                        of smoke. She heard the water ripple, or stir faintly, and then out of the
                        surrounding darkness a boat appeared. It was a little boat, oarless, or not
                        visibly propelled, and in it were her mother, and Vesta, and some one whom
                        she could not make out. Her mother&apos;s face was pale and sad, very
                        much as she had often seen it in life. She looked at Jennie solemnly,
                        sympathetically, and then suddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant
                        of the boat was <pb id="VAA2406-427" n="420"/> Lester. He looked at her
                        gloomilyan expression she had never seen on his face beforeand then her
                        mother remarked, &quot;Well, we must go now.&quot; The boat began to
                        move, a great sense of loss came over her, and she cried, &quot;Oh,
                        don&apos;t leave me, mamma!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and the boat
                        was gone.</p>
                    <p>She woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her. She
                        stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up in the
                        dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone. A great sense of
                        depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted her. Then, when it
                        seemed as if it were nothing, Mr. Watson appeared with his ominous message.</p>
                    <p>She went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her thoughts.
                        She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly woman, well
                        dressed and shapely. She had never been separated mentally from Lester, just
                        as he had never grown entirely away from her. She was always with him in
                        thought, just as in the years when they were together. Her fondest memories
                        were of the days when he first courted her in Clevelandthe days when he had
                        carried her off, much as the cave-man seized his mateby force. Now she
                        longed to do what she could for him. For this call was as much a testimony
                        as a shock. He loved herhe loved her, after all.</p>
                    <p>The carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky down-town
                        district. It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was escorted to
                        Lester&apos;s room. Watson had been considerate. He had talked little,
                        leaving her to her thoughts. In this great hotel she felt diffident after so
                        long a period of complete retirement. As she entered the room she looked at
                        Lester with large, gray, sympathetic eyes. He was lying propped up on two
                        pillows, his solid head with its growth of once dark brown hair slightly
                        grayed. He looked at her curiously <pb id="VAA2406-428" n="421"/> out of his
                        wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection shining in themweary as
                        they were. Jennie was greatly distressed. His pale face, slightly drawn from
                        suffering, cut her like a knife. She took his hand, which was outside the
                        coverlet, and pressed it. She leaned over and kissed his lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m so sorry, Lester,&quot; she murmured.
                        &quot;I&apos;m so sorry. You&apos;re not very sick though, are
                        you? You must get well, Lesterand soon!&quot; She patted his hand
                        gently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, Jennie, but I&apos;m pretty bad,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t feel right about this business. I don&apos;t
                        seem able to shake it off. But tell me, how have you been?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, just the same, dear,&quot; she replied.
                        &quot;I&apos;m all right. You mustn&apos;t talk like that,
                        though. You&apos;re going to be all right very soon now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled grimly. &quot;Do you think so?&quot; He shook his head, for
                        he thought differently. &quot;Sit down, dear,&quot; he went on,
                        &quot;I&apos;m not worrying about that. I want to talk to you again.
                        I want you near me.&quot; He sighed and shut his eyes for a minute.</p>
                    <p>She drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and took his
                        hand. It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send for her. Her eyes
                        showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and gratitude of her heart. At the
                        same time fear gripped her; how ill he looked!</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t tell what may happen,&quot; he went on.
                        &quot;Letty is in Europe. I&apos;ve wanted to see you again for some
                        time. I was coming out this trip. We are living in New York, you know.
                        You&apos;re a little stouter, Jennie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I&apos;m getting old, Lester,&quot; she smiled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that doesn&apos;t make any difference,&quot; he
                        replied, looking at her fixedly. &quot;Age doesn&apos;t count. We
                        are all in that boat. It&apos;s how we feel about life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stopped and stared at the ceiling. A slight twinge of pain reminded him of
                        the vigorous seizures he had been <pb id="VAA2406-429" n="422"/> through. He
                        couldn&apos;t stand many more paroxysms like the last one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t go, Jennie, without seeing you again,&quot;
                        he observed, when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve always wanted to say to you, Jennie,&quot; he
                        went on, &quot;that I haven&apos;t been satisfied with the way we
                        parted. It wasn&apos;t the right thing, after all. I haven&apos;t
                        been any happier. I&apos;m sorry. I wish now, for my own peace of mind,
                        that I hadn&apos;t done it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t say that, Lester,&quot; she demurred, going over
                        in her mind all that had been between them. This was such a testimony to
                        their real uniontheir real spiritual compatibility. &quot;It&apos;s
                        all right. It doesn&apos;t make any difference. You&apos;ve been
                        very good to me. I wouldn&apos;t have been satisfied to have you lose
                        your fortune. It couldn&apos;t be that way. I&apos;ve been a lot
                        better satisfied as it is. It&apos;s been hard, but, dear, everything is
                        hard at times.&quot; She paused.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;It wasn&apos;t right. The
                        thing wasn&apos;t worked out right from the start; but that
                        wasn&apos;t your fault. I&apos;m sorry. I wanted to tell you that.
                        I&apos;m glad I&apos;m here to do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t talk that way, Lesterplease
                        don&apos;t,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;It&apos;s all right.
                        You needn&apos;t be sorry. There&apos;s nothing to be sorry for. You
                        have always been so good to me. Why, when I think&quot; she stopped, for
                        it was hard for her to speak. She was choking with affection and sympathy.
                        She pressed his hands. She was recalling the house he took for her family in
                        Cleveland, his generous treatment of Gerhardt, all the long ago tokens of
                        love and kindness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ve told you now, and I feel better.
                        You&apos;re a good woman, Jennie, and you&apos;re kind to come to me
                        this way.&quot; I loved you. I love you now. I want to tell you that. It
                        seems strange, but you&apos;re the only woman I ever did love truly. We
                        should never have parted.</p>
                    <p>Jennie caught her breath. It was the one thing she <pb id="VAA2406-430"
                            n="[423]"/> had waited for all these yearsthis testimony. It was the one
                        thing that could make everything rightthis confession of spiritual if not
                        material union. Now she could live happily. Now die so. &quot;Oh,
                        Lester,&quot; she exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand. He
                        returned the pressure. There was a little silence. Then he spoke again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How are the two orphans?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, they&apos;re lovely,&quot; she answered, entering upon
                        a detailed description of their diminutive personalities. He listened
                        comfortably, for her voice was soothing to him. Her whole personality was
                        grateful to him. When it came time for her to go he seemed desirous of
                        keeping her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Going, Jennie?&quot;</p>
                    <p>I can stay just as well as not, Lester,&quot; she volunteered.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll take a room. I can send a note out to Mrs. Swenson.
                        It will be all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You needn&apos;t do that,&quot; he said, but she could see
                        that he wanted her, that he did not want to be alone.</p>
                    <p>From that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of the
                    hotel.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER LXII</head>
                    <p>THE end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside almost
                        constantly. The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a relief and
                        company, but the physician was inclined to object. Lester, however, was
                        stubborn. &quot;This is my death,&quot; he said, with a touch of
                        grim humor. &quot;If I&apos;m dying I ought to be allowed to die in
                        my own way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Watson smiled at the man&apos;s unfaltering courage. He had never seen
                        anything like it before.</p>
                    <p>There were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the newspaper.
                        Robert saw an item in the <hi rend="i">Inquirer,</hi> and decided to go to
                        Chicago. Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to
                        Lester&apos;s room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers.
                        Lester had little to say. The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be
                        talked to much. When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, &quot;Imogene
                        has changed a good deal.&quot; He made no other comment.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the afternoon
                        Lester died. He had been meditating whether anything more could be done for
                        Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it. Certainly it was useless
                        to leave her more money. She did not want it. He had been wondering where
                        Letty was and how near her actual arrival might be when he was seized with a
                        tremendous paroxysm of pain. Before relief could be administered in the
                        shape of an anesthetic he was dead. It developed afterward that it was not
                        the intestinal trouble which killed him, but a lesion of a major
                        blood-vessel in the brain.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2406-432" n="425"/>
                    <p>Jennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying, was beside
                        herself with grief. He had been a part of her thought and feeling so long
                        that it seemed now as though a part of herself had died. She had loved him
                        as she had fancied she could never love any one, and he had always shown
                        that he cared for herat least in some degree. She could not feel the emotion
                        that expresses itself in tearsonly a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to
                        make her insensible to pain. He looked so strongher Lesterlying there still
                        in death. His expression was unchangeddefiant, determined, albeit peaceful.
                        Word had come from Mrs. Kane that she would arrive on the Wednesday
                        following. It was decided to hold the body. Jennie learned from Mr. Watson
                        that it was to be transferred to Cincinnati, where the Paces had a vault.
                        Because of the arrival of various members of the family, Jennie withdrew to
                        her own home; she could do nothing more.</p>
                    <p>The final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the anomalies of
                        existence. It was arranged with Mrs. Kane by wire that the body should be
                        transferred to Imogene&apos;s residence, and the funeral held from
                        there. Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry Dodge,
                        Imogene&apos;s husband; Mr. Midgely, and three other citizens of
                        prominence were selected as pall-bearers. Louise and her husband came from
                        Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati. The house was full to
                        overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it expedient
                        to call. Because of the fact that Lester and his family were tentatively
                        Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual of that Church was
                        carried out. It was curious to see him lying in the parlor of this alien
                        residence, candles at his head and feet, burning sepulchrally, a silver
                        cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen fingers. He would have smiled
                        if he could have seen himself, but the Kane family was too conventional, too
                        set in its convictions, to find anything strange in this, <pb
                            id="VAA2406-433" n="426"/> The Church made no objection, of course. The
                        family was distinguished. What more could be desired?</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday Mrs. Kane arrived. She was greatly distraught, for her love,
                        like Jennie&apos;s, was sincere. She left her room that night when all
                        was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of the burning
                        candles Lester&apos;s beloved features. Tears trickled down her cheeks,
                        for she had been happy with him. She caressed his cold cheeks and hands.
                        &quot;Poor, dear Lester!&quot; she whispered. &quot;Poor, brave
                        soul!&quot; No one told her that he had sent for Jennie. The Kane family
                        did not know.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was enduring
                        alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss. Through all these years
                        the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every circumstance, that somehow
                        life might bring him back to her. He had come, it is truehe really had in
                        deathbut he had gone again. Where? Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt,
                        whither Vesta had gone? She could not hope to see him again, for the papers
                        had informed her of his removal to Mrs. Midgely&apos;s residence, and of
                        the fact that he was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial. The
                        last ceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman
                        Catholic churches of the South Side, St. Michael&apos;s, of which the
                        Midgelys were members.</p>
                    <p>Jennie felt deeply about this. She would have liked so much to have had him
                        buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave occasionally, but this
                        was not to be. She was never a master of her fate. Others invariably
                        controlled. She thought of him as being taken from her finally by the
                        removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though distance made any difference.
                        She decided at last to veil herself heavily and attend the funeral at the
                        church. The paper had explained that the services would be at two in the
                        afternoon. Then at four the body would be taken to the depot, and
                        transferred to the <pb id="VAA2406-434" n="427"/> train; the members of the
                        family would accompany it to Cincinnati. She thought of this as another
                        opportunity. She might go to the depot.</p>
                    <p>A little before the time for the funeral cortge to arrive at the church there
                        appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in black, heavily
                        veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner. She was a little nervous
                        at first, for, seeing that the church was dark and empty, she feared lest
                        she had mistaken the time and place; but after ten minutes of painful
                        suspense a bell in the church tower began to toll solemnly. Shortly
                        thereafter an acolyte in black gown and white surplice appeared and lighted
                        groups of candles on either side of the altar. A hushed stirring of feet in
                        the choir-loft indicated that the service was to be accompanied by music.
                        Some loiterers, attracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few
                        acquaintances and citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.</p>
                    <p>Jennie watched all this with wondering eyes. Never in her life had she been
                        inside a Catholic church. The gloom, the beauty of the windows, the
                        whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles impressed her. She
                        was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty, and mystery. Life in all
                        its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified by this scene.</p>
                    <p>As the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of altar-boys.
                        The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first, bearing aloft a
                        magnificent silver cross. In the hands of each subsequent pair of servitors
                        was held a tall, lighted candle. The priest, in black cloth and lace,
                        attended by an acolyte on either hand, followed. The procession passed out
                        the entrance into the vestibule of the church, and was not seen again until
                        the choir began a mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for
                        mercy and peace.</p>
                    <p>Then, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance. There came
                        the silver cross, the candles, <pb id="VAA2406-435" n="428"/> the dark-faced
                        priest, reading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester
                        in a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the pall-bearers,
                        who kept an even pace. Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her nerves responding
                        as though to a shock from an electric current. She did not know any of these
                        men. She did not know Robert. She had never seen Mr. Midgely. Of the long
                        company of notables who followed two by two she recognized only three, whom
                        Lester had pointed out to her in times past. Mrs. Kane she saw, of course,
                        for she was directly behind the coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger;
                        behind her walked Mr. Watson, solemn, gracious. He gave a quick glance to
                        either side, evidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her,
                        he turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on. Jennie looked with all her
                        eyes, her heart gripped by pain. She seemed so much a part of this solemn
                        ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.</p>
                    <p>The procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down. A white
                        shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was put over it,
                        and the great candles were set beside it. There were the chanted invocations
                        and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with holy water, the lighting
                        and swinging of the censer and then the mumbled responses of the auditors to
                        the Lord&apos;s Prayer and to its Catholic addition, the invocation to
                        the Blessed Virgin. Jennie was overawed and amazed, but no show of form
                        colorful, impression imperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense
                        of infinite loss. To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were
                        beautiful. They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made it
                        vibrate through the depths of her being. She was as a house filled with
                        mournful melody and the presence of death. She cried and cried. She could
                        see, curiously, that Mrs. Kane was sobbing convulsively also.</p>
                    <p>When it was all over the carriages were entered and the <pb id="VAA2406-436"
                            n="429"/> body was borne to the station. All the guests and strangers
                        departed, and finally, when all was silent, she arose. Now she would go to
                        the depot also, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train.
                        They would have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in
                        Vesta&apos;s case. She took a car, and a little later she entered the
                        waiting-room of the depot. She lingered about, first in the concourse, where
                        the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks, and then in
                        the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of proceedings. She finally
                        observed the group of immediate relatives waitingMrs. Kane, Robert, Mrs.
                        Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene, and the others. She actually succeeded in
                        identifying most of them, though it was not knowledge in this case, but pure
                        instinct and intuition.</p>
                    <p>No one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was Thanksgiving
                        Eve. Throughout the great railroad station there was a hum of anticipation,
                        that curious ebullition of fancy which springs from the thought of pleasures
                        to come. People were going away for the holiday. Carriages were at the
                        station entries. Announcers were calling in stentorian voices the
                        destination of each new train as the time of its departure drew near. Jennie
                        heard with a desperate ache the description of a route which she and Lester
                        had taken more than once, slowly and melodiously emphasized.
                        &quot;Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland, Buffalo, and New York.&quot; There
                        were cries of trains for &quot;Fort Wayne, Columbus, Pittsburg,
                        Philadelphia, and points East,&quot; and then finally for
                        &quot;Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
                        South.&quot; The hour had struck.</p>
                    <p>Several times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the waiting-room and
                        the tracks to see if through the iron grating which separated her from her
                        beloved she could get one last look at the coffin, or the great wooden box
                        which held it, before it was put on the train. Now she saw it coming. There
                        was a baggage porter <pb id="VAA2406-437" n="430"/> pushing a truck into
                        position near the place where the baggage car would stop. On it was Lester,
                        that last shadow of his substance, incased in the honors of wood, and cloth,
                        and silver. There was no thought on the part of the porter of the agony of
                        loss which was represented here. He could not see how wealth and position in
                        this hour were typified to her mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided
                        her eternally from her beloved. Had it not always been so? Was not her life
                        a patchwork of conditions made and affected by these things which she
                        sawwealth and forcewhich had found her unfit? She had evidently been born to
                        yield, not seek. This panoply of power had been paraded before her since
                        childhood. What could she do now but stare vaguely after it as it marched
                        triumphantly by? Lester had been of it. Him it respected. Of her it knew
                        nothing. She looked through the grating, and once more there came the cry of
                        &quot;Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
                        South.&quot; A long red train, brilliantly lighted, composed of baggage
                        cars, day coaches, a diningcar, set with white linen and silver, and a half
                        dozen comfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped. A great black engine,
                        puffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.</p>
                    <p>As the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in blue, looking
                        out of the car, called to some one within.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hey, Jack! Give us a hand here. There&apos;s a stiff
                        outside!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie could not hear.</p>
                    <p>All she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear. All she
                        could feel was that this train would start presently, and then it would all
                        be over. The gates opened, the passengers poured out. There were Robert, and
                        Amy, and Louise, and Midgelyall making for the Pullman cars in the rear.
                        They had said their farewells to their friends. No need to repeat them. A
                        trio of assistants &quot;gave a hand&quot; at getting the great <pb
                            id="VAA2406-438" n="[431]"/> wooden case into the car. Jennie saw it
                        disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.</p>
                    <p>There were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the baggage car
                        half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine sounded. There
                        was the insistent calling of &quot;all aboard&quot; from this
                        quarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move. Its bell
                        was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a great black
                        plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall. The fireman,
                        conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming furnace door to
                        throw in coal. Its light glowed like a golden eye.</p>
                    <p>Jennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her face white,
                        her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one thought in her
                        mindthey were taking his body away. A leaden November sky was ahead, almost
                        dark. She looked, and looked until the last glimmer of the red lamp on the
                        receding sleeper disappeared in the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the
                        tracks of the far-stretching yard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the
                        anticipation of coming pleasures. &quot;We&apos;re going to have a
                        great time down there. Remember Annie? Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt
                        Ella.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle around
                        her. Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down which she was
                        steadily gazing. Now what? She was not so old yet. There were those two
                        orphan children to raise. They would marry and leave after a while, and then
                        what? Days and days in endless reiteration, and then?</p>

                        reached the full measure of its being. Shall you say to the blown rose,
                        &quot;well done&quot;? Or to the battered, wind-riven,

                        to run as a troubled current; not to be able to fall upon a fellow-being,
                        tearing that which is momentarily desirable from his grasp, only to drop it
                        and run wildly toward that which for another brief moment seems more worthy

                        Behold! there are hierarchies and powers above and below the measure of our
                        perception. It is given to us to see in part and to believe in part. But of
                        that which is perfect who shall prophesy? Only this daughter of the poor
                        felt somethingthe beauty of the trees, the wonder of the rains, the color of
                        existence. Marveling at these, feeling their call of community in spirit,

                        and the necessities onlywere not these the hours of truest insight? Jennie
                        loved, and loving, gave. Is there a superior wisdom? Are its signs and
