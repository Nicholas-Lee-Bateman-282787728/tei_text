            <l rend="ti-1">And the apples plump and mellow,</l>
            <l>And the purple grapes are bursting with their rich autumnal wine,</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">All the blaze of sunset shaming-- </l>

          <lg>
            <l rend="ti-1">It goes through the grassy hollows </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And across the hills; it follows </l>
            <l>All the playful turns and curvings of the ever-singing streams;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Overgrown with tangled grasses,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">All the olden haunts it passes</l>

            <l>Over field and through the forest it goes ever on and on, </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">With the thrush and killdee singing; </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And the redbird madly winging</l>
            <l>Far ahead of us to somewhere, where the sunset meets the dawn.</l>

            <l>Hears the echo of the hailings and the murmur of a song</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> That comes through the silence throbbing--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Half with laughter, half with sobbing--</l>
            <l> Till it clutches at the heart-strings and would hold them overlong.</l>

            <l rend="ti-1">How it spans the miles to joyland!</l>
            <l>Passing leafy lane and blossom-tangled vine, and bush and tree,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Coaxing bees till they, in coming,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> Fill the hush of noon with humming-- </l>

          <lg>
            <l>The boy-days--the boy-days--they were the best of all!</l>
            <l>Through all the hushes of the years the boy-days ever call;</l>
            <l>Out of the darkness of the night resplendently they shine,</l>
            <l>And what a wreath of memories for one and all they twine!</l>
            <l>No matter what of baser stuff the later years may hold,</l>
            <l>We may look up and back and see the boy-days all were gold.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The boy-days--the boy-days--when come the threads of gray,</l>
            <l>You may live in To-morrow, but you dream of Yesterday;</l>
            <l>You may look in the mirror, but the only face you see</l>
            <l> Is one that has the semblance of the boy you used to be;</l>
            <l>And, musing, you may stumble on a broken bit of song</l>
            <l> That wanders from the boy-days in a cadence sweet and strong.</l>

          <pb id="VAA9486-022" n="6"/>
          <lg>
            <l>The boy-days--a picture with not a hue to fade;</l>
            <l>The glamour of the grasses where the summer sunshine played;</l>
            <l>The sparkle of the ripple in some jolly little stream</l>
            <l>Whose song was built of jewels of a never-dying gleam;</l>
            <l>The nodding of the roses; and the whiteness of the snow--</l>
            <l> They blend across the picture of the long and long ago. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The boy-days--the boy-days--we never lose them all;</l>
            <l>The best of all the memories, they come at fancy's call.</l>
            <l>Somehow they are made perfect by the alchemy of years,</l>
            <l>Which keeps alive the smiles they held and never finds the tears.</l>
            <l> The heart is but a treasure chest our precious things to hold,</l>
            <l>And chiefest of the goodly store is all the boy-days' gold.</l>

            <l>The bes' time in the year for boys is when it's hickory nuttin'--</l>
            <l>There's been a frost an' all the hulls is openin' an' shut-in'</l>
            <l>An' winkin' at the squirrels that just jumps round an' chatters</l>
            <l> An' scoots about a mile away when "plop!" a big nut clatters.</l>
            <l> Us boys is glad on Saturdays--we're off of all our studies.</l>
            <l>I wouldn't trade my fun that day for yours or anybody's!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>You get a good two-bushel sack an' sling it on your shoulder</l>
            <l> An' wear your mittens an' your scarf--ma says it will get colder--</l>
            <l>An' then you strike out on the pike until you cross the river--</l>
            <l>We use to go in swimmin' there. Ooh! Makes a fellow shiver!</l>
            <l> From there you cut acrost the fields; it doesn't take a minute </l>
            <l>Until you see a shaggy tree, an' then--why, then you're in it!</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="VAA9486-026" n="10"/>
          <lg>
            <l>The shaggy tree's the shellbark kind; there ain't a nut that beats it,</l>
            <l> I don't care where you get it at, nor when a fellow eats it.</l>
            <l>But butternuts is purty good; it ain't so hard to shake 'em,</l>
            <l> An' then there's hazel-nuts around an' us boys always take 'em. </l>
            <l>So purty soon you get your sack filled plumb up to the middle,</l>
            <l> An' when you shake it there's a tune that's better than a fiddle.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>You don't go home the way you come; you cut acrost by Tucker's, </l>
            <l>An' strike a ripe pe'simmon tree, an' fill your lips with puckers; </l>
            <l>An' mebbe there's some dried-up grapes--the wild kind --still a-clingin' </l>
            <l> But then you haf to climb a fence; that sack sets you a-reelin', </l>
            <l>It bumps you in the back, an' where you have a hungry feelin'.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>So, you start home acrost the farms, the weeds an' stubble crackin'-- </l>
            <l>You playin' you're a Injun an' that it's a bear you're trackin';</l>

            <pb id="VAA9486-027" n="11"/>
            <l>Afore you know how late it is the edge o' town you've sighted,</l>

            <l>You never feel that heavy sack when you walk home, a-struttin'-- </l>

          <lg>
            <l> I'm mighty glad when sorghum time is gittin' round again</l>
            <l> 'Cause Uncle Silas allus sends a big jug of it nen</l>

            <l>'Cause 'at's th' cooles' spot they is in our house anywheres.</l>
            <l>An' nen she gits a pitcher full for all us folks to use,</l>
            <l>An' when we're eatin' breakfas', pa he makes us curly-cues.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>My pa can take th' pitcher up an' let th' sorghum run </l>
            <l>Out of it in a teeny stream--an' I tell you it's fun</l>
            <l> When he jest makes it whirl around mos' ever' which-away </l>
            <l>An' w'ites my name wite on my plate--he makes th' big- ges' J </l>
            <l>An' nen he whops th' sorghum 'round fer O, an' H, an' N-- </l>
            <l>An' nen I'm purty tickled 'cause it's sorghum time again.</l>
          </lg>

            <l>Ma ain't th' same as pa--she sez molasses ain't as good</l>

            <l> Fer wimmen-folks to w'ite 'ithout no handle fer to chew.</l>
            <l> Nen ma she says she pities men 'at never sees no jokes </l>
            <l>I'thout it's somepin' 'at's made up about th' wimmen-folks.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l> O' course they're only funnin'. Nen my ma sometimes she takes</l>
            <l>Th' pitcher in her hand an' makes me elephunts an' snakes </l>
            <l>An' turkles, too--an' nen I wait until they run and spread</l>
            <l>An' nen I tell 'em all good-by an' dip in 'ith my bread.</l>
            <l>I like it bes' when pa whops out that J, O, H an' N, </l>
            <l>But I'm as glad as anything it's sorghum time again.</l>

            <p> As one whom his mother comforteth.</p>
            <bibl>--Isaiah.</bibl>
          </epigraph>



          <lg>
            <l>You take the finest woman, with th' roses in her cheeks,</l>
            <l>An' all th' birds a-singin' in her voice each time she speaks;</l>
            <l>Her hair all black an' gleamin', or a glowin' mass o gold-- </l>
            <l>An' still th' tale o' beauty isn't more th'n half-way told.</l>
            <l> There ain't a word that tells it; all description it defies--</l>
            <l> Th' mother-look that lingers in a happy woman's eyes. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A woman's eyes will sparkle in her innocence an' fun,</l>
            <l>Or snap a warnin' message to th' ones she wants to shun.</l>
            <l>In pleasure or in anger there is always han'someness,</l>
            <l>But still there is a beauty that was surely made to bless-- </l>
            <l>A beauty that grows sweeter an' that all but glorifies--</l>
            <l>Th' mother-look that sometimes comes into a woman's eyes.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It ain't a smile, exactly--yet it's brimmin' full o' joy,</l>
            <l>An' meltin' into sunshine when she bends above her boy,</l>
            <pb id="VAA9486-066" n="48"/>
            <l> Or girl, when it's a-sleepin', with its dreams told in its face;</l>
            <l>She smooths its hair, an' pets it as she lif's it to its place.</l>
            <l>It leads all th' expressions, whether grave, or gay, or wise--</l>
            <l>Th' mother-look that glimmers in a lovin' woman's eyes. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>There ain't a picture of it! If there was, they'd have to paint</l>
            <l>A picture of a woman mostly angel an' some saint,</l>
            <l> An' make it still be human--an' they'd have to blend the whole. </l>
            <l>There ain't a picture of it, for no one can paint a soul! </l>
            <l>No one can paint th' glory comin' straight from paradise--</l>

          <lg>
            <l>I tell her it is foolish--but each Thanksgiving Day</l>
            <l>She's bound to have the table set in the old-time way,</l>
            <l> The little cup and saucer that Henry always had-- </l>
            <l> That handle has been broken since he was just a tad--</l>
            <l> The plate we got for Mollie--the brim is A, B, C's--</l>
            <l> I tell ma it is foolish, but her eyes, they look "Please!"</l>
            <l>And then somehow or other I've got no more to say</l>
            <l> When she gets out the dishes for our Thanksgiving Day.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l> She gets the little high chair--I've vowed 'most every year</l>
            <l> I'd sell it to somebody, but still it's always here--</l>
            <l>The baby used to use it; the baby--that was Rose-- </l>
            <l>It's always for her children our fattest turkey goes.</l>
            <l>We send one to the others; it isn't much to give,</l>
            <l>But it's a home touch for them away off where they live.</l>
            <l>But I tell ma it's foolish, with us both old and gray,</l>
            <l>To set the children's places on each Thanksgiving Day.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I ask a blessing always; there's lots I'd like to ask, </l>
            <l>But with those empty places the blessing is a task. </l>
            <l>I tell ma not to do it--I'm thinking all the while</l>
            <l>How Henry used to argue that handle was in style;</l>
            <pb id="VAA9486-068" n="50"/>
            <l> And ma says she remembers the way that it was broke.</l>
            <l> Both of us laugh about it, but I 'most always choke.</l>
            <l>I tell her that it's foolish to set the things that way--</l>
            <l>And think we've got the children back home Thanksgiving Day.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>We never eat that dinner. We don't get half-way through </l>
            <l>Till ma is in some story of how they used to do; </l>
            <l> Of how they used to chatter, and beg for this and that--</l>
            <l>And all the time a-looking at each place where they sat.</l>
            <l>And then--and then--she's trying to hide a sudden tear</l>
            <l> And saying she is thankful that one time they was here. </l>
            <l> But still I say it's foolish to have things fixed this way--</l>
            <l>To set the children's places on each Thanksgiving Day.</l>

            <l>Oh, when the old home band turns out, and plays its ripplin' airs,</l>
            <l> I'd rather listen to the tunes than be 'most anywheres; </l>

            <l> When they bring out some ringin' march that's full o' fire and vim,</l>
            <l> Where the bass drum keeps a-throbbin' in a cadence gruff an' grim,</l>
            <l>An' the trombone 's just a-roarin' till the tuba's drownded out,</l>
            <l>I dream that I'm a soldier, an' I hear the battle shout!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Dreamin' while the band plays! If they try a serenade,</l>
            <l> Or a liltin' sort o' love song, where the music seems afraid</l>
            <l> To come right out an' sing its piece, but sort o' hangs its head</l>
            <l> An' whispers low an' mellow till you can't tell what it said;</l>
            <pb id="VAA9486-078" n="60"/>
            <l> When the cornet player twists his horn an' puts the tremolo</l>
            <l> On every note he draws out long, an' makes it sob--you know,</l>
            <l>I get to dreamin' of a girl an' holdin' of her hand, </l>
            <l>An' kind of actin' foolish--but I blame it on the band!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l> Dreamin' while the band plays! When the program's nearly done,</l>
            <l>An' the leader holds his pointer up an' says, "Play number one," </l>
            <l>Then they play a piece that's purtier than any song or pome,</l>
            <l> For they're tuggin' at your heart-strings when they bring out <hi rend="i">Home,
                Sweet Home</hi>. </l>
            <l>An' the bass drum sort o' rumbles, an' the tenor drum replies</l>
            <l> With a tender little tappin' like the rain-drops from the skies,</l>
            <l>An' all the other players puts a tear in every note--</l>

            <l>He used to take his fiddle with a loving sort of touch,</l>

            <l>He pressed it to his shoulder and it nestled at his chin;</l>
            <l>He stroked the strings with tenderness before he would begin.</l>

            <l> Until it held the gladness of a dreamy afternoon--</l>
            <l>The vagrant chirpings of the birds, and bees' idyllic croon; </l>

            <l>His was the mystic mastery of touch and time and tone</l>

            <l>And Oh, the swooping swing of his; and how the music swam</l>
            <l>When he would play "The Old Gray Hoss that Died in Alabam'!"</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Grasshoppers roam the Kansas fields and eat the tender grass--</l>
            <l> A trivial affair, indeed, but what then comes to pass?</l>
            <l>You go to buy a panama, or any other hat;</l>
            <l>You learn the price has been advanced a lot because of that.</l>
            <l>A glacier up in Canada has slipped a mile or two--</l>
            <l>A little thing like this can boost the selling price of glue. </l>
            <l>Occurrences so tragic always thrill me to the core; </l>
            <l>I hope and pray that nothing ever happens any more.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Last week the peaceful Indians went a-searching after scalps, </l>
            <l>And then there was an avalanche 'way over in the Alps;</l>
            <l>These diametric happenings seem nothing much, but look--</l>
            <l>We had to add a dollar to the wages of the cook.</l>
            <l>The bean-crop down at Boston has grown measurably less,</l>
            <l> And so the dealer charges more for goods to make a dress.</l>
            <l>Each day there is some incident to make a man feel sore,</l>
            <l>I'm on my knees to ask that nothing happens any more. </l>

            <l>It didn't rain in Utah and it did in old Vermont--</l>
            <l> Result: it costs you fifty more to take a summer's jaunt;</l>
            <l> Upon the plains of Tibet some tornadoes took a roll-- </l>
            <l>Therefore the barons have to charge a higher price for coal.</l>
            <l> A street-car strike in Omaha has cumulative shocks--</l>
            <l>It boosted huckleberries up to twenty cents a box.</l>
            <l>No matter what is happening it always finds your door--</l>
            <l> Give us a rest! Let nothing ever happen any more.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Mosquitoes in New Jersey bite a magnate on the wing--</l>
            <l> Result: the poor consumer feels that fierce mosquito's sting:</l>
            <l>The 'skeeter's song is silenced, but in something like an hour</l>
            <l>The grocers understand that it requires a raise in flour.</l>
            <l> A house burns down in Texas and a stove blows up in Maine,</l>
            <l> Ten minutes later breakfast foods in prices show a gain.</l>
            <l> Effects must follow causes--which is what I most deplore;</l>
            <l>I hope and pray that nothing ever happens any more.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>I've traveled up and down this land</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> And crossed it in a hundred ways,</l>
            <l> But somehow can not understand </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">These towns with names chock-full of K's.</l>
            <l> For instance, once it fell to me</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> To pack my grip and quickly go--</l>
            <l> I thought at first to Kankakee </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">But then remembered Kokomo.</l>
            <l>"Oh, Kankakee or Kokomo," </l>
            <l>I sighed, "just which I do not know." </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Then to the ticket man I went--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> He was a snappy man, and bald,</l>
            <l> Behind an iron railing pent--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> And I confessed that I was stalled.</l>
            <l> "A much K'd town is booked for me,"</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">I said. "I'm due to-morrow, so </l>
            <l>I wonder if it's Kankakee</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Or if it can be Kokomo." </l>
            <l>"There's quite a difference," growled he,</l>
            <l>"'Twixt Kokomo and Kankakee."</l>

          <pb id="VAA9486-097" n="77"/>
          <lg>
            <l>He spun a yard of tickets out--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The folded kind that makes a strip</l>
            <l> And leaves the passenger in doubt</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> When the conductor takes a clip.</l>
            <l> He flipped the tickets out, I say,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And asked: "Now, which one shall it be?</l>
            <l>I'll sell you tickets either way-- </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To Kokomo or Kankakee."</l>
            <l> And still I really did not know--</l>
            <l>I thought it might be Kokomo.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>At any rate, I took a chance;</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">He struck his stamp-machine a blow</l>
            <l> And I, a toy of circumstance, </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Was ticketed for Kokomo. </l>
            <l>Upon the train I wondered still</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">If all was right as it should be.</l>
            <l>Some mystic warning seemed to fill</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> My mind with thoughts of Kankakee. </l>
            <l>The car-wheels clicked it out: "Now, he </l>
            <l>Had better be for Kankakee!"</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Until at last it grew so loud,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">At some big town I clambered out</l>
            <l> And elbowed madly through the crowd,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> Determined on the other route.</l>
            <pb id="VAA9486-098" n="78"/>
            <l> The ticket-agent saw my haste; </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">"Where do you wish to go?" cried he.</l>
            <l>I yelled: "I have no time to waste--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> Please fix me up for Kankakee!"</l>
            <l>Again the wheels, now fast, now slow,</l>
            <l> Clicked: "Ought to go to Kokomo!"</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Well, anyhow, I did not heed</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The message that they sent to me.</l>
            <l> I went, and landed wrong indeed--</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Went all the way to Kankakee.</l>
            <l>Then, in a rush, I doubled back-- </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Went wrong again, I'd have you know.</l>
            <l> There was no call for me, alack!</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Within the town of Kokomo.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And then I learned, confound the luck,</l>

            <l>Deep in the slums, one hot, hot day</l>
            <l> A little girl was at her play--</l>
            <l> A little girl with tousled hair</l>
            <l> And grimy hands, and feet all bare. </l>
            <l>There, in the baking, barren street, </l>

            <l>To one who, halting where she sat,</l>
            <l> Heard: "I know where a rose is at!"</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>She pointed down an alley dim </l>
            <l>Where slattern women, coarse and grim,</l>
            <l>Were bandying strange laugh and call-- </l>
            <l>And there, close to the blackened wall,</l>
            <l> A brave, brave rose was clambering. </l>
            <l>What wonder that the tot could sing--</l>
            <l>That she in accents shrill and flat</l>

          <lg>

            <l>Men are not led with a halter, like to a reasonless beast;</l>

            <l> Men walk, with faces illumined, the paths that their fathers have trod.</l>
            <l>Then, in the shrill of the bullet; then, in the war-trumpet's song,</l>

          <head rend="center"> THE OLD BUGLE</head>
          <lg>
            <l>There on the wall it hangs, with dented curves and battered mouth,</l>
            <l>As though it fought the song of war it shrilled across the South, </l>
            <l>As though the blasts of wrath it blew had clutched it in a grasp</l>
            <l>That left the lasting finger-prints ere it released the clasp. </l>
            <l>There, on the wall, it hangs to-day--a token of Time's lapse--</l>
            <l>For now it knows no other song than that sweet one of "Taps." </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The bent and battered bugle that has sent its thrilling call</l>
            <l> Until a thousand men have hurled themselves against a wall--</l>
            <l> Against a wall of bayonets--of bayonets and flame-- </l>
            <l>And leaped into the charge as if the bugle called each name!</l>
            <l> There, on the wall, it hangs to-day between the soldier caps,</l>
            <l>And in its rusting throat there is no other song than "Taps."</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="VAA9486-130" n="108"/>
          <lg>
            <l>Once, sharp and shrill, it burnt and blared from mouth-piece out to bell</l>
            <l> With strident sound and stinging strains, the startling song of hell!</l>
            <l>Oft, ringing rampantly, it sang in tone and voice elate</l>
            <l>In clearest, keenest melody, the rhapsody of hate.</l>
            <l>Yet now it hangs there peacefully, and sings but when the gaps </l>
            <l>In thinning ranks call for the sad and sweet old song of "Taps." </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And when they take the bugle down to play above the mound,</l>
            <l> No soldier heart but quicker beats when comes the well-known sound;</l>
            <l>No soldier mind but travels once again the distant ways</l>
            <l>That loom anew in memory, though dimming in the haze.</l>
            <l> There, on the wall, it hangs to-day--a token of Time's lapse--</l>
            <l>And now it knows no other song than that sweet one of "Taps."</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Just a soldier lying dead, with a medal on his breast;</l>
            <l> Just a boy who kept his courage to the ending of his quest.</l>
            <l> And the bugle-song is mellow with the melody of sleep</l>
            <l>While the muffled drum is thrumming in a measure slow and deep,-- </l>
            <l>For it's honor for the soldier, and it's laurels for his head,</l>
            <l> And it's praises for his daring--when the soldier's lying dead.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Just a soldier lying dead--and the carpings have an end; </l>
            <l>When he fell upon the altar every critic was his friend.</l>
            <l>With the folded flag about him, and the medal gleaming there, </l>
            <l>Then the praise is quick in coming, and the soldier has his share-- </l>
            <l>For it's honor for the soldier when he dies beside his gun,</l>
            <l> And it's medals for his coffin--when the soldier's work is done.</l>

            <l>Just a soldier lying dead--with his trappings at his side;</l>
            <l>And we come to look upon him, slow of step and heavy-eyed;</l>
            <l>Come to clasp the badge of honor on his faded service coat;</l>
            <l>Come to hear the bugle sighing in its saddest, softest note;</l>
            <l>And it's honor for the soldier, with a medal brightly new, </l>
            <l>And it's eulogy and plaudit, when he's done what he can do.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Just a soldier lying dead--honor rushes to him then; </l>
            <l>Come the men with brush and chisel; come the pencil and the pen.</l>
            <l>Yet the comrades of the soldier hold the country in their debt--</l>
            <l>While they live, the praise and medal are so easy to forget.</l>
            <l>Where the flag of glory ripples in the whisper of the breeze,</l>
            <l>Where the clamoring of battle sends an echo o'er the seas,</l>
            <l> We may find the living reasons for a country's hope and pride</l>
            <l>Just as we have found the medal for the soldier who has died. </l>

          <lg>
            <l> "Bring the good old bugle, boys, we'll sing another song!"</l>
            <l>He heard the far-off chorus as his comrades marched along;</l>
            <l>He heard the clank of saber, and the jangling bit and spur,</l>
            <l> The rumbling of the cannon where his shouting messmates were;</l>
            <l> He heard the hurried hoofbeats of the horses mettlesome; </l>
            <l>And high above he saw the flag that beckoned him: "Oh, come!"</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>He saw them swing along the road--not graybeards slow and bent.</l>
            <l>Ah, no! He saw the boyish ranks of his old regiment.</l>
            <l> With rhythmic tread it held its line, with fifers piping shrill;</l>
            <l> He saw the ragged colors, that were waving to him still; </l>
            <l>And calling--calling--calling, came the rolling of the drum: </l>
            <l>"Fall in! Fall in for dress parade! The ranks are waiting. Come!" </l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="VAA9486-134" n="112"/>
          <lg>
            <l>The line wheeled when it neared him, and as in the light of noon </l>
            <l>He saw the forms of comrades who across the South were strewn;</l>
            <l> He saw the brave companion who had battled by his side--</l>
            <l>The tears welled up again just as they did the day he died.</l>
            <l>Then, "Halt!" the bugles sounded, and he heard his war-time chief</l>
            <l>Call in his kindest, clearest tones: "This is the last relief!"</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>"March on!" The flag was waving and the soldiers marched away; </l>
            <l>And he went singing with them, far beyond the Gates of Day,</l>
            <l>The bugles pealing gladly and the line with no more gaps--</l>
            <l> The bugles singing sweetly in that benison of "Taps".</l>
            <l> And fifes were mad and merry, and the drums were laughing too,</l>
            <l> For he marched beside the colors as he led the grand review!</l>

            <l> And times there are when comes a gale that cuts us like a knife--</l>
            <l>When comes a blast that shudders past and shrivels up our souls-- </l>
            <l>It blows from off the barren rocks where sorrow spreads her shoals,</l>
            <l>Where bitterly the billows break and chatter of defeat;</l>

            <l>Some of us ride upon the tide that in the moonlight gleams</l>
            <l>And sighs of peace and happiness within the port of dreams;</l>

            <l>It may be in the port of dreams, or off of sorrow's shoals,</l>
            <l>Or when in mid-sea's placidness the vessel calmly rolls;</l>
            <l>Wherever, on or off our course, we will but pause to hear,</l>

          <lg>
            <l>So you go down and I go down into the sea of life,</l>
            <l>To feel the bite of angry winds along the reefs of strife, </l>

            <p>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.</p>

          </epigraph>
          <lg>
            <l>"I to the hills will lift mine eyes"--I've heard 'em sing the psalm,</l>
            <l>An' thought of how, close to the skies, the hills rose grand an' calm;</l>
            <l> How peacefully they raised their heads an' stood serene an' still,</l>
            <l> A-blazin' with their greens an' reds--each hope-inspirin' hill.</l>
            <l>I like the sober hush they've got--it's just as if they meant </l>
            <l>To send to me this gentle thought: "Oh, poor man, be content!"</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The hills! God made 'em every one, an' freshens 'em with dew, </l>
            <l>An' makes 'em golden with the sun to gladden me an' you.</l>
            <l> Down here there's bitterness an' strife; an' lots o' things seem vain;</l>
            <l>An' we make our complaints at life here on the noisy plain.</l>
            <pb id="VAA9486-146" n="124"/>
            <l> But there, the hills lift up their heads, an' we can look an' see </l>
            <l>Where brooks play in their gleamin' beds an' sparkle in their glee.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I've watched the hills when just at dawn the sun swept up the slope,</l>
            <l>An' knew my night of doubt had gone an' left a day of hope.</l>
            <l> I've watched the hills at evenin' time, all silvered by the moon,</l>
            <l> When from their sides in tones sublime the breezes brought a croon,</l>
            <l>An' all the world grew good to me--an' all the world was still. </l>
            <l>Oh, them's the times a man can see the glory of a hill!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I reckon David must 'a' been a man like me or you,</l>
            <l>That had his own sore fights to win, just as all humans do;</l>
            <l>An' he looked to them hills of his that breathed of quiet peace--</l>
            <l>Just like our hills, where comfort is, an' all our troubles cease.</l>
            <l> "I to the hills will lift mine eyes"--I've heard 'em sing the psalm; </l>
            <l>An' in each mellow note there lies a blessin' pure an' calm.</l>

            <l>Now there are new religions. Many the codes and creeds;</l>

            <l> All of them waxing milder, waning in strength and tone;</l>
            <l>None of them stern and sturdy; none of them stands alone--</l>
            <l>None like the old religions, those that the fathers made-- </l>
            <l>Built on the fearless basis--the God of the Unafraid.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Mind you the old-time people? Questioning naught and stern;</l>
            <l>Knowing the lifelong lesson ere they were set to learn;</l>
            <l>Seeing the line was rigid, marking for ill or good--</l>
            <l> Holding to step beyond it led where the sinners stood.</l>
            <l>Mind you the old-time people? They who the law obeyed,</l>
            <l>Fearing and finding and praying the God of the Unafraid.</l>
          </lg>

            <l>Life was a constant battle into which they were flung; </l>

            <l>Aye, if a hand offended, straightway it must be cut,</l>

            <l> Now there are new religions, fragile and flimsy things; </l>

            <l>The untraced murmurs of the night </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That dreamily sigh from the west-- </l>
            <l>All sounds He gave to give delight, </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And one was sweeter than the rest.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>That those who stood about and heard</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The throbbing of the thrilling drum,</l>
            <l>And joyous caroling of bird </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And honey-bee's contented hum,</l>
            <l> Were curious and marveling, </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And wondered if there could be found</l>
            <l> A beast, or bird, or anything </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That should receive the sweetest sound;</l>
          </lg>

            <l rend="ti-1"> Said: "Lo, this fairest sound shall go,</l>
            <l> Not to the thrilling trumpet call,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1"> Nor to the love-song soft and low,</l>
            <l>Nor to the ever-singing sea,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">But it shall be"--the Maker smiled--</l>
            <l> "The richest of all melody </l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Shall be the laughter of a child!"</l>
          </lg>
          <lg rend="i">

            <l> It is a legend--pagan, too-- </l>
            <l> That out of pagan dreamings grew-- </l>
            <l> Yet, haply, it might well be true. </l>

            <p>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims,
              and a. flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

            <l>We have eaten the fruit, as decreed we should; </l>
            <l>And we know of evil and know of good.</l>
            <l> We have walked our ways with our heads erect</l>
            <l>And we take the paths that the fates select;</l>
            <l>But many the times that we call to mind </l>
            <l> The wondrous Eden we left behind.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>We remember now how we left the gate,</l>
            <l>And the road seemed pleasant and broad and straight; </l>
            <l>But the hills were many and helps were few,</l>
            <l>And oh, how tardy our footsteps grew! </l>
            <l>And we fain would turn to our Eden, then--</l>
            <l> Would fain go back to the joys again.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>We must earn our bread in our sweat, and eat </l>
            <l>While forging on with unwilling feet;</l>
            <l> And the road is rough and the way is steep,</l>
            <l>And our dreams so fair that we fear to sleep--</l>
            <l>For we dream and dream how the flowers tossed</l>
            <l>In the Eden scorned; in the Eden lost.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Sometimes--sometimes, on a lone, high hill, </l>
            <l>When they give us rest, and the air is still,</l>
            <l> We gaze far back down the dwindling road-- </l>
            <l>Far back where the scented roses glowed-- </l>
            <l>Then a flaming sword we can see, in truth,</l>
            <l> And it bars the Eden we knew--our youth! </l>
