            <p rend="center">Dedicated to my sister Miss Margaret A. Wilson</p>
            <p>Information and incidents of thrilling interest may be found in the lives of many
                    of our leading pioneers in southern Indiana. They erected our state, wrote our
                    constitutions and started Indiana on a long and honorable career. The wisdom of
                    some was sought in the councils of the nation, to its own credit and benefit;
                    the voices of others were heard in congress, at public debates, and in our high
                    courts with consideration, pleasure, and public benefit; the bravery of many was
                    shown in our early wars and in the local but nationally historic battlefield of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>
                    </placeName>, while the executive ability and war record of General Harrison
                    called him to the White House.</p>
            <p>One of the bright stars in a constellation we might call the "Southern
                    Cross" of Indiana is George H. Proffit, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName>. My own county of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois</region>
                    </placeName> is interested in Mr. Proffit because he represented the county in
                    the legislature during the years 1831,1832,1836,1837, and 1838 (five terms); and
                    in congress, from 1839 to 1843, (two terms), twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh
                    congresses; and because he was one of our pioneer merchants, even though his
                    store at Porters-ville, our first county-town, may have been only a branch store
                    of that at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Petersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In this way we became, in a sense, personally interested in this
                    brilliant pioneer orator, political meteor, and youthful statesman; this French
                    lily of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, transplanted to Hoosier soil, led an eventful career for about <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-018-1-004"/> twenty years, living entirely, while in
                    Indiana, under the state's first constitution.</p>
            <p>The production of a biographical sketch places a responsibility upon a writer
                    that is almost personal. For that reason we called into our services the
                    intimate knowledge of Mr. W. D. Crow, editor of the Petersburg <hi rend="i">Press;</hi> Mr. Simon Morgan, grandson, and Mr. Geo. C. Morgan,
                    great-grandson of Mr. Proffit; Mrs. Mary J. Taylor, and others to whom history
                    and tradition had been handed down. It has been said that so many distinguished
                    men have risen from apparently adverse circumstances on farms, or on the
                    frontier in America, that it has become a common lot of biography to magnify the
                    difficulties of such an origin and praise the man who has overcome such
                    impediments. We can hardly say this of our subject, for he was born September 7,
                    1807, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and, died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, September 7, 1847, at the age of forty, but we can give him credit
                    for making use of his opportunities and abilities, which is indeed worth while.
                    It was Mr. Proffit's good fortune to be in touch with the best thought
                    and temper of the state in his day. In this connection it is well to remember
                    that eighty years ago the south and west were closely related from a political
                    standpoint. In point of time, trade and travel, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> was our metropolis.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> people pride themselves on their learning and general literary
                    qualities, and justly so; yet we must remember that from south of the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>–the cavalier half of America; the
                    Jamestown section, if you please–came many flowery orators,
                    statesment and writers, even from as far south as the Gulf of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>. Patrick Henry, the orator of liberty days; <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName>, writer of the Declaration of Independence, our title deed to
                    liberty; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, the father of his country; <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marshall</region>
                    </placeName>, the construer and great conservator of the constitution, were
                    Virginians, and therefore southern people. It is largely due to Virginians that
                    the earlier public discussions and the later public papers so often partook of
                    the quality of literature. Our own subject was a capable artist when it came to
                    delivering an oratorical address in poetic prose.</p>
            <p>We do not wish to record mere platitudes of excellence, without giving a reason,
                    or the circumstances under which, or <pb n="3" id="VAA4025-018-1-005"/> through
                    which, Mr. Proffit's dominant qualities were brought out; therefore a
                    short review of pioneer days is carried through this biography. From the close
                    of the American Revolution until the close of the Civil war public speakers in
                    America were rather extravagant in their statements. Their orations were
                    frequently of the bombastic order, which in our vernacular is appropriately
                    named "tall talk." Even the most prominent and world renowned
                    orators used the grandiloquent style of oratory, in courts as well as before the
                    public. This tendency to extravagant oratory may be seen in the early orations
                    of such men as Patrick Henry; the scholarly Webster; the famous Virginian, known
                    as Henry Clay of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>;
                            <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
               </placeName>'s
                    Senator Benton; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="scu">South Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>'s famous Senator Hayne, the great southern leader; John C.
                    Calhoun; and many others of Mr. Promt's day. Such oratory usually
                    follows successful revolutions, and frequently leads up to other revolutions. It
                    is a matter of fact that the Indiana pioneers loved a spread-eagle speech.
                    Eloquence of that kind reached a degree of extravagance, bombast, and turgidity,
                    never before known, except perhaps, in the ritualistic formalities of the feudal
                    ages. It was what the voter wanted and he got it, as he usually does, even unto
                    this day. Such a flow and style of language may have had much to do in placing
                    Indiana before the country in literature as well as in politics. It is also
                    found in the advertisements for the opening of new pioneer towns, about 1830.</p>
            <p>Mr. Promt was a shrewd politician and knew how to handle the gift nature had
                    given him, with the skill and art of the most successful orators of his day. His
                    style of delivery enhanced his words with deeper meaning and more power than
                    when ordinarily used. He knew how to apply the exciting adjectives to the
                    sleeping nouns, with the skill of a master. Mr. Proffit was a good off-hand
                    speaker, a success in an undress uniform as well as in the regulation dress suit
                    of his day. He was a brilliant and witty local epigramatist and phrasemaker,
                    whose ideas attracted any one who had the good fortune to know him intimately.
                    He looked what he was. His features were full of intellectual strength and
                    becoming graces. His glance was a mingling of the sunshine and the lightning of
                    heaven.</p>
            <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-018-1-006"/>
            <p>Mr. Proffit came upon this earth during the first decade of the last century,
                    when such wonderful literary men as Cowper, Macauley, Lytton, Hugo, Emerson,
                    Schiller, Andersen, Browning, Mill, Longfellow, Whittier, Poe, Holmes, Tennyson,
                    Darwin, Fitzgerald, Lincoln, and many others were ushered in. Wonderful men were
                    being born! Few decades of the century can outclass the first decade. It was a
                    time when great intellectual men were coming. Could it have been in the air, or
                    in the heir?</p>
            <p>From 1830 to 1850, nearly all orators saw fit to have a high sounding beginning,
                    an argumentative discourse, and a lofty and grandiloquent peroration, in which
                    their figures of speech soar broad-cast to the high heavens. Occasionally
                    arguments were replaced by things sentimental. There was a lofty and bombastic
                    style not often seen in these days. The faded portraits of pioneer days usually
                    show an orator in a full dress suit, or a swallow-tailed coat, with one hand
                    stuck in front between the buttons in imitation of Daniel Webster, waiting for
                    the applause to die down.</p>
            <p>The decades from 1830 to 1850 were marked with mawkish sentimentality; it was an
                    era of extreme sentiment and gush, perhaps better described as
                    "swash"; no one seems to know just why. This is evident in the
                    songs, pictures, etc., of those days. Mr. Proffit lived in an age when people
                    were much given to hero worship and to extreme and sweeping statements. This is
                    evident from his addresses and from those of all other orators of his day. There
                    was much floridness and exaggeration in the political speeches of the middle
                    period of the last century. The Congressionable Globe is indisputable evidence.</p>
            <p>To have been born in a log cabin was a source of popularity at the time of the
                    Harrison election, in 1840, and it was magnified greatly for political effect.
                    In pioneer days the minds of men were busily engaged, perhaps more than at tTie
                    present time, in studying our government, compiling and applying new laws,
                    promoting new enterprises, institutions, or policies, or in finding objections
                    to them. Most men were intensely partisan, and were usually known as followers
                    of the thoughts promulgated by their respective favorite politician or
                    statesman, for whom they would fight at the drop of a hat.</p>
            <pb n="5" id="VAA4025-018-1-007"/>
            <p>Mr. Proffit served five terms in the state legislature. In 1831 and also, in
                    1832, he served on the committee on education; in 1836 he served on the
                    judiciary committee, on enrolled bills and on canals and internal improvements;
                    in 1837, he served on the judiciary, on corporations, and on canal and internal
                    improvements, and in 1838, on the judiciary, canal and internal improvements. In
                    1837, Mr. Proffit received the second highest vote for speaker of the house.</p>
            <p>In Governor Noah Noble's message to the legislature, December, 1836,
                    appear these words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In establishing the several routes composing the plan of our public

                            their dissatisfaction, information, both verbal and written, from
                            sources that cannot be disregarded, has been communicated to the
                            governor, that he may make it known to the legislature. In the last
                            named counties, delegates have been sent to a convention at Jasper to
                            deliberate upon measures for the promotion of their wishes, and through
                            their representatives here, the character of the improvements proposed,
                            and the extent of their claims upon the patronage of the state will be
                            made known to the legislature. But whilst they complain, they
                            acknowledged their obligations to the state, and mindful of their duty,
                            they are ready, now as heretofore, to sustain the state in her measures,
                            and to respect the supremacy of her laws. Good policy would seem to
                            dictate a course that will quiet these claims and unite these small
                            districts in interest and feeling with the other portions of the state,
                            and I recommend the subject to your serious considerations.</p>

            <p>During the same session, but a few days later, Mr. Proffit presented a resolution

                    </placeName> to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Petersburg, and also one from Paoli to Mt. Carmel, by way of
                    French Lick, Portersville, and Petersburg. Thus he endeavored to make Petersburg
                    the crossing point of two improved highways. At one time, B. E. Ed-monston, of
                    the "Convention of Jasper," presented a petition in the house
                    of representatives asking for a state road from Jasper to the mouth of
                        <geogName>White river</geogName>. This "Convention of
                    Jasper" was a voice in the wilderness calling for means of
                    transportation, and the state highways now under construction <pb n="6" id="VAA4025-018-1-008"/> in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dubois</settlement>
                    </placeName> and adjoining counties are part of the delayed answer.</p>
            <p>Many pioneer speeches were delivered to win future votes for an internal
                    improvement in the home county, or to tickle the fancy and raise the pride in
                    the folks back home. The Wabash and Erie canal and its various branches,
                    constituted a subject of serious consideration in Mr. Proffit's day.
                    The routes of the canals were also a matter upon which an honest difference
                    could exist. Various towns on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> demanded a
                    terminal and great was the excitement months before even the surveys were made.
                    It was under such circumstances that one of Mr. Proffit's canal
                    speeches was delivered. As a future vote-getter in pioneer days as a high praise
                    of the generosity and public spirit of the men of his own counties of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike</region>
                    </placeName>, and as a collection of flowery compliments, it is so classic, that
                    even Lord Chesterfield himself, might have to look to his laurels. The entire
                    speech appears in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Democrat</hi> January 13, 1832. The
                    speech was delivered in the legislature, in January, 1832, when Mr. Proffit
                    represented the counties of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois</region>

                    </placeName>. Arouse ye sleeping politicians of today, wipe off the dew-drops
                    that sparkle on your garments, and listen to what the voters used to hear or
                    read in days gone by. Mr. Proffit's speech is too long to copy here,
                    but listen to this extract: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I stand upon this floor, sir, the wakeful guardian of the rights and

                            scene of this contemplated work and non-expectants of a share in the
                            distribution of its funds; we are as little interested in the work as
                            any portion of the state can possibly be, but, sir, I have generous and
                            liberal constituents, men, who in charging me to watchfulness and
                            wisdom, mean not that I should indiscriminately oppose any measure, no
                            matter how important, because not immediately conducive to their
                            interest; men who would regret to see their feelings and generosity
                            misrepresented in this hall by me their sentinel, sounding the alarm cry
                            of danger, and no danger to be apprehended; shouting the fearful word
                            "taxation" and no contribution asked. No sir, we care
                            not where a work of character and importance is projected without

            <p>This address falls musically upon the ear and awakens slumbering memories of men
                    and events. It brings a smile, for the amount of state taxes paid by his two
                    counties was very small. In 1829, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois county</region>
                    </placeName>, it was only $209.68, and that included some delinquent
                    taxes and penalties. This speech had foresight in it. The southern arm of the
                    canal was built by way of Petersburg to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Promt occasionally used this pun, at his own expense,
                    "I am not only a Promt but the son of a Proffit."</p>
            <p>Mr. Proffit and the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois county</region>
                    </placeName> had a vision of a railroad from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois county</region>
                    </placeName>, to Mount Carmel, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. On Saturday, January 7, 1837, Mr. Proffit presented in the house
                    of representatives, a petition signed by sundry citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois county</region>
                    </placeName> praying for a rail or macadamised road from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Mount Carmel. A bill was passed to incorporate the
                    "Mount Carmel and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad Company." Ten days later he was fighting in the
                    Indiana house of representatives for an appropriation of $150,000 for
                    a road from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Jasper, and a continuation from Jasper, by the most eligible
                    route to the Central canal, but before he could complete the work the house
                    adjourned. The case was lost, so to speak, by a vote of 41 to 49. The Wabash and
                    Erie canal and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> road were financially helped by land grants, so why not aid other
                    public enterprises? On June 6, 1838, Senators John Tipton and O. H. Smith had a
                    bill before the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate to grant to the Mount Carmel and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad company of Indiana, the alternate sections of the public
                    land on the route of the road, on condition that the company should carry the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> mail for twenty years and its troops, arms, and munitions of war,
                    forever free of expense. It was ably defended by the two Indiana senators. The
                    bill was amended and then made a special order for the next day. It was not
                    passed, yet, the Southern railroad is the vision that came true. Do you
                    recognize it? It is the Biblical Jacob's ladder to the Knobs, and its
                    branches now cover ten out of the eleven counties in Mr. Proffit's old
                    district.</p>
            <p>Mr. Proffit did excellent work in the Indiana house of representatives, but he
                    never became a state senator. Fortune <pb n="8" id="VAA4025-018-1-010"/> failed
                    him in that ambition, for Judge Elisha Embree, who was rather conservative on
                    the question of internal improvements, defeated Mr. Promt for the state senate,
                    about 1838; and, in 1847, was elected to congress over Robert Dale Owen. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName> was kindly disposed toward Mr. Proffit. In the congressional race
                    of 1839, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName>, Mr. Proffit received 478 votes; Mr. Owen 227. Robert Dale Owen
                    succeeded Mr. Proffit, in 1843, and Judge Elisha Embree succeeded Owen, in 1847.</p>
            <p>You who love to ramble down the dusty corridors of yester-century and who love to
                    draw the curtains and peep into the mysteries of long ago, may study the
                    traditions and read the printed pages of the annals of time, from the first dawn
                    of written history to the twilight of yester-night and you may not find a
                    character to parallel that of Abraham Lincoln–the child of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, the boy of Indiana, the young man of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, the man of America, and, father of freedom who now belongs to the
                    ages; and, you must not forget that he lived here among us, in the days when <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, Proffit, Brackenridge, and other political orators were making the
                    welkin ring, and he drank in such speeches as only they were able to deliver.
                    Mr. Proffit was a political factor in southern Indiana before the Lincoln family
                    moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. He was full of political efficiency, of rare personal service, and
                    of rich southern humor and, no doubt was enjoyed by Abraham Lincoln, for both
                    Lincoln and Proffit knew there was more human nature in the world than anything
                    else.</p>
            <p>Mr. Proffit was known over all of Indiana from the <geogName>Ohio
                    river</geogName> to the shifting sand-dunes of the lake counties. It appears
                    that his was the pride and flower of the Hoosier oratory of his day. He was
                    magnetic, popular, and successful; there radiated from him vigor, health and
                    happiness. His presence was felt wherever he was. It is said he had the ability
                    to give back to an audience its own thoughts and conceptions, illuminated,
                    purged, perfected perhaps magnified, and transfigured until the product was
                    better than the audience could produce, and by this art he won approval because
                    he understood and was understood. He had the power to express a soul's
                    emotion and appreciation. Occasionally he could make the place where he stood
                    breathe forth an atmosphere of <pb n="9" id="VAA4025-018-1-011"/> dreams and
                    fancies. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> used long words; Lincoln used short words, as did most pioneers in
                    southern Indiana, except in the writing of legal documents, but Mr. Proffit ran
                    to neither extreme.</p>
            <p>In his oratorical peregrinations over the state of Indiana, no doubt he went well
                    prepared for his addresses, even to the extent of seven fingers.
                    "Loaded seven fingers" was a pioneer expression meaning that a
                    muzzle-loading gun of those days was so heavily charged that the ramrod stood
                    out seven inches above the muzzle. The expression came to mean "well
                    prepared", as for a speech. He could deliver a virile, pulsating
                    American political speech, whenever necessary. Early pioneer orators were long
                    on the glories of liberty and freedom, the rights of man, and kindred
                    generalities, and usually full of historical and political platitudes. Mr.
                    Proffit was so constituted, that if he fell in an undertaking, he would fall
                    like a strong man; he would not hesitate to embrace the pillars of a house and
                    pull the house down upon him. He was a master of sentences and could build them
                    well balanced and full of grace, dignity, and ever increasing interest. He
                    seemed always able to charm, fascinate, and carry away his hearers. He had the
                    power to transform dry logic into sentiment.</p>
            <p>There was an aristocratic southern color about him that was not altogether
                    without its punishment and rewards. According to all accounts we have of him he
                    was a pioneer orator in demand even in the elite east. His speeches do not have
                    the breadth and depth of Webster, those of very few orators do, but in the mere
                    use of words many of his sentences come upon us with a fancied Websterian ring
                    of college days. He had a gift of words and a facility of expression, the result
                    of much choice reading and careful study. For a western orator, his orations had
                    an unusually <hi rend="b">wide range of thought,</hi> imagination, and broad
                    appeal.</p>
            <p>Under the uninvited questions that come from a modern political crowd, the
                    rounded periods of the olden times, that embodied the eloquence of the past,
                    have disappeared; and hard knocks, close reasoning, and pointed questions
                    demanding a direct answer have taken their places.</p>
            <p>In their stump speeches, during the heat of political campaigns very often our
                    local pioneer orators used noisy rhetoric, <pb n="10" id="VAA4025-018-1-012"/>
                    tossed out big adjectives and stinging epithets, and made real exaggerations.
                    They brought this fiery oratory from the south. Mr. Promt, himself, could make
                    stinging adjectives cluster about an opponent's name, as honey-bees
                    gather about the wild flowers of the countryside. There was a great deal of
                    solemn humbug in frontier politics of eighty years ago. As a rule many pioneer
                    speeches show superlative degrees, excessive tastes, and vicious language. They
                    often contained much scurrility and abuse of the opposite party. Jackson used to
                    say he had won all his battles, defeated all his enemies, and rewarded all his
                    friends. In pioneer days the rancorous animosities of politics led to many a
                    fist-fight. These early campaigns, usually grumbled with thunder, but in time,
                    the violent eddies in the stream were flowing smoothly to the sea.</p>
            <p>Among Mr. Proffit's political or oratorical peers or opponents may be
                    mentioned three men, all strong and prominent Democrats, all sturdy and
                    successful men. of their day and exceedingly worthy and honorable, and all
                    eventually members of the constitutional convention of 1850. They show the power
                    and make of men with whom he had to compete. Mr. Proffit's most
                    prominent opponents were Benjamin Rose Ed monston, Judge James Lockhart, and
                    Robert Dale Owen.</p>
            <p>Benj. R. Edmonston was a man of large, physical frame and great personal courage.
                    He was devoted and strong in his attachments to principles or friends and ever
                    ready to defend them. He was always bitter in his denunciations of what he
                    considered wrong. These traits in his character fitted him to be a leader in the
                    days of the early settlement of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois county</region>
                    </placeName>, when personal encounters often settled the political status of a
                    neighborhood or county. Many times before he was of age he demonstrated his
                    physical strength in "fist and skull" encounters with the
                    champions of his political opponents, as was customary in pioneer days. He
                    weighed over two hundred pounds and when flat-boating was the means of
                    transportation, he would frequently shoulder a barrel of corn and carry it upon
                    the boat–a feat ordinarily requiring two men. He had more than an
                    average intellectual ability, although having only the scant education the
                    "bab schools" of that day afforded. He was a successful public
                    debater and stump orator in the then First congressional district. He was <pb n="11" id="VAA4025-018-1-013"/> a presidential elector of this district in
                    1844 and cast his vote for James Knox Polk. His style was fervid and pointed,
                    more calculated to arouse enthusiasm in his own party than to win over persons
                    from the opposite party. Edmonston had red hair, a florid complexion, and
                    usually wore a red flannel shirt. His friends called him "Red
                    Rover." He was a native of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Buncombe

                    Carolina</region>
               </placeName>, and was always jealous of the honor of his native
                    state, but not given much to the use of "buncombe." His
                    political speeches were spiced with his own solos, for he was a good singer. He
                    was born March 8, 1807, died in August, 1856, and his remains lie buried in <placeName>

            <p>Judge James Lockhart was a man of acknowledged talents, a forcible speaker, a
                    sound lawyer, and a good judge; he made no pretense to what is called flowery
                    eloquence, but was rather a matter-of-fact, straightforward speaker and much
                    endeared to his friends. He had few of the arts of the professional orator, and
                    none of that studied grace and polish which some men often utilize in place of
                    solid worth and good judgment; but he was a sober thinker, and never addressed
                    an audience without conveying a message of value. He was "formed on the
                    good old plan, a true and brave democratic man." Well poised with the
                    serenity of calm judgment, he was duly and truly prepared to serve his people in
                    the exalted position he held, but the voters did not send him to congress in his
                    first attempt, in the year 1839. Judge Lockhart is described as being tall,
                    large, and portly, forehead prominent, hair and eyes dark. He was a most
                    valuable member of the late constitutional convention of Indiana. He represented
                    the counties of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike</region>

                        <region type="county">Vandenburg</region>
                    </placeName>, and stood by the ancient landmarks with great firmness. He was the
                    first judge to formulate a code of rules for the government of his circuit
                    courts. He died while a member of congress, having served in 1851, 1852, and
                    1857.</p>
            <p>Robert Dale Owen was a Democrat of great force in the state. It was mainly
                    through the efforts of Robert Dale Owen, a Scotchman, that the women of Indiana
                    finally secured the right to own and control their separate property during
                    marriage; the right to their own earnings; the widow's absolute
                    ownership of her part of the deceased husband's property; and a
                    woman's right to divorce a husband for habitual drunkenness and
                    cruelty. He is so prominently connected with the pioneer history and development
                    of southern Indiana that the writer may as well carry roses to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>

            <p>Mr. Owen was a man small in stature, with a large forehead, light hair and eyes,
                    and prominent features. He looked like a sturdy Scotchman, recently from the
                    "Land o' Cakes." He was a man of many parts and in
                    early life wrote a play called "Pocahontas." He was a man of
                    literary ability, a reformer, and a statesman. He was born at

                    name. Robert Dale Owen was considered one of the best educated, most
                    intelligent, and most influential men of his day in southern Indiana.</p>
            <p>On August 5, 1839, Mr. Owen and Mr. Promt were candidates for congress, and Mr.
                    Promt was elected. Mr. Owen carried the counties of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Orange</region>, <region type="county">Posey</region>,

                    </placeName>. In 1877, in an article published in <hi rend="i">Scribner's Monthly</hi>, Mr. Owen gave this incident of that
                    campaign: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I may mention here, as illustrative of the style of thought and idiomatic
                            expression among the simple people with whom I had made my home, an
                            incident of later date, when I was in the field for congress against
                            George H. Promt. It was in a rustic portion of the district, and after I
                            had spoken I had been invited as usual to spend the night at a
                            neighboring farmer's. Happening to sit, during the evening, on
                            my host's front porch, I overheard, from just 'round
                            the. corner of the cabin, the conversation of two men who did not
                            suppose I was within ear-shot. Their talk was, as usual, of the
                            candidates:</p>
                        <p>"Did you hear Owen speak?" asked one.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," said the other, "I hearn him."
                            "Now, ain't he a hoss?" was the next
                            question. "Well, yes; they're both blooded nags; they
                            make a very pretty race."</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Seldom, indeed, were better blooded men than Promt and Owen entered for
                    congressional sweepstakes.</p>
            <p>Later, Mr. Owen became a member of congress and served his district well. While
                    in congress he was a prominent character. He introduced a bill creating the
                    Smithsonian Institution, and for many years afterwards he was one of its
                    regents. At the south steps of the state house stands a bronze statue of Mr.

            <p>In the musty tomes of congress are to be found many speeches of John Lockhart,
                    Robert Dale Owen, and Mr. Proffit. In the Indiana constitutional convention of
                    1850, Mr. Owen was considered the best writer of correct English. The names of
                    Edmonston, Lockhart, and Owen, in the order named, appear in their own
                    chirography on the original engrossed parchment copy of the state constitution
                    of 1850 in the spread-eagle signatures of pioneer days. That is the document
                    referred to when you hold up your hand and swear "to support the
                    constitution of the state of Indiana," etc. These men have been given
                    full consideration that you may form an idea of the men with whom Mr. Proffit
                    found it necessary to compete for the honors he earned. The highest honors to
                    these men came after Mr. Proffit had passed to the great beyond. In the
                    beginning of the race for congress, in 1839, Judge Lockhart was nominated, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jasper</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on what was then known as the "Van Buren
                    ticket." It was the first congressional convention ever held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jasper</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In time Judge Lockhart withdrew and Robert Dale Owen was
                    substituted. Mr. Proffit's election over Mr. Owren drew the attention
                    of voters from distant states, because of Mr. Owen's religious
                    principles.</p>
            <p>Geo. H. Proffit was educated in English and French, and belonged to one of the
                    leading families of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, where his grandfather held the office of surveyor-general under
                    the French government. He came to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName> about 1828 at the age of twenty-one, and engaged in the merchandise
                    business. He is spoken of as "a merchant of the twenties." He
                    became a member of the Indiana, legislature and served several terms with
                    distinction. He served in congress two terms. The east and south regarded him as
                    a brilliant son of Indiana. Much praise was showered upon him by Whig papers of
                    about 1840, during the Tippecanoe and Tyler campaign. He was a true southerner
                    and was very fond of politics, hunting, fishing, and horse racing. In that
                    respect he was akin to Daniel Webster of the same day and generation. Webster
                    outlined many of his famous orations, and committed some to memory while fishing
                    in the streams in and about Marshfield, his <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> estate. Mr. Proffit was perhaps as good a fisherman as Peter of
                    old, and he was also a fairly good fisher of men and votes for many years, as is
                    evident from his political record. <pb n="15" id="VAA4025-018-1-017"/> Mr.
                    Proffit may have constructed many of his flowery sentences while fishing in Mill
                    creek, and in Patoka, and <geogName>White rivers</geogName>.</p>

                            was quick and ready, his voice remarkably loud and clear, and he
                            possessed a fluent elocution and a fertile imagination. The greater
                            power of Mr. Proffit was on the stump before the people. I first became
                            acquainted with him at <placeName>

                            a ready debater. As a popular speaker, in addressing the masses, few
                            stood higher in the East. One evening, after dark, I was passing down

                                <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                            </placeName>, when I noticed a large gathering up at the City Hall. I
                            walked up, and found it to be a political Harrison meeting. Many
                            transparencies were exhibited. General Walter Jones, the president, was
                            seated on the platform, surrounded by vice-presidents. Just as I reached
                            the skirts of the crowd, General Jones rose, and at the top of his voice
                            said: "Is the Honorable George H. Proffit of Indiana in the
                            assembly? If so he will come forward and address the audience",
                            A voice in the crowd, "Mr. Proffit is unable to speak tonight.
                            He exhausted himself at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Wilmington</settlement>
                            </placeName> last night." General Jones: "We are sorry
                            to hear it, the people want to hear Mr. Proffit. Is Caleb Cushing of <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                            </placeName> in the crowd?" A voice: "Yes, Mr. Cushing
                            is here." "Let him come up to the stand." I
                            was much gratified to see our Proffit stand higher with the multitude as
                            a speaker, than Mr. Cushing, the distinguished orator of <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                            </placeName>. Mr. Cushing took the stand and spoke over an hour. I heard
                            few such speeches during the campaign. He was rather taller than Mr.
                            Proffit, inclined to baldness, wide mouth and dark hair. He was fluent,
                            loud, rapid and animated. The only fault I could find at the time with
                            his speech, was its extreme bitterness against the Democratic party. I
                            had been much on the stump in that contest, had heard many distinguished
                            men, and my observation had satisfied me that soft words <pb n="16" id="VAA4025-018-1-018"/> and hard arguments was the true policy. The
                            sun, and not the wind, made the traveler part with his cloak.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Proffit abandoned the Whig cause with his friends–Cushing,
                            Wise, Upshur, Gilmer, Spencer, Irwin, and a few others, in 1841. His
                            name was more fortunate than theirs, in not being rejected by the
                            Senate. The reason, however, was that Mr. Tyler wisely withheld the
                            nomination of Mr. Proffit until after the Senate adjourned, and then
                            sent him to <placeName>
                                <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                            </placeName> as our Charge. The senate at the next session refused to
                            confirm the nomination, and he returned soon after, in very bad health,
                            lingered for some time, and died at the city of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                            </placeName> I visited his tomb. As I stood silently by his grave, he
                            seemed to rise as in the day of his pride before me, and then sink back
                            to his mother earth. How soon we pass from active life to the sleep of
                            death!</p>

            <p>Mr. Proffit is interestingly spoken of in <hi rend="i">A Tour Through Indiana in
                        1800</hi>, a delightful and charming Indiana production from the pen of Mrs.
                    Kate Milner Rabb. Mr. Owen is also mentioned with becoming grace and dignity.
                    This wonderfully well drawn pen picture of the pioneer days of Indiana deserves
                    a careful perusal if you are interested in the subject of this paper, and his
                    day and generation with its barbecues, speeches, and processions. Politicians in
                    Mr. Proffit's day did things and took chances no one would dare attempt
                    in Indiana today. In 1840, Martin Van Buren was the Democratic candidate for
                    re-election as president, and William Henry Harrison was the Whig candidate. It
                    was during this campaign that Mr. Proffiit rendered heroic work for the Whigs.</p>

                            and an orator of great brilliancy, etc.</p>

                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It is related of Mr. Proffit that once upon his return from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, he brought with him a very fine carriage, carryall or barouche,
                    the first ever seen in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName>. It was drawn by a team of dashing horses with a set of flashy
                    harness. As was usual in those days, there was a large basket meeting <pb n="17" id="VAA4025-018-1-019"/> in the neighborhood of Petersburg. Mr. and Mrs.
                    Proffit attended, coming in the carriage, their driver in livery, and Mr. and
                    Mrs. Proffit correctly dressed, silk hat and all, after the fashion of the elite
                    east. The approach of the Proffits created a sensation, and any one who knows
                    the pioneers of the decade of the forties needs no prophet to tell him what
                    result to expect. It practically broke up the meeting. The Proffit turn-out got
                    the crowd, leaving the minister almost without a congregation. The people
                    viewed, admired, and wondered, but the old taxpayers shook their heads, did not
                    approve, and said that hereafter they would not vote for any one who made such a
                    display on the money they were paying him to represent them in congress; that it
                    was too much like royalty and not to the liking of an American citizen of
                    southern Indiana. The amusing part about this is the fact that no other public
                    speaker in Indiana could so bemean and condemn the Van Buren administration in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> for its extravagancies, aristocratic tendencies and so on, as Mr.
                    Proffit. Yet, Mr. Proffit was dressy, he could not avoid it; he was a cultured,
                    educated, aristocratic man from the south and really at home in the social ways
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> and the east. The southern cavalier spirit was in him and he could
                    not help it; blood will tell.</p>
            <p>Mr. Goodlet Morgan who heard the address used to relate a story to the effect
                    that at one time Mr. Proffit had incurred the displeasure of some of the voters
                    of Petersburg, whether through the defamation of his rivals, the carriage and
                    livery. or some fancied wrongs seems unknown. Having in some way, become aware
                    of this displeasure, Mr. Proffit notified the voters by placards at the voting
                    places that he wished to speak to them once more before they voted. A large
                    crowd gathered to hear him, and he spoke for an hour. At the end of the speech
                    he secured practically every vote in the town, such was the overpowering
                    influence of his eloquence, and the strength of his logic. It is interesting to
                    know that he prepared for this event with the greatest care and the highest
                    regard for "stage setting." He had a platform built with a
                    canopy, dressed his two little daughters in their finest white dresses, and had
                    one of them on each side of him. In beginning his speech he told the crowd that
                    he wanted it to understand <pb n="18" id="VAA4025-018-1-020"/> that he valued
                    its good opinion and its confidence even as he loved his two little girls. He
                    told the crowd, that he could with fortitude and courage, although with
                    unspeakable grief, follow to the grave the bodies of his beloved children and
                    there stand until the last clod was thrown upon their little coffins, but he
                    confessed that he had not the strength to endure the loss of the confidence of
                    the masses who had so frequently honored him, whom he had sought to serve so
                    faithfully, and whose good opinion he was sure he still deserved. He then
                    proceeded with an exposition of his views and an explanation of his attitude
                    with the result that the whole crowd was with him heart and soul long before he
                    had finished.</p>
            <p>In 1842, the Whig party began to separate itself from President Tyler and to
                    detest him. By May, 1843, President Tyler was abandoned by the Whigs and was
                    seeking support for his administration from the Democrats. In the main it was
                    the old banking system that caused the dissatisfaction.</p>
            <p>In 1841, Mr. Proffit left the Whig party. He was a turbulent and daring spirit.
                    There was a French cavalier dash In him. His tempestuous public harangues suited
                    the people of the times. His style of oratory was every where received with
                    acclamation and huzzas. When it was known that he was to be present at a
                    political gathering, it added hundreds to the excited throng. His spirit was
                    suited to lead in battle. He was in the front rank as an orator in 1840. Do not
                    blame Mr. Proffit too harshly for leaving the Whigs. He was placed in the front
                    rank where the battle raged the fiercest. He would not accept a rear guard
                    position when the danger was past. Mr. Proffit was a real idol of the common
                    people when political excitement prevailed. His speeches were bold and searching
                    against the Democrats of Van Buren's day.</p>
            <p>Under our first constitution, state elections were held annually in August; the
                    legislature convened in December and everybody talked politics. Party conflicts
                    were frequent and extremely animated. Political fist-fights were common; for
                    heated discussions were conducive to ugly words and combats, yet after all, they
                    were sponsors of our present local political knowledge. The early newspapers of
                    Indiana contained very little of what we now call local news. Politics was the
                    chief item of interest in pioneer days, and aside from a few brief <pb n="19" id="VAA4025-018-1-021"/> items from the outside world column after column
                    was given over to the discussion of national and state political questions.
                    Political booklets, or tracts, were printed and circulated, and in this way
                    Indiana eventually became a close state, politically. Many of the booklets were
                    severe in tone and argument.</p>
            <p>Mr. Proffit's biography gives us valuable glimpses of the days when
                    Indiana was in the turmoil of annual elections in the dog days of every August.
                    No sooner was one election over, than they began their stump speeches for
                    revenge at the next general election. Today when a man is a candidate for
                    congress we are permitted to speak to him as "running for
                    congress." In pioneer days a candidate for congress was spoken of as
                    "standing a poll for congress."</p>
            <p>In 1839, the Whig candidates for the nomination to congress in the first district
                    were John A. Brackenridge, G. Burton Thompson and Geo. H. Proffit. Mr. Proffit
                    was nominated at <placeName>

                    convention was conducted on the county unit system. The votes of

            <p>In speaking of an address delivered at Freedonia, April 29, 1839, by Mr. Proffit,
                    the <hi rend="i">Leavenworth Arena</hi> of May 2, says: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            listened to very attentively. Many went to hear him, and at the same
                            time harbored great prejudices against him, but afterwards were
                            thoroughly convinced that he was the people's

                    county's. This was also charged against Mr. Proffit, in earlier
                    campaigns in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike</region>

                    </placeName> counties, but these charges were never substantiated. Time after
                    time Mr. Proffit challenged any man to prove ihis charge against him. One
                    slanderer said "Mr. Proffit administered the sacrament with whiskey,
                    etc." This is mentioned here as an example of pioneer politics. Judge
                    James Lock-hart started to make this race for congress in 1839, but in time,
                    Robert Dale Owen was substituted and became the Democratic candidate; then the
                    "concoctors of the buttermilk slander" had all they could do
                    to clear up another religious controversy. The "buttermilk
                    slander" became so extensively circulated that ministers and other
                    church people finally carded the papers as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Mr. Proffit's victory, in 1839, was indeed a victory, for it was an
                    early Whig congressional victory in the Pocket. Mr. Proffit won his laurels as
                    an orator before he was thirty-four years of age. At a time when oratory was in
                    flower in the American congress he was an idolized, popular Whig leader and a
                    far-famed Hoosier orator, whose speeches were veritable Niagaras of forceful
                    logic and rhetoric. One wonders where this Petersburg merchant acquired his
                    ability and when he found time to keep abreast of the national questions of the
                    day, to such an extent as to attract national recognition.</p>
            <p>In August, 1839, George H. Proffit was elected to congress from this district by
                    a vote of 6,008, being 779 more than Robert Dale Owen, the Democrat, received.
                    Mr. Proffit was known at that time as a constructive Whig, yet men were not
                    always known by party names. Politics was very personal. In the Indiana
                    delegation to congress in 1841, all were new men but Mr. Proffit, who alone
                    withstood the political upheaval of the campaign. During Mr. Proffit's
                    last term in congress his associates were Andrew Kennedy, Henry S. Lane, Richard
                    W. Thompson, and David Wallace, all exceptionally strong men. This election gave
                    Mr. Proffit a prominence in Indiana and in many eastern states. The presidential
                    campaign of 1840 was much of a frolic on the part of the Whigs. There were many
                    jubilant and uproarious expressions of imprisoned mirth and fun on the part of
                    the voters, and anything like calmness of judgment and real seriousness of
                    purpose seemed to be absent from the Whig camp. Harrison was presented to the
                    Whigs as a "poor man's friend"–while Van
                    Buren was proclaimed an aristocrat. The Whigs charged President Van Buren with
                    using golden spoons, with planting mulberry trees in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House grounds, and with other so-called extravagances, etc. The
                    Whigs claimed he was so "slick" that he should have planted
                    "slippery elms." His enemies referred to him as the
                    "Kinderhook Wizard." General Harrison's military <pb n="22" id="VAA4025-018-1-024"/> record was magnified greatly by the Whigs, a
                    common custom in those days, borrowed from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> Democrats. In the congressional election of 1840, when Geo. H.
                    Profnt was again elected to congress, he received 190 votes in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois county</region>
                    </placeName> while Judge Lockhart received 202. Mr. Profnt served in congress
                    from March 4, 1839, to March 3, 1843. At that time Mr. Profnt was rated as a
                    Whig, and since then few Whigs or Republicans, as such, ran any better races in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois county</region>
                    </placeName>. Pioneer voters were men usually of few words and they were usually
                    for a man, or against a man. It was not always a party question. Voters made no
                    half-way choice. If they had no use for a man, they never told him to go to
                    limbus; they told him to go all the way down. An idea of what was uppermost in
                    the minds of people at any given time may be obtained from the subjects of their
                    orations. In 1828 the fourth-day-July was celebrated by public speaking in
                    nearly all parts of Indiana. Here are some of the toasts–
                    "The Day We Celebrate," "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>," "The Sages and Heroes of the
                    Revolution," "The Cause of Liberty," "<placeName>
                        <country reg="gr">Greece</country>
                    </placeName>," "The Present Administration of the General
                    Government," "The American System,"
                    "Internal Improvements," "The Spirit of the
                    Times," "Indiana," "The New
                    Purchase," "The Army and the Navy." In 1830, some of
                    the toasts were "The Day–The brightest and most glorious in
                    the annals of freedom," "Gen. George Washington–the
                    name conveys sufficient meaning," "The Heroes of the
                    Revolution–may their fame be as immortal as the struggle was
                    glorious," "Charles Carroll–the only survivor of
                    the noble band who signed the Declaration of Independence," etc., etc.
                    This was at a period in our history when, at least once a year, there was a
                    feast of patriotism and a flow of patriotic oratory–a holiday that
                    should by all means be revived.</p>
            <p>In pioneer days toasts were the usual mode of expressing thought and sentiment.
                    They were emphasized in various ways, such as–"Six cheers
                    and one gun," "four cheers and one gun,"
                    "six cheers and two guns," "standing in
                    silence," "three cheers," etc. In those days in
                    southern Indiana political discussions and polemic societies were conducive to
                    offhand oratory with perhaps equal parts of logic and noise. Political
                    processions came into general use in the campaign <pb n="23" id="VAA4025-018-1-025"/> of 1840, and an accomplished orator was a dangerous
                    opponent. In pioneer days a cheap politician was called a
                    "rabble-rouser." The word explains itself, when separated
                    exactly in the middle. Mr. Proffit was nearly the opposite of a cheap
                    politician, but he knew human nature and he could hand out compliments with the
                    skill of an artist. A few of the pioneer voters could spit tobacco into either
                    eye of the family cat contentedly sleeping, with its back to a fireplace, ten
                    feet distant, for there was a lot of plain living and some high thinking going
                    on at the same time, in many a log cabin along the banks of the drowsy, sleepy,
                        <geogName>Patoka river</geogName>, that beavers' paradise of gentle
                    curves and graceful meanderings. The inhabitants felt honored at being
                    designated and appealed to as taxpayers, American patriots and citizens, holding
                    the destiny of a nation in the hollow of their hands. Mr. Proffit knew cabin
                    life as well as that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>. He had touched life on many sides, and was in sympathy with the
                    needs, hopes, and ambitions of our pioneers, but patriotism was his pole-star
                    after all; politics the means to an end.</p>
            <p>In those early days a barbecue was a free-Avill offering on the altar of
                    patriotism or politics, a great outdoor feast of the very fat of the land. The
                    stump-speech system of electioneering was prevalent. It came to the Pocket from
                    the south. Its peculiar advantages over the convention system of the east gave
                    it a preference for many years. It was a school for offhand orators, and many of
                    the statesmen of eighty years ago learned how to speak in the old-time political
                    campaigns. In pioneer days, strong men like Mr. Proffit often went into public
                    life from an inward call and a love of the highest distinction, often to the
                    sacrifice or injury of their health or fortune. Distinction was the reward. In
                    those days it was not exactly the caprice of fashion, not the accident of high
                    rank, and not a distinguished social position that established a man's
                    reception in a community–to do that it usually took his politics, or
                    his position on some great state or national issue.</p>
            <p>The Van Buren marker, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plainfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the <geogName>Van Buren Hill</geogName> near <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, are amusing reminders of the days of early travel over the old
                    Cumberland road. Mr. Proffit was a strong advocate for the completion of the
                    Cumberland road, the great <pb n="24" id="VAA4025-018-1-026"/> national highway
                    through Indiana, and on February 8, 1840, wrote the <hi rend="i">Spirit of
                        '76</hi>, a Whig paper of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, blaming the Van Buren adminitsration for lack of support to the
                    great highway. On the 14th of June, 1840, Mr. Promt wrote the same paper
                    denouncing Tilghman Howard, the Democrat candidate for governor of Indiana, for
                    leaving his seat in congress to look after his political fences at home, while
                    bills for the up-keep of the road were pending in congress. In the <hi rend="i">Spirit of '76</hi>, under dates of July 11 and 18, of the year
                    1840, may be found Mr. Promt's speech, delivered in the house of
                    representatives, at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, on April 27 of that year. It is on the general appropriation bill.
                    It is a severe indictment of Van Buren's administration, and is
                    probably "loaded seven fingers."</p>
            <p>Near the opening of his speech Mr. Proffit says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It required no stretch of intellect to perceive that the order had gone
                            forth to vote down every proposition of the minority; and, sir, up to
                            this hour, that order has been most implicity obeyed. It comports not
                            with my taste to describe the tumult, the legislative depravity, the
                            utter recklessness which I have here witnessed. It has been but a
                            combination of the disgraceful scene with which our sitting opened; and
                            it is now lamentably palpable that a congress which commenced in
                            revolution, riot, and anarchy, must terminate in disorder and disgrace,
                            etc.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The speech is a long one, and a severe one. In closing, Mr. Proffit said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I take no pleasure in criticising the course of my government; I know the
                            fallibility of human nature. I regret being compelled to show my

                            corruption exists. I am sorry that the necessity is forced upon me to
                            take any thing like a prominent position in denouncing the conduct of
                            the administration. I know that a faithful discharge will draw down the
                            execrations and base calumnies of the administration presses; our
                            motives impunged; public course misrepresented; private character
                            assailed; 'life's life lied away.' But, sir,
                            I, for one, will pursue my course with the same defying spirit which

                    did not pretend to be very orderly in congress himself. Thus began the
                    presidential campaign of 1840, with Mr. Proffit making the keynote speeches
                    which were of great assistance in winning the fight for "Tippecanoe and

                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, but the senate was so hostile to Mr. Tyler, and perhaps to Mr.
                    Proffit, that it did not confirm the appointment: Mr. Proffit was severe in his
                    denunciation of Van Buren's administration, almost to the extent of an
                    iconoclast. He supported General Harrison as a hero worshiper would, in the days
                    of old.</p>
            <p>On December 22, 1840, in the house of representatives, at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Mr. Proffit submitted a resolution calling for $450,000

                    direful consequences which he had alleged would ensue, in case the house should
                    not make the appropriation. He declared that: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            grievances of the Western people arising from other causes. He then
                            touched upon nullification, the tariff question, etc., and concluded by
                            giving the House a solemn warning, that in case the resolution should be
                            rejected, the people of the northwest would rise in their might when
                            thier indignation would be an all consuming blaze, without a particle of

                    the southern and western leaders and when reminded of it, they pointed to the

                    </placeName> in the War of 1812, with its Hartford convention, resolutions,

                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> may well hang her proud head in shame. Mr. Proffit was using the

                    a northwestern revolt, unless the national road was given more financial aid.
                    The south and west learned their line of reason and talk from the scholarly and

            <p>President Tyler vetoed several important bills. This caused much ill feeling
                    between the president and those of the Whigs who still believed that a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Bank was an absolute necessity. All the cabinet officers resigned
                    except Daniel Webster, (whom General Harrison had made secretary of state), for
                    Webster had started on the great negotiations with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> over the boundary line between <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Webster tried his utmost to prevent the break between Tyler and
                    the Whigs. Webster said it would ruin the Whig party, and help neither the bank
                    nor the country. Henry Clay exhausted his power of ridicule and sarcasm in
                    denouncing Mr. Tyler. Whig newspapers attacked Mr. Tyler and prominent Whigs
                    denounced him. Mr. Proffit remained faithful to the president. The Massachusetts
                    Whigs, in 1842, in their convention, declared a final separation of the party
                    from President Tyler. It was the beginning of the end of the Whig party. Some
                    Whigs left the party; the party left some Whigs.</p>
            <p>At one time during a discussion about the northeast boundary of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Mr. Proffit objected to the cost of the surveys but he withdrew
                    his objection when informed three lines were to be surveyed. The present
                    boundary as adjusted by Daniel Webster was the middle line. Mr. Proffit was not
                    inclined to "twist the lion's tail," as was often the
                    case in those days, but usually by a cheap grade of politicians.</p>
            <p>In July, 1840, the house had before it the case of Lieutenant Hooe, concerning
                    the enlistment of negroes, or other colored <pb n="27" id="VAA4025-018-1-029"/>
                    persons in the service of the army or navy of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. It seems the conduct of a president in this case did not meet with
                    Mr. Proffit's approval. Mr. Proffit said he was unqualifiedly opposed
                    to the admission of the testimony of colored persons against white men. He
                    approved fully of the laws of the state of Indiana, which provided that no
                    negro, or mulatto, or Indian, or even the quarter-blood, should be admitted as
                    evidence against white persons. He considered the conduct of the president in
                    the case of Lieutenant Hooe as an insult not to be pardoned by any southern man
                    and a direct attack upon the institutions of the south, etc.</p>
            <p>On Monday, August 23, 1841, in the house, Mr. Proffit said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>He believed the Whig party was not to be found in these halls; they were
                            to be found at the plough-handles and in the workshops. The Whig party
                            succeeded, by the addition of the old Jackson men, who wished to reform
                            the abuses of the administration. He compared a vetoed bill, which was
                            concocted in the senate to make great men–to make
                            presidents–to a limping animal that stalked up the avenue
                            with a leg of brass and a leg of wood, and finally died with the
                            "Botts." He said he belonged to the
                            corporal's guard; and, if the member from <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                            </placeName> would permit him, he would march as the humblest member of
                            the forlorn hope. He thought the president (Mr. Tyler) should have a new
                            cabinet; and if he were asked when, he should say NOW. If the present
                            members went out of their own accord, so much the better. He went
                            against Mr. Clay with sorrow, but he never could have Mr. Clay for his
                            president. He felt the chains upon his wrists now; he did not feel them
                            when he advocated Mr. Clay's cause before the people for
                            thirteen long years. He said the name of the bill would be changed
                            before it was passed, and he should not be surprised if its authors
                            stole the title of the much abused Sub-Treasury bill for it. Mr. Proffit
                            defended the president (Mr. Tyler) with eloquence, and to the fullest
                            extent.</p>

            <p>On Tuesday night, August 24, 1841, a full length effigy of John Tyler was

                    </placeName> because in the exercise of a power vested in him by the

                    </placeName>. Politically, Mr. Proffit fell for his friend John Tyler.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tyler's elevation to the presidency, through the death of General
                    Harrison, was America's first lesson–yet not
                    learned–of the danger of being careless in naming a vice-presidential
                    candidate. Mr. Tyler's administration would have been a most
                    distressing failure had not Daniel Webster <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-018-1-030"/>
                    remained his secretary of state until he completed his boundary treaty with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>; then A. P. Upshur, who signed Mr. Proffit's passport, in
                    time, became Mr. Tyler's secretary of state. Mr. Proffit was before the
                    public at a time of great unrest. Sectional interests were slowly dissolving
                    party lines. The symptoms of the approaching dissolution of the Whig party were
                    clear, but the travail that was to bring into life the Republican party had not
                    yet come to pass. Mr. Proffit was one of the star speakers in the defeat of
                    President Van Buren and the election of Harrison and Tyler. It is to be
                    remembered that Mr. Harrison died soon after his elevation to the presidency,
                    and that Mr. Tyler became president. Mr. Tyler's administration did not
                    meet with the approval of many eastern Whigs, but Mr. Proffit defended him; thus
                    Mr. Proffit became the victim of an enfilading fire from the Van Buren Democrats
                    and the eastern Whigs–some of the very men his vicious attacks upon
                    the Democrats had helped to elect. He proved to be a foeman worthy of their
                    steel, as the records of congress conclusively prove. He insisted upon their
                    votes being recorded on all questions of party policy.</p>
            <p>On March 11, 1842, in an address before congress, Mr. Proffit said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>He was endeavoring to do something to relieve the country and to restore
                            the state of the currency. He was for the country; he was determined in

                            to keep up an angry party denunciation, in which he admitted that he had
                            himself too much indulged in the times past, they could do so; but for
                            him–as he grew older he grew wiser. The Whigs had told the
                            people they would endeavor to allay these party dissensions, and pour
                            oil upon the troubled waters; they were pledged to this, and he was
                            resolved to perform it.</p>

                    Proffit had not"been in congress six months. During his first year in
                    congress Mr. Proffit delivered a speech before an audience of ten thousand at

                        <p>For an hour and a half, Mr. Proffit kept the House convulsed with
                            laughter. He is decidedly original. He thinks exactly as no other man
                            ever thought or ever will think–as no other mortal ever can
                            think. He is a man of unquestionable talent; and, as a partisan, may be
                            ranked as the most ardent and rabid of the Harrison party. John Randolph
                            once said that he would walk a mile to kick a sheep; and I suppose that
                            Blr. Proffit would traverse the whole of the greater prairies of the
                            West to demolish a locofoco, as such; and yet few men possess, as a man,
                            better feelings than he does. He is always good natured and complacent
                            to all and as he possesses strong conversational powers, a ready, and a
                            rich store of wit, and a large fund of anecdotes, he is popular with all
                            parties. As a representative, he is industrious and attentive to the
                            interests of the people, and may be regarded by them as a faithful and
                            constant agent.</p>

            <p>From the records of congress it appears Mr. Proffit was a fiery, extemporaneous
                    speaker, often on the floor and in tne heat of debate, but it does not appear
                    that he was ever charged with loquacity. He had done much to elect Harrison and
                    Tyler, who received 234 out of 294 electoral votes. Gen. Harrison was moderately
                    in favor of a bank; Tyler was opposed to a bank. Tyler was a Virginian and not a
                    Whig in its generally accepted term. He was a "state-rights"
                    Whig or Democrat, with emphasis on the compound adjective, and is now generally
                    recorded as a Democrat in our histories. This ticket was elected at a time when
                    the west was supplying presidential candidates and demanding serious
                    consideration. In a sense, Tyler was a Democratic tail to a Whig kite. Had
                    President Harrison lived out his term, it is apparent, Mr. Proffit would have
                    been very powerful in the councils of the party, but Mr. Tyler was not a very
                    popular president, and the burden of defending his administration fell upon such
                    men as Mr. Proffit, who were, to some extent, responsible for his election; thus
                    Mr. Promt's last term in congress was one of defending the president, a
                    task not in harmony with his aggressive spirit. President Tyler was a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> "State-Rights Whig" who became a Democrat and is
                    probably best known as a negative statesman, who quarreled with the Whig
                    leaders, vetoed many bills, among them the fiscal bank bills and the protective
                    tariff bill (of 1842); opposed the Ashburton treaty and the annexation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>; and favored the Confederate cause of 1861, etc. In 1840, Mr.
                    Proffit carried Harrison's <pb n="31" id="VAA4025-018-1-033"/> banner,
                    and beat Tyler's drum; they were elected, but Mr. Tyler proved a hard
                    man to justify. The burden fell upon Mr. Proffit to an unusual extent.</p>
            <p>On January 10, 1843, in the house, Congressman Botts, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, brought forward articles of impeachment against President Tyler,
                    who came from his own state. The vote stood 83 yeas and 127 nays. Thus it was
                    decided the president was unimpeached and unimpeachable. Mr. Proffit voted
                    against the impeachment of the president, but said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>For his part, he would have been perfectly willing that the impeachment
                            should have gone on, as he would like to see the black silk gloves, and
                            other trappings of a court of impeachment, but he did not vote for the
                            resolution, because he did not believe in the truth of the charges, or
                            that they contained impeachable matter.</p>

            </p>
            <p>On Friday, March 3, 1843, the last day of his last term, Mr. Proffit, Mr. Wise,
                    and some others, were at the desk of Mr. Fillmore, chairman of the committee of
                    ways and means, examining the manuscript copy of a bill in care of Mr. Fillmore,
                    it being the only one to which the members had access. The chairman told them
                    they <hi rend="i">must</hi> take their seats. Mr. Proffit stood for a moment
                    evidently in great astonishment, and then said firmly <hi rend="i">"Sir, I will not take my seat."</hi> A great sensation
                    was instantaneously created, and much confusion ensued. A half dozen gentlemen
                    sprang to the floor and each addressed the chair. Some asserted positively that
                    Mr. Proffit was not out of order, and begged the chairman to bear in mind that
                    the house of representatives was not a school house. During the excitement
                    Congressman Oliver drew Mr. Proffit to his desk and succeeded in pouring oil on
                    the troubled waters, and the affair was allowed to terminate–with Mr.
                    Proffiit's congressional career. Those were ugly days in congress and
                    in one of his speeches in the house, Mr. Proffit told the speaker, if he could
                    not get protection from the speaker he would come prepared to protect himself.
                    In those days dueling was not uncommon and many men went armed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Proffit is perhaps better known as a Whig, refined, and with a great respect
                    for education and learning. Practically all the old eastern Whigs cultivated
                    dignity and its allied graces, but Mr. Proffit may not have been altogether an
                    extremist <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-018-1-034"/> along that line, at least, not to
                    the extent of arrogance. When you once thoroughly know an American gentleman,
                    you can easily recognize a Hoosier gentelman. Mr. Proffit was both.</p>
            <p>In 1843, President John Tyler, who filled out the unexpired term of William Henry
                    Harrison, and for whom Mr. Promt did heroic campaign work, appointed Mr. Proffit

            <p>The original papers are in the archives of the Indiana University. With the
                    penetrating glance of a seer Mr. Proffit saw in the future, the end of the Whig
                    party, as such, and went over into' the camp of the Democrats as did
                    Mr. Tyler, when all was mist and uncertainty to the generality of his
                    contemporaries, and he paid the penalty for his independent judgment. The man
                    that makes a character worthy of history usually makes foes. History is usually
                    very kind to great men; biography is not always so kind. The dignity of history
                    and the truth of biography compel us to speak the language of humility when we
                    say that Mr. Promt's appointment to <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName> was not confirmed by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate, and he was called home. Perhaps neither the president nor
                    Mr. Promt expected the appointment to be confirmed. Mr. Promt served as
                    miniister from June 7, 1843, until August 10, 1844.</p>
            <p>Senator Thomas H. Benton of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, hated President Tyler and all his friends. He seems to have had a
                    special dislike for Mr. Promt, who was one of President Tyler's most
                    trusted lieutenants. It is probable that Mr. Proffit had in some of his speeches
                    exposed to ridicule some of Benton's weaknesses, as the
                    latter's ability, however great, was immeasurably exceeded by his
                    vanity. This sort of man always afforded Mr. Proffit an irresistible subject for
                    the exercise of his power of ridicule. Doubtless he had exercised this more than
                    once at Senator Benton's expense. In his <hi rend="i">Thirty
                        Years' View</hi>, Senator Benton makes an incorrect statement when
                    he says Mr. Proffit was not received by the emperor of <placeName>

                            talent and finished manners; and eminently fit for the place. It was
                            difficult to see in Mr. Proffit intended to supersede him, any cause for
                            his appointment except for his adhesion to Mr. Tyler.</p>

            <p>Thus, Senator Benton squared things after Mr. Proffit's death for all
                    the ridicule Mr. Proffit may have heaped upon him in his campaign speeches, but
                    he had no reason for saying that Mr. Promt was not received by the emperor. The
                    details of his formal reception were well known to a number of people at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Petersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> who were living twenty or thirty years ago and who heard Mr. Promt
                    describe the ceremony very minutely. They were greatly amazed that Mr. Promt (a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName> merchant) was not much embarassed in being presented to an emperor,
                    but Mr. Promt was as Bill Nye said of Benjamin Franklin: "To him a king
                    was no greater than a seven spot."</p>
            <p>That Mr. Promt was very prominent in congress for a young member, however, is
                    revealed occasionally through Senator Benton's work; for instance, in
                    writing of the attempt to pass the national bank bill, in 1841, when the measure
                    had been vetoed by Tyler, and the attempt was being made to pass it in the House
                    over the presidential veto (an attempt which was opposed by Mr. Proffit and in
                    which he was successful, since the effort failed) Benton says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It was disapproved and returned to the House with a message stating his
                            objections to it, where it gave rise to some violent speaking, more
                            directed to the personal conduct of the President than to the objections
                            to the bill stated in his message. In this debate Mr. Botts, of <placeName>

                            </placeName>, was the chief speaker on one side, inculpating the
                            President; Mr. Gilmer, of <placeName>

                            </placeName>, and Mr. Proffit, of Indiana, on the other were the chief

            <p>It is quite evident from Senator Benton's reference to it that this
                    debate was a very important one and attracted wide attention at the time. The
                    President still had a large number of powerful and very able friends in both
                    houses. The fact that Mr. Promt was put forward as one of the two chosen orators
                    and debaters to bear the brunt of the battle, selected from all the eloquent,
                    able, and brilliant men in the House who were still Tyler's friends, is
                    a tribute to his ability, that even his enemies could not ignore. Mr. Promt had
                    just passed his thirty-fourth birthday at the time of this debate. He was still
                    on his first term as a representative in congress.</p>
            <p>Senator Benton's reference to the fact that only eight senators voted to
                    confirm Mr. Promt's nomination as minister to <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName> contains nothing of reproach to Mr. Promt personally, since these
                    were the eight who stood by Tyler to the end. Caleb dishing received but two
                    votes, all the others in the senate being cast against approval of his
                    appointment to an important post. At that time there were only about fifty
                    members in the senate.</p>
            <p>Sydney George Fisher, a well known biographical writer, in his <hi rend="i">The
                        True Daniel Webster</hi> does not write very complimentary of Senator
                    Benton, but classes him as a man of distorted views.</p>
            <p>Evidently Mr. Promt had sufficient grounds for attacking Senator Benton, and he
                    did it while the senator was living. Senator Benton was a relay speaker in the
                    long debates between Senator Hayne and Daniel Webster. Webster had to defeat
                    both of them and he did it with becoming grace and dignity. Here is a quotation
                    from one of Senator Benton's speeches: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Every canal and every road tending to draw the commerce of the western
                            states across the Alleghany Mountains is an injury to the people of the

                            </placeName> and make that their great city.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Benton was opposed to the great national road through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, etc. That was enough to destroy any community of interest between
                    him and Mr. Proffit, to say nothing of the senator's attempt to unite
                    the west with <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-018-1-038"/> the south. Senator
                    Benton's opinion of Mr. Proffit will not cause Mr. Proffit to lose any
                    friends.</p>
            <p>Naturally Mr. Proffit's adhesion to Tyler in the break with the Whig
                    party lost him many Whig friends locally and gained him few among the Democrats.
                    He was accused of deserting his party for the sake of office. Judge Foster, a
                    local Whig of great influence and prominence, always insisted that Mr. Proffit
                    had clung to Tyler with the expectation of receiving the appointment to <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>. At this day, this does not seem probable. Mr. Proffit seems to
                    have stood by Tyler from the very first when there could have been no immediate
                    hope or expectation of reward; and indeed no desire for such at the hands of the
                    President, since Mr. Proffit's ability would have brought almost any
                    office he may have desired within his reach, provided it was within the power of
                    his party to grant it. He was accused of having turned to be a Democrat, but as
                    he was not active after his return from <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, his health having failed, it is problematical just what his stand
                    would have been. It is unthinkable that having attained the heights when most
                    men are just beginning a career, he would have thrown all away for the sake of
                    an appointment of any kind when the highest places in the land were open to him.
                    It is probable that he conceived it to be his duty to stand by the President and
                    did so until he was gradually estranged from his party. He became involved to
                    such an extent. in the bitter personal quarrels that followed, and was so goaded
                    on, that he reached the point where he had to stand with Tyler to the end.</p>
            <p>Apparently Mr. Proffit had been well received in <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, and his recall home reminds us of the wisdom of old, "A
                    prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own
                    house." In 1841, when Mr. Proffit went over to the opposite party it
                    caused quite a disturbance among the Whigs in Indiana. He was not a
                    "Clay for President" man. In the Whig convention of May, 1844,
                    Mr. Clay was nominated, but he was defeated by the Democratic candidate, James
                    Knox Polk, of <placeName>

            <p>This was the campaign in which Mr. Proffit could not, or did not,
                    "strike for Henry Clay."</p>
            <p>The word W-H-I-G (We hope in God) is a time honored English term for those who
                    opposed power and upheld the cause of liberty. In America, many men, whose sons
                    became Republicans, took the name Whig when they felt it their mission or duty,
                    to oppose what they termed the tyranny ol Andrew Jackson. Abraham Lincoln, the
                    great Republican, and greater American, became a Republican by the Whig route.
                    One of the most tiresome notions of pioneer political days was that "a
                    statesman must remain perfectly consistent from childhood to old age and never
                    change his opinions." Even unto this day some people hold to this
                    theory, not only in politics but in many other things. Such a doctrine is
                    usually an enemy to progress, since it practically rules out the intelligence
                    and the conscience of a candidate for office.</p>
            <p>Many pioneers who came from the south, soon became prominent forensic orators.
                    They did not always possess qualities essential in great lawyers, or deep
                    thinkers, but they were effective as public speakers on the political issues of
                    the day. From the Pocket the easy way to the open door of the world was by
                    whiskey, the rivers, and politics. When our local pioneers spoke of
                    "going to town," they meant to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Not a few of our early statesmen came here from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, and much early business was transacted at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was our early market, and thereby much Mexican silver was
                    brought to Indiana. Strange as it may seem, the Mexican dollar constituted the
                    larger part of the coin of the pioneers in 1837.</p>
            <p>Mr. Proffit was a man of ability and of serene soul. He was endowed with a
                    delightfully joyous nature. He radiated good cheer and did not live by his hates
                    alone. He was one of the best citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName>. American born with American ideals, he cherished
                    America's traditions and honor. In the twilight of local history he
                    represented the noblest ideals of local American life. All his short years were
                    devoted to <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-018-1-040"/> serving the best interests of his
                    country and the local people. To every worthy movement he gave his encouragement
                    and support. How full is that page in the early history of Indiana when Mr.
                    Proffit was an orator! He had an air of confidence, success, and gaiety. His
                    features were sharply cut, refined, and delicate. The biography of this man is a
                    pioneer history of his district, a measuring-rod of pioneer politics and Hoosier
                    progress in southern Indiana. His name added not only a dignity and a spirit,
                    but also an orator to the political influence in the Pocket. Perhaps after all,
                    "the proper study of mankind is man."</p>
            <p>Some pioneers could be referred to as men of dress, judging from the records left
                    by them. In 1831, the law provided that the stocks of Indiana militia men had to
                    be made of black leather or silk. Among articles stolen from Andrew Porter,
                    owner of a boat in 1821, two miles below the mouth of Deer creek in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry county</region>
                    </placeName>, were "a close-bodied black broadcloth coat with a black
                    velvet collar, a gold watch (cased as a hunting watch) and a yellow silk
                    handkerchief"–fairly good evidence of some style.
                    "Silk Shirt," a warrior of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> tribe of Indians lost several horses at an Indian encampment near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1820. He advertised for their recovery in the <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi>, June 24, 1820. If his mother followed the traditional
                    method in naming him, some settlers must have been wearing silk shirts at least
                    a generation before Mr. Proffit put in his appearance in southern Indiana. Even
                    in those days a voter could do what a candidate or a public official could
                    hardly afford to do.</p>
            <p>In the decade of the thirties men were far more particular about their personal
                    appearance than they are at present. In an advertisement at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1836, are these items: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Silk velvet, marseilles, and Valencia vestings; Italian silk cravats;
                            silk and linen handkerchiefs; gentlemen's silk, linen, cotton,
                            horseskin and beaver gloves; silk half-hose, silk and satin vests, silk
                            hats, etc.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In 1840, a well dressed gentleman wore blue broadcloth with plated gold buttons,
                    a buff vest, and a high hat.</p>
            <p>Mr. Proffit was never at a loss in the social duties of his day. By his friends
                    he was considered one of the finest gentlemen in Indiana, while those not his
                    friends, or not in sympathy <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-018-1-041"/> with his
                    political ideas, were inclined to say he was
                    "high-falutin"–a pioneer expression for
                    well-mannered or perhaps aristocratic people. Well may we take our hats off to
                    the ghost of any pioneer politician who escaped severe criticism. In the decade
                    of the thirties Governor Noah Noble was a very polished man. In the decade of
                    the forties, James Whitcomb, a Democratic nominee and a very polished man,
                    became governor; so we see Mr. Proffit was in his class with good manners. In
                    retrospect, we look in the mirror of history and biography, with pardonable
                    pride and pleasure upon this pioneer orator of the Pocket and perhaps wonder why
                    he came to southern Indiana. In his day thousands of flat boats, loaded with the
                    products of the <geogName>Wabash valley</geogName>, reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> annually. Perhaps he came north to make his mark, or his fortune,
                    for the same reason that hundreds of young Hoosiers went west fifty years ago.
                    It would seem that of Mr. Proffit no citizen of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName> could think without pleasure or speak without praise. If there are
                    to be any paintings on the walls of the new temple of justice in that county
                    paintings of Mr. Proffit, Mr. Foster, The Old Fort, The Buffalo Trail, and
                    Abraham Lincoln moving to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, should find appropriate places. It would help local history
                    throughout all of southern Indiana. If I were a citizen of <placeName>

                    of the first brick court house in the county, in the year 1834. This would
                    indicate that he was a man of means or good credit, when he was yet very young.
                    Mr. Simon Morgan, a grandson of Mr. Proffit, has an oil painting of Mr. Proffit.
                    Not many pioneers of Mr. Proffit's day were financially able to sit for
                    an oil painting though ever so crude.</p>
            <p>Along the vista of a century of local history there are high points and bright
                    lights. Mr. Proffit was a bright light in the wilderness of southern Indiana. He
                    was qualified by inherited aptitude, training, and education to be an orator,
                    and a leader of men. In 1836, General Harrison received 165 votes in <placeName>

                    which the town now covers. In addition to this he owned seven lots in the town

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His personal estate was undoubtedly very large <pb n="41" id="VAA4025-018-1-043"/> for that day, since the settlement of other estates
                    show payments of interest, debts, etc., to Mr. Proffit. Mr. Proffit left as his
                    only heirs his wife and Emily; the latter married Good-let <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan</region>
                    </placeName> a few months after her father's death and the estate was
                    settled out of court; that is, the personal estate was so disposed of. Mrs.
                    Proffit shared in Mr. Profit's estate under Indiana's first
                    constitution when a widow's estate was not under the more liberal laws
                    that appeared later through the efforts of Robert Dale Owen in behalf of the
                    women of Indiana.</p>
            <p>At the time of his death Mr. Proffit was one of the wealthiest men in this
                    section of Indiana. This was accumulated in the few years he was in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Pike county</region>
                    </placeName>. He owned good property in the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The property he owned at the time of his death would now be worth
                    a handsome fortune. Most of this was made in mercantile business and in trading
                    in land, although he did not hesitate to "take a chance." As
                    an evidence of this it is well known that he wagered $5,000 on
                    Polk's election and won the money. It was not regarded as any
                    "surething" either, owing to the great popularity of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Proffit would also bet on a horse race, or back his judgment
                    on a dog or cock fight. This sporting inclination was one of the secrets of his
                    great popularity with the pioneers. He drank, as did most men of his day, but
                    rarely to excess. Notwithstanding the fact that he mixed freely with the people,
                    took part in their sports, and occasionally drank with them, he seems to have
                    had a manner that let them know that while he could do these things, he was,
                    after all, not really one of them. They had this feeling and seemed to have
                    respected him for it. He was, after all, a southerner, with the southern
                    man's class ideas.</p>
            <p>While there seems to be no record that Mr. Proffit was educated especially for
                    the law, he practiced that profession to a limited extent in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Petersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was unquestionably far above the average lawyer of that day in
                    ability and learning. However, the profession at that time did not offer great
                    prospects of financial return. The litigation was mostly trivial and small sums
                    only were involved. Goodlet Morgan, who married Miss Proffit, told the following
                    story about one of Mr. Proffit's experiences as a lawyer: <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-018-1-044"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mr. Proffit was engaged to prosecute a small civil suit before a local
                            justice of the peace. The justice was a man of decided views on all
                            subjects and one who made up his mind quickly. The evidence being in,
                            Mr. Proffit arose to make an argument for his client. The justice
                            promptly told him that it was useless to argue the case, that the
                            court's mind was made up and that he was going to decide the
                            case against Mr. Proffit's client. Mr. Proffit insisted on his
                            right to be heard until the court finally said: "Mr. Proffit,
                            the court has no objection to hearing you make a speech, but it is now
                            supper time, the evidence is in, and the court here and now decides the
                            case in favor of the defendent and against your client; the court will
                            be here at eight o'clock in the morning and so far as I am
                            concerned you may speak until sun-down and I will hear you. Court is
                            adjourned." Mr. Proffit, who was a man of violent temper, when
                            aroused, was making loud protests long after the justice had closed his
                            office and gone home to supper, but gradually the ludicrous side of the
                            matter dawned upon Mr. Proffit and he later enjoyed telling the story as
                            much as his hearers enjoyed listening to it.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Mary J. Taylor, of Petersburg, who was fifteen years old at the time of Mr.
                    Proffit's death, was one of the play-mates of his two daughters. She
                    was in the Proffit home countless times. She says that when in good health Mr.
                    Proffit weighed about one hundred ten pounds. He was a charming man about home,
                    of perfect manners and idolized his family. He was gone much of the time and on
                    the occasion of his return his wife and daughters always gave a
                    "party" to celebrate the event to which the young folks, and
                    especially the friends of the girls, were invited. On these occasions Mr.
                    Proffit was always at his best, kept the girls in a high state of delight with
                    tales of his experiences as member of the legislature, member of congress, and
                    minister to <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>. His house was well furnished for that day. The entertainments
                    given were always a source of pleasure to the young. Mr. Proffit took special
                    pains to entertain the girl friends of his daughters, and soon made them feel
                    perfectly at ease in his presence. Mrs. Taylor remembers him thus as one of the
                    most charming men she ever saw. Mrs. Taylor also remembers his wife. She was
                    Miss Mahala Wyatt, daughter of John Turner Wyatt, a prosperous farmer of near
                    Petersburg, and was reputed to be the most beautiful girl of her day in this
                    section of the country. Her father lived on the road from Petersburg to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it was on one of his trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> that Mr. Proffit first saw her. She retained her beauty almost to
                        <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-018-1-045"/> the day of her death, which occurred
                    long after that of her distinguished husband. She had none of the education that
                    distinguished Mr. Proffit; yet for her he always manifested the strongest
                    affection. One of Mrs. Taylor's most vivid recollections of him is his
                    devotion to his wife and daughters. The daughters also had much of their
                    mother's beauty.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately Mrs. Taylor remembers little of the political life of that day. She
                    never attended a political meeting at which Mr. Proffit spoke, and says that
                    girls of her age, as a rule, did not attend political meetings in those days.
                    She does not remember exactly the way Mr. Proffit was brought home after his
                    death at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but thinks it was overland on the old Buffalo trail to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She distinctly remembers his death and says that the death of
                    Abraham Lincoln was the only other occurrence of the kind that ever caused so
                    much excitement in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Petersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> and vicinity. It seems that it was wholly unlooked for and
                    unexpected by the majority of people and even by his family. She naively remarks
                    that Mr. Proffit was regarded here as being almost as great as a president.</p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Proffit were the parents of two daughters, Emily, who became the
                    wife of the Hon. Goodlet Morgan, and Amanda, who died at the age of nine years
                    and six months. All the members of the family are buried at <geogName>Walnut

            <p>On February 1, 1848, an act of the General Assembly was approved which named

            <p>Some years after the death of Mr. Proffit his widow became the wife of John B.

            <p>We may not have measured this man correctly, or have visualized him properly. We
                    have tried to make national facts shine through the surface annals of local
                    history and through the data of biography; and, to show the reasons for any
                    action or position Mr. Proffit took. Perhaps there are no hues so soft and
                    delicate as those with which the imagination invests that which is unseen or
                    only faintly seen, particularly so, <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-018-1-046"/> when one
                    takes no delight in being an iconoclast. Remoteness in time may have an
                    idealizing effect. The voice that comes from the dim chambers of the past may
                    have a subdued, softening influence, for it is a good practice to write the
                    shortcomings of men of the past upon the sands of the sea shore, if they must be
                    written at all, and let the waves wash them away. It seems almost as difficult
                    to say anything new of the old days as it is to say anything old of the new
                    days. If you doubt this, try it.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, we may as well recognize, that democracy places a heavier burden
                    on individuals than do many other forms of government; for that reason every
                    citizen of our form of government should know his local, state, and national
                    history; for, after all, history, like charity, should begin at home. Biography
                    is history with a soul. He who knows his history well, does not find much
                    trouble in judging where America should have stood in the World War, or where
                    she should stand now. It is unsafe for a state to produce ignorant men and
                    indifferent women. None should be ignorant of, or indifferent to, the high aims
                    and ambitions of America.</p>
            <p>Let us rake "embers out of the ashes of the past," and fan them
                    into a blaze to illuminate the present and throw a headlight into the future.
                    There are many embers of unsullied fame in southern Indiana. Shall they shine?
                    There were many good men during the mid-years of the nineteenth century whose
                    biographies we should compile for the help they may be to the future historian.
                    Old documents and papers taken from the blurred and scattered records of a
                    countryside, are often rich in a subdued splendor of historical data and human
                    interest.</p>
            <p>The power of this nation was made up, in part, by the generations of the past,
                    whose bodily forms long ago crumbled into dust beneath the bramble and the briar
                    of neglected burial grounds; but whose sentiments, spirits, and impulses move
                    on. Woodrow Wilson says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The history of a nation is only the history of its villages written
                            large. Local history is the ultimate substance of national history.</p>

            <p>Poets, painters, and peers have pictured the passing pioneers in pleasing poetry
                    and polite prose; why can not we <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-018-1-047"/> ordinary
                    mortals try it? History mellows with age, and historians themselves soften in
                    their interpretations of men and of conduct. Some pioneers were leaders, great
                    local historical figures, whom their grandchildren may well study, analyze, and
                    admire. May the time soon come when the names of our pioneers will shine with
                    the reward that justly belongs to them; however, the illumination of the past
                    will not serve its best purpose unless its rays are able to penetrate into the
                    present and to bestow guidance and confidence for the future. Often a generation
                    will place an erroneous judgment upon contemporaneous men and events, and time
                    only will correct the injustice.</p>
            <p>Mr. Proffit's life was all too short, being only forty years to a day.
                    He died too young, but most men die at the wrong time. His political career is a
                    wonderful record of brilliant achievements, successes, and, in time,
                    adversities. In fewer than twenty years he advanced from bartering indigo for
                    mink skins at <placeName>

                    American empire at Rio de Janeiro, on the shores of the sea. It recalls to mind
                    the lines of the poet: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p> It may be said of Mr. Proffit, and of each of the other Hoosier pioneers
                    mentioned in this sketch: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            conscious tear, And, pointing, say, 'There sleeps a

            <p>We have accomplished our purpose if we have, for a short time brought back the
                    pioneers to the very few yet living who knew them and have given some slight
                    basis for appreciation by those who knew them not.</p>

                    <hi rend="b">INTRODUCTION</hi>
                </p>
            <p>This study of the Know Nothing party was undertaken at the suggestion of Dr.
                    Logan Esarey at Indiana university. One of the most powerful movements in our
                    political history has received comparatively little attention from historians.
                    This may be due to two causes: first, it disappeared as suddenly and silently as
                    it arose, apparently having had but little permanent effect on our politics or
                    institutions; and second, the traces it left were few.</p>
            <p>It is a difficult task to write the history of a secret society from the reports
                    which become public. The newspapers of the time were full of Know Nothing news,
                    but it was the opponents of the order who were so anxious to publish anything
                    they could learn about it. Those who were favorable were pledged to secrecy and
                    pretended to know nothing at all about the organization. The result of this
                    situation is that the Know Nothings must be studied in a great measure from the
                    reports of their enemies.</p>
            <p>The records of the various councils would have been the best source, but they
                    seem in practically every instance to have been destroyed when the council
                    disbanded. It has been impossible to gain access to the private papers of Col.
                    Richard W. Thompson and other leaders of the party. Until these become
                    available, we will have to be content with the information that newspapers and
                    contemporary political literature can give.</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> divides itself naturally into three periods. Until 1845 it was a
                    local movement confined largely to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York city</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1845 it entered the field of national politics, but died out
                    within a few years. Revived under the auspices of the Know Nothing order it
                    became national in 1854, but again after a brief existence it was stifled by the
                    intrusion of a larger issue. It is with the last phase of the movement that this
                    paper is concerned, but for a proper understanding of the subject a brief survey
                    of early nativism is necessary.</p>
            <p>Hostility to foreigners and Catholics dates back to colonial days, but as there
                    were few Catholics in the country and immigration was so small as to be almost
                    negligible, the opposition <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-018-1-050"/> was based upon
                    theory, rather than upon some ever present danger. After the Revolution a small
                    but steady inflow of Irish Catholics began, most of whom settled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York city</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1786 the first Catholic congregation was organized there, the
                    members of which were mostly Irish, who, to the number of several thousand, were
                    settled in one district, forming a community noticeably apart from the native
                    born citizens.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> They soon became a factor in local politics.</p>
            <p>The naturalization question divided the first political parties. The Federalists
                    were strongly anti-alien. The first naturalization law, approved March 26, 1790,
                    required only two years' residence in this country. A few years
                    afterwards the Federalists extended the time to five years and in 1798 to
                    fourteen years. The Democratic party on the other hand was very favorable to
                    foreigners; in fact, it contained a very large element of naturalized citizens.
                    When the Federalists were overthrown in 1800 the naturalization period was
                    promptly reduced to five years (1802).<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>The earliest exhibition of hostility toward Catholics came on Christmas eve,

                    </placeName> a city watchman who attempted to interfere was killed by an
                    Irishman. Only the arrival of the authorities prevented a general sack of the
                    homes of the Irish Catholics.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> This isolated incident shows
                    how early there existed an antagonism directed against them. The next spring,
                    when some assemblymen were to be chosen, an "American ticket"
                    was put forward, the first attempt at a Native American organization.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> This ticket did not prove to be successful.</p>
            <p>For several years there was no further manifestation of the latent nativist
                    sentiment, but all the time the Catholic population became more and more
                    numerous until by 1826 they numbered twenty-five thousand in <placeName>

                    resulted in the first-great attempt at organization. In 1834 a series of twelve

                    a recent visit to Europe, had learned of the existence of the Leopold
                    Foundation, a Catholic organization intended to promote church expansion in
                    America. As the letters of "Brutus" voiced an alarm felt by
                    many, steps were taken toward the formation of an organization, which in July of
                    1835 received the name of the Native American Democratic Association. The
                    principles of the movement, as declared in its platform, were: opposition to
                    office holding by foreigners, to pauper and criminal immigration and to the
                    Catholic church on the ground that that church was a political machine.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> For the November elections of that year, 1835, the Whigs
                    united with the new movement, beginning an alliance that was to last throughout
                    the career of nativism in the state. But their combined forces were defeated.
                    The next spring Samuel F. B. Morse ran for mayor, unsupported by the Whigs, and
                    polled about fifteen hundred votes.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In 1837 Aaron Clark,
                    supported by a combination of natives and Whigs, was elected by a plurality of
                    three thousand three hundred, together with a common council of the same
                    politics. But the nativist movement was ruined by the fusion, and absorbed by
                    the Whigs in the hour of victory.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>The passing of the Native American party left the field open for a new factor in
                    American politics, the secret political society. There were many of these
                    associations, but two stand out above all others in importance, namely, the
                    Order of United Americans, commonly called the O. U. A., and the Order of the
                    Star Spangled Banner, the Know Nothing order.</p>
            <p>Of these the Order of United Americans was the first in the field. It was

                        <settlement type="city">New York city</settlement>
                    </placeName>, December 21, 1844, and adopted the weapon of secrecy.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Expansion was slow but steady. By 1850 chapters were

                    society, with no program of political conduct. The secrecy extended only to the
                    signs and ceremonies connected with its work. There was a uniform ritual for all
                    chapters, but there were no degrees.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> In government, the
                    chapters or local organizations were grouped into a State Chancery, which was
                    the legislative head, consisting of three delegates from each chapter. The
                    Arch-Chancery, in turn, was the national legislative head, consisting of three
                    delegates from each State Chancery. The presiding officer in each chapter was
                    called the Sachem. The 0. U. A. was thrown into the (background by the rise of
                    the Know Nothing order. It reached its height of prosperity in 1855, when it was
                    represented in sixteen states. After that date it declined rapidly.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    of Bereans, and the American Protestant Association, were founded by
                    "Orangemen," protestant Irish whose antipathy to the Catholics
                    exceeded, if possible, that of the native born Americans.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>The Order of the Star Spangled Banner, or Order of the Sons of the Sires of
                    '76, was conceived and planned by Charles B. Allen of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, who had never been associated with any of the other nativist
                    societies. As early as 1849, he prepared his plan, but did not begin his work
                    until the next year. Drawing a little group about him, he formed a secret
                    organization whose qualifications for membership were far more restrictive than
                    the 0. U. A. Secrecy was specific and stringent. The plan of action was to
                    control, rather than to make nominations, by concerted action in favor of such
                    nominees of other political parties as might be agreed upon. It cost nothing to
                    acquire and hold membership. At first there was no stated place of meeting. A
                    private home or lodge room might be used.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After two years the little group numbered scarcely thirty. Then, under new
                    leaders, steps to increase the membership were taken, and a thousand new members
                    were secured in four months. Regular weekly meetings were instituted. This
                    reorganization took place in April, 1852.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> All this time
                    the existence of such an organization was entirely unknown to the general
                    public. In the local elections of 1852 and still more in 1853 it was able to
                    take a decided stand. Then, in the latter year, its existence first became
                        known<hi rend="sup">28</hi> and for lack of a better name was dubbed the
                    "Know Nothing Order" and under that name the Order of the Star
                    Spangled Banner continued its career.</p>
            <p>A revival of nativism came in the years 1853-54. The story of the imprisonment of
                    the Madiai family in Tuscany for reading the Protestant Bible, it was said,
                    roused the horror <list type="footnotes">

                    Catholic bishops were said to be attacking the American non-sectarian school
                    system. In 1853 Father Alessandro Gavazzi, a priest and revolutionary, came to
                    America for the purpose of agitating against the Catholic church. He was
                    received in the same manner as Kossuth. On October 29-30 he spoke in <placeName>

                    of the horrors of the Inquisition.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> At the same time, the

                        feeling.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> The thought that the ambassador of a foreign

            <p>The Know Nothing Order, taking advantage of these circumstances, realized its
                    ambition of becoming national. A system of national, state and local councils
                    was adopted and other arrangements for a widespread and numerous

            <p>The Know Nothing question held a leading place of interest in the newspapers of
                    the time. Editors favorable to the movement, although they invariably denied all
                    connection with the organization, commented with obvious pleasure upon its
                    vigorous and rapid progress. The "old line" Democratic
                    editors, fearing the approach of this new secret political association that had
                    already become such a powerful factor in the east, printed anything that tended
                    to discredit the movement or to expose its proceedings.</p>
            <p>The name of no man of prominence is connected with the extension of the order
                    over the state. The work was accomplished by obscure men. Not many politicians
                    were willing to identify themselves with such a movement while it was in its
                    infancy, although they were willing enough to make use of it when its political
                    strength began to be revealed. Judge William J. Peaslee, president of the
                    council at Shelbyville, was actively engaged during the spring and summer of

            <p>A brief survey of the political situation in Indiana in 1854 here becomes
                    necessary. Parties were in a state of flux. The Whigs, as an organization, had
                    practically ceased to exist after their disastrous campaign of 1852. They had
                    largely drifted into the ranks of the Know Nothings. The Free Soil movement, at
                    its height in 1848, had had its vote cut in half in 1852, but still obtained
                    strong support in central and northern Indiana. The radical Abolitionists were a
                    mere handful, but, because of their activity, they exercised an influence far
                    out of proportion to their numbers. The "<placeName>

            <p>This same situation existed throughout the north. These diverse elements of the
                    opposition united for the campaign of 1854 in nearly all the northern states.
                    This movement marks the birth of the Republican party, although in 1854 it
                    received that name in but a few states. In other states fusion tickets known as

                    common ground of enmity to the further expansion of the slave power.</p>
            <p>In Indiana as elsewhere there was a movement for a Fusion or People's
                    party. The Know Nothings, perhaps the strongest of all the elements of the
                    opposition but not strong enough to run a ticket of their own, determined to act
                    with the Fusionists, to control the whole movement and to direct it in their own
                    interests. In this they were merely following the usage of their brethren in the
                    eastern states when the party was weak there. As a result their program was
                    carried out with astonishing success, for during the entire canvass of 1854 the
                    invisible machinery of Know Nothingism governed the Fusion
                    movement–its nominations, its active organization and its
                        campaign.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A state convention was called for July 13, 1854, by the Fusionists to meet in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for the purpose of uniting on a common People's ticket.
                    The Know Nothings, now that a sufficient number of councils had been organized
                    to hold a state council, secretly decided to hold their state convention at the
                    same place on July 11-12.<hi rend="sup">1T</hi> Their next step was to secure
                    control of the election of delegates to the Fusion convention. In this they
                    succeeded. Probably three-fourths of the Fusion delegates chosen were Know
                        Nothings.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> The men thus openly elected to the Fusion
                    convention were then secretly nominated by the Know Nothing county councils to
                    their own convention. Thus it happened that the members of the state council
                    secured control of the People's convention.</p>

            <p>To the believers in the conspiracy theory, the opposition of the Know Nothings to

            <p>But Know Nothingism in Indiana did not quite conform to this theoretical
                    non-committal position. In the councils of central and northern Indiana, both
                    the leaders and the rank and file were men with strong opinions on the slavery
                    question. Only in the southern portion were the "national"
                    Know Nothings in a majority. Thus in 1854 the state organization was controlled
                    by men with free-soil views. Throughout its brief history the fortunes of the
                    Know Nothing movement in Indiana were largely determined by its relations with

                            resulted in the following: (Here follows what was called the

                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>–a county council, hence similar proceedings must have
                    been transpiring in the subordinate councils all over the county. Next a special
                    meeting was called to hear the report of these delegates, which embodied as the
                    result of the main action of the county council the precise ticket, with slight

            <p>It was natural that a bitter enmity should be aroused between the Know Nothings
                    and the lower class of foreigners and Catholics in the country. Unscrupulous
                    politicians courting the support of that vote told the foreigners that the Know
                    Nothings wished to disfranchise all foreigners and either kill or drive them out
                    of the country. Taking this literally many Germans and Irish went armed. There

                    opinions to go near them, for they held a bitter hatred against the Know
                    Nothings. To intimate that any one was a Know Nothing was sufficient to set the
                    Irish on them in all their fury. Riots and assaults on individuals were
                        common.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> The Germans of <placeName>

                    claim but it cannot be greatly exaggerated. There were councils in practically

            <p>It was certain that "Sam" was very active on the day of the
                    election, but it was not until the returns came in that it was discovered just
                    how successful he had been. Although the Know Nothings had nowhere openly run
                    tickets of their own, the thorough manner in which they controlled, almost
                    monopolized, the People's movement was now so well known that its
                    victories were reported indiscriminately as Fusion, or Know Nothing successes.
                    Nine out of the eleven Fusion candidates for congress were elected,<hi rend="sup">82</hi> of whom every one with the possible exception of George
                    G. Dunn in the Third district were Know Nothings.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> George

                    congress by Know Nothing support. In but two rockribbed Democratic districts,
                    the first and the second, were the Old Liners successful, where Smith Miller and
                    William H. English were re-elected. The Indiana delegation in the existing
                    congress consisted of ten Democrats and one Whig.</p>

            <p>Aside from the revision of the ritual,<hi rend="sup">105</hi> and the oaths of
                    the old degrees, the most notable news that came to the knowledge of the outside
                    world was the adoption of the new third or "Union" degree.
                    This degree was proposed by Kenneth Rayner, who, although a slaveholder and a
                    believer in Southern rights, was intensely national in his sympathies. Unfolding
                    his plan before the convention, it was received with great enthusiasm, and when
                    a committee, of which he was chairman, reported the new degree with its oath, it
                    was adopted by a nearly unanimous vote. The degree was conferred by Mr. Rayner
                    on all the delegates present. It bound each member under solemn pledges to
                    adhere to, defend, and maintain the union of the states against all assaults
                    from every quarter without any limitations whatsoever. The recipients of this
                    degree were welcomed into the brotherhood of the "Order of the American
                    Union." Within six months a million and a half of men had taken the
                        degree.<hi rend="sup">106</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the origin of the famous <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> degree. After the adjournment of the convention, November 25, and
                    the news of its work became known, a bitter protest came from the anti-slavery
                    men. They felt that they had been sacrificed in order to gratify the demands of
                    the pro-slavery wing.<hi rend="sup">107</hi> In form the new oath merely
                    affected to condemn any and all attempts to disrupt the nation, a sentiment to
                    which no American could object. But in fact it gave the conservative and
                    pro-slavery element a means of suppressing the anti-slavery agitation by using
                    the discipline of the order against its advocates.<hi rend="sup">108</hi> The
                    immediate result in the north was the disbandment of many councils, and the
                    withdrawal of many members of anti-slavery sentiments.<hi rend="sup">109</hi>
                    Yet there can be no doubt that the motive of the men originating the degree was
                    pure, and there is no ground to support the "conspiracy"
                    theory of the northern radicals, who held that the third degree was a virtual
                    pro-slavery obligation.<hi rend="sup">110</hi> This move to <list type="footnotes">

                    rapidity with which it spread, the secrecy which enveloped its action, and the
                    phenomenal success that it achieved, made it the most powerful political
                    organization of its day. But already it had reached its zenith. Coinciding with
                    its period of expansion, those disruptive factors appeared which were soon to
                    wreck and ruin it. The intrusion of the slavery issue and the contest with
                    sectionalism will be the subject of a further chapter.</p>

                </p>
            <p>According to the Morrison and Sharpies <hi rend="i">History of the Kimball
                        Family</hi>,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> the first Kimballs to come to America
                    sailed from Ipswich, <placeName>

                  <settlement type="city">Rattlesden</settlement>, <region type="county">Suffold
                    county</region>
               </placeName>, where they belonged to a middle class and not very
                    numerous family. The name there was spelled in various ways such as Kemball,
                    Kemble, Kimbal, Kimbel or even Kymbold. The claim is made that the last
                    mentioned form was the original one.</p>
            <p>There were two men from this family on the
                    "Elizabeth"– Henry Kemball and Richard Kimball.
                    They may or may not have been brothers. There is nothing to suggest that they
                    were related in any way beyond the similarity of their names and the fact that
                    they came to America on the same vessel. Henry Kemball has but few descendants,
                    but Richard has many. Most of the Kimballs in America are in his line. He had
                    eleven children and they all married and left issue but one, and even that one
                    may have married, although no record to such effect has ever been found.</p>
            <p>Richard was a wheelwright, and settled first in Water-town, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, moving later to Ipswich, where he spent the remainder of his life,
                    dying June 22,1675. He was prominent and respected in Ipswich. Indeed, he moved
                    there at the invitation of the people of the community, who were in need of a
                    competent man to act as wheelwright. The town granted him a house lot, forty
                    acres of land and liberty to "pasture two cows free."</p>
            <p>The Kimball family has always been distinguished for general shrewdness and
                    practical ability rather than for purely intellectual leadership. Few of the
                    name have ever been noted politically, professionally or in letters. Kimbals
                    have figured largely as capable and reliable men and women in the <list type="footnotes">

                    Richard and his sons, have frequently been placed in positions of trust in the
                    town and church governments of the places in which they lived. They have always
                    been strongly represented in business, and there they are uniformly successful.
                    Until recently, not many of them were rich, although generally they were in
                    comfortable circumstances. Now many of the name are wealthy.</p>
            <p>Although clearly a peace-loving people, the Kimballs have always shown themselves
                    to be public-spirited and patriotic, and willing to fight when necessary. The
                    name Kimball is found often in the Revolutionary war rolls; and in the War of
                    1812 and in the Civil war, Kimballs again played their part. In the latter war,
                    some of the name gained prominence.</p>

            <p>While working on the life history of Jesse Kimball, pioneer settler in
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> and Indiana, it has
                    been brought strongly to mind that a man rarely goes through life without
                    leaving a trail by which he may be traced. Oftentimes the trail is obscure and
                    all but lost, but it exists, nevertheless. Old letters, deeds to property,
                    wills, mortgages, records of lawsuits, and all such papers–to say
                    nothing of family Tbibles and family traditions aid the persistent searcher,
                    frequently in a surprising manner.</p>
            <p>In the case of Jesse Kimball the lack of authoritative information concerning his
                    life activities constituted a great handicap at the outset. Two very important
                    sources of information, however, became available early in the
                    search– his family bible? and his pension application. In each of
                    these he stated that he was born on March 19, 1760, in Preston, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>. Unfortunately, no mention of his birth can be found in the Preston
                    town records.</p>

                                                Hell gate (as it was then called) and settled in the
                                                interior of the state on the Catskills.</p>
                                 <p>My father was too young to be in the Revolutionary
                                                war, but his two older brothers &amp; his father
                                                were. At the close of the war one of them received a

                                                brought my father out to the new country. We came

                                                we stayed for 7 years.</p>
                                 <p>I cannot tell the year, but it was after the
                                                earthquakes (the earthquakes were in 1811-12) that

                                 <salute>Dear Nephew–</salute>
                                 <p>84 years ago I first peeped out from the top of
                                                  <geogName>Catskill mountain</geogName> on this
                                                beautiful world covered 4 ft. deep with snow. We
                                                moved to Onterio Co. when I was three years old,
                                                &amp; from there to Indiana when I was 8 years
                                                old &amp; to the lower part of that state when I
                                                was 15 years old. After staying there two years,
                                                when 17 years old I started on foot for <placeName>
                                                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                                </placeName>, which I made in one week, waiding some
                                                &amp; swimming some streams; no railroads then.
                                                I Have ever been glad of this movement. I had at
                                                that time but little or no knowledge of the
                                                christian religion but I had a desire to get into
                                                better associations than I found at Cynthianna,
                                                (Indiana).</p>

                                 <salute>My dear nephew–</salute>
                                 <p>You wish me to write what I know about our ancestry.
                                                Well, my grand father John Kimball was the great,
                                                great, great grandson of Adam, the first, the
                                                intermediates I do not recollect, because I never
                                                collected them. My Grandfather married a woman by
                                                the name of Sandos, or Sandors,– She was
                                                some 3 years older than he &amp; died about that
                                                long before him, which events both occured at your
                                                grandfather Jesse's, (where also your own
                                                father was buried). My father was the youngest of 3
                                                sons, &amp; my Aunt Mary the youngest of 13
                                                sisters, 16 in all, the boys names were Samuel,
                                                Jesse &amp; Isaac, the girls names were
                                                Thankful, Prudence, Olive, Mary and the rest of
                                                their names I do not know. My mother's name
                                                was Sarah Warner. I have no knowledge of my
                                                mother's relations but I see a good many of
                                                that name from the eastern states where she was
                                                born. My grandfather and his 2 older sons served in
                                                the Revolutionary war, my own father being too
                                                young. Tour grandfather's bounty land fell
                                                to him in Henderson Co. <placeName>

                                                </placeName> &amp; that is what brought so many
                                                of the Kimball family out to the western country. A

                    accompanied as it was by the names of Jesse's brothers and some of his
                    sisters, made it possible to establish the connection between his family and the
                    other branches of the Kimball family in <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Upon following in the Kimball history the line through which Jesse seems to have
                    descended, we find that among the sons of the immigrant Richard (1), was one
                    named John (2). He was born in Rattlesden, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, in 1631, and came to America with his parents. He spent his life
                    in Ipswich, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, and died there May 6, 1698. By trade he was a wheelwright, as his
                    father, Richard, had been, but by occupation he seems to have been an extensive
                    farmer also. He frequently bought and sold land, and there are a large number of
                    deeds on record at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>,
                    bearing his name. He married Mary Bradstreet, whose parents had come over in the
                    ship "Elizabeth" when the Kimballs came. He had thirteen
                    cheldren. His ninth child was named John (3).</p>
            <p>This John (3) was born March 16, 1668, in Ipswich. He became a wheelwright and a
                    farmer, and married Sarah Goodhue. He bought two hundred acres of land in
                    Preston, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, and moved there in 1727. He had nine children. Of these Isaac (4)
                    was the sixth.</p>
            <p>Isaac (4) was born April 19, 1705. He married Prudence Parke and lived much of
                    his life in Preston, where he received from his father, John Kimball (3),
                    October 11, 1736, on account of "love and good will," eighty
                    acres of land in that town. Isaac (4) made his will March 20, 1744, and left
                    half his property to his wife, Prudence, and the other half to his sons, John
                    (5), Isaac (5) and Jesse (5), they to have the whole on the death of his wife.
                    The Jesse (5) here mentioned was Captain Jesse of Canaan, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, whose Revolutionary war service and subsequent career is known.
                    John (5)∗ is assumed to be the father of Jesse (6), who is the
                    subject of this sketch.</p>

            <p>John (5) was born December 12, 1731. He married Ru-hama Sanders, of Lyme, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, September 21, 1752, and had a family consisting of three sons and,
                    it is said, thirteen daughters. The sons were Samuel (6), Jesse (6) and Isaac
                    (6). Of the daughters, Thankful (6), Prudence (6), Olive (6), Azuba (6), Silvia
                    (6), Amy (6), Margaret (6), and Mary (6) are known by name. Jesse (6) seems to
                    have been the second son. We know that Isaac (6) was the youngest, and it is
                    probable that Samuel (6) was the oldest.</p>
            <p>John Kimball (5) was a soldier in the Revolution. His son, Samuel (6), also saw

                    that the rolls containing the name of this particular Samuel were among the many
                    that suffered destruction during and after the Revolution. Nothing is known to

                            years or somewhere about that time. And about three months before his
                            time was out, he was taken with the measles and came home and I went and
                            served in his place. My captain's name was Captain Chapley and
                            I do not recollect my lieutenant's name, and I can recollect no

            <p>In an amendment to his pension declaration, Jesse stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>That by reason of old age and consequent loss of memory, he can not
                            recollect the precise time he served; but to the best of his knowledge,
                            it was three months. And he recollects that he got his discharge maybe
                            one months or shortly before the town of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New London</settlement>
                            </placeName> was burned, but he cannot recollect the day and dates.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>His uncertainty concerning dates is only too evident. His statements regarding
                    time are seldom more than approximations. It must be borne in mind, though, that
                    when he made his pension declaration, he was about eighty-seven years of age,
                    and the loss of memory of which he complains, was entirely natural.</p>
            <p>There are valid reasons for questioning the correctness of the date of his own
                    birth. For instance, he states in his declaration that he lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> sixteen or eighteen years before going to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName>. If his Revolutionary service terminated, as he says, shortly
                    before the burning of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New London</settlement>
                    </placeName>–which occurred in September, 1781–he would
                    then have been past twenty-one years of age, providing he was born in 1760, as
                    he says. Furthermore, among the children of John Kimball named in the records of
                    the town of Preston,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> is a daughter, Sylvia, who was born
                    November 15, 1759; and it is clear that if she is Jesse's sister,
                    either her birthday or Jesse's is incorrectly stated. Town records are
                    generally accepted as final authority in such cases, while an error regarding
                    the date of his birth might easily have found lodgment in Jesse's mind.
                    He may have been born later than 1760, and there is ground for suspecting that
                    such was the fact. Family tradition has it that his Revolutionary war service
                    was rendered when he was a mere boy, and this accords with his statement
                    limiting his residence in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> to sixteen or eighteen years. The record of his own birth in his
                    bible could easily be the least reliable entry in it, since it would be
                    dependent upon hearsay and not upon his own knowledge.</p>

            <p>The Captain Chapley referred to in his declaration was undoubtedly Captain Adam

                    assumption is sustained by the fact that before the Revolution ended, he

                    </placeName> law of that day. The evidence of Jesse's enrollment was in

                    The exact date of the enrollment cannot now be determined, since the document

            <p>There was a considerable migration from <placeName>

                    land in Canajoharie district for 270 pounds. On the same day he sold another
                    piece containing 213 acres for 340 pounds. The deed transferring this last piece
                    of property was acknowledged by him at Canajoharie on August 31, 1790. The

            <p>A diligent search of the war department records relating to the Indian wars
                    subsequent to the Revolution, fails to show any mention of Jesse Kimball. The

                    Buel's company of the 2nd regiment, the company in which Jesse would
                    have been. The early records of the war department are, however very incomplete,

                    his (St. Clair's) absence may be inferred from the statement in his

            <p>We may feel considerable certainty that Jesse had a part in the bearing of these

                    known to have been, we can picture him as an acceptable scout and messenger at
                    this critical time.</p>
            <p>The return of Captain Buel to the east, mentioned by Major Denny, was evidently
                    merely temporary since in 1792-93 Buel was in the 2nd Sub-Legion,<hi rend="sup">18</hi> a part of the organization formed by General Anthony Wayne when he
                    succeeded General St. Clair. Wayne conducted a successful campaign against the
                    Indians, a campaign that terminated in 1794 in the battle of Fallen Timbers. In
                    this conflict, the power of the Indians in the west was so broken that the peace
                    that followed endured for sixteen years. Jesse Kimball must have been with Buel
                    in this 2nd Sub-Legion.</p>
            <p>It has already been shown that Jesse was in Canajoharie as late as August 31,
                    1790–the date when he personally acknowledged his deed to property.
                    His family bible gives October 25, 1794, as the date of the birth of his first
                    child after his marriage to Elizabeth Roelofson. It would seem proper,
                    therefore, to assume that he came west with the 2nd infantry in 1791, and that
                    his three years of service covered 1791-92-93. He probably reached Henderson in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> late in 1793 or early in 1794.</p>
            <p>There is a well-authenticated family tradition to the effect that Jesse
                    contracted an unfortunate marriage before he came west, a marriage that
                    terminated in a divorce and his departure <list type="footnotes">

                    that time. The tradition concerning the divorce finds support in the record of

                    his wife and members of her family. The divorce, which its accompanying grief
                    and mortification, goes far toward explaining the somewhat surprising fact that
                    a man of his character and standing, as indicated by his real estate

                    have been made up, at that period, of a very disreputable element of the
                    community. The quality of many of the men is indicated by the following passage
                    from Maj. Denny's "Military Journal," dated Nov. 7,
                    1791: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                            name was Jesse Kimball. They were first cousins. (He)
                                            lived a long distance away. He and (she) had never met
                                            until he came to visit his uncle and family. It was a
                                            case of love at first sight, and in course of time they
                                            were married and lived happily together on what was
                                            later the Levi Jones place, and still later the Lydia
                                            Knowles place.</p>
                              <p>Aunt Sarah was the beauty, in her father's
                                            family. Her husband died and left her with the little
                                            boy Charles. Then she lived with her father and mother
                                            until in course of time she married Uncle Hullum.</p>
                              <p>Yes, grandfather was a Revolutionary soldier. He and Mr.
                                            Wyatt and another man, I can't quite call his
                                            name, all living in the vicinity of Owensville, <placeName>

                                            honors at celebrations on the 4th of July.</p>
                              <p>Grandfather had two sisters who I think lived with him,
                                            also his parents,– one Aunt Amy, the other
                                            Aunt Thankful.</p>
                              <p>I remember when I was a child, a lawyer came out from
                                            Bvansville and talked pension to
                                            grandfather,–talked of everything pertaining
                                            to it, and left. We never heard of it again. Grandpa
                                            never looked it up. He had plenty and was not grasping
                                            for more.</p>
                              <p>Yes, there was an unhappy marriage, and consequently a
                                            divorce. I do not know who the first wife was, or what
                                            state they lived in when married, but think it was In
                                            the far east.</p>

            <p>One of the problems connected with Jesse's life that long seemed

                    of the children named in his family bible. Recent discoveries have made it clear
                    that the marriage occurred in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the winter of 1793-94, soon after his arrival there.</p>
            <p>Family tradition pictures the wife as of Holland Dutch descent, fair,
                    ruddy-cheeked, stout, industrious, and "no taller than the back of a
                    splint-bottomed chair." The following account of her wedding journey,

                            people. Grandma said they, the children, would hide out when they would
                            see someone coming toward the house, as there would probably be
                            questions asked and they could neither speak nor understand our

                        <p>When Grandpa and she were married, the country was sparsely settled. The

                            know how far he went for her, but they had been married and were enroute
                            for his home on horseback, following a bridle path. It was very cold
                            weather. They traveled on and on, after nightfall, hoping to reach the
                            settlement. They were suffering much from cold but on they went. After
                            hours of solitary riding through deep lonely forests, they routed a
                            bunch of hogs from their hiding. They were suffering so terribly with

                            until morning to keep from freezing. Grandma said: "No I never
                            have slept in a hog bed. This shows we are nearing the settlement.
                            Let's press on." So they did, and after a time came in
                            sight of a house all aglow with light. They rode up and he called
                            out–when in an instant all was dark again. Grandpa called and
                            pleaded but there was no response. He said: "I know you
                            well," calling the man by name. But they (the occupants of the
                            house) were afraid of Indians as they would resort to such tricks to get
                            into houses and slaughter the inmates. He continued to plead and tell
                            them of circumstances, places and people which he and they were familiar
                            with. At last the lamps were cautiously lighted and they were invited in

            <p>A recent book by a genealogist who has devoted many years of research to the

                                other families, started overland across the 'great

                                the present city of Cheyenne, Ann Roelofson Scott died, June 20,
                                1852. She was sick but a few hours with what was known as
                                'plains cholera.' Around her lowly bed on the
                                ground in a shelter tent where she died, were her husband and nine
                                children, the youngest three years and six months old, the oldest
                                nineteen years. Her last words were: 'All is
                                well.' All was indeed well with her, but for her children,
                                what a calamity! A grave was made for her in the soft sandstone by
                                chiseling out a coffin-shaped vault. She was wrapped in cerements
                                and buried by the side of the trail, in a wilderness far from
                                civilization–without a coffin. The next morning the oxen
                                were yoked up and the caravan again started westward, her husband
                                and children with anguished hearts and fearsome glances backward to
                                the new-made grave."</p>

                            pounding it in a mortar; and at one time such was the difficulty with
                            which bread stuff was had, that Isaac's father bought some corn
                            at the mouth of <geogName>Green river</geogName>, at one dollar and
                            twenty-five cents per bushel, and conveyed it to his family in a perogue
                            or canoe. Indeed, the difficulties under which the first settlers of
                            that part of <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                            </placeName> labored, were almost insupportable.</p>
                        <p>For the security of the whites and their families, they were impelled to
                            build and resort to forts in as large bodies as their thinly settled
                            population would permit. Uniting their energies, they labored by turn in
                            each man's field, one or more, as necessity required, standing
                            as sentinel.</p>
                        <p>Seldom would anything short of abundant sign of Indian hostilities drive
                            them in the spring of the year, from their homely huts. It is, however,
                            perfectly within the recollection of the author of this narrative, that,
                            when a boy, he heard the report of a gun, which killed dead one of the
                            finest men in the settlement, and one, too, who lived within a few steps
                            of his father's door. Mr. Downs, who was thus shot by the
                            Indians, left a wife and seven children to lament his untimely death. He
                            was most cruelly used by the savage butchers, and left scalped on the
                            ground.</p>

            <p>The following extract from the journal of one B. Van Cleve, published in the <hi rend="i">American Pioneer</hi>, describes the social conditions at Red Banks
                    as they may have appeared to Jesse when he arrived there: <text>

                                    the oppressed, but for all the horse thieves, rogues and outlaws
                                    that have been able to effect their escape from justice in the
                                    neighboring states. Neither law nor gospel has been able to
                                    reach here as yet. A commission of the peace had been sent by <placeName>

                                    and insisted upon doing without. I inquired how they managed to
                                    marry, aand was told that the parties agreed to take each other
                                    for husband and wife before their friends.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>This description is far from flattering, and it is evident that the
                    writer's knowledge of Red Banks' society did not include the
                    whole population. The lawless element in such a <list type="footnotes">

                                house was yet erected–the rest of the families lived in
                                camps. In removing to this place, their property being conveyed by
                                water, except the stock, Isaac, then a boy about nine or ten years
                                of age, assisted in driving them. They at length arrived all in
                                safety, at the Red Banks, where even greater difficulties were
                                undergone by settlers, than had been endured by them at <placeName>
                                    <settlement type="city">Vienna</settlement>
                                </placeName>. Here, too, as at the former place, they cultivated the
                                soil in safety, only by means of sentinels. But these only secured
                                them from the attacks of red men. Greater fears were excited among
                                the quiet settlers, by the inhuman conduct of some white men,
                                Kuykendall, Ayers, Ashley, Howard, Cane, and the Masons, who seemed
                                to delight more in bloodshed and murder than in anything else. With
                                such men as these they were harrassed for some years, and no
                                man's life was considered secure, who was so unfortunate as
                                to incur their displeasure."</p>
                            <p>Isaac Knight was captured by Indians across the river from Red Banks,
                                April S, 1793. In the summer of 1795 he escaped and returned to <placeName>

                            <p>"After running some days, they landed at the mouth of Harden
                                Creek. Here Isaac met a young married woman, with whom he had gone
                                to school before he was taken by the Indians. They recognized each
                                other, and she informed him that his father and friends had removed
                                from the Red Banks to what was then, and is now called,
                                Knight's Falls, on <geogName>Green river</geogName>. He was
                                here advised to land at the Yellow Banks, which he did. Now we find
                                the weary, anxious little prisoner within thirty miles of his
                                father's dwelling.</p>
                            <p>From this place he started alone and afoot along a path some twelve

                            <p>Next morning the kindness of Mr. Vernado and one of his sons impelled
                                them to accompany Isaac, in a canoe, down <geogName>Green

                    conspicuous than the quieter residents, and it would be only natural for a
                    transient traveler to gain an unfavorable impression of the whole. It is
                    gratifying, however, to remember that Jesse's advent in Red Banks at
                    that time was not of his own volition. As is shown by his statements in his
                    pension application, he was on his way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> after receiving his discharge from the army at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, becoming stranded at Red Banks when the captain sold the boat on
                    which he was traveling. He must have been intending to take a ship at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> that would carry him back to his home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, for in commenting on the matter in his pension declaration, he
                    says, "And so I never got back to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, only on a visit." Had the captain not become frightened,
                    Jesse would doubtless have continued on his way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and this sketch would never have been written. During the ten
                    years or more that he lived in the vicinity of Red Banks law and order were
                    established. A county government was organized, and there were added to the
                    population men of high standing such as the naturalist, Audubon, and Gen. Samuel
                    Hopkins and his associates in the Henderson land company.</p>
            <p>The Roelofson family, including the families of the married sons and daughters,
                    must have formed a very appreciable part of the early population of Red Banks.
                    It is not known just how long they remained there. We do know that on April 8,
                    1793, while the family were living at Red Banks, Lawrence's grandson,
                    Isaac Knight, was captured by the Indians and carried far north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. After two and one-half years of captivity, he escaped and returned

                    </placeName> in the fall of 1795, to find that his people had left Red Banks and
                    were then living at a station on <geogName>Green river</geogName>. This station
                    was known as Knight's Falls, and was probably established by his
                    father, John Knight. It was in the northeastern part of the present county of
                    Henderson, at or near Spottsville, where Lock and Dam No. 1 on <geogName>Green
                        river</geogName> were afterward constructed.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    he allied himself with them through his marriage to Elizabeth. There is valid
                    ground, however, for inferring that he did so, and that he remained with them
                    for a brief time.</p>

                    made at about this time, and his wife, Elizabeth, and the eldest child, Polly,
                    may have accompanied him. There is a vague family tradition to the effect that
                    Sarah, the second daughter, whose birth occurred March 5, 1796, was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>

                    a trip, since the breaking of the power of the Indians, through Wayne's
                    victory in August, 1794, had left the country comparatively quiet, and a woman
                    could have traveled in comparative safety. Such was very far from the case when
                    Jesse first arrived at Red Banks. His determination then to return to <placeName>

                    </placeName> must have been made soon after Wayne's victory, and before
                    the details of the campaign had become generally known. This would explain the
                    eagerness for information that he says in his pension application was displayed
                    all along the line of his journey. He must have been one of the first to carry
                    the news.</p>
            <p>It must have been shortly after his return from this visit that Jesse made
                    improvements on a tract of land in what later became <placeName>

            <p>Jesse must have been living near his wife's people at Knight's

            <p>In 1801, the sons and sons-in-law of Lawrence, Sr., acquired lands near Highland
                    creek, southwest of Red Banks, and moved there, forming what was then called
                    Roelofson's Settlement. When, in 1843, a post office was established
                    there, the place took the name Smith Mills. The name was given in honor of Col.
                    Robert Smith, whose father, Thomas Smith, had come to Red Banks with his family
                    from western <placeName>

                    found the low lands about Red Banks unhealthy, and removed to the higher land at

                    Jesse, having wedded one of Lawrence Roelofson's daughters, in 1803.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Colonel Robert erected a horse mill at

            <p>In spite of the stirring scenes amid which much of Jesse's early life

                    located at the present Smith Mills. Lawrence Roelofson obtained title to a
                    portion of the same tract of land on the same day. His name appears as one of
                    the witnesses to the signature of the deed to Jesse's land. We have

                            </placeName>, March 23, 1760, served in the Revolutionary War, and about
                            1795, came down the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> to Red Banks, now
                            Henderson, <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                            </placeName>, where he settled and soon afterward built a horse mill. He
                            lived here and engaged in milling, farming and trading with the Indians
                            for several years. He had some difficulty with the
                            "Redskins," and one time, while he was out in a maple
                            grove making sugar, they came and burned his cabin and carried off
                            everything of value that suited their fancy. Becoming dissatisfied with
                            his location, he crossed the river and came north into Indiana Territory
                            and made a settlement in the southeast quarter of section 34, township 3
                            south, range 12 west. The date of his arrival is about the same as that
                            of Thomas Montgomery, in 1805. The spot which he selected for his home
                            was upon the site of an old Indian village, and his cabin stood near a
                            large perennial spring of pure cold water. About 1810, he built and
                            operated a water mill on <geogName>Black River</geogName>, a few hundred
                            yards east of his cabin. He subsequently constructed a horse mill which
                            was in operation as late as 1840. He planted an apple orchard on his
                            place which <list type="footnotes">

            <p>A resident of southern Indiana who is familiar with many details of
                    Jesse's life, adds an interesting sequel to the above mentioned race
                    with the Indian chief.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> He says that Jesse had no sooner
                    won the race than he realifced that his victory would probably cause him trouble
                    in the future, since the Indians had grown sullen and discontented and were
                    murmuring among themselves. With great sagacity and diplomacy, he therefore
                    announced that the race had been won unsatisfactorily, and proposed that the
                    chief run with him again. When nearing the goal in the second race, Jesse
                    purposely stumbled and fell. The Indian was acclaimed the victor, good humor
                    returned to his followers, and a situation that might have led to serious
                    consequences was averted.</p>
            <p>Considerable uncertainty exists as to the date when Jesse established his
                    residence in Indiana. We have just seen that the Tartt history represents him as
                    moving there about 1805. The same history, in another place, gives 1804 or 1805
                    as the date. It will be recalled that Jesse himself names ten years as the
                    length of his residence in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

            <p>Among the executive orders of William Henry Harrison, Governor of Indiana
                    Territory, we find one issued to Captain William Hargrove, Commander of Rangers,
                    directing him to attend a meeting which would be held at Mr. Kimbles, who lives
                    on the site of the old <placeName>

                    His removal to the home on <geogName>Black river</geogName> had evidently been
                    planned long and carefully. It is clear that he had explored the region north of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> very thoroughly, and that his attention had been attracted to the
                    site on <geogName>Black river</geogName> long before he moved his family there,
                    probably even before 1804, the year when southern Indiana was opened to
                    settlers. An old hunter told him of the location,<hi rend="sup">47</hi> an
                    exceptionally desirable one owing to the fact that on it was an ever-flowing
                    spring of pure cold water. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> Indians had made it the site of one of their towns, doubtless on
                    account of the spring, and many interesting Indian relics have been collected in
                    that vicinity. It is practically certain that it was from the Indian village on
                    this site that Mrs. Talbot and her little son were rescued by discharged U. S.
                    soldiers from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>Jesse probably erected a temporary dwelling on the newly selected land before he
                    transferred his family there; and this habitation was presumably the place
                    referred to by Governor Harrison as "Mr. Kimbles."</p>
            <p>Jesse did not sever his connection with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henderson county</region>
                    </placeName> completely, even after he transferred his family to Indiana, but
                    passed back and forth at frequent intervals. Elias Turner, in an affidavit made

                    commonwealth." Jesse was there as late as 1812, when he executed the

                    </placeName>, because of trouble with the Indians lacks credibility, since in
                    crossing into Indiana, he was certainly going into a region far more seriously

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> was at that time. It is true that the Indians burned his house in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. They came while the family was away from home, and the fire was
                    proved to have been their work when, shortly after the destruction of his home,
                    Jesse saw an Indian wearing a shawl that had been one of the prized possessions
                    of his wife.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> It had been taken in the general looting of
                    the house that preceded its destruction. It is said that he had incurred the
                    enmity of certain Indians by refusing to give them whiskey on some occasion when
                    they demanded it. The burning of his Home may have been because of this refusal.
                    The millers of those days were accustomed to operate stills in connection with
                    their grist mills,<hi rend="sup">50</hi> as in that way any surplus grain could
                    be converted into a product that could be conveyed a great distance with
                    comparative ease. The nearest market for their produce was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the product of the stills was less bulky to transport and less
                    liable to damage from weather than the grain itself. The Indians undoubtedly
                    knew that he made "fire water," and his unwillingness or
                    inability to furnish it upon demand would very naturally have aroused their
                    resentment. It is probable, however, that his removal from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to Indiana was due to the appeal to him of the latter place as a
                    farming region, and not to his fear of the Indians in <placeName>

                    following details of Jesse's early life in Indiana: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In 1810, Jesse Kimball built a flutter-wheel water mill on
                                <geogName>Black River</geogName> about six miles south of
                            Owensville, Indiana, and ground corn for himself and few neighbors for
                            several years. Mr. Kimball came to that neighborhood in 1804 from the
                            Red Banks, now Henderson, <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                            </placeName>, and took the burrs with him from Henderson with a horse in
                            the shafts and a pole through the stones for an axle.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>A cane made from a mud sill of the above-mentioned mill, now in the possession of
                    one of Jesse's descendants in southern Indiana, shows that the sill was
                    black walnut. That valuable wood was common in Indiana in pioneer days.</p>
            <p>In moving his family from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henderson county</region>
                    </placeName> to the new home north of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Jesse was fortunate in not being obliged to hew his way through
                    pathless forest. An old Indian trail led from Red Banks to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, passing within a few miles of Jesse's home. It was known
                    as the Red Banks trail, and could be traversed by vehicles. It was patrolled for
                    some time in order to protect the immigrants from the Indians.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Without doubt it was over this trail that Jesse traveled in his unique
                    vehicle with mill-stones for wheels and a pole through them for an axle.</p>

                    </placeName> certainly forty years and probably longer.</p>
            <p>During these forty years he must have gained a reputation for good judgment and
                    common sense, since the Tartt history records that in 1813 he was appointed one
                    of the three appraisers for the first estate probated in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson county</region>
                    </placeName> court. He must also have enjoyed the good will and esteem of his
                    neighbors as well, for while he occupied his <geogName>Black river</geogName>
                    farm as early as 1807, he obtained no patent to the land until 1818. That he
                    could retain possession of a farm for eleven years by merely living on it, in
                    the days when claim-jumping and murderous fights over land were not uncommon, is
                    an indication of the regard in which he was held in the community. A local
                    historian who knew him said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    and he chose Jesse. Jesse probably continued in this relation until Charles was
                    twenty-one years of age.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, who submitted Jesse's pension application to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1847, stated in his letter to the war department that when he
                    asked Jesse to whom he could refer for information concerning his honesty and
                    veracity, the answer came promptly and proudly, "Anyone within fifty
                    miles, who knows me." Accompanying his pension application were
                    affidavits from three of his old friends and neighbors who were glad to testify
                    to his character. These men were the Reverend Joseph Was-son, John Sharp and
                    William Sharp, Sr. They stated that they had been acquainted with him from
                    twenty to forty years.</p>

            <p>In his old age, Jesse was frequently furnished a carriage or hack in which to
                    ride in Fourth of July processions or on other patriotic occasions, owing to his
                    being a Revolutionary war veteran.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Persons now living
                    remember seeing Jesse and other aged veterans riding in a carriage which, as a
                    mark of special honor, was drawn by men instead of horses.</p>
            <p>The later years of his life seem to have been quiet and uneventful, spent on his
                    farm and in his mill, and offering a decided contrast to his earlier life. He
                    had done his part, slight though it was, in freeing his country from the
                    domination of the British; he had helped to subdue the fierce Indian tribes; and
                    his sturdy manhood must have contributed appreciably to the betterment of each
                    of the pioneer communities in which he found himself. That he possessed ability,
                    energy, initiative and foresight is clear when we remember that in addition to
                    setting up one of the earliest mills in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson county</region>
                    </placeName>, he is said to have built the first frame house and burned the
                    first brick kiln.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The following quotation from a letter
                    written by his granddaughter, Mrs. Harris, attests his mechanical ingenuity:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I remember a man calling him a Yankee. Grandpa had been repairing his
                            carriage. He made the springs so there was a rocking motion instead of
                            the ordinary springing motion. The man laughingly said, "My!

            <p>As age with increasing feebleness and blindness came upon him, we can imagine the

                    and made their homes near the old home place. His faithful wife, Elizabeth, died
                    in 1843; and after her death, his daughters, Sarah Kimball Jones and Cynthia

                    aged about ninety-seven years, and was buried beside his wife in the family
                    graveyard on the farm. The grave of each is marked by a sandstone slab bearing
                    some simple carving the work of a member of the family.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old "burying ground" cannot but make a strong appeal to
                    Jesse's descendants. In it lie generation after generation of Kimballs.
                    Jesse's father and mother rest there, together with his sisters,
                    Margaret, Amy and Thankful, and his nephew and son-in-law, Jesse W., although
                    none of these graves can be located.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> The old farm also
                    awakens a deep sentimental interest. It is still in the possession of one of his
                    descendants. Seven generations of Kimballs have quenched their thirst at the old
                    spring.</p>
            <p>Before his death, Jesse transferred the farm to his son, Isaac. The transfer was
                    made in three different transactions, each involving one-third of the land, in
                    1849, 1851 and 1852 respectively. Jesse was then past ninety years of age.
                    Blindness had even then come upon him, and the last two of the deeds were signed
                    by a mark as he could no longer see to affix his signature. The distribution of
                    the small amount of personal property remaining after his death was made by the
                    court February 8, 1859.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>

                    </placeName>, as he was, what wonder that he was entertained throughout his

                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> then, and to the New Englanders who were wresting their meagre
                    livelihood from its stony barren soil, the tales that Jesse told of the lavish
                    gifts nature had poured upon the region along "La belle
                    riviere," as the French called the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, must have been alluring indeed. No one can know how many families
                    eventually made their way westward through the interest aroused by this one man.
                    It was just such influences that drew settlers from one region to another in
                    those days.</p>
            <p>In appearance, Jesse was short, stocky, fair-skinned, and possibly red-haired as
                    his father is said to have been. In accordance with the custom of the time, he
                    wore his locks long, tying them on week days with a leather thong, and on
                    Sundays with a black ribbon. He was a Whig and a staunch Methodist. He possessed
                    a genial disposition, a keen sense of humor, and a decided gift for whimsical
                    narrative. He was a true and a helpful friend to those who, like himself, were
                    striving to gain a foothold in the wilderness. Stories are still current in
                    southern Indiana illustrating this rare trait in his character.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>

                                            delayed on account of heavy rains on the Bluffs of Big
                                            Creek about one mile southeast of Cynthiana. The Platts
                                            on this side of the creek were covered with water deep
                                            enough to swim a horse. When Jesse Kimball learned that
                                            the Barrs were held up by the high water he started to
                                            meet them and invite them to become his neighbors. He
                                            rode his horse as far as he could in the water without
                                            swimming. Then he climbed upon a high stump and called
                                            to the Barrs telling them that as soon as the water was
                                            low enough he would be there with a team to help them
                                            across the flat, saying, 'I have a fine quarter
                                            section selected for you.' He fulfilled his
                                            promise and he and the Barrs remained close friends as
                                            long as they lived."</p>

            <p>He was not of the hunter-trapper-explorer type of pioneer to which Daniel Boone
                    belonged–one of those roving spirits attracted irresistibly by the
                    wilderness with its freedom and its adventure. He belonged to a class of
                    different mold, the class that made the great untamed west an abode of
                    home-builders. Fate seemed to mark him as fitted for this special task. More
                    than once he was spared experiences that might have ended his career. He was
                    discharged from the garrison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New London</settlement>
                    </placeName> but a short time before the Arnold raid, when nearly everyone at
                    Fort Griswold was massacred; he missed accompanying the disastrous St. Clair
                    campaign by only a few days; he received his discharge from the Indian war only
                    a short time before the decisive battle of Fallen Timbers. Furthermore, by the
                    fact that a river captain became afraid to go any farther, he missed returning
                    to <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> after his term of military service in the west had expired,
                    remaining to aid in establishing the empire beyond the mountains.</p>
            <p>The years that Jesse devoted to military service brought him no reward in the
                    form of pension or of land bounty. The failure to obtain a pension caused him no
                    concern, however, as he had ample means to sustain him. He doubtless made the
                    application at the solicitation of a lawyer. His claim was rejected because his
                    three months of Revolutionary service did not satisfy the requirement of the law
                    of that day which demanded at least six months. The three years he spent in the
                    Indian wars did not entitle him to a pension. The statement made in the letters
                    of his nephew, Isaac, to the effect that he had bounty land in <placeName>

            <p>The third annual history conference, under the auspices of the society of Indiana
                    Pioneers, the Indiana Historical society, and the Historical commission, was
                    held on December 9th and 10th, 1921, in the Claypool hotel. This conference on
                    Indiana history which is rapidly taking on the nature of a clearing house for
                    state history, was attended this year by more than two hundred
                    people–the actual registration showed one hundred and seventy.
                    Forty-six counties in the state were represented. From the standpoint of
                    interest and attendance, the conference was by far the most successful of the
                    three that have been held.</p>
            <p>The Friday afternoon program was given over chiefly to a discussion of county
                    centennial plans. Those participating in the discussion included Prof. Harlow
                    Lindley, Lucy M. Elliott, Herriott C. Palmer, Mrs. H. C. Robinson, Clarence H.
                    Smith, Miles S. Cox and Eliza G. Browning.</p>
            <p>At the Friday evening session ex-Governor Samuel M. Ralston read an interesting
                    paper on Jonathan Jennings, the First Governor of Indiana.</p>
            <p>At the Saturday forenoon session, the following papers were read: The Local

            <p>The annual dinner of the society of Indiana Pioneers was held on Saturday
                    evening. A talk on Some Old-Fashioned Indiana Writers, by Mrs. Demarchus C.
                    Brown, and the singing of the songs of days long gone, were the chief features
                    of the pioneer dinner program.</p>
            <p>A committee was appointed to arrange for the Fourth annual conference on December
                    10th and 11th, 1922. These annual conferences on Indiana history are becoming a
                    feature in promoting a keener interest in our state's history. They
                    bring together the four leading organizations in Indiana that are primarily
                    interested in state history, namely, society of Indiana Pioneers, Indiana
                    historical society, Indiana historical commission, and the history teachers
                    section of the Indiana State Teacher's association.</p>

                    historical society in the state to take advantage of the special act approved
                    March 10, 1921, enabling the board of county commissioners to employ a curator
                    to look after the work of the local historical society. Clarence H. Smith of
                    Newcastle has been named as its curator. Mr. Smith has entered upon his work and
                    is devoting his time now to classifying the collection of books, papers and
                    relics that are in the possession of the society.</p>
            <p>The growing interest on the part of the reading public in Indiana history is
                    strikingly illustrated by the space now devoted to this subject by the leading
                    newspapers of the state. For several months, Kate Milner Rabb, through her daily

                    this plan, P. H. Gill, chairman of Polk township, reported at the November and
                    December meetings of the society, one hundred and six new members together with
                    a collection of numerous and valuable old relics. Other townships were
                    represented at the December meeting by the different chairmen of each and
                    reported many new accessions to the society, as well as many contributions to

            <p>Armistice day, November 11, 1921, was generally celebrated throughout the state
                    of Indiana by programs, patriotic and social in nature. No more beautiful or
                    appropriate program was given in the state than the celebration of this event in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The program consisted first of a parade in which marched the
                    soldiers of three wars, the Service Star legion, Labor Union members, civic
                    organizations, and representatives of every walk of life, the number of marchers
                    estimated from 5,000 to 7,000; and a pageant immediately following the parade
                    given in the Coliseum. Mrs. Albion Fellows Bacon was the author of the pageant,
                    and Mrs. E. A. Torrance, <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-018-1-127"/> the director. The
                    subject of the pageant was Disarmament, and was written for the express purpose
                    of showing t he horrors of war and the blessings of peace. The theme of the
                    first act was war, accompanied by the attending spirits of death and famine; and
                    the theme of the second act peace, enthroned on the earth surrounded by smiling
                    nations and happy flower-laden children. The concluding song, Peace to the
                    Nations, emphasized the central theme of the pageant, Disarmament of Nations to
                    insure permanent peace. It was an all <placeName>

                    </placeName> pageant and reflected great credit upon its author and those
                    supporting her in its production. The crowd seeing the pageant and parade was
                    estimated at fifteen thousand.</p>

                        <region type="county">Newton county</region>
                    </placeName>, do not forget to stop at the sign of the "Open Door
                    Museum and Home of the Round Table Club" located at Goodland, Indiana;
                    and while visiting this museum do not miss hearing the story of its founding
                    from the lips of the man who has spent thirty-six years in its up-building for
                    the benefit of the boys and girls of Goodland. A. D. Babcock, sole founder and
                    owner, will tell you that several years ago he came to the conclusion that
                    "one could amuse himself at home." Selecting as his source of
                    amusement the gradual development of an historical collection of articles of
                    rare value, he today can boast of having the best collection of historicl relics
                    in northwestern Indiana. Mr. Babcock does not confine his efforts to Indiana
                    alone, but has in this collection relics of historical value from Africa, Asia
                    and Europe. Already the museum building is too small. Plans are under way for
                    its enlargement, after which he hopes to invite all of the noted orators of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to speak before the Round Table Club and in this way put Goodland,
                    as he says, on the map as a cultural center. Should this project reach the
                    proportions outlined by Mr. Babcock, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Newton county</region>
                    </placeName> will be noted for two national attractions, George Ade, the
                    humorist, and the "Open Door Museum" of Goodland. Mr. Babcock
                    is also the author of a volume of verse, "The Silver Oar."</p>
