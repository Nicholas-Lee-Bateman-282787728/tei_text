            <p>The "suspense we are in is worse than hell—!!!!" was Jonathan
                    Robert's explosive view of the procrastination of the Senate on the question of war.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> President James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> had delivered his war message on June 1; the House of Representatives had decided in
                    favor of war on June 4; but on June 17, 1812, the nation was still anxiously awaiting the decision
                    of the Senate. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was excited by rumors circulating about the proceedings of the Senate and the prospect
                    for war. Speculation was rampant because the proceedings of Congress were veiled by the rule of
                    secrecy. It was said that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> hoped the Senate would defeat the war bill; that the Navy would incite a hostile act on
                    the part of the British to unite the country; that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, which had nominated De Witt Clinton for the presidency on May 29, would remain neutral
                    in case of war; that the British had incited the Indians into a mass attack in the West; and there
                    were premature reports of the passage or defeat of the declaration of war.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    Tension reached a high pitch. It was obvious to all that the Senate was dragging its feet in the
                    march toward war.</p>
            <p>The British minister in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Augustus Foster, was convinced that "not four senators from north [of] the
                    Potomac will vote for war."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The Federalist leader in the Senate, James
                    A. Bayard, observed on June 4 that "in the Senate no calculation can be made."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> And the semiofficial organ of the administration, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">National Intelligencer</hi>, declared on June 13 that "the public mind is yet
                    in painful suspense, as to the result of their [the Senate's] deliberations."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> This expressive apprehension indicates that the real test of the issue of war
                    in 1812 came in the Senate and not in the House.</p>
            <p>Those who have investigated the events which led to the outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain
                    and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1812 have concentrated, for legitimate reasons, upon the activities and votes in the
                    House of Representatives. The House better reflected public opinion, and its membership during the
                    Twelfth Congress was especially interesting because <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> himself had switched from the Senate to the House because he preferred "the

                        Chamber."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> But the Constitution does require the Congress to
                    declare war, not the House alone. The Senate's role in the vote for war has been neglected;
                    it has been treated merely as a ratifying agency for the actions of the House.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                    This was definitely <hi rend="i">not</hi> the case in 1812.</p>
            <p>The usual treatment accorded the crucial vote in the Senate for war has been merely a statement that
                    on June 17, 1812, the Senate voted for war by a majority of 19 to 13. Only two recent historians,
                    Roger H. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bradford Perkins, have treated the vote in the Senate at any length. Both recognize
                    the importance of the Senate debates on the issue of war. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> feels that the opposition to war in the Senate was motivated primarily by honest
                    differences with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration's foreign policy. Perkins emphasizes personal and political
                    disputes between members of the Senate and the administration, rather than "honest
                        differences."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Senate, whose members served six year terms and were chosen at that time by the state
                    legislatures, was a more mature, a more independent, and a more conservative body than the House of
                    Representatives. Therefore, it was, as intended by the authors of the Constitution, less subject to
                    the influence of popular opinion. This situation helps explain why the resolution for war in 1812
                    faced its most critical test in the Senate. A thorough study of the Senate's membership,
                    its factions, and its votes on the issues leading to war is vital to an understanding of the crisis
                    which faced the nation in 1812.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first administration had been marred by serious division within the
                    Republican party and by diplomatic failure to obtain concessions from Great Britain. In spite of

                    </placeName>, the quality of the President's leadership is still questionable. Squabbles
                    within his cabinet were common, and corrosive factionalism eroded party unity from the very
                    beginning of his administration.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    the Twelfth Congress (1811-1813). Republicans (House, 106; Senate, 28) could easily pass anything
                    through Congress upon which they could agree, but there was little agreement within the party. The
                    strongest center of discontent was in the Senate where <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s foreign and judicial appointments were factiously opposed and defeated. The

                    Congress (1809-1811).<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Nathaniel Macon had observed when his first bill was
                    defeated that there was less chance of the Senate declaring war on Great Britain or <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> than on the Treasury, meaning Albert Gallatin and the administration.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The House of Representatives presented no real problem to the administration, for
                    Republicans there were able to unite in sufficient number to maintain a majority, going so far as to
                    impose the "gag rule" to end some of the endless speeches by Republican
                    malcontents like John <placeName>

                    </placeName>. When the vote for war was finally taken in the House, June 4, 1812, Republicans formed
                    a comfortable majority of thirty in favor of war, but the Senate was an entirely different
                        matter.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>The thirty-four senators in the Twelfth Congress were presided over by Vice President George Clinton
                    until his death on April 20, 1812. The Federalists were a powerless but influential minority of six.

                    </placeName> respectively. Although a few of these men had qualms about war with Great Britain, they

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration were the Invisibles: Samuel Smith of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, William B. Giles of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the administration in general. The Invisibles, however, took a position of
                    superior zeal in the debates over the measures of resistance to "British
                    aggressions." There was great suspicion among the other members of Congress that their true
                    purpose was to embarrass the Treasury and the administration and that they did not really favor
                        war.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Equally opposed to the administration were a few Republicans of the northern wing of the party,
                    generally called Clintonians, who hoped to see one of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Clintons in the presidency in 1813. The Clintonians had called for vigorous
                    preparations for war and negotiation from a position of strength, but their cause received two
                    setbacks in the spring of 1812—George Clinton died in April, and the spring elections in

                    </placeName> went badly for the Republican party. During the Senate debates on war, Clintonians
                    called for postponement; they claimed that they desired a delay in order that the nation might be
                    better prepared. However, many suspected the Clintonians of baser motives. Whatever was the case,
                    the Clintonians in the Senate—Obadiah German of <placeName>

            <p>The recalcitrant mavericks and the kaleidoscopic factions in the Senate in 1812 made the success of a
                    vote for war with Great Britain highly questionable. The six Federalists, the seven
                    antiadministration Republicans (Clintonians and Invisibles), and the numerous maverick senators
                    seemed to form a majority against the <placeName>

            <p>With the election of 1812 approaching, the antiadministration forces in the Senate took every
                    opportunity to denigrate the public image of the administration. Foster, the minister from Great
                    Britain, wrote in January, 1812: "The opposition know the embarrassment of the President,
                    and endeavor to take advantage of it by pushing for measures so decisive as to leave him no retreat.
                    It has been told me in confidence more than once by different leaders, that if the Orders in Council

            <p>Prior to the beginning of the debates on the actual question of war, the Senate passed several bills

            <p>The administration men defended the embargo during April and May and debated with the opposition
                    about the expediency of war. Bayard observed that there was a new sentiment in the Congress for
                    maritime war, attributing it to the fear of southern congressmen that a land war would mean added
                    strength for the northern tier of states: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            publicly spoken of. It has existed but a short time and passes as yet in whispers and a semi

            <p>The session had been long and arduous. Many senators desired a recess and some began to drift home,
                    recess or no recess. On April 24 Bradley presented a resolution from the Joint Committee on Recess
                    to the Senate. It proposed a recess of twenty days from April 29 to May 18. Pope successfully moved
                    to strike May 18 from the resolution. He then proposed to substitute the fourth Monday in June as
                    the end of the recess. Bradley stated that he preferred the second Monday in June, while Leib, from
                    nearby <placeName>

                    prefer no recess at all. He feared that it might produce an unfavorable impression of hesitation and
                    weakness abroad. George Washington Campbell agreed with his colleague from <placeName>

                    supported a maritime war as preferable to unlimited war, but when maritime war failed to find enough

            <p>Had Vice President Clinton still been presiding, the War of 1812 would probably have begun as a
                    limited war of naval reprisals, because he would have, no doubt, voted for the committee's
                    report. The failure of the efforts of the opposition to war may be blamed on the irascible Senator
                    Giles who had voted in favor of instructing the committee for maritime war and then voted against
                    the committee's report to that effect. Thirty senators had voted 17 to 13 to instruct the
                    committee for limited war on June 11. On June 12 two administration supporters—Brent and
                    Robinson—had returned to the Senate and had voted against the committee report. Only
                    Giles changed his vote from yea to nay to force the 16 to 16 deadlock. Perhaps this is the reason
                    Leib called for the roll call—he had expected a 17 to 15 victory. If Bradley and
                    Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been present, the vote would have been 18 to 16 in favor of the
                    committee's report; thus, a number of circumstances contributed to the defeat of maritime
                    war. With the failure of the committee report, the opponents of the administration turned to the
                    idea of triangular war.</p>

                    Obadiah German, Clintonian from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, moved to postpone further consideration of the war bill until November. German may
                    have sincerely feared that the nation was unprepared, or he may have believed that further delay
                    without decision might have improved the chances of the Clintonians for success in the presidential
                    election; but, whatever the case, his speech was a reasoned appeal. He admitted that Great Britain

                    therefore, the moment was not propitious. He astutely predicted disaster for General William Hull in
                    the West and blamed the problems with the Indians upon Governor William Henry Harrison's
                    raid on the village at <placeName>

                    </placeName>—a judgment with which some historians agree. He believed the officers of the
                    Army were ill trained and unprepared, and the Navy, he said, might be ready, but it could not ward
                    off an invasion. Therefore he proposed to postpone the war until November.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> But

                    at the opening of the session, nor for a long time after. He maintained that "A menacing

                    There were, however, certain political advantages to be gained by opposing the war—delay

            <p>The June 12 tie vote on limited war and the votes for triangular war demonstrate that most senators

                    war, and they had impaled themselves on the horns of dilemma: "To oppose war would be
                    inconsistent with their past conduct … to join in with the views of the administration

            <p>Thus the nation was committed to an all out war for survival as an independent nation. Republicans
                    had been seriously divided over the issue, but the political situation in 1812 was such that they no

                    war." Many Republicans believed that failure to declare war, after six months of oral

            <p>The old story that if there had been an Atlantic cable in 1812, there would have been no war is
                    probably true. A change of only three votes in the Senate on June 17 would have resulted in deadlock
                    and defeat for the declaration of war. If news of the imminent repeal of the Orders in Council had
                    arrived, the three votes and more would doubtless have been forthcoming from the Invisibles and
                    mavericks. The Republican party would have been able to claim victory without war.</p>
            <p>In the vote for war in the Senate of the Twelfth Congress, the most important factor in the voting
                    would appear to have been party regularity and political advantage. A majority of the Senate did not
                    prefer unlimited war as proposed by the House, but when all alternatives were rejected they cast
                    their votes for party and for war. Certainly the senators were concerned about national honor, the
                    vulnerability of their home states, and the future of republican institutions, but the political
                    future was also a primary consideration.</p>

                        amendments to the House war bill which would have converted the declaration of war to a
                        declaration of a war of naval reprisal and letters of marque with either Great Britain or both

                        to vote to add a crippling amendment to the war bill and, if such an amendment had passed, to
                        join the administration Republicans to vote the bill down.</item>

                        successfully defeated every proposed amendment to the House war bill, primarily because of the

                        declaration of war premature, but political considerations were probably foremost in their

                        decided to support war. Howell supported a maritime war against Great Britain alone. Pope
                        supported triangular war only. Reed voted with the Federalists and Clintonians against war. John
                        Smith wavered but ended by voting for war. Worthington supported limited war against Great
                        Britain, but opposed an all out war. Stephen Bradley of <placeName>

                        be counted as mavericks. With the latter two included, there were eight mavericks. Four of

                    </placeName> which he called "The Significance of the Frontier in American
                    History." He began with a reference to this census: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In a recent bulletin of the superintendent of the census for 1890 appear these significant
                            words: "Up to and including 1880 the country had a frontier of settlement, but at
                            present the unsettled area has been so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that
                            there can hardly be said to be a frontier line. In the discussion of its extent, its
                            westward movement, etc., it cannot, therefore, any longer have a place in the census
                            reports." This brief official statement marks the close of a great historic
                            movement. Up to our own day American history has been in a large degree the history of the
                            colonization of the Great West. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous

            <p>It required little sophistication in the late 1880s and early 1890s to realize that the conquest of

                    </placeName> was moving into a new phase in its development. Several events seemed to be historical

                    </placeName> and Wyoming followed in July, 1890. James G. Hill's organization of the Great
                    Northern Pacific Railroad Company in 1890 meant that another transcontinental railroad would soon be
                    in operation. As 1890 closed, the Sioux of the Black Hills rose in the "Ghost Dance
                    War." For a time there were fears of conflicts with the Indians like the Nez
                    Percé War, thirteen years before, but the army crushed the Sioux at Wounded Knee on
                    December 29 and drove them back to their reservation. Farmers, ranchers, and miners had supplanted
                    the Indian tribes as the principal makers of the history of the West, as easterners reading of
                    demands from Populists for free coinage of silver and government regulation of railroads, must have
                    been aware.</p>
            <p>Americans of that era were proud of their country's growth. They saw nothing alarming in
                    steadily increasing population figures or in the breaking of more land to the plow. At almost every
                    kind of meeting—Fourth of July celebrations, "Old Settlers'"
                    meetings, church and lodge conventions— speakers extolled the greatness of America and
                    foretold a glorious destiny. From the census of 1890 Americans wanted precise information about the
                    progress they saw everywhere. They wanted reports, statistics, and maps with dots and lines, and
                    they wanted to know the location of the new center of population. Taking office on March 4, 1889,
                    the one hundredth anniversary of the founding of the federal government, President Benjamin Harrison
                    expressed the expectations of his fellow citizens in his inaugural address: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The center of population when our national capital was located [on the Potomac in 1790] was

            <p>Porter's achievement was remarkable. He told a House committee which was considering
                    proposals for a permanent census bureau that "When I was appointed I had nothing but one
                    clerk and a messenger, and a desk with some white paper on it."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Within
                    a few months Porter put together an organization of thousands of temporary workers and tabulated one
                    of the most informative censuses in American history. It was, probably, his decision to use a new
                    tabulating machine that accounts for his success. A primitive machine had been used in 1880, but
                    Porter wanted an electrical device; he studied recent inventions and concluded that a machine
                    patented by Herman Hollerith, a thirty year old <placeName>

                    paraphrased or copied from Superintendent Porter's bulletins. It would, of course, be going

                    center of gravity of the population of the country," and determined to place a marker at

                    Armstrong, who had studied law at Indiana University before turning to journalism, had been on the
                        <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> staff since 1887. Years later he recalled that he had
                    "assisted a number of other slaves to write the news one morning and correct it the
                        next."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> It seems unlikely that his slavery was as exacting as he
                    liked to say, for he found time to write for several magazines, and had recently published a novel
                    about corruption in Indiana politics.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>, meanwhile, secured a large block of "<placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> for carving. The editors spared no expense; the total cost of the monument was
                        $300.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> They were delighted when they learned that the stone
                    carvers would finish their work before May 10, the tenth anniversary of the founding of the <hi rend="i">Herald.</hi> The editors resolved to dedicate the marker that day. Since May 10 would
                    fall on Sunday, they could expect a large attendance.</p>
            <p>Armstrong made several trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Soon he was a familiar figure to its citizens, and he learned much about the

                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s history was not a lengthy one, for it was founded in 1822, but Armstrong
                    described the little city as "quaint old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>." He took many walks down its long, tree lined streets, admiring its
                    "thousand pleasant homes."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Of course, he walked around the
                    courthouse square, gazing up at the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Courthouse. A fine example of the Romantic architecture of the 1850s, it looked like a
                    small version of the Smithsonian Institution, completed at about the same time. Few people failed to
                    comment about the aspen tree growing from the sloping roof of the clock tower!<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                    Here was the wonder of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>; often citizens of the town had to attempt answers to such questions as "How
                    did it get there?" Needless to say, no one has ever discovered satisfactory answers to
                    questions about that tree or its descendents.</p>
            <p>Armstrong was even more enthusiastic about the surrounding countryside than about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Like most people who had lived in Indiana, he knew that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur County</region>
                    </placeName> was the "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hoopole County</region>
                    </placeName>" of Edward Eggleston's famous novel, <hi rend="i">The Hoosier
                        School-Master</hi> (1871). He quickly discovered that many citizens of the county took little
                    pride in this association. Their memories of the early days of settlement were much too sharp for
                    them to regard Eggleston's story as mere historical fiction; in fact, it was believed that
                    the original of Old Man Means was still living in the <placeName>

                    Cumback's life came when he cast the first of Indiana's electoral votes for
                        Lincoln.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Cumback spent the war years as an army paymaster, and, in 1868,
                    won election as lieutenant governor. Later, he served as a <placeName>

                    failed in his quest for office. When Leroy Armstrong met him, he was much disappointed by the
                    refusal of President Harrison to appoint him to either the Interstate Commerce Commission or the
                    Civil Service Commission. The President, it should be said, had not forgotten Cumback altogether; he
                    had offered him appointment to a special commission to the Puyallup Indians in the new state of <placeName>

                    would give distinction to the program at the Engel farm, and Armstrong found the aging politician
                    most helpful. From Cumback he learned much of the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur County</region>
                    </placeName> and received advice about the program for the ceremony.</p>
            <p>Armstrong found another speaker whose background was as interesting as Cumback's but which
                    was in sharp contrast to it. Henry C. Miller was a farmer who lived a short distance from the
                    center. He was one of the most prosperous men in Sand Creek Township, and his stately brick house,
                    surrounded by majestic pine trees, seemed a mansion when compared with the homes of his neighbors, a
                    few of whom still lived in log houses built during the early days of settlement. Miller's
                    family had been one of the first to take up homesteads in southern <placeName>

                    </placeName> with his parents nearly sixty years before and how he had been "bound
                    out." As a young man he had spent six years as an overseer on his brother's <placeName>

                    house. It was the Civil War which gave Miller's life its particular interest. An opponent
                    of the invasion of the South, he spoke contemptuously of abolitionism at every opportunity. There
                    were in southern <placeName>

                    hanging its owner. No one knows precisely what happened, but they changed their minds—and
                    Miller was somewhat quieter after that evening. In 1891 even survivors of that group respected him
                    as a hard working member of the Methodist church, a leader of local Democrats, and a stern enemy of
                    alcohol. Miller's friends expected him to give a worthwhile address.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>The monument arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> on May 8, two days before the celebration. At once a small boy who made a habit of
                    meeting trains ran down the middle of the street yelling "The Herald's center
                    monument has come." People questioned him; others talked to the drayman; several
                    individuals telephoned the freight office for confirmation of the exciting news. Soon curious
                    citizens were crowding into the box car in which lay the heavily boxed monument. They could see
                    little, but they ran their hands through a small opening and touched the carving. A few hours later
                    the monument was placed on another train for the journey to Davis' Switch, a spur about a
                    mile west of the center. The switch was equipped with derricks for handling limestone from nearby
                    quarries; and a Mr. Dewey, whom Armstrong had hired to set up the monument, expected to place it on
                    a wagon without difficulty. But he met with an unexpected problem. The man in charge of the switch
                    demanded three times the usual fee to operate the derricks. When Dewey found another man, the
                    regular attendant demanded $7 for the privilege of driving a team onto the grounds.
                    Dewey's assistants threatened to thrash the attendant. Frightened, the man gave way. Slowly
                    the derricks lifted the huge stone—it weighed 9,500 pounds—onto a low wagon.
                    Drawn by four teams of mules, the creaking wagon moved towards the Engel farm. At times the men had
                    to level the road before proceeding. After long hours the party reached the center. There another
                    arduous task awaited the men. They dug a hole five feet deep, filled it to within a foot of the
                    surface with rubble and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName> cement and then laid the base. They worked until late in the night pulling on the stone
                    with levers, jackscrews, and ropes. Just before dawn the ten foot high monolith at last stood
                    proudly in position.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>Meanwhile, Armstrong had been busy with final arrangements. All had seemed ready until a business
                    matter called Cumback out of town. This development was, of course, a disappointment, but securing a
                    replacement was not difficult. B. F. Bennett, a young attorney, was glad to speak.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Then came another problem. The Reverend Mr. Reynolds suddenly had <list type="footnotes">

                            the present day unincorporated town of Letts. It was named for James M. Davis, on whose farm
                            the switch was located. His granddaughter, Mrs. Nelle Harrell Wright, in a letter to the
                            present writer, dated March 3, 1966, recalled that when she and her husband, Arthur Wright,
                            lived on the farm, they could not plow the area once occupied by the switch for many large
                            pieces of limestone were still embedded in the soil.</item>

                    it would be a sinful use of the sabbath; sternly he announced that he would not go and warned his
                    fellow citizens to stay away. Armstrong was angry. He had found out, he wrote, that Reynolds was
                    "down on dancing and unalterably opposed to having any man but himself earn a dollar on
                    Sunday." Armstrong decided to give Reynolds a place in the story of the center as
                    "a professional Christian—just as some men are professional Irishmen and some
                    are professional old soldiers," and to omit prayers at the ceremony.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    old saying that frost on Wednesday meant "rain before Sunday." The worried

                    Boys and young men climbed into trees; most people sat on the ground. The band played an air, and
                    Armstrong, as master of ceremonies, opened the program. He asked Gavin to speak first.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The young attorney went right to the point, telling the audience that the monument had been erected
                    "not to mark the successes and achievements of any one man nor to glorify the conquest of
                    one people by another, but it has been placed here as a milestone to mark one step in the progress
                    of a great nation which is destined to attain—nay, more, has already
                    attained—a position among the nations of the earth far surpassing that which has ever yet
                    been reached by any other people." As if to reassure anyone who might have been troubled by
                    the ruckus Reynolds had raised or who was displeased by the omission of an invocation, Gavin
                    declared: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We have assembled here not unmindful of the day nor of the spirit befitting it. We come to
                            mark a national event with our hearts turned with grateful thanks to the great God who
                            presided over the birth of this nation, who has guarded and watched over its welfare and
                            guided its destinies during the years of its existence; that God whose spirit pervades all
                            our institutions, without whom our nation would soon be as the house founded upon the sands,
                            but with whose spirit permeating our institutions, we may expect ever to advance toward a
                            higher and better civilization.</p>
                    </quote> Gavin continued, dwelling upon the progress of Indiana since statehood, and lauding her
                    distinguished statesmen and authors. He received warm applause.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

            <p>Marsh Thomas followed on the platform. He had chosen a song about the visit of an old man to the farm
                    home of his boyhood. Then came another number by the band. With admirable brevity the next speaker,
                    Willoughby, traced the history of modern newspapers, praised the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>, and
                    advised every one to read his newspaper. The editor of the <hi rend="i">Review</hi> claimed much:

            <p>After Willoughby took his seat, the Mapleton Glee Club sang "America," to the
                    accompaniment of a cottage organ. They repeated the last stanza, and the audience joined in.
                    "One can hardly imagine the effect of that song," Armstrong wrote, "it
                    was something to remember, something to love."</p>
            <p>Bennett took "Indiana" as his special topic, but for a time it seemed that
                    correction of Edward Eggleston was his primary concern. "Despite Mr. Eggleston's
                    impression," he insisted, "our good old fathers and mothers were educated, not as
                    books count, but educated in industry, educated in honesty, educated in integrity, educated in
                    enterprise, educated in good morals, educated in all that makes noble men and noble
                        women."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Bennett then praised the accomplishments of distinguished
                    Hoosiers. Finding a native born son of <placeName>

                    </placeName> to include in this list was difficult, but Bennett came up with one: Edward J.

                    he said, carry passengers. Bennett told his audience that "Who knows but that this is
                    fulfillment of Mother Shipton's prophecy, only a little delayed, which runs somewhat as
                    follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Henry Miller was last on the program. The silvery haired man had been sitting in the audience
                    listening to Gavin, Willoughby, and Bennett. Like them he was a reader of books, but he carried no
                    notes filled with lists of statesmen and authors. He resolved to tell what it had been like, in
                    1833, when he first saw the land on which they were meeting: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>My father cut down a large poplar tree, perhaps six feet in diameter, and set forks in the
                            ground in front of it. From these forks to the tree poles were laid on cross poles and over
                            all was piled leafy branches of trees for a roof. My mother hung quilts and blankets around
                            for walls and our house was completed. All gathered up heaps of dry leaves, for there were
                            no straw or hair mattresses, and of these we made our beds. Then we felled the trees that
                            were right about us and that were in danger of falling upon our home, and then we were ready
                            to begin farming. The first year we cleared out the underbrush, cut down the smaller trees
                            and planted corn in the virgin soil that had never yet known a plow. We cultivated it with
                            hoes for two reasons; first, we could not get about among the logs with a plow, and, second,
                            because we had no plows.</p>
                        <p>In the fall we gathered our corn in baskets and carried it to the house, for in the meantime
                            we had cut and hewed logs and the neighbors had helped us raise a <list type="footnotes">

                    beginning to forget about the census. There were stories about the new Navy's recruiting
                    problems. Observers wondered about the international consequences of the recent failure of a Russian
                    loan. The controversy with Great Britain over the Bering Sea fur seals was disturbing. And the

                    Engel farm. A few years later the county rebuilt the highway, moving it to the front of the
                    monument, and the Armstrongs built a wall around the small square of land on which stood the stone.
                    For nearly fifty years the Armstrong family guarded the monument from souvenir hunters and told
                    visitors its story.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Since 1938 other families have taken over the task, and

                    they did not exaggerate the symbolic importance of the monument. The population center of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had required only a hundred years to travel from the Chesapeake Bay to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur County</region>
                    </placeName>, a distance of 505 miles, and it was to continue its westward movement after 1890,
                    staying close to the thirty-ninth parallel, as it had throughout the preceding century; but the
                    movement west was to be slower. Not until 1950 did the center pass beyond the narrow limits of
                    Indiana to a point near Olney, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, only 139 miles west of the 1890 marker. Turner was right in giving stress to the
                    disappearance of the frontier line, for the distribution of population among the sections of the
                    country had reached a certain stability by 1890. There was, indeed, much more land to be
                    homesteaded, but the most significant population movements of the next century were to be from the
                    country to the cities. Men were to think less about building new communities than about the
                    increasing population of communities already established. None of the speakers at the celebration of
                    May 10, 1891, seems to have mentioned Porter's bulletin about the disappearance of the
                    frontier line, the bulletin Turner was to make famous; but, as one reads their speeches recalling
                    the frontier and other experiences of a recent past, and as one notes their confidence in the future
                    of America, it seems that their words were even more appropriate for the day than their audience
                    knew.</p>

            <p>Curtis R. Burke's journal is a rare example of a southern soldier's record of his
                    participation in the Civil War as a member of John Hunt Morgan's cavalry and of his
                    experiences as a prisoner of war. The extant journal consists of 482 legal size—81/2 by
                    14 inches—typewritten pages; there is a four page preface and a daily record from Sunday,
                    October 5, 1862, to Wednesday, June 7, 1865. According to Mrs. Curtis E. Burke, the
                    author's daughter-in-law, this journal was prepared by Burke in 1914 at the age of
                    seventy-two using his notes—presumably the "journal" to which he
                    frequently refers—and his memories of men and events. Burke dictated the account to a
                    YMCA typist in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he had come to live with his son, Curtis E. Burke. The original notes have been
                    lost or destroyed, and no further information has been forthcoming about the actual composition of
                    the document which now exists.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Substantial portions of the first 214 pages of Burke's journal have been included in this
                    installment. The major actions cover Burke's enlistment, along with his father Edward D.
                    Burke, in Morgan's cavalry at <placeName>

                    Island on the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> on July 19, 1863. Much of the conditions and daily
                    life of the soldier necessarily has been omitted from this published version, but there is more than
                    enough to convey Burke's often acute perception, vivid description, and engagingly subtle
                    humor. Two further installments, scheduled for June and December, 1970, will give Burke's
                    account of his imprisonment in Camp Morton, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for almost a month and in Camp Douglas, <placeName>

                    says he joined in 1860. According to Basil W. Duke the group under Morgan "was composed of

                    Burke's father included, Morgan committed himself to the southern cause as a cavalry
                    commander on September 20, 1861. Duke asserts—as Burke does—that at that time
                    popular opinion around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>

                    </placeName> in the conflict. Neutrality seems to have been a compromise official position since
                    within the state there was an ambiguous mixture of reluctance to leave the Union and sympathy for
                    the states that could no longer tolerate the alleged coercion of that Union. The state senate
                    resolution of neutrality in April, 1861, reflects this sentiment: "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> will not sever her connection with the National Government, nor take up arms for either
                    belligerent party; but arm herself for the preservation of peace within her borders."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> During the summer of 1861, however, recruiting for the Union army began in the
                    state; armed forces were organized; and camps were established. Considering <placeName>

                    </placeName> on September 4, 1861. By the end of September the state government was committed to the
                    Union cause, and Morgan with many men of similar opinion had joined the Confederate forces in

            <p>The name of John Hunt Morgan came to be well known and revered by many southern sympathizers during
                    the Civil War and feared by Union loyalists in the border states of the Midwest where his cavalry
                    carried out its major operations. In Indiana, in particular, Morgan and Morgan's men after
                    the summer of 1863 were especially infamous and abhorred. For four or five days from July 8 through
                    July 12 or 13 approximately 2,000 cavalrymen under Morgan terrorized the southeastern portion of
                    Indiana before crossing into <placeName>

                    </placeName> and being dispersed by Federal troops seven days later. Accounts differ in the estimate
                    of success of the venture but seem to agree that the major activity of most of Morgan's men

                    major encounter on Indiana soil during the war.</p>
            <p>Burke's account of the Indiana raid agrees in substance with the version by Duke, one of
                    Morgan's staff officers, but the detail of the private soldier's existence during
                    the arduous venture adds much to the overall view presented by the officer. The relatively moderate
                    conduct of Burke and the men about whom he writes, Burke's humane concern for the people
                    whom he meets, and the practice he records of discrimination in stealing only from those who had
                    deserted their homes, for example, illustrates that the usual generalizations about the conduct of
                    Morgan's men possibly need modification, slight though it may be. The journal in addition
                    makes absolutely clear how grueling the forced march throughout the raid—from its
                    beginning in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>

                    himself and his horse along with other difficulties of the march.</p>
            <p>Burke's journal is a remarkable document, valuable for the personal record that it contains
                    of several important years of its author's life as well as for its record of the conflict
                    of which he was a part. The chronicle of events and the vignettes of people and places provide a
                    fine commentary on the times. Perhaps the most characteristic situation is the family divided by the
                    war: Burke and his father fighting together and imprisoned together several times see and are aided
                    by relatives on the Union side; not infrequently capture provides the occasion for a reunion of
                    friends and relatives who have been made enemies by their political choices. There are occasional
                    lapses of hindsight but they are few and not obtrusive. Although prepared fifty years after the
                    conflict, the journal manages to convey the immediacy of elation and despair at victory and defeat,
                    of concern and casualness about life and death which are the especial fruits of war.</p>

                                    the City Council a good many years. January 24th. 1860, my eighteenth birthday,
                                    found me a student of Fransylvania University<hi rend="sup">2</hi> where I had hopes
                                    of graduating in two more terms. About this time I got permission from Father to
                                    join Capt. John H. Morgans Company of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>

                                    drilling and turning out with the Company was cut off by my father taking me from
                                    school in the spring and sending me over to <placeName>

                                    (hired by him) had run off and left in trouble. I carried on the marble works until
                                    the following spring and then seeing that there was likely to be a war, father
                                    ordered me to break up and move the stock to his <placeName>

                                            followed exactly except as here indicated. Dates for the entries in the
                                            typescript are located on the right side of the page and divide the entries;
                                            dates are relocated in the text published here primarily to save space. Only
                                            a few very obvious typing errors have been corrected; otherwise the
                                            misspellings have been allowed to remain. It is impossible to determine
                                            whether these errors are the responsibility of Burke or his typist.
                                            Capitalization is also unchanged. Burke's use of the apostrophe in
                                            the possessive is quite erratic; the typescript is followed without change.

                                            elsewhere in the journal. Most of this information is derived from a roll
                                            call of the scouts of July 2, 1863, given on pages 168-70 of the typescript.

                                            if a significant number of pages has been omitted is the number given. These
                                            summaries include only events which Burke's journal relates; some
                                            information regarding names or places has been added from outside sources
                                            when fuller explanation in the summaries seems necessary or desirable. Page

                                    be brought to the Armory so one dark night, when I happened to be out of town,
                                    father and a good many of the company went to the Armory and packed the rifles and
                                    accoutrements, etc., in spring wagons and started them southward secretly with a
                                    guard. I did not get back home until the night after the guns left so my gun was
                                    left at home where I hid it. I wanted to go but father said that I would not likely
                                    be arrested and he wanted me to close up his business for him which I consented to
                                    do. Most of the company slipped out of the city one or two at a time for a week or

                                    had to get a few new hands to fill out the orders that were unfilled at the shop. I
                                    learned from Mr. Eugene Johns, one of our company that did not go, that he did not
                                    get his gun to the Armory before Morgan left, so he hid it at home and if I would
                                    call some night he would let me have it. There were a good many Federal Troops in
                                    the city then and he was afraid to keep it longer as there had been several calls
                                    made by the U.S. Provost Marshall<hi rend="sup">4</hi> for all the state arms to be
                                    delivered to him. I made an arrangement with Mr. Johns to be in an alley at his back
                                    fence and next to No. 1 City School one dark night and take his gun, etc. over the
                                    fence without seeing him or his seeing me, so that if either of us was arrested I
                                    could not swear who gave me the gun. Citizens were not allowed on the street after
                                    ten o'clock so I had to go before that time and as the fall nights were
                                    getting cool I had a good excuse for wearing a big overcoat. I made my way past a
                                    good many Yanks to the alley in the other side of the city near the old Masonic
                                    Temple and school house. I soon heard a light step on the other side of the fence
                                    and gave the fence a light tap and over came the guns and traps. Neither of us spoke
                                    and when I heard the footsteps on the other side of the fence move away, I then
                                    quickly took the gun-barrel off of the stock and stuffed it down one pants leg and

                                    so I made a forced ride to Harrodsberg and found the town full of Confederate Troops

                                    <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-065-4-046"/> morning when a brass band followed by cheering
                                    was heard on Main St. I had just finished dressing in my new gray suit to go to
                                    church with my cousin, Mrs. Myres, daughter of Judge Wm. Burke of Canton, O. I put
                                    on my hat and hurried down town to see what was up, and saw General Humphrey
                                    Marshall's army<hi rend="sup">8</hi> passing through in the direction of
                                    Harrodsburg. I noticed that the faces of all the southern citizens looked serious
                                    and inquiring. I asked what was the matter, some shook their heads and said that the
                                    rebels were skeedaddleing, others laughed and said it was all right, that the army
                                    was only gathering for a big fight. One of Marshall's men as he passed
                                    seeing me in uniform told me to get my gun and come on. I answered that I would get
                                    it soon enough that there was plenty of time. I turned towards home and met old man
                                    Thomas Woods who said that he was going to drive his spring wagon with provisions
                                    and clothing for himself, two sons and several others, and that they were going as
                                    Infantry with an <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                                    </placeName> regiment. He offered me a place with them and said that they expected
                                    to start that evening. I began to think things were coming to a pretty pass. I also
                                    met several friends with their guns and bundles. They said they were going wherever
                                    the army went and would not stay and live among the Yankee soldiers again. I noticed
                                    that there were a great many wagons collecting in the streets. When I got home it
                                    was about half past eleven and cousin had gone to meeting by herself. Mother gave me
                                    a blowing up for treating cousin so and I really felt ashamed of myself but consoled
                                    my conscience with the thought that the exciting times would be a sufficient apology
                                    for my neglect. I bundled up my things and put everything in shape for traveling,
                                    also cleaned my Minnie rifle well and put the sword bayonet away as it was too heavy
                                    to carry on horse-back. I went down again after dinner and found everybody on the
                                    move, some rigged up and others hunting for horses, saddles, bridles, etc. It seemed
                                    as if every secesh in town was agoing. <placeName>

                                    southern army left the state. I spent most of the evening trotting first down town
                                    and then back again after different articles that I thought I would need. During the
                                    whole day immense trains of wagons were loaded with provisions, goods, arms and
                                    forage, and sent off. I tried to get me a good horse but was disappointed so after
                                    supper I went down to the office where the arms and ammunition belonging to John H.

                                    ladies wanted to try and get permission to enter Murfreesboro by themselves, and get
                                    a mortally wounded brother from the Hospital and return outside of the lines again
                                    to us, but if they were refused, we were to escort them back immediately. I took
                                    dinner at the Tavern. I had no change and had to owe the lady fifty cents as that
                                    was the price per meal. Capt. Quirk chose Lieut. [Frank] Brady, myself, Ed Lonney
                                    [or Loney], Henry [W.] Beach and James Hicks to make the trip. We were all willing
                                    to make the trip, expecting a fine time. We saddled up, leaving all of our baggage
                                    off of our saddles, thinking that we would get back the next night, as it was only
                                    thirty miles distant. I left my blue overcoat, so did the rest. Henry Beach borrowed
                                    a dyed one that had been blue. We were afraid to trust them in sight of the Yanks.
                                    We carried our empty guns with us for fear the company might move while we were
                                    away. We made a white flag about a yard square and started. A little boy, the
                                    brother of the ladies, drove the buggy and we rode in front. We took the
                                    Murfreesboro pike passing through Aubern [<placeName>

                                    and put up at a farm house and stuck our white flag in the gate post so that there
                                    would be no danger of being surprised without a white flag in sight. We put our
                                    horses in the stable and gave them a good feed. In an hour we sat down to a good
                                    supper, and after chatting awhile with the family we were shown to a room and
                                    retired, and all hands had a good night's rest.</p>
                        <p>Sunday January 11th, 1863. We rose late and found that our flag had been stolen in
                                    the night from the gate post. I came to the conclusion that some darkie had stolen
                                    it for a pocket hankerchief. We fed our horses. Eat a good breakfast and saddled up.
                                    The lady of the house made us another big white flag on a piece of fishing pole, and
                                    we moved on. It was still 16 miles to Murfreesboro. We went to within 3 1/2 miles of

                                    we saw the Lt. of the picket coming. He told us to hand our arms to the squad and
                                    mount our horses and advance. We did not think this was right, but said nothing and
                                    did as ordered, but I hated to give up my old Ky. State Guard Minie rifle. We all
                                    rode to the picket base and halted, then the Lt. told us that he was ordered to hold

                                    General Rosecrans came to the door and took a look at us. I heard him muttering

                        <p>Monday January 12th, 1863. We got up early and made a fire, it was chilly. We thought
                                    they would certainly send us some breakfast, but no breakfast came. 12
                                    o'clock nothing to eat yet. We vowed and declared that we would starve the
                                    next Yank that fell into our hands. The guards said they were short of provisions
                                    themselves, and that a train of provision wagons was expected from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> that evening. About 4 o'clock this train arrived. It was a
                                    long one. About dusk they brought crackers, bacon, rice, and a candle. I missed my
                                    pocket book. The last time I used it was when I bought eggs three nights before in
                                    Liberty. I strongly suspected that the Yanks picked it from my pocket. It had about
                                    $65 (Confederate money) in it. We made a good fire and laid down and
                                    slept well.</p>

                        <p>Sunday January 25th, 1863. Cloudy. Spent most of the day writing. The balance played
                                    cards. After supper the guards brought us a bottle and a canteen full of whiskey at
                                    their own expense. I had never been drunk in my life and I told the boys that I
                                    would celebrate my 21st birth day by getting drunk just to see how a fellow felt,
                                    and as it would be the first time I would also make it the last time. The boys said
                                    all right they would let me know when I was drunk. They and the three guards drank
                                    and passed it to me every few minutes. I took light swallows which brought the tears
                                    every time, and soon began to feel a numness coming over me and when I spoke it
                                    sounded to me like I was down in a cistern, and my fingers tingled. The boys said
                                    that when I could not walk a crack in the floor I was drunk. So finally I got so I
                                    could not walk the crack. I could steady myself on it, and the boys decided that I
                                    was drunk. I spread down a blanket and one of the boys took my jacket for a pillow,
                                    and I slept until midnight when I woke up sick in my stomach. I rolled over and
                                    threw up on a crack in the floor by my side and took an old newspaper from my jacket
                                    to clean the floor, but was still so unsteady that I made a bad out of it and gave
                                    it up. Hicks got drunk and danced on our rations of coffee, scattering it and the
                                    crackers all over the house. Beach and Lonney were not quite so drunk. Both of the
                                    guards and several others were tight also. I went to sleep again and left the
                                    balance of the boys singing.</p>

                                    morning some ladies came to see the prisoners, and took some Confederate money out
                                    in the city for the boys and traded it off at the brokers for green-back,<hi rend="sup">18</hi> allowing forty or fifty cents in green-back to the dollar.
                                    This was a great sacrifice, but the boys wanted change to buy something to eat. Boys
                                    and girls with baskets of pies, apples, cheese, cakes, crackers, and sausage for
                                    sale. It was very cool. There was but one stove without fire in it in the room. They
                                    would not furnish any wood, so we commenced tearing down the window frames and
                                    burning them, and they soon furnished us wood plenty. It was market day and I saw
                                    six cleaned turkeys from a wagon stolen one at a time by Yanks soldiers, hardly an
                                    arm's length from the owner. We hollowed and told the owner that the Yanks
                                    were stealing turkeys from his wagon, but he paid no attention to us, thinking that
                                    we were only joking with him….</p>

                                    men. Whiskey was not allowed in the prison, but the ladies were not to be beaten.
                                    They would tie canteens and bottles of spirits to their legs, then when they got in

                                    the boys that had green back money sent out and got one dollars worth of bread each
                                    and divided it in the car with the boys. I could see the earth fortifications and
                                    the Federal flag back of town on our right. We moved on. It was sometime after dark
                                    when we passed Munfordsville, Ky. The moon came out, and as we passed Nolin bridge I
                                    saw the very pannels of fence where I had taken planks to burn the bridge and
                                    stockade on our Christmas raid. I thought of the good supper I got at Mr. Monins

                                    for emergencies. We got out of the cars and marched up to Barracks No. 1, and after
                                    standing about an hour in the yard we were passed four at a time into a room and
                                    were searched. Our spurs, pocket knives and money were taken by the officers in
                                    command of the prison. We were then taken to our quarters in a long plank building

                                    our quarters. We went through the same operation for supper. I and Ed. Lonney made
                                    our bed together. I was very sleepy and slept well regardless of the lousy bunks.</p>

                                    smaller and shallower than I expected to find it. We asked the guards in the car if
                                    we might sing a song. They said they did'nt care a dam, crack loose. So we

                        <p>The guards took the song in good part. I was shown North Mountain. We stopped at
                                    Martinsberg [Martinsburg] Station. The people said that the rebels had never been
                                    higher up in the country than that place. After leaving here I saw where the
                                    railroad had been burned for about forty miles. Every bit was burned, and the rails
                                    laid in piles, all warped up. Our train switched off five or six times letting three
                                    or four trains of coal pass each time. The engines were all curious looking

                        <p>The buildings seem to have been very large. A part of one of the buildings had been
                                    patched up for a store room. The train passed over the new trussel over the Potomac
                                    river. It was not completed. They were working on it then. It was a plain timber
                                    trussel. I saw the pillers of the old trussel that was burnt down and they showed
                                    signs of their being once a splendid piece of work in the shape of a trussel. There
                                    was a pontoon bridge just above, made of boats fastened together for wagons and
                                    horses to cross on. The tops of the boats were flat and fit close together. As soon

                        <p>The boys were all in a jolly mood. There was a large Yankee camp on the heights
                                    overlooking the ferry. The cars stopped soon after crossing, and the people from the
                                    houses on the side of the road brought plates of provisions to the car windows (we
                                    were in passenger cars) to the boys. We next passed through <placeName>

                                    some with them. I could see a monument near a bridge on the <placeName>

                                    There was twelve or fifteen boys that followed the cars three squares to where it
                                    stopped beging for just one Southern button. An old gray haired man followed us a
                                    square for a button. The boys that had Southern State seal buttons cut every one
                                    from their coats and gave them away. In a little while some ladies came up with
                                    baskets of provisions. A lady keeping a saloon opposite of us gave the boys as much
                                    beer and ale in their canteens as they could drink under pretence of giving them
                                    water. The police and guards were very strict. The ladies had commenced handing in
                                    clothing to our boys when the guards from Ft. McHenry<hi rend="sup">22</hi> came up
                                    to take charge of us and stopped it. A gentleman was about to hand in something when
                                    he was struck by a Yank who called [him] a dammed sesesh and hallowed for the Union.
                                    The guards then formed in two lines and we marched between them through several
                                    crowded streets. It was about dark, we marched out to Ft. McHenry about three miles

                                    Quirk's scouts at Liberty on March 6. With the scouts Burke remains in

                                    pleasant and there are even a few eggnog parties. The scouts go out on several short

                        <p>Tuesday July 7th, 1863. Weather clear. I opened all my letters by sun up and had been
                                    very successful having sixty six dollars and seventy five cents in all in greenbacks
                                    which I stuffed in my pocketbook with eighty dollars in Confederate money. I found
                                    about a dozen different pictures of Yankee officers and soldiers in the letters and
                                    kept them, also I did not read a single letter. A good many of the boys had found
                                    something, most of them less and some more than I did. We fed our horses from the
                                    crib and saddled up and moved off in the direction of <placeName>

                                    of getting a fresh horse as my old C. S. horse began to show signs of giving out. We
                                    went about five miles crossing the <placeName>

                                    back. I and one of the men rode up to a house and asked where their horses were,
                                    they said that they had nothing but colts and old mares in the field. This did not
                                    satisfy us so I went to the stable and examined it, but found nothing in it. We
                                    asked if they had anything cold to eat in the house, they said yes, and invited us
                                    in. We went in and eat a piece of meat and bread, drank a glass or two of milk then
                                    caught up with our party of eight or ten. We all stopped at a spring house and got
                                    as much milk as we could drink. We had four or five horses, but none that I would

                                    I succeeded in passing several regiments when I found myself in a little town called
                                    Meadville. The rear guard of the next regiment did not want to let me pass so I had
                                    to flank them and go ahead. Just after leaving town (Meadville) I received the
                                    benefit of a hard shower of rain. I came up with the General and staff. Not wishing
                                    to crowd past I rode leisurely along and soon came up with my regiment dismounted to
                                    rest in the woods. I had hardly dismounted and tied my horses when the regiment
                                    moved forward again. I led the horse awhile and gave it to Henry [Harrison] White
                                    who gave his tired horse to Robert Reeves [or Reves] negro boy to ride. I took my
                                    place in ranks again. Ed [Edward] Golgin [or Colgan] my partner in ranks asked me to
                                    let him see a fifty cent greenback bill, I pulled out my pocketbook and showed him
                                    one then stuffed my pocketbook down as I thought securely in my pantaloon's
                                    pocket again. We were riding briskly. We heard that our scouts had captured two

                                    the fence corners. I was very sleepy and took a short nap. I woke up and found that
                                    all of the boys except horse holders<hi rend="sup">26</hi> had marched down into the

                                    </placeName> to skirmish with some home guards across the river. They had overlooked
                                    me in wakeing the boys up. They all soon came back without any fighting and we
                                    mounted and went into camp in a lot near by. A detail was sent out to get something
                                    for us to eat. A corn detail brought in a little corn and I got a few ears for my
                                    horse. We made no camp fires for fear of drawing the attention of the Yanks. I made
                                    my bed down in a fence corner and was soon asleep. The night air was chilly. A
                                    considerable frost [?] fell in the night.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday July 8th, 1863. Weather cloudy. We fed our horses early and had a slight
                                    shower of rain. The bread detail brought in some bread and meat. A shell from the
                                    Indiana side of the river passed over our camp and small arms could be heard at the
                                    river. We saddled up to shift our position out of range. The lady living next to us
                                    was very much scared by the shell and cried out, "Oh is this war! Are you
                                    going to have a battle." We moved into a woodland hollow and dismounted to
                                    rest. Some of the boys were looking at some greenbacks. I felt for my pocketbook and
                                    it was gone. I had an idea at once that it had fallen from my pocket when I put it

                                    night and other places but could not find it and gave it up as lost, which left me
                                    without a cent of either greenbacks or Confederate. I took a canteen and walked a
                                    short distance to town for water, then went down where our artillery was planted. It
                                    was planted by the side of the Courthouse, a square brick building and pointed up
                                    stream toward a Yankee gunboat which was standing still just around a be[n]d in full
                                    view but out of close range. The Courthouse was on very high ground next to the
                                    river making a beautiful position for artillery. The artillerymen were sitting
                                    around their steel pieces waiting for the gunboat to come closer. The gunboat looked
                                    to me like a steamboat boxed up and painted black with portholes.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> All this time the captured steamboats Alice Dean and Ben McCombs in our

                                    up. The home guard Colonel<hi rend="sup">28</hi> mounted a stump and cried out,
                                    "I demand you to surrender and bring those boats over here in the name of

                                    answered "Oh hell old man come over and take a drink." The home
                                    guards then let loose with their muskets and fired their steel piece at one of the
                                    boats, but the shell struck the water short of their mark, but our artillery then
                                    drove them away from their piece before they could fire more than twice. Then two
                                    boat loads of our troops crossed and drove them clear off. A couple of our brass
                                    pieces was sent up the river on the <placeName>

                                    across they went up the river on their side also to look out for transports. When my
                                    regiment's turn came to cross we moved down into town and halted. I tried
                                    to get a new pair of boots at a store but failed. We moved down to the boats to go
                                    aboard when the gunboat suddenly dropped down stream and commenced shelling us. Our
                                    boats dropped down stream out of range and our regiment left town again. The

                                    around the bend, then we returned to the wharf again. The boats came up and we were
                                    crowded on the two boats besides part of the artillery. I expected every minute that
                                    the gunboat would come around the bend and shell us again before we could get
                                    across, but we landed safely and a barrel of crackers was issued to us. I was put

                                    It was getting dark and the cannon pulling detail was dismissed. We found our

                                        captives…. There were 'Union bushwhackers' and

                                    guard was fired on by men in the bushes who would fire and run. Our advance guard

                                    Capt. Hines<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Co. was killed from a house. Hutty Hutchison [M.
                                    Hutcherson] and several others of my company received orders to burn the house.
                                    Hutchison went in and the woman declared that there was no men or arms in the house
                                    and begged Hutchison not to burn the house. He paid no attention to her but got fire
                                    from the stove and commenced fireing the beds and bookcase. In a few minutes the old
                                    man and young son came bouncing down stairs and tried to put the fire out. Hutchison
                                    attempted to stop the old man and the old fellow then pitched into him and tried to
                                    take his carbine from him. In the scuffle Hutchison found that the old man was
                                    stronger than he was and determined to use his carbine if he could. He soon managed
                                    to get the muzzle of his gun against the old man's thigh and fired. The old
                                    man still contended for the gun. Hutchison called to Huston [T.V.H.] Garvin to shoot
                                    him! shoot him!! Garvin then cocked his gun and pressed the muzzle against the old
                                    man's side. The old man instantly released his grip on the gun and said
                                    "I give up." Being weak from his wound he staggered out and laid
                                    down in the yard. The flow of blood could not be stopped and the old man soon bled
                                    to death. By this time the house was all in flames. The women made a great fuss over
                                    it. There seems to have been a good many loaded guns in the upper story of the house
                                    for a good many reports were distinctly heard above the roar of the flames. During
                                    the above transaction the regiment was halted in the road. We then received orders
                                    to go on a scout to the right of Corydon. A guide was furnished us and we took a
                                    road to the right through the woods and went a mile or so when the advance caught
                                    sight of some bushwhackers and we all put out after them on a double quick. Turning
                                    a corner to the right at a house where some women and children were crying I saw a
                                    fine pair of boots on the side of the road that some of the boys ahead had dropped.
                                    I thought that I would have time to stop and get them so I rode out dismounted and
                                    got them. Just then a heavy volley was fired into us from the woods just about stone
                                    throw ahead. My horse was restless and before I could mount the rear of my company
                                    closed up and dismounted to fight and I could not get to my place in the first
                                    section. I was holding my horse and five or six bridle reins was partly forced into

                                    his foot shattered, Charles Bess [or Best] got a deep graze on the side of his head,
                                    both on the advance guard. R. S. Porter of Co. C got a shot in his hand, L. P. Thorp
                                    badly wounded in the shoulder. The wounded and a couple of prisoners that we had
                                    captured in the skirmish were sent to the rear. Then we all mounted and took a road
                                    to the right through the woods on a double quick, the guide keeping in front with
                                    the advance and the advance from twenty five to a hundred yards in advance of the
                                    regiment. We went about three miles bearing a little to the left when the advance
                                    vidett sent word back that the bushwhackers were ahead. We galloped into a large
                                    stubble field and formed a line in the center of the field on a double quick. As
                                    fast as the companies got into line they dismounted to fight, then we double quicked
                                    about fifty yards to the top of a little rize in front of a house which brought us
                                    within a hundred yards of a clump of trees where a group of about a dozen mounted
                                    men had just ridden up. "There they are give it to them boys" ran
                                    along our line. I had a fair shot they broke without returning the fire leaving one
                                    man dead. We followed them a hundred yards or so loading as we run. Some got two
                                    shots. I did not get a second. We could see the bushwhackers and home guards
                                    galloping past us on the pike some distance below us into Corydon. We could see
                                    Corydon on our left. Our horses came up and we mounted and went to the pike, then
                                    took to the right down the pike about two hundred yards to a house. The regiment
                                    formed behind the house in an orchard and company B (My company) dismounted and got
                                    in an old log stable on the side of the pike to keep the Yanks from escaping from
                                    town on that road as our forces were all around the town and we felt sure of taking
                                    it. We had a clear view of the pike for about two hundred yards and good cracks
                                    between the logs of the stable to shoot from both below and in the left. I laid a
                                    lot of my cartridge in a trough before me hoping to get a chance to use them soon.
                                    We waited about half an hour, but one person made his appearance and we captured him
                                    and returned to the regiment. There was a dozen or so home guards came up the pike
                                    from the country but on seeing us they halted. The boys hollowed to them to come on,
                                    that we would whip the robbers and etc. So they took it for granted that we were
                                    home guards also, so they came right up and were very much surprised when they were
                                    informed that they were prisoners in the hands of Morgan's men. There was
                                    another lot came in sight and halted. The boys had a considerable argument whether
                                    they were our men or Yanks. We all looked so much alike. We knew that there was
                                    other scouts out from the command besides ourselves. We tried to call this second
                                    lot to us, but they would not come. Some of the boys saw bayonets in their crowd and
                                    decided they were Yanks and fired at them <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-065-4-064"/> and
                                    they broke back. One of the first prisoners said that there was a wagon load of
                                    provisions cooked just behind the party that we drove back and that if we had fired
                                    we would have captured the wagon. The boys regretted very much not getting hold of
                                    the wagon. The prisoners said that they were going to Gorydon in compliance with a
                                    general order to help drive the rebels out of the country.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
                                    They were on foot. Some of the officers parolled them to go back home. Then we
                                    mounted and moved towards Corydon falling in with one of our regiments coming from
                                    the direction that we had come. We stopped at a place where about two companies of
                                    the enemy had surrendered and ground their arms. Several of us tried to trade off
                                    our old muskets for better guns, but the guards over them would not let us change.
                                    We received the news that Corydon had been surrendered, and moved on. As we passed
                                    through the toll gate I saw among a scared looking group of women and children the
                                    large lady that lived at the house where we fed that morning. She hollowed to us
                                    "Oh Please don't kill anybody or burn the town everybody has
                                    surrendered." As we entered Corydon we sung The Bonnie Blue Flag. As we
                                    passed through town I noticed that every house was shut up and our men and the
                                    prisoners some seven or eight hundred in number were crowded in the streets. The
                                    houses were mostly white frame buildings. It is not a very large place but a
                                    tolerable good looking place. We took the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                                    </placeName> pike dismounting to fight five or six times in an hour. At one place my
                                    company was thrown out as skirmishers and went to a house looking for some home
                                    guards that went in that direction. The lady said that about twenty five men just
                                    passed the house five minutes before. Several of us got all the cold meat and bread
                                    on hand. The lady said that herself and husband had never openly taken sides on
                                    either side, but stood neutral. We went no farther but returned to our regiment. At
                                    another place the advance came to a halt on a rise in the road. There was some
                                    mounted home guards near a house and stable in a bottom, cleared piece of land. My
                                    company was sent around the hillside to the left through the woods to get in their
                                    rear. The woods was very thick with undergrowth. We could scarcely keep our seats in
                                    the saddle riding single file. We got into the position we wished but the game had
                                    fled with but two exceptions. The advance fired on them and got their horses. We
                                    galloped to the next house and halted till all got up, then moved on passing through
                                    the village of Palmyra, Ind. and halted to camp two miles beyond, about dusk at a
                                    good looking house. We were all ver/tired and getting sleepy. Myself, Wm. Gibbons,
                                    Henry White and others was called out on a detail for picket before going into camp.
                                    We immediately went down the road to the next house about a quarter of a mile and
                                    made it our base. There was a cross <list type="footnotes">

                                    pickets stood. The family at the house were Dutch. We got plenty corn for our horses
                                    and meat, bread, milk, cheese, and butter for ourselves, and no charge. One of the
                                    boys gave him a pair of ladies slippers as a present. He professed to be a little
                                    secesh but had to keep neutral. I and Henry White made a bed near our horses of our

                                    together from three o'clock till five o'clock. We could hear bells
                                    ringing and cars whistleing all through the night. Just before sun up the advance of
                                    the command commenced passing and we were relieved, but remained at the picket base.</p>
                        <p>Friday July 10th, 1863. Weather clear. We fed our horses and got some meat and bread.
                                    By this time our regiment came up and we took our places in ranks. Our regiment was
                                    in the rear of the first Brigade and in advance of the second Brigade. The city of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Ind. surrendered before we got there without much opposition. The
                                    courthouse and pavement was crowded with home guard prisoners. They were being
                                    parolled and turned loose as fast as possible. We got some fresh horses here. I gave
                                    up my broken down G. S. horse for a heavy made road pony. Some of our men rigged up
                                    a new wagon with new harness and fresh horses and filled it with captured
                                    ammunition. We passed on to the village of Canton, Ind. about three miles distant
                                    and halted on a side street. We fed our horses from a crib which the boys soon
                                    cleared on a double quick. Whenever we stop to feed the boys all break for the corn
                                    or whatever we intend feeding on and each get as much as he can carry
                                    notwithstanding he may know at the time that his horse will not eat half of his
                                    load, but in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> the forage is mostly issued to us and we get twelve ears of corn or two
                                    bundles of oats. Tap [J. Tap.] Carpenter got two pair of new boots and gave me one
                                    pair of No. sixes. The boys took six or seven pair of boots from a shoemaker shop
                                    and when the lady of the place found it out she took on like a lunatic, screaming
                                    and beating her head with her fists. Two stores were opened and some things were
                                    sold to us, but most of the tricks we got we did not pay for. When one got more of
                                    anything than he needed he divided it with the rest of the boys. Part of the boys
                                    eat dinner at houses in town, but I was not so fortunate. We had captured
                                    buttercrackers and cheese issued to us. As soon as our horses were done eating we
                                    mounted and left on the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vienna</settlement>
                                    </placeName> road. Jack [John] Curd was my partner. He was the life of the first
                                    section and in fact the whole company. I was generally sleepy and Curd would always
                                    wake me up with his nonsence. My pony proved to be too hard a rider for the service,
                                    so I gave him up and took Sergeant [W. O.] Tuggle's <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName> horse. He was thin and pretty well broken down but a good fast riding
                                    horse. Late in the evening we were riding along a high ridge road. The country in
                                    sight was hilly. As we were going down hill at the end of the ridge we could see
                                    some mounted home guards raising a <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-065-4-066"/> dust a half
                                    mile ahead in the road on the next hill. The advance guard pitched out after them
                                    under spur and we followed at a lively gate. A little beyond the top of the hill we
                                    captured a spring wagon and a fine pair of horses. A little farther on a dead home
                                    guard lay in a fence corner. The advance guard had charged into a home guard company
                                    here and scattered them. We rode a few miles farther picking up some men with axes
                                    going to appointed places to blockade the road to stop our onward progress. They
                                    were sent to the rear to be parolled. Then the regiment halted and my company was
                                    ordered to take the advance to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vienna</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Ind. where we were expected to capture a train of cars. It was five
                                    miles to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vienna</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. We started off at a gallop. At every half mile or less we met from two
                                    to ten men with axes. We did not stop but sent them to the rear. We captured two
                                    more wagons. Our speed enabled us to take everybody by surprise. The people did not
                                    know that we were in the neighborhood till they saw us. We charged into <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vienna</settlement>
                                    </placeName> the citizens and a lot of the ax squad were completely surprised and
                                    made no resistance. All of the roads were immediatedly picketed and the stables
                                    searched before more than a dozen of the companies had came up. A large Yankee flag
                                    hung over the street. We soon tore it down. We went around inquiring for arms and
                                    ammunition. Several of us got into a little grocery, but took nothing. I and Ed
                                    Lonney came across two home guard horses saddled, bridled and hitched to the fence.
                                    We tried them and found them unfit for the service, so we left them hitched. I
                                    hitched my horse and went to the nearest house to get something to eat. I knocked at
                                    the door and found the lady and children crying. They said that we would burn the
                                    house. Of course, I went to work contradicting the opinion of our men. I told them
                                    that the prisoners we had in town would be immediately paroled and set at liberty. I
                                    had cause to suspicion that the head of the family was among the prisoners. They set
                                    out a couple of crocks of milk, some bread, butter and preserves. I eat a hearty
                                    supper and left the family in a more tranquil state of mind. I t was dusk by this
                                    time. I rode down to the railroad and found my company dismounted and deployed along
                                    the railroad expecting a train of cars. Myself, William [V.] Sloan and three others
                                    was detailed to tear up the railroad track a mile from town. We dismounted and gave
                                    our horses in charge of the horseholders. Then got a couple of crow bars and set out
                                    on foot across the railroad bridge down the railroad. The bushes on both sides was
                                    high and thick, just the place for bushwhackers. We went about a half mile and went
                                    to work, keeping our guns within arms reach. We took up two rails one on each side
                                    in two places, then laid them down putting the ends against the track in the
                                    direction that the train was expected and the other ends about eight inches of[f],
                                    throwing the rails away to prevent the break from being detected by the engineer.
                                    The track was perfectly straight for a mile and the smallest objects could be
                                    plainly seen by any light as strong as those carried on the front of <pb n="311" id="VAA4025-065-4-067"/> locomotives for a long distance. We worked hard,
                                    expecting the train every minute. One of the rails fell on my foot in bursting them
                                    up which did not feel very pleasant. We started back and saw a fire on the railroad
                                    at the crossing at town. At first we did not know what to make of it. We knew that
                                    the train would not come into our trap when they saw the fire, but on approaching
                                    nearer we saw that our boys were burning the bridge. The hour for the train was
                                    passed and it had been given out they had taken alarm and stopped. We mounted our
                                    horses then and fell in line. The command had just caught up. We moved off and as we
                                    went through town I fell out and took one of the home guard horses that I had tried
                                    that evening, and mounted him intending to lead my tired horse till we camped for
                                    the night, then give it to some dismounted man. It moved so slow and led so bad that
                                    I soon found I was getting behind in spite of my vigorous spuring and whiping. I got
                                    mixed up with one of the regiments. I then rode out to one side and mounted my old
                                    horse again and lead the other, but the change did not facilitate my progress much
                                    as it would not lead well. It came near pulling me off my horse several times, but I
                                    determined to hold to it. After riding an hour or so we halted in the suburbs of the
                                    town of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Ind. The report was that the Yanks were in town and we were going to
                                    fight them. I let my lead horse go and rode forward to find my company. I fell in
                                    and we moved through town without any disturbance and camped a mile beyond in a lane
                                    and lot. We had to go a half mile after corn. It was very dark. Most of the boys did
                                    not feed at all. I and another fellow went and got some corn. It was as much as I
                                    could do to find my way there and back. The camp was in a low went [wet?] place. I
                                    slept on a pile of rails.</p>
                        <p>Saturday July 11th, 1863. Weather pleasant. We got up early and saddled up. The
                                    report was that the Yanks had passed near us that morning. We went back to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Ind. and hitched our horses to the fence around the courthouse, then
                                    fed them from the hotel stable crib. I learned that the Yankee cavalry had actually
                                    entered town very early that morning not knowing that our men had possession of the
                                    place, but as soon as they found it out, they left in a hurry, before the Gen. who
                                    saw them had time to have them attacked. <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> is a small place. The courthouse is a plain square building enclosed in
                                    a circular white fence. Sergeant [Wm.] Miller and Tuggle bursted open the door of a
                                    confectionary store. The company pitched in and soon cleaned it out. I got a box of
                                    peanuts, some cakes, candy, cove oysters, cheese, etc. We all got as much as we
                                    could eat and store about us. It was late when we mounted and took the Vernon road
                                    singing Morgan's Northern Raid Song.</p>

                        <p>We halted in a little town called <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                                    </placeName> for fifteen minutes. It was very hot and dusty. A man from each section
                                    gathered all the canteens in the section and fell out and filled them with water. I
                                    fell out several times for that purpose. Once the regiment got a mile or two ahead
                                    and I had to do some hard riding to catch up. I noticed several sign boards with
                                    familiar names of towns such as, Winchester, <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>,
                                            <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                           </placeName>, etc. We halted <pb n="313" id="VAA4025-065-4-069"/> to rest a few minutes several times. About dusk
                                    we came in sight of Vernon, Ind. then took through the woods on our right. It was
                                    reported that there was too many Yanks in town to attack the place. General Morgan
                                    ordered an old cason to be burned. It was backed into a hollow and a man made a fire
                                    around it. In a few minutes it burst with a loud noise, fortunately hurting no
                                    person. The man did not examine the cason before fireing it and a shell was left in
                                    it. At first the boys thought that the Yanks were shelling us from town. We rode
                                    over a road cut up with gullies. The night was very dark and the boys kept getting
                                    into them. We had to call one another to keep together in our places. We halted
                                    about midnight, and camped near a house on the right where Col. Morgan put up. We
                                    hitched along the fence and made our beds in the corners on the opposite side. I
                                    slept very well.</p>
                        <p>Sunday July 12th, 1863. Weather cloudy. We had a light shower early in the morning.
                                    Com was very scarce, but I managed to get a few ears for my horse. We saddled up and
                                    moved on to old Vernon or Dupont, Ind. and crossed the railroad with halting in
                                    town, but as we did so nearly all of our regiment broke ranks and went to a depot or
                                    warehouse where there was a lot of canvass hams said to be Yankee property, that is
                                    government property. We got a ham or two each. We had eat nothing that morning and
                                    were hungry. I took a ham and carried it in front of me. As I left I noticed some
                                    cars burning. In about an hour or so the yellow began to rub off of the hams on the
                                    boys cloths, and they began to throw them away. We were riding lively. Some would
                                    cut out a few choice pieces and throw the balance away. I held on to mine for some
                                    time longer, then cut a haversack full of the dryest and leanest portions and left
                                    the balance on a fence post. Some of the hams were dropped in the road and left,
                                    others were given away at houses on the road. We had fine sandy roads to travel on.
                                    The horse pressing details never stopped for an hour. As we moved on every stable
                                    and lot was searched in sight and some times several miles off of the road. We
                                    halted in the suburbs of the town of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Versailles</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Ind. on Laugherty river [Laughery Creek], and a guard put ahead to
                                    keep the boys from going into town till the Gen. and staff were ready for us. The
                                    boys wanted to get into town very bad. Some wanted one thing and some another.
                                    Everyone wanted something. The stragglers flanked us on the right heavily. I could
                                    see them going into town by way of a lane on our right in a gallop. I led my horse
                                    through a gap on the right into a deep grass lot and let him graze. I eat a snack of
                                    raw ham and bread. In half an hour we moved into town and halted a few minutes in
                                    front of a beer saloon. The women gave us all of the cold meat and bread in the
                                    house, also some cheese, crackers, and beer. We then moved on. The advance had a
                                    little skirmish with some home guards and run them killing one and wounding several.
                                    The regiment dismounted to fight several times without getting into a fight. At one
                                    place <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-065-4-070"/> I went to a house within stone throw and
                                    got a piece of meat and bread, and wash the dust off of my face and hands. The
                                    regiment commenced moving and I hurried back to my horse. The regiment halted about
                                    twelve o'clock near a little village on the railroad in a lot. We hitched
                                    to the fence and got corn from a stable. I went to the nearest house to see if I
                                    could not bum something to eat, but I was not fast enough, as the house was full of
                                    burners like myself, and they had eaten everything that was cooked on the place. I
                                    then tried to get something cooked but was beaten in that also. The women had more
                                    cooking engaged than they could do before night. I took a good wash and returned to
                                    the regiment. A load of oats was hauled to us, but we had to move before we had time
                                    to feed them to our horses. We crossed the railroad and travelled steady all evening
                                    and came in sight of the City of Harrison, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>. We were on a high range of hills still in Indiana. The road led to the
                                    right down the side of the hill. At the foot of the hills run the White water river
                                    and a canal. Beyond was the city of Harrison and a large rick [rich?] valley like
                                    strip of bottom land, which was cultivated mostly in corn. The finest of the season
                                    that I had seen. The scenery would make a splendid picture for an artist. As we
                                    wound our way to the bottom of the hill I looked up and back at our long string of
                                    horsemen displayed against the face of the hill and felt proud of them. We crossed
                                    the river and canal bridge and quietly entered the city. A wagon was seen to leave
                                    hurridly. James [C] Beeler was sent to bring it back. We halted in the main street
                                    with orders to keep in our places, but a good many of the boys slipped out and went
                                    in search of horses. They and the pressing detail brought in a good many fresh
                                    horses. I got a stout heavy made draft horse, and gave my broken down horse to a
                                    citizen. The houses were nearly all closed. We left the city and went three miles on
                                    the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> pike, halted and fed near a house from a crib. McGillet [John
                                    McGillick] and Boll [D. R.] Shindler both of my company had a little fight about
                                    some cheese that was sent by commissary Henry Moore from town to be distributed to
                                    the company, but it was made way with before reaching our camp. Col. Dick Morgan
                                    parted them. Ben [Bennet H.] Young cooked for the Col. as there was no person to
                                    cook at the house. I went over and eat a good dinner with Ben Young. Commissary
                                    Henry Moore went to a little village in sight ahead of us and got some more cheese,
                                    then we all had plenty of cheese and butter crackers issued to us. We then moved on
                                    passing through some thickly settled country. In some places there was small
                                    settlements of neat looking houses mostly inhabited by Dutch. We had good roads to
                                    travel on. At one time we came near going to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> through mistake. We were within three miles of the city, and our
                                    advance drove the Yankee vidett into the city. We then turned back and took another
                                    road. Our object was to go around <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. We travelled all night passing through several towns that I did not
                                    learn the names of. The boys got so sleepy that they would sometimes go fast to
                                    sleep riding along. About midnight <pb n="315" id="VAA4025-065-4-071"/> Gen. Morgan
                                    halted us at a house. The Gen. wished some information. It was some time before the
                                    man of the house could be roused, and he wanted to know how on earth we ever got
                                    there. Most of us got off of our horses and laid in the fence corners and tied or
                                    held the reins while we took a nap. I laid on the hard side of some rails and took a
                                    nap, and was awakened by the fence tumbling down on me and my horse, and the next
                                    horse fighting over me. When we were ready to start half of the regiment had to be
                                    aroused from slumbers that they so much needed. A few strayed off to[o] far in fence
                                    corners or other places and were left behind asleep. Every now and then could be
                                    heard the wish of some sleepy horseman for only a few minutes sleep. Everybody was
                                    kept in ranks.</p>
                        <p>Monday July 13th, 1863. Weather pleasant. Daylight still found us on the march. The
                                    regiment passed through Miamiville, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> without halting. Six of us was detailed to stop and collect some axes.
                                    We then went to the houses each getting an ax, then double quicked to the front. The
                                    horse pressing and buming for something to eat was still carried on. On approaching
                                    a house, milk was generally asked for first. We were death on milk. We forded a
                                    creek and companies B. and C. took a guide and went down the creek to capture a
                                    train of cars. The balance of the command went up the creek. We went a short
                                    distance, took down a fence on our left and went through a pasture, then took down
                                    another fence and went through a corn field, which brought us to a fence next to the
                                    railroad at a cow-gap. We dismounted and hitched our horses, then all set briskly to
                                    work piling logs, fence rails, etc. into the gap, and cutting the telegraph wires
                                    and posts. We had the pile at the gap about three feet above the track and still
                                    pileing on logs and ties on the rails with a little fire put under them. When
                                    someone hollowed "The trains coming mount your horses". We dropped
                                    everything and broke for our horses. I got to my horse picked up my gun and untied
                                    my horse. The cars were so close on us that I did not think that I would have time
                                    to mount before the cars got to us, and I expected they were full of Yankee infantry
                                    who would give us a volley, so I took up a row of corn leading my horse. The corn
                                    was higher than my head. As the train passed I looked back and saw the locomotive
                                    smash up. My horse got scared and pulled loose from me and went ahead. I was in
                                    hopes that he would strike the gap in the fence and go into the pasture, but when I
                                    got there I could not find him. I saw <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pa</region>
                                    </placeName> without his horse also. He said that his horse had thrown him. Near
                                    half of the two companies was without their horses. The cars came on us so suddenly
                                    and so fast that they could not get to their horses. I saw that the train was a
                                    passenger train with no armed men on it, so I and several others went back in search
                                    of our horses. Sergeant <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                                    </placeName> of company B. went to the train with a flag of truce and received the
                                    surrender of the train and passengers. I found several things that the boys had
                                    dropped. A lot of company C's horses were still hitched to the fence where
                                    their <pb n="316" id="VAA4025-065-4-072"/> owners had left them. Failing to find my
                                    horse there I went back to the pasture and found one of company C. on my horse. I
                                    mounted him and rode over to the train to help burn it. The locomotive lay on the
                                    right of the track about twenty yards from the cowgap, a complete mass of ruins. I
                                    never saw a locomotive so badly used up before as this was. The baggage car was not
                                    so roughly handled and the balance of the train was still on the track. The engineer
                                    was killed and one or two others wounded by the smash up. Most of the passengers
                                    were men on their way to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to help defend the place. We let all but a few go where they pleased
                                    with paroling them. While fireing the cars I got a good bed cumfort that was left by
                                    one of the would be soldiers, and put it under my saddle. While this was going on a
                                    scout of our boys went down to the bridge nearly in sight and run up on eight Yankee
                                    pickets or guards playing cards in the bridge. Our boys fired on them and charged
                                    them. The Yanks were panic stricken and took to their heels without fireing a shot,
                                    every man for himself. One man was captured and all eight of the horses. The horses
                                    were fresh, all rigged up with new cavalry saddles and rigging. One of the horses
                                    was wounded. The bridge was about five miles from Gamp Dennison, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>. All the boys got together and we went to the regiment. One of the
                                    other regiments took a passenger train also, in a short time after we took ours. We
                                    passed through several little villages and halted at a stable and got corn to feed
                                    on, but provisions for ourselves was scarce. We kept moving a little and halting.
                                    Each time we would dismount to rest to make it easy on our horses as well as
                                    ourselves. The bushwhackers annoyed us a little by fireing on our pickets and
                                    pressing details. We moved off and soon passed a deserted Yankee camp called Camp
                                    Shady. There was a good many U. S. army wagons in camp. All new with snow white
                                    covers on. A detail was sent to burn them. In the next pasture there was a
                                    considerable drove of U. S. horses and mules. The pressing detail and others were
                                    chaseing them around picking out the best. I noticed a fine large brick house next.
                                    We were not very far from Camp Dennison. We passed through several small places and
                                    came to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, a considerable place. We rode in without opposition, and halted on one
                                    side of the street. The first thing was to bum for something to eat. I drank three
                                    large glasses of milk and got as much bread and butter as I wanted. The stores were
                                    closed. The women, children, and citizens generally came to their doors and took a
                                    good look at us. The first Confederate soldiers in arms that had visited that part
                                    of the country. They gave us something to eat as soon as called on, and sometimes
                                    sent it to us of their own accord. Of course the stables were visited among the
                                    first things. We opened a store and got a few notions, then moved to a lot in town
                                    and went into camp. We had orders to get corn wherever we could find it. We
                                    scattered and got corn from the nearest stables. Corn seemed to be very scarce. I
                                    unsaddled, took a good wash and brushed the dust off of my cloths. We had been
                                    riding hard all day in the dust and looked nearly <pb n="317" id="VAA4025-065-4-073"/> white. We had plenty of butter crackers and cheese issued to us. This together
                                    with some confectionaries such as, figs, candy, cakes, etc. that I eat with Sergeant
                                    Millers mess made me a very good supper. We had orders to stay in camp so I did not
                                    go up town as I had intended, but contented myself by currying my horse and making
                                    down my bed on the grass. I was very tired and sleepy and went to bed early. I slept
                                    very well. The dew fell heavy during the night.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday July 14th, 1863. Weather pleasant. We again got corn from stables to feed on
                                    and made our breakfast on crackers and cheese, then saddled up and left town and
                                    passed to our place in front of the command. Part of the command were just saddling
                                    up. We did not go far till we left the command by taking a road to the right. The
                                    command went straight on. I learned that our regiment (the 14th Ky.) was going on a
                                    scout to <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>. We traveled steady and lively keeping a good lookout for bushwhackers.
                                    Nothing of interest occured. We came in sight of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
                                    </placeName> about twelve o'clock. Sergeant Miller called for volunteers to
                                    go on detail. Myself, Henry Beach, Ed Lonney, Henry Allen and Tap Carpenter
                                    volunteered thinking it was to be Provost Guards in town, which would have given us
                                    a good chance to get plenty to eat, also a chance to get in the stores first, but
                                    the detail was for picket much to our disappointment and too late to back out.
                                    Corporal Ed Lonney, Henry Beach and Henry Allen stopped near a house in sight of
                                    town. Myself and Tap. Carpenter went on guard first. We went back about a quarter of
                                    a mile to a fork in the road and took our position. In looking around I noticed
                                    something close to the ground on the inside of the fence within twenty feet of me
                                    which looked like the face of some person. I hallowed get up there nobody's
                                    going to hurt you, and up jumped a young man from behind the fence. We asked him
                                    what he was going [doing?] there. He said that he was hiding because he was afraid
                                    that we would hurt him. We detained him a few minutes and let him go. Tap Carpenter
                                    took a canteen to the next house and got some water and a piece of bread. There was
                                    a house on the left fork of the road about three hundred yards off that I kept a
                                    close watch on. The women watched us so closely that I began to suspicion the
                                    inmates of being bushwhackers. I stayed on picket and sent Tap Carpenter to a good
                                    looking house to engage dinner, which we intended to eat as soon as the other two
                                    pickets took our places. While he was gone one of the ladies at the suspicioned
                                    house brought me some bread and a couple of pies in a newspaper, a favor quite
                                    unlooked for. She said that she thought that we must be hungry. I thanked her and
                                    she returned to the house. Tap came back and said that he had engaged our dinner. We
                                    eat our snack. We detained several citizens half an hour. Nothing of interest
                                    occured. We told them that the whole division would be along in an hour or less, as
                                    we were told to do to keep our real situation in the dark. One man run when we
                                    halted him, but we did not fire on him <pb n="318" id="VAA4025-065-4-074"/> as he
                                    was a scared citizen. We had been on picket about an hour and a half when Cor.
                                    Lonney came within hollowing distance and told us to come on in a hurry that the
                                    regiment had left town. We were leaving just as the gentleman that Tap had engaged
                                    our dinner of came across the fields to us and said that he had a good dinner ready
                                    for us. We thanked him for his trouble and told him that we could not stop to enjoy
                                    it. We went to town in a lope. The rear guard was leaving town. We did not stop, but
                                    went on to our company. I did not see much of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. It appeared to be a very good looking little place. We halted to rest
                                    and Sergeant Miller go so tight that he could hardly ride at all. On reaching the
                                    town of North Union, O. a citizen shot at John Messick of the advance guard missing
                                    him and killing another citizen. We halted a few minutes and moved on till we came
                                    to the town of West Liberty, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>. We crossed a bridge over a little creek passing through town and
                                    camping in a stable lot on the other side. We got corn from the stable to feed on. I
                                    went down to the tavern and took a good wash intending to take supper but Col.
                                    Morgan ordered us to camp. The bridge that we crossed was [burned?] by order of the
                                    Colonel which all the boys thought was unnecessary as any persueing force could
                                    easily ford on either side. I got a big water can took it down to a pump and filled
                                    it, at the same time begging a loaf of bread. Then returned to camp. A couple of the
                                    boys came in with a jar of preserves, a jar of honey, two crocks of milk, some
                                    butter, etc. from somebody's spring house. We sat down and eat a very good
                                    supper. We made people believe that the whole division would be along in an hour or
                                    so to keep them from making any resistance. I went down two with Sergeant Simon [S.
                                    F.] Ferril [or Terrill] of my company to see a lady who had a husband in the
                                    southern army. She gave the Sergeant a letter and we returned to camp. I noticed by
                                    the show bills that was pasted on the blacksmith shops that a circus was but a few
                                    days ahead of us. About dusk we fell in line and moved on. After riding two hours we
                                    took the wrong road and had to turn back half a mile. Then went down a long rough
                                    steep road and came to the Sciota [Scioto] river and rode along its bank in a deep
                                    sandy beach almost in a keen jump. It was very dark and several of the boys horses
                                    stumbled over stumps and logs throwing them on the sand. We soon got to Jacksville, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> where we found the command camped near the river. Some were sitting
                                    around the camp fires cooking, others were sleeping. We passed through town leaving
                                    the curious sight of the many camp fires sparkling in the darkness, and camped in
                                    sight of town in a lot on the right. I did not see enough of the town to form an
                                    opinion of it. We had nothing for our horses, so we unsaddled and slept on the
                                    grass. The dew fell heavy.</p>
                        <p>Wednesday July 15th, 1863. Weather pleasant. I woke up and found my horse loose. Each
                                    fellow got a bundle of wheat and fed it to his horse. We saddled up and took the
                                    road to the right from town. The road on both <pb n="319" id="VAA4025-065-4-075"/>
                                    sides was strown with loose wheat where part of the command had been feeding. Some
                                    times as in this case corn could not be found to feed on and we were compelled to
                                    feed on wheat to keep our horses alive. We were beginning to be anxious to get on
                                    the south side of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> river again for we knew from what the papers said that there was a
                                    large Yankee force following us some where in our rear,<hi rend="sup">34</hi> but we
                                    felt confident of being able to keep out of their way. We rode steady all day,
                                    stopping near dark at a farm house and feeding. We had dusty roads again today. We
                                    had passed through several small places that I did not learn the names of. I got a
                                    small piece of meat and bread and as much milk as I could drink. The boys generally
                                    broke into the nearest spring house as soon as we stopped to feed or camp. After our
                                    horses were done eating we moved on and rode leisurely all night. The boys got so
                                    sleepy that they could hardly ride. Once I dropped my gun. At another time my hat,
                                    but as soon as they fell I woke up and recovered them. We rode on till day.</p>
                        <p>Thursday July 16th, 1863. Weather pleasant. Awhile after day we halted in a stable
                                    yard and fed. While feeding the command passed us. The Colonel did not order us to
                                    move till he got his breakfast. We then rode lively being in the rear of the
                                    command. About twelve o'clock we came to a little town on the Sciota river
                                    and the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>
                                    </placeName> canal. At first I though[t] that the whole town was on fire. On
                                    entering the place I found that our men had fired a canal boat that was in the
                                    employ of the U. S. government, and a mill caught fire from this, and the flying
                                    sparks fired a stable or two. The command, I was told tried to put out the fire on
                                    the mill, but it was a windy day and their efforts were unsuccessful. We halted half
                                    an hour in town. The command had left. The boys got whiskey by the bucket full. I
                                    got a large bottle full to take along but changed my mind and poured it out, fearing
                                    that it might be the cause of somebody getting too drunk to ride, and be left
                                    behind. We all knew very well that all that strayed too far or got left behind was
                                    either killed or captured by the bushwhackers. We left town and as we were fording
                                    the Sciota river the bushwhackers commenced fireing at us from the hills. We had a
                                    bad place to ford. As fast as we got across we formed in line to defend or protect
                                    some buggys and spring wagons containing our sick and wounded while fording. These
                                    vehicles were all captured or pressed on the raid, most of them since crossing the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> river. All got across safe, and as we moved on the fireing became more
                                    rapid. Sergeant George [W.] <placeName>

                                    we could see nothing to shoot at, and did not fire in return, but rode out of their
                                    way in a few minutes. We went about two miles and came to another little town. I
                                    stopped at a house to get something to eat and met <placeName>

                                    on. The regiment rode lively till near dusk, when we caught up with the command and
                                    commenced crowding past to get to the front. The command halted in another little
                                    town. It was dark enough for candle light when we all got past. We then halted in a
                                    lot on the left near a large white house. We formed in lines each company by its
                                    self one behind another and dismounted to rest. I went to the crib and got a heavy
                                    feed for my horse and had some trouble in finding my horse again. I then went to the
                                    house and took a good wash to get the dust out of my eyes. Supper was just ready so
                                    I then took supper with some fifteen or twenty others at the house. I was hoping
                                    that we would all get a good nights sleep when I heard the almost unwelcome order of
                                    Mount Your horses, but I was willing to go ahead when the officers thought it
                                    necessary. The command had nearly all passed so we had to double quick to get in
                                    advance again. We had been in the rear all day. After riding three or four miles at
                                    a lively gate we camped on the right of the road in a lot next to a stable. The

                                    Ben Young and others got into a dairy and got a lot of put up cherries. I slept
                                    well. The dew fell heavy during the night.</p>
                        <p>Friday July 17th, 1863. Weather pleasant. We fed our horses well again, but found but
                                    little for ourselves. We saddled up and moved on. In an hour or two a detail was
                                    made from each section in our company to get something to eat for the men. I was one
                                    of the detail. We went ahead to the vidette who would not let us pass so I visited
                                    the houses as I came to them in the rear of the vidette. A couple of us went to a

                                    the cupboard and found some milk and a little bread. Then we got into a large jar of
                                    honey and eat as much as we wanted. We saw the lady of the house coming and covered
                                    up the honey again. When she came in we asked her to cook some bread for us. She
                                    willingly went to work at it saying that she was a butternut or a copperhead<hi rend="sup">35</hi> as the abolitionists called them. The command had nearly all
                                    passed and my bread was just put in the oven. I told the other fellow that I could
                                    not wait for the bread and he agreed to wait for it. I caught up with my regiment
                                    just before entering the town of Jackson, <placeName>

                                    good looking place. After standing in the street awhile we moved into a lot on the
                                    other side of town and watered our horses at a branch in the next lot. Commissary H.
                                    C. Moore brought some hams from town. Co. B drew one but before we had time to
                                    divide it among the messes orders came to mount immediately. Several of us agreed to
                                    take it turn about carrying the ham. We went to town and took a road to the right,
                                    and found more than half of the command ahead of us, so we commenced double quicking
                                    to get in the advance again. I carried our ham awhile and gave it to one of the
                                    other boys. After two or three more had taken a turn the ham was thrown away. It was
                                    too unhandy to carry on a double quick through the crowded road. I understood that
                                    the depot and some cars had been burned at Jackson. We rode along near the railroad
                                    for some distance. It was lined with burning cord wood. All the cowgaps and bridges
                                    were burning also. We got in advance but not without raising a terrible dust, and
                                    incurring the displeasure of acting Brigadeir Gen. Basil Duke. We came to a halt
                                    near a little town on a branch of the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and Merietta [Marietta] railroad. We dismounted to fight. Our advance
                                    vidette Thomas Murphy had been dangerously wounded by a shot from some bushwhackers
                                    as soon as he entered town. In counting off I came out number three. Our boys
                                    deployed forward. A piece of our artillery came to the front. We took the horses in
                                    the woods on our left. We saw some home guards in a point of woods. Three or four
                                    shells was thrown at them and they left. The boys all mounted and we started to
                                    follow them, but the order was countermanded. We moved through the town without
                                    further trouble. Soon after passing the houses of some butternut citizens who gave
                                    us all the milk, bread, butter, etc. they could raise. They were in favor of
                                    Vallandingham for their next governor.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The horse pressing
                                    detail was still attending to business. We halted about an hour before sun down and
                                    camped in a lot on the right near a stable and house. The people had run off and
                                    left the house. We found plenty of corn for our horses. The boys got into the house
                                    cleaning it of everything fit to eat. I found a comic picture of Jeff Davis hanging
                                    on the gallows. The picture was framed and hanging over the mantel piece of the
                                    sitting room. One of the boys found a picture of Abe Lincoln in a Magazine and cut
                                    it out and pasted it over the picture of Jeff Davis, so as to represent Lincoln
                                    hanging instead of Davis. I guess the family raised a howl when they saw it. We made
                                    our supper off of milk, bread and preserves. Some of the boys out too far from camp
                                    was fired on and six or seven of us took our guns and walked out across the fields a
                                    few hundred yards and seeing some citizens we hailed them. They did not answer but
                                    started to run. We fired a shot or two at them and returned <list type="footnotes">

                                    on the grass. I was glad that we were going to have a good nights rest, but
                                    something told me that we ought to ride all night, which would take us to the <placeName>

                        <p>Saturday July 18th, 1863. Weather pleasant. We fed our horses well and saddled up. We
                                    moved early passing through the little village of D. where we saw a company of
                                    Sappers and miners<hi rend="sup">37</hi> from our command with axes and shovels. The
                                    planks had been removed from the floor of a little bridge in the village by the home
                                    guards and hid so we had to go some distance around it to get by. We rode lively
                                    till about twelve o'clock when we came to a place in the road that was
                                    blockaded with trees cut across the road which brought us to a halt. We were within
                                    a few miles of Pom[e]roy, O. on the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> river where we intended going. The blockade was in a place where the
                                    road run between hills, besides it was defended by a strong force of home guards and
                                    bushwhackers to prevent our clearing away the obstructions. While we were waiting
                                    orders a lot of us went to a large white house on our right and got as much milk,
                                    bread, preserves, molasses, honey, etc. as we could eat and took some to the balance
                                    of the boys. The people had run off from home. Where people stayed at home and
                                    behaved themselves we did not disturb the house, but where people run away from home
                                    we rated them as home guards or bushwhackers, and took everything in the way of
                                    something to eat in the house. We waited about an hour and finding that we would
                                    loose too much time in clearing out the obstructions we turned back nearly a mile
                                    and took a road to our right. The road was in a bottom or valley following the
                                    course of a branch. As usual the dust flew in clouds. We did not go far before the
                                    advance guard was stopped by a volley from home guards on a high bluff of rocks in a
                                    fork in the road. A ridge on our left sheltered us. We dismounted to fight. The
                                    enemy's fireing sounded as if it was nearing the fence on top of the ridge.
                                    So we hurried up to get to the fence first. On reaching the fence we were surprised
                                    to find a deep wide valley with the left fork of the road between us and the enemy.
                                    We were ordered not to waste our ammunition as they were too far off to do any
                                    execution. Their spent balls passed over us once in a while. We fired a shot apiece
                                    at them to get the old loads out and load fresh again. Co. G. and D. with assistance

                                    bluff driving them off. The right hand fork of the road led to the river but it was
                                    strongly blockaded. I could see the black clouds of smoke rising from the gunboats
                                    and transports on the other side of the hills in front of us. I was surprised to
                                    find that we were so close to the <placeName>

                                    yards and dismounted to fight again. We nearly reached the enemy's old
                                    position on the bluff when we were ordered back to our horses, the fireing had
                                    ceased and we moved on the road still following the course of the branch with high
                                    hills and ridges on either side. The road was of gravel and a very good one. The
                                    rumor was that we were going some ditsance up the river and cross into <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                                    </placeName>. I began to wish that Gen. Morgan would take us to the river so high up
                                    that the gunboats could not get at us. We were bothered a great deal by the
                                    bushwhackers fireing on us from the hills. In several places I saw them walking
                                    leisurely along fireing and loading. I heard of several persons being wounded by
                                    them. We came to a place where the bridge was destroyed. The planks were taken off
                                    and hid and the balance burnt. The branch on both sides of the bridge was filled
                                    with fallen trees. The water was two or three feet deep and not running. Our only
                                    chance was to fill the branch up and make a solid bridge. Our regiment was
                                    dismounted to help the sappers and miners. We carried logs, rails, rockes, and dirt,

                                    planks of the old bridge and made a good floor on ours. We cut the bank a little and
                                    the bridge was completed to the satisfaction of Gen. Morgan who was present. We had
                                    worked like Turks making some citizens living near work also. We mounted and moved
                                    on. Every mile or so we would come to places where trees were cut across the road.
                                    The advance guard would sing out, Sappers and Miners to the front!! pass it back!!
                                    The sappers and miners would pass us in a jump and go to clearing the road. We would
                                    hardly stop but pick our way around the obstacle and dash ahead to the next
                                    blockade. Sometimes the sappers and miners would be called for in front before
                                    finishing their last job. We made all the citizens we could catch help clear the
                                    road. In this way the command did not have to wait. At last we got ahead of the
                                    blockades and double quicked five miles to the town of <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Chester</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">
                                        Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>. We halted in the street and dismounted to rest. We opened a store and
                                    found a lot of provisions cooked in boxes and baskets that had been cooked for home
                                    guards who were to collect to blockade the roads, but we made good use of all the
                                    good things. I got two hats, a few yards of cotton and calico, a new curry comb and
                                    brush, a hand full of nutmegs and a few other little tricks. The command coming up
                                    we mounted our horses and moved a square down the street and halted a few minutes.
                                    One of the boys went into a grocery and brought us out some hard cider. Then we rode
                                    hard till dusk when we halted and dismounted to fight. We were told that we were
                                    within a half a mile of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> river. The advance guard went ahead. We received no orders to move
                                    forward so we laid around by our horses and all came <pb n="324" id="VAA4025-065-4-080"/> near going to sleep. The General and staff passed us.
                                    We mounted our horses and rode quietly down a lane and halted within a hundred yards
                                    of the river. We were ordered not to unsaddle or make any noise. We dismounted and
                                    sit or lay in the fence corners holding our horses. Everything was quiet except a
                                    shot now and then from the advance guard and a scout from the regiment who were
                                    after home guards. Three or four squads of prisoners passed us to the rear. A thick
                                    fog arose and the night grew very chilly. I was detailed about midnight with nine
                                    others under Lieut. [K. F.] Petticord [or Peddicord] to cross the river in a couple
                                    of skifts, and hunt for boats to cross the command in. We went to the river and the
                                    fog was so thick that we could not see <hi rend="i">ten</hi> feet before us. We
                                    could not see how wide the river was or anything about it. We had a citizen with us
                                    but he did not give us any information that was satisfactory. We stumbled around
                                    there for awhile and the Lieut, posponed the project till day light. We were chilled
                                    through. I could hardly have put a cap on my gun, and we were glad to return to our
                                    horses. The boys made a few small rail fires, but were soon ordered to put them out
                                    for fear that the Yanks would see them and send a gun boat up and shell us. We could
                                    hear the boats puffing away on the river below us. I laid three rails near a
                                    deadened fire and slept about ten minutes.</p>
                        <p>Sunday July 19th, 1863. Weather clear. Day light came slow. We went to a stable and
                                    got corn for our horses before the fog had cleared off. After feeding we rode down
                                    the river bank four or five hundred yards to a little village called
                                            <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> where we dismounted to rest. I went to a house and got some bread and
                                    meat. About half of the people had left their houses. I had not been in town more
                                    than half an hour when a detail of thirty men was called for to strengthen the
                                    pickets a few hundred yards below town. Sergeant Miller detailed me for one. We all
                                    went to the picket base and halted. We learned that one of our Brigades had taken
                                    some earthworks and a piece of artillery a short distance below us. About fifteen
                                    prisoners passed to the rear. We were on the river bank. Three or four of us gave
                                    our horses in charge of others and went down to the river and took a wash. We heard
                                    the boats puffing very plain and hurried to our horses. Buffington island lay just
                                    below us. In five minutes more a shell burst some distance below us. The next one
                                    burst nearer on a bee line with us. We knew at once that the Yanks were shelling us.
                                    I dismounted and held my horse. The next shell burst sight [right?] over us about
                                    fifty feet high. The boys commenced moving back slow, and I led my horse thinking it
                                    safer from the shells. Then two or three of the boats as it followed us up the river
                                    shelling us every few minutes. I saw a shell or solid shot strike the ground within
                                    two feet of the heels of a horse in the rear of one of the regiments, giving both
                                    horse and rider a shower of dirt. On reaching the hills our regiment bore a little
                                    too far to the left and got separated from the rest of the command. Myself, Henry
                                    Allen, Sergeant <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and several others in going through <pb n="325" id="VAA4025-065-4-081"/> the thick woods and bushes got separated from the regiment. We could hear them
                                    ahead of us. Sergeant <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                                    </placeName> dropped a bundle and as he was leading an extra horse I dismounted and
                                    got it for him. The Yanks getting pretty close in our rear, we moved on. I took the
                                    lead. We crossed gullies, climbed steep banks, through thick matted undergrowth that
                                    I would have thought impossible to do. I felt proud of my horse for the manner in
                                    which he carried me through. In climbing a steep bank a grape vine took off my hat
                                    and nearly pulled me off my horse. I had to choose between my hat and my gun which I
                                    would loose. I concluded to let the hat go and save my gun and went on without going
                                    back for it. I reached an open road and found myself alone. I passed several pieces
                                    of our artillery upside down in a ditch with the horses cut loose. I soon found the
                                    regiment. A shell or two passed over us about tree top high showing that the Yanks
                                    were determined to shell us as long as [we] were within range. We still had hopes of
                                    getting with the balance of the command. The Yanks came up and fired into our rear.
                                    Co. A dismounted and fought them till the balance of the regiment reached a rize in
                                    the woods, and formed a line. We dismounted to fight and advanced about twenty-five
                                    yards. We stood behind trees waiting for the enemy to come up again. There was about
                                    two hundred stragglers from other regiments with us. They attempted to get away
                                    while we were in line, but they did not go more than a few hundred yards when a
                                    sharp fire was opened on them from the front and they came back in a hurry. Nothing
                                    coming up in the rear we mounted our horses, but had hardly done so when the Yanks
                                    came up and fired into us. We moved back slowly fireing a few shots. I saw one
                                    Yankee horse loose in their front without a rider. No one hurt on our side. We soon
                                    found out that we were surrounded and cut off from the command entirely. Some of the
                                    officers by order of Col. Dick Morgan who had been lost and just got with us, raised
                                    a white flag in the shape of a handkerchief on a ram rod. I left the regiment and
                                    took a road to the left in hopes of getting away. I did not go far till I met three
                                    or four of our boys coming back. They said that they had tried to get out on several
                                    roads but the Yanks were all around us. I picked up a new hat that was too large for
                                    me and went back with them to the regiment. While Col. Dick Morgan was making the
                                    conditions of our surrender, we threw away nearly everything that we had got on the
                                    raid. All of the pistols were thrown as far into the bushes as we could throw them.
                                    Some were thrown away in pieces. I met <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pa</region>
                                    </placeName> looking as if he had lost something. I laughed and told him that we
                                    were trapped and had better make the best of it. Some of the boys even threw away
                                    greenbacks and watches for fear that the Yanks would treat them rough if they found
                                    such things about them. We cleared our saddles of everything new. There was enough
                                    things scattered through the woods to set up quite a respectable variety store. I
                                    got a hat to fit me. Most of us put on what ready made clothing we had on hand.
                                    There was some eight or ten left <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-065-4-082"/> us with the
                                    bold intention of cutting their way out. We mounted took our places and rode four or
                                    five hundred yards down the road handing a Yank our guns as we passed. This made the
                                    second gun the Yanks had gotten from me. We came to where two or three regiments of
                                    Yankee cavalry and and some artillery were in line. We formed in two lines in front
                                    of them and were counted. The boys gave their spurs to the Yanks standing around. I
                                    called a young Yank and told him to take mine off and he did so thanking me for
                                    them. We then dismounted and stood in front of our horses. I loosened my saddle girt
                                    and slipped my bed cumfort out knowing that I would need it to sleep on. I also took
                                    my journal from my saddle pockets and wrapped it up in the cumfort, feeling very
                                    uneasy for its safety. We went through a light examination for arms and were marched
                                    into a field near by in the shade. We silently bid our horses good-by as they were
                                    led away. It was very warm and we were all very thirsty. Some of the Yankees took
                                    our canteens to a spring and filled them for us. We were impressed with the
                                    unwelcome fact that we were no longer at liberty to do as we pleased. We were all in
                                    hopes that our being captured would give the rest of the command ample opportunity
                                    to escape from the large army in persuit. <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pa</region>
                                    </placeName> came across Lt. J. S. Pankey who before the war was one of his best
                                    marble agents in business. Lieut. Pankey said he would do anything he could for us.
                                    He appeared a little tipsy and gave me a fifty cent green back bill and would not
                                    let me give it back. We then marched through the dust back to our old camp near the
                                    river, a distance of three miles. Where we found Lieut. Petticord and a lot more or
                                    [of] our boys. We halted in the middle of a wheat field with infantry guards around
                                    us. I noticed a good many pieces of artillery also our own pieces that the Yanks got
                                    before we could get them out of the bottom. I saw but one of our men dead on the
                                    field, but I heard that our loss in killed was five. In an hour or two Cols. Basil
                                    Duke and D. Howard Smith<hi rend="sup">39</hi> with about a hundred more of our
                                    command was brought in. The boys were all sorry that Duke was captured, but they
                                    cheered him when they found he was unharmed. The Yanks issued some fat bacon and
                                    army crackers to us, and I picked up one of their haversacks with a tin cup and
                                    spoon in it. I soon silenced all honest scruples and kept them. They were just the
                                    things that I needed. The guards and by standers handed us the nearest wheat shocks
                                    to sit on and sleep on. I opened three or four bundles of wheat and spread it on the
                                    ground myself. Henry White and Leven [P.] Young [Jr.] slept on it, and covered with
                                    my comfort. It was a warm one and the only thing in the mess in the way of

                        <p>Monday July 20th, 1863. Weather pleasant. The first thing that I saw on rising and
                                    looking around was the grim visages of four pieces of artillery placed in a half
                                    circle around us, and so close that I could see down their polished throats. They
                                    had been stationed around us to keep us from breaking through the guards in the
                                    night. Jack Curd woke up rubbing his eyes and exclaimed in his comical way,
                                    "By golly who authorized these Yanks to take my picture so early this
                                    morning." We had some crackers and bacon issued to us again. We made little
                                    chip fires and cooked our meat on sticks. Then we were marched into <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and halted on the river bank where the Yanks commenced searching us,
                                    taking everything we had. Most of the boys threw away what little they had left. I
                                    was afraid that my journal would be taken from me so I hid most of it in my comfort
                                    and the rest I hid under the sand where I was sitting. The bank above us was crowded
                                    with union citizens and soldiers looking at us, making it hard to hide anything.
                                    Fortunately before it came to my turn to be searched Major Coffee of
                                    Wolford's cavalry<hi rend="sup">40</hi> came along and stopped the search,
                                    making the Yanks give back the things that they had taken. Major Coffee was once a
                                    prisoner in the hands of Morgan's command and had been treated well. I
                                    found all of my papers again, but three or four days items of the raid. There was
                                    three steamboats at the landing to take us to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. I saw Thomas Wingo carried on board in a cot. Two boats loaded with
                                    infantry passed up the river still on the chase. The last we h[e]ard from the
                                    command they were still skeedaddleing. They started to ford about seven miles above
                                    but the boats came up and shelled them so that only about four hundred and Col.
                                    Johnson got across and escaped. Some few were drowned in the river, and Gen. Morgan
                                    and the balance struck out into the interior again. The Yanks said that the river
                                    was so low that they could not take us on there, so we had to walk about seven miles
                                    through the dust down the river. We halted about half way to rest and stayed an hour
                                    at the river. Most of the boys went in washing by permission of the officer in
                                    charge of us. I took a good wash and felt a great deal better. It was late in the
                                    evening when all of us some five or six hundred in number got settled on board of
                                    the steamboats. My regiment was on board the Ingomar. The <placeName>

                                    the town of Raven Wood [now Ravenswood, W.Va.] and laid over till day. We slept on
                                    deck. The night was chilly.</p>

            <head>Angel Site: An Archaeological, Historical, and Ethnological Study. Two volumes. By Glenn A. Black. (<placeName>

            <p>The Angel Site, located on the north bank of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is one of the largest prehistoric Indian towns in the Midwest. The author of this
                    volume had dedicated a major portion of his life to the archaeological investigation of this
                    settlement. Within a span of twenty-three years (1939-1962) Glenn Black directed excavations at the
                    Angel Site which culminated in this publication. After the author's untimely death these
                    two volumes were compiled from his manuscripts and research notes with the addition of a fifty page
                    descriptive section on the material remains by James H. Kellar.</p>
            <p>Although this report is primarily intended for the archaeologist and anthropologist, many portions of
                    it should be of interest to the historian and layman. Black presents both a description of the
                    numerous archaeological features and artifacts plus a reconstruction of the Angel Site history and
                    environment based upon his archaeological analyses and numerous historical sources which are
                    presented at length and synthesized in the second volume. Throughout these pages, Black's
                    professional objectivity is tempered with romanticism and the excitement of discovery.</p>
            <p>Here in southern Indiana is a most impressive Indian site which flourished from about A.D. 1200 to
                    A.D. 1500. Ail notions of the American Indian being a primitive savage at the mercy of the elements
                    should be dispelled after reading this book. Cultural debris is spread across more than 400 acres of
                    land and the central area of the settlement is enclosed by a stockade which is close to one mile in
                    length. Square and rectangular bastions were erected at set intervais along the main stockade line
                    and a smaller picket line ran parallel to the major palisade. The construction of this stockade
                    entailed the hand excavation of more than 2,000 cubic yards of earth and the cutting and trimming of
                    at least 7,600 logs for posts. Within this enclosure the Indians built twelve or more mounds; the
                    largest ones are flat topped pyramids which probably formed the bases for small temples. Mound A
                    dominates the site measuring 110 feet by 100 feet at the base and attaining an elevation of
                    forty-two feet. This mound has been estimated to contain 67,785 cubic yards of earth which places it
                    among the largest earth mounds of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The orientation of the stockade, mounds, houses, and other features are evidence of a
                    planned settlement which was constructed by a large population under the direction of a ruling class
                    or group.</p>
            <p>Considerable monetary support went into the publication of these volumes which has resulted in a
                    handsomely bound set with numerous drawings and illustrations. As a professional archaeologist this
                    reviewer appreciates the <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-065-4-085"/> detailed maps and numerous plates of
                    artifacts; however, there is no overall map of the excavations and many of the plates of materials
                    have no indication of scale. A great amount of data can be gleaned from the pages, but the section
                    on "Material Remains" represents only a cursory analysis and treatment of the
                    millions of recovered artifacts; however, this can be excused due to the lack of time available to
                    Kellar.</p>
            <p>Through the foresight of the Indiana Historical Society and Black, an important archaeological site,
                    which yields a great amount of information about our American heritage, has been saved from
                    destruction. The record of twenty years of dedicated work by Black has now been published, and it is
                    a major contribution to American Indian prehistory.</p>

            <p>If love of the land and of the living landscape were intemalized in the Hoosier social character,
                    this would have been a "happier" book. Unfortunately the dominant Hoosier attitude
                    toward the natural environment is to make it earn a profit regardless of any other consideration.
                    Moonlight on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and frost upon the pumpkin belong to a body of myth which Hoosiers love to invoke on
                    sentimental occasions. But their "service club sentimentality" has seldom, if
                    ever, been known to obstruct a shrewd business deal or block a development project.</p>
            <p>In this respect the Hoosiers are not much worse than the inhabitants of most underdeveloped countries
                    and some other American states. Through the pioneering efforts of one farsighted and public spirited
                    citizen, Colonel Richard Lieber, Indiana took an early lead in the development of a state park
                    System. But the System was based on assumptions and attitudes which could not support its continued
                    growth and development. Many natural areas that should have been preserved and protected for the
                    benefit of future generations of Hoosiers and for the people of the entire state, were needlessly
                    destroyed—often for the most mediocre sort of profit. The study by Lindsey and his
                    associates describes what has been left, and much of that is in peril of degradation or total
                    destruction. Indiana is being impoverished by short-sighted, exploitive, and antipublic attitudes
                    and too few voices are being raised in protest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Natural Areas in Indiana</hi> is an authoritative statement of what remains of the
                    ecosystems that evolved during past millenia in the territory now designated as the State of
                    Indiana. Alton Lindsey is one of those exceedingly valuable scientists, who is willing to devote
                    scientific competence, energy, and <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-065-4-086"/> time to the conservation of
                    this irreplaceable natural heritage. He and his collaborators were assisted in their survey and
                    description of natural areas by a grant from the Ford Foundation. This study makes a good companion
                    piece to <hi rend="i">Natural Features of Indiana</hi> published in 1966 by the Indiana Academy of
                    Science and which was also edited by Lindsey. These volumes are outstanding pieces of scholarly
                    investigation, recording, and description. If the people of Indiana can be moved to make more
                    effective efforts to preserve and protect the great natural beauty and variety of the state, these
                    contributions of Lindsey and his associates will have been indispensible.</p>

            <p>Rohrbough's volume is a study of the administration of the survey and sale of the public
                    domain of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from the 1780s to the end of Andrew Jackson's administration in 1837. Colonial
                    and state precedents are noted, but according to the author, federal administrative practices
                    developed more in response to circumstances than to precedents. Moreover, the transition from state
                    to federal administrative control was both graduai and haphazard, especially during the 1780s. With
                    rapid westward expansion and the accumulation of a vast and fertile public domain in the
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> administrative problems became varied in nature and
                    staggering in scope. The survey and sale of federal land were initially vested in a minor office in
                    the treasury department of the general government, but in 1812 a General Land Office with
                    considerable autonomy was established in this department. Meanwhile, federal administrative patterns
                    and machinery evolved which included both centralized and decentralized elements. The centralized
                    control was exercised through personnel within the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Treasury which established general guidelines, checked accounts of land office
                    officiais, and other-wise directed the overall administration of the federal domain. But limitations
                    of the period in communication, transportation, and technology resulted in substantial
                    decentralization of responsibility with considerable latitude being exercised by officiais of the
                    district land offices.</p>
            <p>The focus of this study is on the role and great importance of the district land offices which
                    increased from only four in 1800 to several dozen by the Jackson era. Their leading officiais were a
                    receiver and a register, the former receiving monies due and the latter keeping officiai records of
                    transactions. Endless correspondcnce flowed between land office personnel and the top federal
                    administrators of the public domain at the national capital. The copying and filing of records from
                    the district land offices required a sizable number of clerks, but Congress habitually declined to
                    authorize a sufficient <pb n="331" id="VAA4025-065-4-087"/> number of them at adequate pay to break
                    the clerical log jam. Hence many purchasers of land experienced long and at times costly delays.
                    Rohrbough makes clear that political and personal considerations of one sort or another were
                    generally involved in land office appointments, both at the capital and district levels.
                    Nevertheless he indicts the Jackson administration for its extremely partisan appointments which
                    lowered both the quality and honesty of the administrative setup. Unfortunately this deterioration
                    came at the very time that land office sales reached an all time high. Rohrbough indicates that
                    Jackson's partisan appointments and the consequent decline in administrative integrity are
                    well illustrated by developments in Indiana during the 1830s. In this decade sales of the federal
                    domain within Indiana also peaked.</p>
            <p>This study offers some further evaluations and perspectives worth noting. It contends that the
                    administrative setup frequently worked more to the general advantage of large rather than small
                    purchasers of land; it notes the general leniency of the federal government in dealing with its
                    debtors and the claims of land buyers; and it plows some new ground in its interpretation of the
                    Foot Resolution of 1829 calling for temporary limitation on western land available for settlement.
                    Rohrbough contends that the famous Webster-Hayne debate of 1830 which grew from the resolution did
                    not develop because the Foot Resolution represented a departure from previous policy. All in all
                    this volume is one of substantial merit. It even has the footnotes accompanying the pages of the
                    text to which they belong.</p>

            <p>That biographies of secondary and even tertiary figures can be interesting and illuminating is amply
                    demonstrated by this very good book. John Breckinridge did not have the amazing versatility of

                    </placeName> in 1760 Breckinridge, like other outstanding men of his age, was precocious in assuming
                    serious responsibilities. When John was only twelve, his father died leaving a large family with
                    only slender means of support. Young John had to struggle to help support the family and to get an
                    education. Despite many calamities John had the good fortune of falling under the influence of that
                    great teacher, George Wythe, at William and Mary. At the age of nineteen he was elected to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> House of Delegates; he became a lawyer; he married; his family increased; and he was
                        <pb n="332" id="VAA4025-065-4-088"/> elected to Congress. He was doing well enough in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> but decided that even greater opportunities beckoned across the mountains in <placeName>

            <p>Breckenridge had many ambitions but central to ail his projects was one ideal: to lead the life of a
                    country gentleman. Moving to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, practiced law, taught law, speculated in land, and prospered in politics. As a
                    disciple of Jefferson he guided the resolutions opposing the Alien and Sedition acts through the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    the happy and fruitful part of Jefferson's presidency. Late in 1805 he left the Senate to
                    become Jefferson's attomey general—an office he was to hold only a few months
                    until his death in 1806.</p>
            <p>Harrison has told this story adequately but with commendable brevity; he neither exaggerates nor
                    underestimates the importance of his subject. He has successfully met the challenge of ail
                    biographers: the proper balance between the man and his times.</p>

                    through the eyes of contemporaries who fought with or against him, (3) and through the judgments of
                    leading academie interpreters. This short volume, in a series that also includes volumes on Hitler,
                    Jesus, <placeName>

                    college classes as a basis for discussion sessions and papers. For those purposes, it is an
                    economical, useful, and well rounded collection of materials.</p>
            <p>The book, however, is uneven in tone and quality; and the part that is least successful, strangely
                    enough, is the material selected from La Follette's own words. Neither the intense
                    personality nor great emotions engendered by La Follette are glimpsed in this section; this, of
                    course, is perhaps more the fault of La Follette than of the editor, but the emotional fervor of
                    "Fighting Bob" La Follette simply does not corne through. The selection of
                    con-temporary writings, however, especially the item by Lincoln Steffens, is extremely strong and
                    presents a fascinating portrayal and some shrewd judgments. Too often one reads only the
                    man's own words or the inevitable pronouncement of Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and misses the
                    contemporary <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-065-4-089"/> passions that a La Follette evoked. The selections
                    by historians are uniformly judicious, cautious, and dull.</p>
            <p>This volume will serve its pedagogical purposes well, but it, of course, does not fill the need for a
                    definitive biography or a published collection of his writings. La Follette, selected as one of the
                    five greatest senators in American history by a senate committee headed by John F. Kennedy, deserves
                    more from the historical profession than has been done.</p>

            <p>The compilers of this anthology introduce their volume vvith the first chapter of Stampp's
                        <hi rend="i">The Era of Reconstruction</hi> (1965) and group their twenty-two selections from
                    revisionist literature under five headings: "Lincoln, Johnson, and
                    Reconstruction," "The Radical Republicans," "The
                    Freedmen," "Radical Reconstruction in the South," and "The
                    Collapse of Reconstruction."</p>
            <p>In the introductory chapter, "The Tragic Legend of Reconstruction," Stampp sets the
                    historiographical stage with a synopsis of the traditional interpretations of the post-Civil War
                    era, an explanation of the origin and acceptance of that interpretation, and an assessment of its
                    principal weak-nesses. Stampp's essay contains incisive and valid criticisms of earlier
                    historians of Reconstruction, but this reviewer cannot agree that the interpretation of Claude
                    Bowers "is only a slight exaggeration" of the views presented by William A.
                    Dunning and his followers (p. 5). The studies of the latter, for ail their shortcomings, are
                    decidedly more temperate, accurate, sophisticated, and scholarly than the Bowers version.</p>
            <p>The selections in this volume are articles and excerpts by such leading scholars as LaWanda and John
                    H. Cox, Richard N. Current, David Donald, W. E. B. DuBois, Eric McKitrick, Vernon Lane Wharton, and
                    C. Vann Woodward. Taken together, these writings challenge earlier works, not by discounting
                    political and economie motives, not by denying that there was greed and corruption, but by
                    acknowledging the importance of humanitarianism, ideals, and ideology, by pointing out the
                    period's constructive achieve-ments, and by identifying civil and political rights of
                    Negroes as either a central or the central issue of Reconstruction. The interpretation that emerges
                    defiates the reputations of the Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson plans for speedy reunion;
                    discredits the contention that the Radical Republicans were simply vindictive, power hungry villains
                    bent upon humiliating and torturing the South; reevaluates and upgrades the attitudes, behavior, and
                    contributions of the black population, scalawags, and carpetbag governments; and offers fresh
                    explanations for the collapse of Radical Reconstruction. Perhaps the most disturbing but nonetheless
                    important contribution of this <pb n="334" id="VAA4025-065-4-090"/> revisionist literature is its
                    exposure of the dominant influence, throughout the period, of pervasive white racism.</p>
            <p>This volume will doubtless be useful to students of Reconstruction, but it would be much more
                    attractive if it contained a bibliography and index, and carried a more reasonable price tag.</p>

            <p>Although American historians are often prone to focus too much attention on the activities of the
                    federal government to the detriment of state affairs, this distortion is particularly evident in
                    studies of the New Deal years. To date there have been but few published works and a scattering of
                    doctoral dissertations dealing with the impact of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> D. Roosevelt's policies on the state level despite the mountain of source
                    material which certainly exists. This situation may well cause many scholars to conclude that James
                    T. Patterson's attempts to analyze the relationship between the New Deal and the states are
                    premature and based upon insufficent sampling, especially since the sheer magnitude of the task
                    prevents him from singling out more than a few of the myriad of New Deal programs for consideration.
                    The author candidly acknowledges the difficulties involved and contends that a perusal of the
                    current literature, coupled with his own original research, does enable him to discern the general
                    patterns of response without losing sight of individual variations. Not everyone will agree that he
                    has done so, but no one can deny that he has made a scrupulously honest attempt.</p>
            <p>In the main, the author's findings indicate that most New Deal programs suffered from a lack
                    of centralization, rather than an excess. The efforts of the various states to cope with the
                    depression before the advent of the Roosevelt administration were confusing and ineffectuai, with
                    very few exceptions. Attempts to implement such relief projects as the Federal Employees Relief
                    Administration, Works Progress Administration, and unemployment compensation at the state level
                    often led to factionalism, interparty squabbling, and bitterness between federal and state
                    officiais, with the unemployed and the indigent the unfortunate victims. Efforts to coordinate other
                    New Deal programs through such agencies as the National Emergency Council generally resulted in
                    failure, and very few states made a concerted effort to emulate national policy by launching their
                    own little New Deals. Far from being a dictatorial blueprint to which each state must slavishly
                    adhere, Patterson argues, the New Deal was rather like an "over-used piece of carbon paper
                    whose imprint on the states was often faint and indistinct" (p. 126).</p>
            <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-065-4-091"/>
            <p>Patterson attributes this unhappy situation partly to the lingering hold which the hoary tradition of
                    self-help and laissez faire still exercised in many state capitals, as well as to the vast
                    differences in environment which obtained in the forty-eight states. Using the techniques of
                    political science to good advantage, he concludes that the highest degree of cooperation with and
                    imitation of the New Deal was to be found in states which were predominantly urban, possessed
                    abundant financial resources, had a high degree of voter participation, benefited from a reformist
                    tradition, and were characterized by a high incidence of interparty competition. Even here, though,
                    the author is careful to avoid forcing his material into a strait jacket by pointing up significant
                    variations in the pattern such as the success of reform in rural, poor, one party <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, and its comparative failure in urban, wealthy, two party <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It is this generally judicious policy of tempering his generalizations with exceptions and of
                    singling out areas for future study which enhances the value of the book and prevents it from being
                    too highly speculative. If and when other historians heed Patterson's advice and turn their
                    attention from the excitement of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the more mundane occurrences in the various state capitals, they may challenge his
