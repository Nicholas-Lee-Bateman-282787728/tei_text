            <byline>RICHARD F. NATION</byline>
            <p>In August 1859, an African–American man by the name of James Hays was attacked and
                    brutally beaten by a small group of <placeName>

                    </placeName> white men, allegedly under the hire of George W. Kimble, Hays's employer. The
                    intention of the beating was to drive Hays from the neighborhood, forcing him to join the
                    substantial exodus of African Americans from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>

                    of European–American residents. The scale of legal limits imposed on African Americans
                    equaled or surpassed that of the neighboring states of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, although there is some evidence that many of the laws were not enforced. The best
                    single measure of white feeling about African Americans occurred earlier in the 1850s, when Hoosiers
                    voted on a referendum regarding the exclusion of blacks from the state. Five–sixths voted
                    for it, and in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName>, as in most of the southern third of the state, the anti–black position
                    gained over ninety percent of the vote. The story of Hays's beating, however, was more than
                    a simple tale of racial violence; it also involved sexual, party, and class politics. As we will
                    see, Kimble's determination to drive Hays from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> was motivated primarily by Kimble's relationship with Hays's wife,
                    Elizabeth. Further, Hays's ability to stand his ground derived from his unlikely alliance
                    with local Democratic leaders who sought to use the case to embarrass Kimble, a leader of the county
                    Republicans. Ultimately, Kimble's power to resist Hays's allegations rested not in
                    his role in the Republican party nor even in his racial identity, but in the power that his wealth
                    could buy. Yet to ignore the racial issue would be to overlook the central reason that Kimble chose
                    violence and, perhaps more important, the reason that he was able to find others willing to do this
                    deed. Taken together, these interwoven elements of James Hays's story highlight the complex
                    interplay of race, politics, gender, and class in Indiana on the eve of the Civil War.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>That an antebellum Republican county leader would instigate violence against an African American
                    might not surprise those who know the period well; yet the response to this particular
                    act—Democrats coming to an African American's defense—certainly
                    requires reconsideration <list type="footnotes">

            <p>To begin that process of rethinking such simple theses, this article examines closely the small
                    mysteries of individual lives such as Kimble's and Hays's.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    Much of what follows is cautious and tentative as a result of the gaps in the historical record. But
                    some of the evidence is clear. Democrats for a time supported an African–American man.
                    The evidence of sexual impropriety was sufficient grounds for divorce. And James Hays was beaten.</p>
            <p>The beating Hays received was severe. According to the original news–' paper
                    account, he received blows "on the head, body, and limbs with clubs and other
                    missiles," and his jaw was broken. He filed suit against Jacob Bickel, Joseph Wilson, James
                    Brison, Jr., and George W. Kimble, and eventually named as witnesses brothers John Daniels, Jr.,
                    Peyton Daniels, Richard Daniels, and their mother, Sarah Daniels, among others. Bickel was singled
                    out as the leader and most violent of the assailants. He had pretended to need Hays's help
                    with a sick horse and under that pretense led him to a wooded area where the beating took place,
                    with Bickel wielding the club that broke Hays's jaw: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Not satisfied with this, Bickle [sic] was with difficulty prevented from cutting off the old

                    </quote> Fortunately for Hays, the others present were more restrained and "finally agreed
                    to grant him his life, if he would … never return to this part of the state."

                            family, even before the separation, would have needed only about 1,600 pounds of meat, and
                            $225 would have represented more than 4,000 pounds. Indeed, converting everything
                            to corn bushel equivalencies–an assumption that to meet their dietary needs, they
                            bartered some of the meat for other foodstuffs–the Hays family would have
                            produced approximately 183 bushels of corn more than they needed to eat, a marketable
                            surplus that far surpassed many of their neighbors, especially those who were farmhands. See

                    while these two went hand in hand in an agricultural system where wealth was often a function of
                    age, many of these young men had fewer prospects than some of their neighbors of benefiting from the

                    the farms of their wealthier neighbors, much as James Hays did, but perhaps with even less success
                    than Hays had found. Without great prospects of climbing the agricultural ladder, these young farm
                    laborers found themselves dependent on the income and perhaps the will of the wealthier landowners.</p>
            <p>Such a landowner was Hays's employer, George W. Kimble, who in 1860 was the second
                    wealthiest man in Laurel Township, with assets of $16,000. Emigrating from <placeName>

                    plateau above Little Sane's Creek. Employing his sons and poorer men like James Hays and
                    his neighbors, Kimble found time to dabble in Whig party politics (serving as <placeName>

                    became a Republican, and he continued to play a leading role in the party, serving on the Laurel
                    Township People's Party Committee of Vigilance in 1856. Although originating in the Know
                    Nothing movement in 1854, the People's Party had by 1856 become the Republican Party in
                    Indiana. The local party's platform, reflecting <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s large German Catholic population, stated that parties organized against
                    Catholic or the foreign–born "are neither justified by past history or future
                    prospects of the country, nor in unison with the spirit of toleration and enlarged freedom which
                    peculiarly distinguishes the American system of popular govt." Kimble put his efforts into
                    living up to these sentiments, participating in a failed attempt to recruit a German Lutheran pastor
                    to be the party's candidate for county treasurer. The overarching sentiment of the local

                    that he was "a pure Negro of pure African blood–that he was born and raised in
                    the State of <placeName>

                    </placeName>–that his ancestors were of pure African blood and were brought to this
                    country and sold as Negro slaves."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Kimble and Wilson's
                    language thus echoed, almost to the word, John E A. Sanford's plea in abatement in the <hi rend="i">Dred Scott</hi> case. The Supreme Court had, in its 1857 decision, responded to such
                    language by asserting that even if Scott were in fact free and recognized by a state as its citizen,
                    he would still not be a citizen of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>—and would therefore have no standing to bring suit in federal court. To
                    buttress the point, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney provided evidence that even in the most
                    anti–slavery of northern states, the citizenship rights of African Americans were
                        limited.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kimble and Wilson likewise maintained that Hays had no standing to bring suit in state court because
                    he was "not legally a citizen or inhabitant of this State and is not entitled to any right
                    under the Constitution and laws of Indiana." But they did not stop there. Before denying
                    Hays's allegations, they accused him of failing to register with the county clerk, as all
                    African Americans were required to do in Indiana, adding that he <list type="footnotes">

                    the county to comply with this onerous law, his demurrer made no mention of it. Instead, he replied

                    harsh. Another possibility would also reflect poorly on James. Elizabeth may have sought protection

                    because sexual mixing lay at the heart of their fears of the Republican program. Amalgamation of the
                    races would blur the lines that distinguished those who could embrace liberty–white
                    men–from those who were by their very nature marked as a lesser people incapable of

                    be among the gravest dangers posed by Republican control. To be able to point to an active local
                    Republican who was sexually intimate with an African–American woman gave credence to
                    Democratic racist demagoguery that the Republicans intended to destroy the distincions between the

                    privileges of race. And Kimble may well have benefited from notions of white male equality when he
                    recruited his thugs to drive Hays from the county. Hays was, after all, more successful in some ways
                    than his assailants were—a fact that may have contributed to Jacob Bickel's
                    extreme violence against him. It seems unlikely that these men were unaware of Kimble's
                    sexual liaisons with Elizabeth Hays, so their willingness to help Kimble procure a permanent
                    relationship with Elizabeth also points to a white, male perception of African–American
                    women as sexual servants of white men.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Although Democrats feared that
                    Republicans threatened the equality of all white men, elite whites like Kimble had sometimes found
                    in such a doctrine a useful means of forming alliances with poorer whites like James Hays's
                        assailants.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>James Hays's first attempt to divorce Elizabeth had ended in failure when many of the
                    witnesses ignored their subpoenas and remained home, failing to testify. These same individuals were
                    called as witnesses in the criminal case, and here again they simply failed to show. The results
                    were a hung jury in the divorce case, no trial in the civil case, and no decision by the grand jury
                    in the criminal matter. An angry grand jury indicted five of the witnesses—James
                    Carpenter, Nancy Wallace, Calvin Tucker, Catharine Spear, and Sarah Daniels—for
                    "failing and refusing to obey the process of subpoena and to appear before the Grand Jury

                    and given a dollar a day plus mileage for attending the court and apparently testifying in the
                    divorce suit, making possible its completion. It is perhaps permissible to speculate that these two

                    posted Tucker and Carpenter's replevin bond for the costs incurred in evading the subpoena,
                    a fact suggesting that Kimble may have been behind all of the absences. The other male witnesses

                    servers, as did Catharine Spear's brother, John. The continuance was granted, but Hays
                    appeared before the court again in 1861 to ask for another continuance. John Daniels, Jr., was still
                    not available. The continuance was denied, and Hays, defeated, moved for dismissal of his civil
                    suit. Moreover, the grand jury never returned an indictment in the criminal case. Thus the outcome
                    of the three legal cases was that Hays won his divorce but nothing more.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    system of white privilege and indeed were the authors of the very measure that had prevented Hays

                            Well, <pb n="234" id="VAA4025-100-3-026"/> it wasn't. It all came about this way:
                            John L.B. Soule was the editor of the <placeName>

                            right, he and Dick Thompson were conversing in the former's sanctum. Thompson had
                            just finished advising Soule to go west and grow up with the country and was praising his
                            talents as a writer.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>"'Why, John,' he said, 'you could write an article that
                            would be attributed to Horace Greeley if you tried.'</p>
                        <p>"'No, I couldn't,' responded Mr. Soule, modestly,
                            'I'll bet I couldn't.'</p>
                        <p>"'I'll bet a barrel of flour you can if you'll promise to
                            try your best, the flour to go to some deserving poor person.'</p>
                        <p>"'All right. I'll try,' responded Soule.</p>
                        <p>"He did try, writing a column editorial on the subject of discussion—the
                            opportunities offered to young men by the west. He started in by saying that Horace Greeley
                            could never have given a young man better advice than that contained in the words,
                            'Go West, young man.'</p>
                        <p>"Of course, the advice wasn't quoted from Greeley, merely compared to what
                            he might have said. But in a few weeks the exchanges began coming into the <hi rend="i">Express</hi> office with the epigram reprinted and accredited to Greeley almost

                    searched for Soule's editorial; both searches proved fruitless. The first, undertaken in
                    1948, is evidenced only by a note in the library's files from an unnamed researcher that he
                    or she could find no evidence of the phrase in that year's issues. The second was
                    undertaken in 1988 byjohn L. Selch, then the ISLs newspaper librarian. A memo by Selch in the

                    "filler." The item immediately preceding it reads: "J. Smead, Esq., of <placeName>

                    Following it one reads that "The widow of Lopez is at present in <placeName>

                    mentioned. There is no discussion of "the opportunities offered to young men by the
                    West," nor is "go west" followed by the crucial "young
                    man." Finally, it is hard to imagine that this sentence was anywhere near
                    Greeley–ish enough to win the bet with Thompson.</p>

                    its variations. It is inconceivable that Greeley would reprint this single sentence and then append
                    the supposed footnote. This item bears little resemblance to the scenario described in the original
                    story and cannot be what the author of that story was referring to. And there is no other

            <p>I submit that the 1890 article is most plausibly interpreted as a fiction intended to entertain the
                    readers of the <hi rend="i">

                    secondary work of reference. To put the matter in the starkest possible terms, we have on the one
                    hand a mass of primary authority from which Soule is consistently and conspicuously absent, and on
                    the other hand a single anonymous account of an unnamed individual telling the Soule story (with
                    verbatim quotations from a conversation and two newspaper articles) in an unnamed bar somewhere in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> forty years after the fact. It is also a story that one of its two principal actors did
                    not confirm.</p>
            <p>So is Greeley the source after all? Probably, but proof is maddeningly elusive. I have not been able
                    to find any writing by Greeley where this exact phrase appears. Suzanne Schulze, author of <hi rend="i">Horace Greeley: A Bio–Bibliography</hi>, who has read perhaps more of
                    Greeley's writings than any person alive, told me that she might have seen the phrase
                    somewhere therein, but was not sure; and she could not give a citation to any particular work.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>This source, as can be seen, does not directly attribute the quotation to Greeley. The earliest such
                    attribution found so far appears in the June 29, 1872, edition of <hi rend="i">Harper's

                    history" in which the author describes "the events which immediately preceded the
                    destruction of the once great American Union," includes the following passage: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In the fall of 1872 Horace Greeley, the editor of a newspaper in <placeName>

                            move to that region as a cure for all the disasters that could befall the human family.

                            mistook the ambassador for a beggar, and without looking up, handed him a quarter and an
                            order for a clean shirt, and said to him, "Go West, young man—go

            <p>In my view, the earliest reliably documented instance in which Greeley appears to have used the
                    phrase was September 1853, as recorded byjosiah Bushnell Grinnell (1821–1891). Grinnell
                    was an abolitionist Congregational minister who preached for a time in <placeName>

            <p>"Go West, young man!" is associated so firmly with Horace Greeley that it is
                    impossible to suppose that he did not repeat it many times over and in many contexts. The <hi rend="i">Harper's Weekly</hi> article quoted above strongly suggests that by 1872 he
                    had been saying it for many years. From the <pb n="242" id="VAA4025-100-3-034"/> evidence we have,
                    it appears that John Soule had nothing whatsoever to do with the phrase (or with Greeley); that no
                    researcher has yet been able to locate an instance of the phrase in any of Greeley's
                    written works; and that the Grinnell account records Greeley's earliest known use of the

                    surrounding the quotation arises because 150 years later we are focusing on the exact wording, which
                    seems to have mattered far less to Greeley and his contemporaries. What was important to them was
                    the visionary ideal of westward expansion. The phrase itself seems to have acquired independent
                    significance only at the very end of Greeley's life and after his death—by which
                    time countless thousands had already followed his advice.</p>

                    also precious—and that its preservation keeps us in contact with essential principles of
                    human dignity and morality. That night an arsonist destroyed a small museum dedicated to the
                    preservation of the memory of the Holocaust. The identity and intent of the arsonist remains
                    unknown, but it is doubtful that the response this violent act elicited was the one intended. In the
                    days and weeks that followed, a sizeable group of citizens, including thousands of school children,
                    came forward to offer support. Using newspaper articles, school fundraising activities, and
                    electronic mail, they had within four months obtained donations sufficient to begin to rebuild the
                    museum. By their spontaneous, positive response to an act of hate, these citizens created a new and
                    considerably larger awareness in their community of the importance of the museum and its founder, a
                    Holocaust survivor. They also revealed an <list type="footnotes">

                    good will in which newcomers were welcomed, more subtle forms of discrimination were practiced by
                    Protestants against both a sizeable Catholic population and by Christians generally against a

            <p>Eva Mozes Kor is one member of that local Jewish community, though her story is far more dramatic

                    to obtain permission to leave their farm. As things became worse, the twins, their two older

            <p>After disembarking from the railroad car, Eva, Miriam, and their mother became separated from their
                    father and sisters who, they believed, were killed that day. Jaffa Mozes and her girls were standing
                    on the platform when Nazi soldiers ran by calling for twins. When Jaffa confirmed her
                    girls' relationship, Mengele's men took them for his experiments. As they were led
                    from the "selection" platform, Eva and her twin sister looked back at their
                    mother's outstretched arms. It was the last time they would ever see her. Camp guards
                    tattooed Eva's left arm with the designation "A–7063." She
                    recalls walking to the end of the crowded barracks to use the latrine that night and discovering the
                    corpses of three emaciated children lying on the floor.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the weeks and months that followed, Mengele performed experiments on Eva and Miriam. His
                    assistants tied Eva to an examining table and inoculated her with unknown strains of bacteria or
                    viruses in order to observe her body's reaction and to compare it to that of her
                    "healthy" sister. Eva realized that if she died, her sister would lose her value
                    to the doctor and thus his reason to keep Miriam alive. Eva became ill with swollen arms and legs
                    and high fever, but through a combination of willpower, the help of other prisoners (who found
                    potatoes for her to eat), and luck, she fought off the illness. Later, Miriam also received
                    injections of unknown material, the source, she later believed, of her eventual kidney failure.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Their only resource during this dreadful time was hope, which Eva considers
                    to have been essential. Each girl knew that her sister remained alive, and they could hear sounds of

                    stare, and when she vigorously protested Halloween tricks such as soaping the Kor house windows or
                    throwing handfuls of corn on their porch, the neighbors shunned her, calling her "that
                    crazy lady." Michael and the children told Eva to ignore the taunts. Her reactions, they

            <p>One such invitation came from high school English teacher Mary Wright, who asked Eva to speak to her
                    senior class in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fithian</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>. The students had read Nyiszli's <hi rend="i">Auschwitz: A Doctors Eyewitness Account</hi> and were familiar with the experiments on
                    twins. Wright recalls that the experience of meeting and listening to Eva was unforgettable for her
                        students.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    </placeName> in the summer of 1993, Wright urged Eva to write an autobiography and even offered to
                    help her with it.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> They published the book, <hi rend="i">Echoes from
                    Auschwitz</hi>, in 1995. Meanwhile, Eva opened a small Holocaust museum on South Third Street where
                    travelers on Indiana 63/U.S. 41, the main route between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, could easily see it. To identify the museum, Eva and Mary erected a modest, lighted
                    commercial sign on a pole.</p>
            <p>The CANDLES Holocaust Museum and Education Center was an open classroom with tables displaying
                    objects and photographs depicting life in the death camps. Eva says her goal in founding the museum
                    was to teach children not to single out others. Such actions, she affirms, can lead to
                    discrimination or worse. Mary, for her part, helped Eva to envision and undertake an even larger,
                    educational mission.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Students sat in the folding chairs in the center of the
                    room. Mary would give the introduction on the rise of anti–Semitism and the Nazi party in
                    the 1920s and 1930s. Eva would tell of her experiences. Linda Lambert, an English teacher at <placeName>

                    the Holocaust and to write essays which they entered in an annual contest sponsored by CANDLES.

                            Krinsky of the Lubavitch Hasidic movement in Brooklyn has said, "The greatest
                            revenge the victims could have on those who persecuted and slaughtered them would be in the
                            perpetuity of the Jewish education and, therefore, Jewish life." But it is
                            important to note, as well, that among the groups that Hitler and his henchmen attempted
                            to' exterminate were disabled persons, gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah's

                    </placeName>, grew larger until during 2002 alone some 2,300 persons visited the museum.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Eva estimates a total of more than 40,000 visitors to the museum in the

            <p>Despite Mary's help and the growing interest of teachers and students, Eva felt that the
                    museum remained isolated from the mainstream of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s cultural life. Modest royalties from sales of Eva's book as well as

                    expenses but were never adequate.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What, then, caused such an outpouring of support for Eva after the fire? In part, it was the
                    traditional rallying of an American community to help a fellow member: compassion, charity, and
                    brotherly love combined with a feeling of "there but for the grace of God go I."</p>
            <p>There was another factor, however. Just three years earlier, the federal penitentiary at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> had become the location of a new death chamber. It was there in June 2001 that federal
                    authorities, for the first time in thirty years, resumed the death sentence, executing Timothy
                    McVeigh, the convicted bomber of the Murrah Federal Building in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> City, by lethal injection.</p>
            <p>A veteran of the 1991 Gulf War, McVeigh had been an excellent soldier, but he apparently became
                    disillusioned when he failed to qualify for the elite Special Forces. After his discharge he drifted
                    and began reading white–supremacist, anti–government literature. He became
                    obsessed with alleged FBI misdeeds such as the incident at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Ruby

            <p>The McVeigh execution was a media event with international television news and camera crews camped
                    for a week near the prison grounds. The city established special routes and parking lots; buses

            <p>In <hi rend="i">War under Heaven</hi>, Gregory Evans Dowd offers a brilliant
                    reinterpreta–tion of the causes and consequences of Pontiac's War
                    (1763–1765), a series of violent conflicts between western Indians and British soldiers
                    that left thousands dead or displaced. Based on a vast array of primary research, Dowd's
                    study transcends old debates about the character of Pontiac himself to reveal the cultural, social,
                    and political context within which the war occurred. Along the way, he crafts a bold argument about
                    the place of Indian peoples within the first British Empire.</p>
            <p>For well over a century, historians have vigorously debated the causes of the war. Francis Parkman,
                    who wrote the first and most enduring account in 1851, treated the war as a
                    "conspiracy," planned by the cunning and despotic Pontiac who gained support for
                    his murderous designs through intimidation and deceit. More recent studies have sidelined the issue
                    of Pontiac's leadership and shifted to arguments about land ownership, the failure of
                    British diplomacy, or the anti–Indian sentiments of westward–moving colonists.</p>
            <p>Although Dowd makes ample allowance for each of these theories, he concludes that the war arose from
                    Indians' deeper concerns about their status within the British Empire, which, he forcefully
                    proposes, "emerged as the single most important issue in Pontiac's War, far more
                    important than, for example, trade, Indian hating, or even title to the lands themselves"
                    (p. 2). Many developments, ranging from British officers' dismissive language to their
                    tightfisted trade policy, convinced <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-100-3-051"/> Pontiac and his allies that
                    Indians had no standing within the empire. Thus, although Indian nations at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> had immediate complaints different from those at Fort Pitt or Niagara, they
                    nevertheless shared a common fear that the British wished to exclude them or, worse, reduce them to
                    slavery. Encouraged by the revivalist spirituality of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> prophet Neolin, Indians from very different places with very different material
                    concerns joined to reclaim their power and their homelands.</p>
            <p>Most readers will likely accept as convincing (perhaps even definitive) Dowd's explanation
                    of the war's origins. His description of the conflict's military and diplomatic
                    history will likewise earn well–deserved praise for its eloquence and concision. For a
                    single work to synthesize such a broad and complex movement with such clarity is a rare and most
                    impressive accomplishment.</p>
            <p>If there is any area of Dowd's argument that will inspire disagreement, it is his
                    description of the war's legacy. Especially in the last fifteen years, historians have
                    tended to argue that Pontiac's War taught British authorities a powerful and costly lesson.
                    Rather than dominating Indians, they learned that they had to trade with them more fairly, treat
                    them more kindly, and prevent their own expanding population from overrunning Indian lands. Dowd
                    rejects this interpretation as "dangerously misleading" (p. 234). Instead, he
                    maintains that even after the war British colonists and administrators alike "shared in the
                    conviction of British superiority and in the expectation that Indians would, before long, surrender
                    their homelands to British subjects who were racially white" (p. 174). Dowd reveals an
                    imperial policy that at every level sought to push Indians beyond the legal and geographic
                    boundaries of the empire. Considering Indians neither subjects nor sovereigns, Dowd argues that
                    British policy from this period anticipated John Marshall's characterization of Indians as
                    "domestic dependent nations" (p. 188).</p>
            <p>Dowd's argument leaves little room for those within the empire, in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or North America, who wished either to integrate Indians as subjects or to treat them
                    as fully sovereign allies. Nor does Dowd's approach allow for the many ironies and
                    ambiguities that surrounded discussions of Indians' status, especially when it came to the
                    idea of race. What, for example, are we to make of William Johnson and Jehu Hay, men who, according
                    to Dowd, wished all Indians to be either dominated or destroyed? Johnson fathered eight children
                    with a Mohawk woman and Hay married into a prominent metis family west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. How did these men envision the status of their own extended families? How did their
                    policies toward Indian peoples reflect enmities between their kin and other Indian nations? Did they
                    wish, in the ways that Dowd implies, to exclude their own relatives from the empire on racial
                    grounds?</p>
            <p>These minor, and perhaps unanswerable, questions are not meant to <pb n="260" id="VAA4025-100-3-052"/> diminish Dowd's remarkable achievement. Even if the racial boundaries of
                    Indians' status are not always probed as critically as this reader would have liked, <hi rend="i">War under Heaven</hi> is still an exceptionally rich and rewarding book. It offers the
                    finest treatment we have of the causes and course of the war, and a provocative interpretation of
                    its legacies. Even those who disagree with Dowd's final conclusions will find themselves
                    rethinking the conflict, the region, and the period for some time to come.</p>

                    </placeName>'s statehood, provides general readers with a useful and readable overview of
                    the heroic roles women played in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s history. Following a chapter on the frontier period, Booth considers the
                    history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> women through the twentieth century in topically organized chapters focusing on
                    employment, the suffrage movement and political activism, reform movements and benevolent projects,
                    cultural and leisure activities, and religious and educational institutions.</p>
            <p>Each chapter relies on a range of historical scholarship and primary sources to provide chronological
                    and geographical coverage, although the topical organization does give rise to occasional
                    repetition. Less understandable, however, is the author's decision to place her discussion
                    of <placeName>

                    </placeName> women's struggle for the vote and subsequent political activity (chapter 3)
                    before a detailed analysis (chapter 4) of the anti–slavery, temperance, and moral reform
                    movements from which suffrage activity later arose. While African–American women appear
                    in every chapter, the author excludes Sojourner Truth's famous speech at the 1851 Akron
                    women's rights convention, a speech which has recently been the subject of considerable
                    historical controversy. More troubling, the book gives almost no attention to the Native American
                    women whose peoples first inhabited the region. On those occasions when a Native American woman does
                        <pb n="261" id="VAA4025-100-3-053"/> appear in the book, it is as the object of the actions of a
                    white woman, consistently portrayed by Booth as the "keeper of culture" (p. 3) on
                    the frontier. Indeed, Booth summarizes the significance of the removal of virtually all Native
                    Americans from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> by the 1830s as "leaving one less responsibility for women" (p. 9).
                    In her coverage of women's education, the author neglects the pioneering role of Oberlin
                    College, the first coeducational college in the nation.</p>

            <p>America's inland rivers have received ample scholarly attention over the last twenty years.
                    John O. Afinson's <hi rend="i">The</hi> River <hi rend="i">We Have Wrought</hi> adds
                    another fine volume to that literature. It focuses on midwesterners' longstanding struggles
                    to improve the upper <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>'s navigability and on the
                    ensuing conflicts with conservationists over river management. Geographically, Afinson looks at the
                    river between <placeName>

                    and, more recently, large barge fleets. Temporally, he considers the period between
                    1823—the date when steamboat traffic commenced on that stretch—and 1940, when
                    the U. S. Corps of Engineers completed the last of the locks and dams that opened a continuous
                    nine–foot channel along the length of the upper river.</p>
            <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-100-3-054"/>
            <p>The author follows a logical structure that leads the reader through the river's
                    transformation from its natural state to a thoroughly engineered waterway. Chapters one to four
                    trace nineteenth–century steamboat and timber–raft navigation on the river and
                    the subsequent political struggles to construct a
                    four–and–a–half–foot channel to increase the efficiency
                    of waterborne transportation by 1906. Chapters five through nine contrast declining river commerce
                    with the seemingly futile demands for improvements to maintain the river's competitiveness
                    with railroads. While campaigning for federal support, navigation boosters encountered a second
                    opponent—conservation advocates. Chapters ten and eleven provide the political context
                    surrounding the nine–foot channel effort. In his closing chapter, Afinson refers to the
                    four stages of river development: the natural waterway, the river modified by channel constriction
                    techniques, the lock–and–dam stage of the nine–foot channel, and
                    the river as it continues to evolve today. Employing these stages throughout the book would have
                    strengthened their use in the closing and in the work's overall organization.</p>
            <p>While there have been other works on inland rivers, this is a very satisfying contribution. An
                    obvious strength is the rich context Afinson provides. This is not a one–dimensional
                    treatment of commerce statistics or technological triumph. By situating the early navigation modi
                    fications within the national agricultural crisis and the Granger movement, Afinson raises his
                    discussion above a regional treatment. With each successive campaign for congressional funding, he
                    situates the battle within larger national political and economic deliberations. In addition,
                    Afinson adeptly weaves together multiple strands of human interaction with the river. He offers an
                    informed discussion of early channel constriction and its impact on river hydrology. He also
                    discusses environmental degradation produced by channel transformation. His well–balanced
                    treatment adds to the historical discussion of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> and its
                    importance to the Midwest.</p>
            <p>At the heart of this work lies the conflict between navigation boosters and conservation advocates.
                    While Afinson portrays them as equally matched adversaries, the navigational interests clearly had
                    the greater influence. Many powerful players participated in reworking the river, but local boosters
                    and farmers were the chief allies who displayed an insatiable appetite for navigation modifications.
                    When challenged by a national park movement, they prevailed. When they failed to stop the creation
                    of a national wildlife refuge, where environment took precedence over commerce, they were not
                    dismayed. In subsequent battles for the nine–foot channel, economic development
                    overwhelmed wildlife and water–quality concerns. Commerce unquestionably prevailed
                    through 1940. To suggest a <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-100-3-055"/> greater parity before 1970 strains
                    the issue.</p>
            <p>Although early river modification programs were unable to reverse a downward trend of river commerce,
                    the nine–foot channel has opened the upper river to considerable barge traffic. It has
                    also completed a major overhaul of the natural river. While obviously sympathetic to the
                    river's environment, Afinson ends optimistically by pointing out that the most recent
                    transformation has benefitted habitat and water quality as part of an ecologically sensitive river
                    management program. Americans, he argues, are "unwilling to accept either the loss of the
                    river's ecosystem or the loss of the river as a transportation artery" (p. 292).
                    Fulfilling this dual expectation is the challenge faced by river managers.</p>

            <p>What was there about baseball (given the number of urban eastern fads to fizzle in the Midwest), asks
                    Peter Morris in his new study of baseball in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, that allowed it to catch on west of the Appalachians, and how did it happen? Morris is
                    interested in discerning how baseball evolved during a critical period in its history—
                    the two decades preceding the founding of the National League in February 1876—by deeply
                    examining one distinct area (in this case, the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>). <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> is a good choice in many respects. The state was home to enough towns with sufficient
                    populations, a large city (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>) that did not overpower the others, and enough fairs and other events to generate
                    plenty of tournaments and spectators. This work demonstrates that baseball was becoming a
                    "national sport" well before the advent of the first all–professional
                    team in 1869.</p>
            <p>Baseball reflected much about the tension between American ideals and reality, as Morris
                    demonstrates. Seen as a country boys' game that was still played in idyllic settings of
                    green grass and fresh air, the sport fit into the Jeffersonian ideal of an agricultural nation.
                    However, it gained popularity <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-100-3-056"/> in the East and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> alike. Initially played by either elites or the upwardly mobile in cities under the
                    most gentlemanly of rules, it quickly became a game in which youth, strength, and speed mattered far
                    more than courtesy on the field; imagine, if you will, Roger Clemens apologizing for throwing a
                    close pitch to Mike Piazza—as he might have in 1857, pitching for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Franklins. While initially a mere game played by clubs for fun and occasionally to
                    determine who paid for dinner, baseball became a game where men pursued more tangible gains.</p>
            <p>While focusing primarily on games and tournaments, Morris is clearly interested in figuring out why
                    this elitist game, played by and for real or aspiring gentlemen, soon appealed to a broader base of
                    spectators. For one thing, the old chivalry fell by the wayside within just a few years of the end
                    of the Civil War, replaced by a greater emphasis on winning. Professional–ization shifted
                    the focus to finances, recruiting players, and gaining competitive edges. Soon the playing field was
                    enclosed and spectators were charged for admission. Paradoxically, this trend helped baseball build
                    a sense of community among spectators. Interestingly, local fans were even willing to tolerate
                    imported professional players and ringers on their own teams so long as they won games and beat
                    their rivals in neighboring towns, suggesting that rooting for the local team created a greater
                    sense of community. Morris describes a process whereby baseball became a tool in building
                    boosterism, community competitive spirit, and a sense of belonging, as playing and watching ball
                    games spread from town to town and from fathers to sons.</p>
            <p>This book uses pre–National League baseball as a prism through which to see the
                    dovetailing of emerging Gilded Age values with changing views about leisure and play. This story
                    would be lost had Morris tried to tackle it on a scale any larger than that of a state, because the
                    nuances of local competition and of the ebb and flow of popularity would be buried under the story
                    of emerging professional teams, as is the case with most histories of baseball during this period.
                    The book might have been shortened by omitting the lists of players or by summarizing the results of
                    yearly tournaments, but it would have lost its appeal as a closely detailed case study of the way in
                    which baseball became the "national pastime."</p>

            <p>Scholarship on the 1960s black freedom movement is rapidly shifting from studies of civil rights to a
                    focus on black power. Joy Ann Williamson's <hi rend="i">Black Power on Campus</hi> makes a
                    significant contribution to this emerging trend. Using a wealth of primary sources from the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Archives and thirty–one interviews with former students, faculty, and
                    administrators, Williamson provides a detailed analysis of the motivations and process by which
                    African–American student activists, as well as both black and white university
                    administrators and faculty, negotiated campus reform. In so doing, she situates this rich material
                    in the context of both higher–education reform and the transition from the civil rights
                    to the black power movement.</p>
            <p>Students constitute one of the most important and perhaps least–studied segments of the
                    new black power studies. Yet as Williamson demonstrates, an examination of
                    African–American student protests from a black power perspective opens a window on a
                    broad range of interconnected subjects. Her study traces the general history of
                    African–American student protest at predominantly white campuses from the 1920s through
                    the mid–1970s, as well as the more specific story of black students at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Champaign</settlement>
                    </placeName> (UIUC) from 1887 through the mid–1970s. For both the general and the
                    specific histories, the 1940s through the 1950s represented an escalation in the struggle, while the
                    period from 1965 to 1975 marked the high tide of black student protests.</p>
            <p>While attuned to continuity between these two moments, Williamson ultimately uncovers a story of
                    startling transformations. During the 1940–1964 period there were few
                    African–American students on predominantly white campuses—as late as 1967, for
                    instance, only 233 attended UIUC. This generation of black students was isolated and tended toward
                    assimilation and conformity. When these students did engage in protest they did so through
                    integrated chapters of national organizations, such as the NAACP and Congress of Racial Equality
                    (CORE). In contrast, during the latter period, particularly between 1964 and 1970, black student
                    enrollment doubled nationally and more than quadrupled at UIUC (p. 71). According to Williamson, the
                    increased enrollment of African–American students dramatically altered the campus
                    climate. At <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, the increased numbers combined with factors particular to UIUC, such as the
                    homogeneity of black students and the racial politics <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-100-3-058"/> of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to create a unique cohesion among black students.</p>
            <p>Using the language of the black power era and of African–American psychologistWilliam
                    Cross,Jr.'s, "Nigrescence" or
                    "Negro–to–Black Conversion Process model," Williamson labels
                    black students during the former period as "Negroes" and describes their goals as
                    "integrationist." In contrast, she uses the term "Black" for
                    later students, who are committed to "instilling solidarity and unity among Black students
                    … expressing the positive aspects of Black culture, and providing a training ground for
                    political organization and leadership" (p. 28). Using the testimony of students, Williamson
                    powerfully locates these differences in the break with the civil rights movement and adoption of
                    black power ideology. She quotes a former student, Sandra Norris, as saying, "When I came
                    there, I was … a student who happened to be Black. When I left, I was a Black who
                    happened to be a student" (p. 49). Black power ideology meant "preservation of
                    Black identity, preference for an ethnically centered curriculum, and an orientation toward
                    collective racial advancement" (p. 31). These views were quite a distance from those of the
                    preceding generation.</p>
            <p>The transformation of African–American students' ideology from negro
                    assimilationist to black power, and the resulting institutional reforms at places like UIUC, attest
                    to the long–term influence of the 1960s' generation of black student activists.
                    Williamson's most important point is to remind us of <hi rend="i">how</hi> transformative
                    black power was. This is particularly important at a moment when historians tend to collapse civil
                    rights and black power and to argue that continuity rather than change characterized the
                    relationship between the two movements. <hi rend="i">Black Power on Campus</hi> makes a tremendous
                    contribution to the burgeoning black power studies literature. Moreover, it suggests that we need
                    more historical accounts of black students and the creation of black studies units.</p>

            <p>Ira Berlin skillfully braids the histories of African–American slaves into a coherent,
                    self–contained narrative that provides general readers and specialists alike a way to
                    conceptualize two–and–a–half centuries of history <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-100-3-059"/> while accounting for regional differences, dramatizing change over
                    time, and documenting the persistence of slave resistance in English, French, and Spanish North
                    America.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Generations of Captivity</hi>, Berlin compresses and updates his
                    prize–winning study <hi rend="i">Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery
                        in North America</hi> (1998), integrating his earlier account with a fresh evaluation of
                    antebellum slavery and a brief sketch of emancipation. He investigates how antebellum–era
                    slavery accelerated and transformed social processes that had developed over the preceding
                    centuries. The era of the internal slave trade, which Berlin evocatively labels the "Second
                    Middle Passage," and the rise of the cotton South marked "the period of
                    slavery's most rapid change in mainland North America" (p. 16). Berlin
                    demonstrates this assertion by attaching his analysis of antebellum slavery to his detailed account
                    of slavery in colonial America.</p>
            <p>Berlin creates order by designing analytical categories, identifying bellwether experiences, and
                    delineating specific regions to revisit in each section of the book. He uses the concept of
                    "generations" to divide his study into four major sections, each of which
                    evaluates slavery in the North, the Chesapeake, the <placeName>

                    generations" of Africans defined the slave experience in the seventeenth century. These
                    early slaves were more likely to achieve greater measures of freedom than subsequent generations, in
                    part because as members of this numerically small cohort, they possessed knowledge of the Atlantic
                    world that matched or exceeded that of frontier–society Europeans. On the southern
                    Atlantic coast, "Plantation Generations" transformed colonial–era
                    slavery, creating societies organized economically, politically, and socially around slavery. Some
                    parts of the North experienced increased dependence on slaves. The era of the American Revolution
                    transformed life once again, leading to gradual abolition in the North. In the South, slaveholders
                    recovered from the turbulence of war, evangelical revivals, and egalitarian political rhetoric,
                    setting the stage for a dramatic expansion of slavery in the region. During the "Migration
                    Generations" of the nineteenth century, the lives of African Americans suffered profound
                    disruptions. The transportation of approximately one million people westward forced slaves to forge
                    new lives and new communities within the antebellum cotton economy. The arrival of
                    Anglo–American planters further accelerated a trend toward plantation slavery in the

                    Spanish masters had been forced to grant considerable autonomy to slaves.</p>
            <p>Berlin is acutely sensitive to variations within and between regions, while also arguing that each
                    generation left a legacy which shaped those that followed, despite dramatically shifting conditions.
                    Among the bench–marks <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-100-3-060"/> he provides to describe slave
                    experience are the degree to which slaves carved out opportunities for independent economic
                    production, as well as whether slave labor followed a closely supervised "gang" or
                    a more flexible "task" system. Berlin also pays close attention to the ebb and
                    flow of African cultural traditions and adaptations of Christianity within
                    African–American communities. Naming patterns provide one tangible index for measuring
                    both status and cultural adaptation.</p>
            <p>Berlin forges meaningful comparisons across regions, eras, and social classes, while breathing
                    abundant life into his narrative through vivid examples. The study draws considerable energy from
                    the persistent impulse among slaves and masters to renegotiate each slave–labor regimes
                    requirements. This tension combined with changing staples, patterns of slave importation, and
                    political regimes to ensure diverse and far–from–inevitable outcomes across
                    the history of slavery. Some regions deepened their investment in slavery, even as others retrenched
                    or reconfigured their commitment to the institution. In each generation, American slaves devel oped
                    internal cultural resources to mitigate inescapable oppression. The strategies of free, often urban,
                    black communities also were conditioned by the persistence of slavery.</p>
            <p>While readers will not find material that specifically addresses Indiana history, Berlin's
                    insistence that the antebellum North was not "a free society," but rather
                    "part of a slave–holding republic" (p. 233) until the issuance of the
                    Emancipation Proclamation should stimulate thoughtful reflection amongst all readers. So too will
                    Berlins closing observations on how negotiations between blacks and whites touched off by the coming
                    of freedom continued to be colored by slavery. The Civil War and its aftermath further confirmed
                    that the nation's history was entangled with slavery from the first
                    trans–Atlantic immigrants to the age of Lincoln.</p>

                    </placeName> University associate professor of English Deborah Logan explores Martineau's
                    journey from the deaf daughter of an English Unitarian textile manufacturer into a
                    self–supporting writer and activist whose works and ideas spanned the Atlantic. The
                    author's discussion of Martineau's involvement in the American antislavery
                    movement, and of her interactions with such well–known figures as Charlotte Bronte,
                    Florence Nightingale, and Margaret Fuller, leaves no doubt in the reader's mind that
                    Martineau indeed led a remarkable life. The determined efforts of contemporary
                    reviewers—so well documented in this work—to dismiss Martineau's work
                    as the ramblings of a deaf spinster with limited education further testify to the political threat
                    she posed in her time. Why, then, has she been overlooked for so long by literary and social
                    historians? It is, Logan contends, because her inter–disciplinarity and nonconformity
                    made it impossible for earlier critics and scholars to fit her into a neat category. This
                    fascinating study goes a long way in establishing Martineau's significance as an influence
                    on Victorian culture on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
            <p>Departing from the chronological arrangement of most biographies, Logan provides a biographical
                    overview in the first chapter and devotes the remainder of the book to thematic essays highlighting
                    several dimensions of Martineau's complex life. An intriguing chapter two examines why this
                    dedicated needleworker devoted countless hours of her life to produc ing everything from cot
                    blankets for infants to the intricate needlework sofa cover portrayed on the back of the dust
                    jacket. The highly gendered act of needleworking, Logan argues, was for Martineau a subversive
                    activity; it gave her the appearance of respectability while enabling her to raise money for reform
                    causes and to carve out time for the reflection needed to inspire her writing.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Hour and the Woman</hi> also provides readers with deeper insight into the American
                    roots of Martineau's feminism and abolitionism (although those who yearn to know more about
                    her travels in the Great Lakes region will be disappointed). Martineau's
                    three–volume <hi rend="i">Society in America</hi>, published after her
                    1834–1836 travels in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, positioned her to become "one of the most vocal participants in the.
                    transatlantic slavery debates" (p. 79). Confident of the validity of her observations, this
                    frank nonconformist and freethinker not only denounced chattel slavery but also called for the
                    eradication of sexual and social slavery. In addition to being an abolitionist, Logan argues,
                    Martineau's "woman–centered approach to resolving social, economic, and
                    political inequalities based on race, class, and sex" (p. 165) establishes her as a
                    nineteenth–century feminist. She not only refused to hide her identity as a woman behind
                    a male pseudonym, but also further transgressed gendered expectations of women authors by favoring
                    serious nonfiction over the more popular genre of romance novels.</p>
            <p>Logan succeeds admirably in establishing <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-100-3-062"/> Martineau as an
                    influential voice in both American and British society, documenting the sale of her work, the people
                    with whom she interacted, and those whom she men–tored. The <hi rend="i">Hour and the
                        Woman</hi> is beautifully written, although at times theoretical digressions detract from the
                    flow of the narrative. Since the author so clearly wishes to increase awareness of and scholarly
                    interest in Martineau, it also is regrettable that this thoroughly researched work lacks a list of
                    the manuscript collections and periodicals/newspapers consulted. Despite these minor limitations,
                    scholars of antebellum America, print culture, and women's history will join literary
                    historians in finding this a valuable addition to nineteenth–century studies.</p>

            <p>Contemporary popular music in America reveals an ever–increasing indebtedness to
                    international influences. This anthology, an outgrowth of a 1992 conference at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, reminds us that this process is part of a long tradition. What was sung and played in
                    America involved an internationalization with roots going back to the earliest days of settlement in
                    the 1600s when Britons, Germans, and others began coming to America.</p>
            <p>In their introductory essay, Philip V. Bohlman and Otto Holzapfel indicate that their major goal is
                    to define German–American ethnicity by study–ing its music. The effort is
                    unusually complex and problematic as it often involves assessing the assimilation of
                    non–German musical elements. By showing the fluidity of the making of
                    German–American ethnicity, the essayists put to rest the older folkloric notion that an
                    ethnic group's music was homogeneous and static. It was, to the contrary, a mixture of
                    internal and external influences even before it arrived on these shores.</p>
            <p>Unlike most peer studies of ethnic music, the editors as well as the authors of the essays are
                    knowledgeable scholars from both sides of the Atlantic. This enables readers to experience <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-100-3-063"/> a perspective embracing both the emigrant and immigrant lands.</p>
            <p>Another distinguishing aspect of the work is the choice of the ethnic group studied. The Germans were
                    one of the largest white contingents to come to America, and they had a powerful influence on
                    American music and culture. German bands and instrumentalists were ubiquitous entertainers in the
                    1800s, playing both German and American pieces in concert halls, at public festivals and civic
                    occasions, as well as in taverns and saloons. They also entertained at their own affairs, in
                    churches and music contests, and at parties and family celebrations. Even at these internal affairs
                    their repertoires were often eclectic, reflecting a mixture of influences.</p>
            <p>The essays offer unusual insights about music and the transformation of German ethnic identity. One
                    of the best is Kathleen Conzen's micro–study of rural Sauk Valley Germans, in
                    which she shows how her subjects manipulated American law to both enforce and oppose group behavior.
                    She also cites the German sense of mission and cultural superiority over "joyless"
                    American materialism that later changed and accepted mainstream American music. An essay by Leo
                    Schelbert illustrates how distinctive Swiss immigrant music reveals that group's
                    uncertainty about their future in the new land.</p>
            <p>Three essays, by Lawrence Libin, Bohlman, and Helmut Walz, treat the importance of hymnal and sheet
                    music in early colonial times. These ma terials reveal the process of
                    German–Americanization, including borrowings from several of the group's
                    religions in America: Catholicism, Lutheranism, and even Judaism. Folk–lorist James
                    Leary's essay notes that the German concertina has concentrated in the Upper Midwest; while
                    it still is considered German, the concertina also has evolved into an instrument of and for the
                    common folk. In the final essay, Alan Burdette deals directly with the book's theme of
                    change, discussing what he calls traditionalization, a process that mixes past and present.</p>
            <p>The work does have certain flaws but, considering the huge scope of its topic, most are excusable.
                    The musical coverage cannot be comprehensive, but it is nevertheless regrettable that no mention is
                    made of the important ethnic labor songs. Also, while the individual entries are of uniformly high
                    quality, they have little continuity—a common problem with anthologies. Nevertheless, the
                    work is a pioneering venture in making ethnic music a part of our social history, and it makes a
                    substantial contribution to the ever–growing literature on the relationship of music to
                    group ethnicity and assimilation. Enhanced as it is with extensive bibliographies and an
                    accompanying CD, it should encourage future research on the subject and serve as a model for other
                    studies.</p>

                    $19.95.)</head>
            <p>This work is a collection of twelve essays and lectures that the author contributed to the subfield
                    of "memory studies" over a fifteen–year span ending in 1998. These
                    essays address Dwight W. Blight's primary scholarly concerns: "the meaning of the
                    causes, course and consequences of the American Civil War; the nature of African American history
                    and the significance of race in American history generally; and the character and purpose of the
                    study of historical memory" (p. ix). After an introduction intended as a primer on the
                    relationship between history and memory, <hi rend="i">Beyond the Battlefield</hi> is organized into
                    three sections. The first part, "Preludes," contains four chapters that treat the
                    coming of the Civil War. One of the most appealing, a lecture delivered on the centennial observance
                    of the death of Frederick Douglass, examines how the black leader's three autobiographies
                    attempted to order the passage of time. The second part, dealing with the war, is the lengthiest
                    portion of the book. Those familiar with Blight's <hi rend="i">Race and Reunion: The Civil
                        War in American Memory</hi> (2001) will find that the five chapters in this section cover the
                    same ground as that highly acclaimed book.</p>
            <p>The third part, "Postludes," comprises two chapters and an epilogue. In one,
                    entitled "W E. B. DuBois and the Struggle for American Historical Memory" (which
                    previously appeared in an anthology, History <hi rend="i">and Memory in African–American
                        Culture</hi>, eds. Genevieve Fabre and Robert G. O'Meally, 1994), Blight declares that
                    "the real tragedy of Reconstruction was not in the history but in the histories"
                    and looks to a day "when the marketplace for the construction of social memories
                    … [is] as free and open as possible, while still firmly guided by the rules of
                    scholarship," ensuring that "the politics of remembering and forgetting might be,
                    here and there, overcome" (p. 250). Whether that is "a vain hope or a realized
                    ideal remains the principal challenge of all those seriously interested in American historical
                    consciousness" (p. 251). In the adjoining chapter, Blight assesses the vision of the late
                    Nathan Irvin Hug–gins, chiefly through his imaginative, though controversial Black
                    Odyssey: <hi rend="i">The African American Ordeal in Slavery</hi> (1977). A work that reflected the
                        <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-100-3-065"/> influence of Oscar Handlin's <hi rend="i">The
                        Uprooted</hi> (1951), <hi rend="i">Black</hi> Odyssey's chief target was what Blight
                    labels the "Ban–croftian paradigm"—the "master
                    narrative of providential destiny." Blight suggests the need for a "replacement
                    narrative"—one that, like Huggins's work, will pay attention to
                    "contradiction and irony and not flee from them" (p. 273).</p>
            <p>The chief value of this work lies not in its essays on memory and the Civil War. Readers interested

                    been saying in the recent past about the differences between and the similarities of history and
                    memory. Blight clearly comes down on the side of convergence—between, for instance,
                    history and literature, and especially poetry and mythology. This work also allows readers to
                    explore the developing thought of an important historian of the Civil War and of African Americans.</p>

            <p>According to Webster's, a revisionist is simply "one who favors revision."
                    Customarily, the term describes a historian who alters previously accepted interpretations of a
                    historical event. In this sense, William Marvel is surely one of the most effective and reliable
                    revisionists in a field—Civil War history—long marked by romance and legend
                    and greatly in need of cleansing. Marvel takes on the tough ones, too: in the past he has considered
                    Ambrose Burnside and Andersonville prison; in this volume he reconsiders Robert E. Lee's
                    storied final campaign. In a foreword, Marvel states that "no episode of the war (perhaps
                    not even <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>

                    </placeName>" (pp. ix–x). After identifying the prior romances, Marvel follows
                    Lee and his beaten Army of Northern <placeName>

                    accepting Lee's surrender of what remained of his army.</p>
            <p>The defeat of the Confederacy was the just outcome of its unjust and self–destructive
                    rebellion in behalf of preserving the institution of slavery. Nevertheless, the desperate last
                    flight <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-100-3-066"/> of the southern common soldiers is a tragic tale. They
                    were led to that end by their leaders' pathology. It has seldom been acknowledged that six
                    thousand Confederates were killed or wounded in the flight to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in addition to the hundreds of prisoners and deserters lost—senselessly
                    prolonging the agony to serve Lee's personal sense of honor. (See Thomas L. Livermore, <hi rend="i">Numbers and Losses in</hi> the Civi! <hi rend="i">War in America,
                    1861–1865</hi> [1986], p. 137.)</p>
            <p>As the casualty data suggest, Lee's final retreat was marked by skirmishes along the way,
                    through Amelia Court House, at Farmville (where 8,000 rebels were captured), and at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the early hours of April 9 before the truce. Throughout "the last
                    mile," Lee persisted in driving his soldiers, thus causing the additional loss of life and
                    limb. He finally desisted only when the pursuing Federals literally forced him to do so. General
                    Porter Alexander, Longstreet's artillery commander, described Lee's state of mind
                    as of April 5: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We took the road to Jetersville where it was reported that Sheridan with his cavalry crossed
                            our path &amp; Gen. Lee intended to attack him. I rode with him and his staff &amp;
                            Gen. Longstreet… I never saw Gen. Lee so anxious to bring on a battle in my life
                            as he seemed that afternoon, but a conference with Gen. [WH.E] Lee in command of the
                            Confederate cavalry in our front seemed to upset him greatly. [W.H.F] Lee reported that
                            Sheridan had been reinforced by two infantry corps who were entrenching &amp; that force
                            was more than we could venture to attack. (From Gary W Gallagher, ed., Fighting/or <hi rend="i">the Confederacy: The Personal Recollections of General Edward Porter

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Performing the American Frontier, 1870–1906</hi>, Roger A. Hall's
                    chronicle of American plays and theatrical productions that treated the subject of the <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-100-3-067"/> westward movement, is a theatrical survey in the tradition of Garff B.
                    Wilson, the author of A <hi rend="i">History of American Acting</hi> (1966) and <hi rend="i">Three
                        Hundred Years of American Drama and Theatre</hi> (1973, 1982).</p>
            <p>In a chronologically organized narration, Hall discusses or describes more than fifty plays, devoting
                    special attention to fifteen, among them: <hi rend="i">Across the Continent</hi> (1870); <hi rend="i">Kit, the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>

                    (1904); <hi rend="i">The Squaw Man</hi> (1905); and <hi rend="i">The Girl of the Golden West</hi>
                    (1905). Typical of the author's treatment of these works is his section on <hi rend="i">My
                        Partner.</hi> Here, Hall offers brief biographies of producers Louis Aldrich and Charles T.
                    Parsloe, describes the circumstances that led to the production, provides a synopsis of the play and
                    a summary of the reviews, lists the cast members, engages in a brief analysis of the play's
                    treatment of moral standards and use of a courtroom scene, and traces the effects of the
                    play's success on Aldrich, Parsloe, and playwright Bartley <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Hall's study does extend this basic formula in places. He treats two aspects of the
                    public's fascination with Buffalo Bill: the plays that formed a "craze"
                    beginning in 1872, and William E Cody's own Wild West show and its imitators. Elsewhere,
                    Hall moves somewhat outside the boundaries indicated in the title, including, for example, a
                    description of several "Indian" plays that appeared before 1870, starting with the
                    unproduced <hi rend="i">Ponteach</hi> (written in 1766).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Performing the American Frontier</hi> offers a wealth of information, sometimes for its
                    own sake, as when Hall includes details regarding Arthur Mc–Kee Rankin's
                    philandering (p. 102) or relates that Oliver Doud Byron served as a pallbearer for fellow actor
                    Francis S. Chanfrau (p. 47). Hall lists or mentions many more plays than he discusses, and he covers
                    not only the playwrights but also the relevant actors, managers, directors and producers, providing
                    commentary on such figures as Ned Buntline, Martha Jane Canary, John Wallace "Captain
                    Jack" Crawford, Charles E. "Dashing Charlie" Emmett, Kate Mayhew, John B. "<placeName>

                    </placeName> Jack" Omohundro, and Anne Pixley. In brief asides to the reader, he suggests
                    connections with recent popular culture, as when he presents My <hi rend="i">Partner</hi> as
                    analogous to "a western movie where Ernest Borgnine marries the heroine" (p. 121)
                    or refutes a negative review of M'liss by suggesting that the feature film <hi rend="i">Dances With Wolves</hi> (1990) had extended, and therefore validated, the potential of the
                    material developed in the 1878 melodrama (p. 113).</p>
            <p>The book is comprehensive, accurate, well–researched, and thoroughly documented from
                    reliable, frequently primary, resources. What some readers will miss is a central argument that
                    Hall's facts might serve. The introduction is by far the most thoughtful portion of the
                    study: Hall argues that the theatre, art, and literature of the <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-100-3-068"/>
                    latter nineteenth century developed the frontier images, especially the cowboy heroes, that later
                    became so well known through film and television. He suggests that the frontier experience had, as
                    early as the 1870s, become a form of entertainment for those who could afford to hire someone like
                    Cody to serve as their guide. He explores the notion of heroism, the development of stagecraft in
                    service of scenes involving gunfire and the burning of the prairie, the impact of the frontier
                    landscape, the promise of the West, the link between masculinity and violence, the challenges to
                    traditional femininity, the economic forces behind the westward expansion of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and the market for entertainment based on a subject of widespread fascination. In this
                    in–traduction lies the potential for an insightful study that would engage the work of
                    scholars like Rosemarie K. Bank and Richard Slotkin, delving into the intricacies of cultural
                    production in relation to the social and perceptual changes that accompanied the concept of
                    frontier. Instead, Hall has chosen a different course, one that provides a different service to the
                    field.</p>

            <p>The cover of <hi rend="i">Making Men, Making Class</hi> features a picture of a shop meeting of
                    rugged male factory workers, three women (clerks?), and a child, all of them listening to the
                    message of two well–dressed evangelists. Interestingly, for a YMCA publicity photo, the
                    image is ambiguous. Its focus is on the female evangelist who seems to be speaking at that moment.
                    Some, including the women, sit attentively. Yet several of the male workers have already shifted
                    their gaze from the speakers; above them, a stern–looking man in a suit appears to be
                    watching the crowd more than the speakers. What is the message being presented by the evangelists?
                    Toward whom is it aimed? For whom was the gathering called?</p>
            <p>For a half century beginning with the railroad strikes of 1877, YMCAs held thousands of factory
                    gatherings for industrial workers, suggesting an agenda much more central to the emergence of
                    corporate capitalism <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-100-3-069"/> than is typically assumed. It is Thomas
                    Winter's goal to examine the organization's messages and to recapture its
                    importance in defining class and gender in modern America.</p>
            <p>The YMCA embarked on its appeal to workingmen amid the turmoil of rapidly escalating labor strife in
                    the 1870s. Since railroads were the most visible and despised corporations, they provided the
                    testing ground for the YMCA vision of social harmony. At first, this program involved building
                    character in American males by offering an alternative to the prevalent leisure habits of masculine
                    working–class culture. Employers funded excellent facilities for the
                    "neutral" YMCAs to encourage the self–restraint that fostered
                    "individual acquisitiveness and entrepreneurial drive" (p. 145). But railroad
                    executives always expected that such traits would unite workers and employers in a paternalistic
                    formula emphasizing hard work, efficiency, and upward mobility rather than collective action and
                    conflict. Key to YMCA success was the recruitment of aspiring and moral young men to staff the
                    facilities and sell its ideas to the rough, masculine railroad workers. At first, the recruiting
                    process was haphazard, but it fortunately found a seedbed in the "burned–over
                    district" of upstate <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>By the turn of the century, the YMCA was ready to take its railroad program into the
                    working–class neighborhoods of the nation's cities. There, the professional
                    staff faced new challenges complicated by differences of ethnicity and religion, as well as by labor
                    radicalism. Further, the organization's emphasis on character as a means to individual
                    independence clashed with the reality of declining opportunities for upward mobility. YMCA officials
                    added the notion of "personality" to their lexicon of ideal manhood but defined it
                    in a way that emphasized their own ability to exert a manly dominance over others, in this case the
                    men of the working class. This blending of personality (for the professional staff) and character
                    (which came to mean faithful, productive work for wage earners) enabled YMCA officials to redefine
                    manhood and think of themselves as superior in terms of both gender and class.</p>
            <p>Although Winter's title suggests that the YMCA was "making men" of the
                    working class, his is really much more a story about resolving the identity crisis of
                    middle–class professionals. It thus reminds one of Richard Hofstadter's and
                    Robert H. Wiebe's interpretations of the Progressive Era, updated by cultural history. That
                    is not a flaw, but rather a strength. The book is deeply researched, well–written, and
                    makes a significant contribution to understanding the creation of a modern corporate culture.
                    However, the author missed a terrific opportunity to compare the YMCA with the YWCA, especially
                    given the provocative picture on the cover. YWCA industrial work was subject to the same corporate
                    pressures to emphasize programs that denied collective action and labor reform, but women rejected
                    those demands. The YWCAs <pb n="278" id="VAA4025-100-3-070"/> professional staff worked closely with
                    the Women's Trade Union League and the Consumer's League to improve the lives of
                    working women and to usher in modern liberalism rather than corporate paternalism. Putting gender
                    and class at the center of such a comparative organizational study might advance even further our
                    understanding of how the Ys helped sort out the interplay of these identities.</p>

            <p>Today the term "factory farm" conjures up images of huge, confined feeding
                    operations (places in which hundreds of thousands of animals are prepared for market on
                    scientifically formulated diets) and of expansive grain farms that cultivate thousands of acres of
                    com, wheat, and soybeans, all requiring heavy capital investment in equipment, hybrid seed, and
                    chemicals. These trends have indeed exerted a significant impact on agriculture in Indiana. While <placeName>

                    </placeName> boasts several large hog–feeding operations and DuBois County turkey growers
                    are among the nation's leading producers of birds for the Thanksgiving table, many Hoosier
                    hog farmers find it increasingly difficult to compete with mega–producers in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and southern Indiana dairy farmers who once milked one hundred cows have ceased
                    operation in the face of competition from western dairies that milk between 2,500 and 10,000 cows.
                    Meanwhile, many Hoosier corn and soybean farmers use computers, global–positioning
                    systems, and other technological innovations to improve productivity, increase acreage, and reduce
                    environmental degradation.</p>
            <p>Deborah Fitzgerald's Every <hi rend="i">Farm a Factory: The Industrial Ideal in American
                        Agriculture</hi> says very little about the current state of American agriculture, but it is
                    packed with insights into the origins of industrial agriculture and the consequent process that
                    brought us to where we are today. Looking back from the 1980s, when many farmers went bankrupt after
                    investing heavily in new machinery, land, and livestock, Fitzgerald traces the transformation of
                    American farming to the 1920s, when many farmers, in the wake of the agricultural depression that
                    followed World War I, adopted an "industrial ideal" based on "the five
                    components that characterized nearly every successful factory: large–scale production,
                    specialized <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-100-3-071"/> machines, standardization of processes and
                    products, reliance on managerial (rather than artisanal) expertise, and continual evocation of
                    'efficiency' as a production mandate" (pp. 21–23). The
                    prophets of this industrial ideal included agricultural economists and engineers based in the
                    Cooperative Extension Service at land–grant colleges, urban as well as country bankers,
                    farm–implement manufacturers and dealers, and others with a vested interest in persuading
                    farmers to adopt the factory model of production. Reinforcing the gospel were various agencies of
                    the U.S. Department of Agriculture, especially the Bureau of Agricultural Economics.</p>
            <p>The centerpiece of Fitzgerald's essay is a well–crafted "analysis of
                    several industrial farming operations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName>, particularly those owned by Thomas D. Campbell, a successful
                    farmer–engineer who attempted to apply industrial principles and techniques of
                    mechanization, expert management, and economies of scale to his operations. Although her analysis
                    focuses on the West, where aridity required large acreage, Fitzgerald takes care to demonstrate that
                    the industrial ideal was adopted at varying rates by farmers in differing regions, depending on
                    their unique combinations of climate and commodities. Built on a broad array of secondary and
                    primary sources, her argument about the origins and development of industrial agriculture is
                    compelling. As an urban–agribusiness historian, I do not fully share her underlying
                    Jef–fersonian agrarianism, which regrets the rise of industrial farming, but my
                    ambivalence in no way detracts from the persuasiveness of her case. I highly recommend this book to
                    anyone attempting to understand the roots of twenty–first–century agriculture.</p>

            <p>The Madame Walker Theater Center in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> stands out as one of the very few historic sites on the na– tional landscape
                    officially commemorating the achievements of African–American women. Providing space for
                        <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-100-3-072"/> arts education and performances, the center occupies the
                    second factory building of Madame C. J. Walker's fabulously successful hair products
                    enterprise. Unfortunately, this site, memorializing a woman's life, is a rarity. As the
                    essays in this anthology testify, the history of American women remains startlingly invisible at the
                    vast majority of the nation's recognized landmarks.</p>
            <p>Preservationists have long acknowledged that women, such as Ann Pamela Cunningham, and
                    women's organizations, such as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mount Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> Ladies' Association of the Union, spearheaded the initial efforts to protect
                    and interpret the nation's historic sites. Academic historians, however, have failed to
                    incorporate the stories of these early preservationists in the larger story of
                    middle–class women's activism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
                    In one of the volume's most spirited essays, Barbara J. Howe asserts that these women
                    embraced their cause with the same level of intensity as their counterparts in the temperance and
                    suffrage movements. In many cases, their efforts achieved long–lasting success, saving
                    such national treasures as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mount Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alamo</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Ironically, most of these triumphs glorified men's activities, accepting a
                    subordinate position for women.</p>
            <p>Restoring women's place on the historic landscape will be a complex project requiring
                    changes in research methodology, professional practice, and public perceptions. In recognition of
                    this fact, the editors have divided the volume into five parts. Part one highlights the need to
                    document women's contribution to the preservation movement. Part two focuses on the
                    practical problems of interpreting women's history at official museums and sites. In part
                    three, several authors propose methods and paradigms for understanding women's connection
                    to the physical environment of the past. Part four acknowledges successful efforts by communities,
                    states, and countries to identify, document, and protect women's history sites. In part
                    five, several contributors look at the big picture, attempting to establish a national agenda for
                    placing women on the historic landscape. It is clear, however, that we have some way to go before a
                    coherent policy emerges.</p>
            <p>Preservation ideology itself is a stumbling block. As Abigail A. Van Slyck points out in an
                    interesting essay on saving public libraries, preservationists have long focused on saving exteriors
                    rather than interior spaces. This well–established bias tends to emphasize the
                    achievements of male architects and craftsmen, who designed and erected the buildings, over the
                    activities of women, who occupied their interior spaces. In the case of public libraries, women
                    often filed the catalog cards, served the patrons, and sat behind the service desks. Destroying the
                    interiors of these buildings, while preserving the outer shells, destroys the evidence of these
                    women's labor.</p>
            <p>It is not enough to commemorate the extraordinary success of a few women, such as Madame Walker. The
                        <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-100-3-073"/> editors of this volume advocate an "inclusive
                    agenda," which will require identifying and protecting buildings, structures, and
                    landscapes associated with the dazzling variety of women's experiences on this continent.
                    This excellent volume offers no easy solutions, but suggests lines of thought for future scholars,
                    professionals, and preservation advocates.</p>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">Sloan Rules</hi> David Farber has written an informative, balanced, and highly
                    readable account of the life and impact of one of the most important figures in American business.
                    Other historians and commentators, notably Alfred D. Chandler and Peter F Drucker, have outlined
                    Sloan's role in creating the vertically integrated corporation, but they focused on Sloan
                    as efficient, rational, and objective— in short, the consummate businessman. Although
                    Farber covers some aspects of this story, his contribution here is to sketch out Sloan's
                    life and business career before General Motors, and then to examine the ways that Sloan put his
                    influence and con– siderable financial resources behind an agenda Farber calls
                    "corporate conservatism." This included strenuously opposing not only government
                    safety standards for automobiles, but also most aspects of the New Deal (as did many other business
                    leaders of the day, to be sure). Throughout his long career as the head of General Motors, Sloan put
                    corporate well–being before all other concerns. At the same time, however, Farber points
                    out that Sloan also created the Sloan–Kettering Institute for Cancer Research and the
                    Alfred P Sloan Foundation. Farber has produced an account that contributes to our understanding of
                    the larger issue of the influence of private money, <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-100-3-074"/> trade
                    associations, and corporate public relations upon governmental policies and effectiveness.</p>
            <p>Farber describes numerous examples of Sloan's single–minded pursuit of corporate
                    profit and violent opposition to government "interference" in any form from the
                    beginning of the Depression onward. Among these were his creation of the Automobile Safety
                    Foundation—which for decades successfully forestalled legislation that would have
                    increased automobile makers' responsibilities— and his generous support (along
                    with members of the DuPont family) of the xenophobic, anti–Semitic American Liberty
                    League to oppose the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and other New Deal candidates. Sloan also
                    deployed his own wealth and the formidable public relations machinery of GM to oppose most New Deal
                    programs. Later, in the 1940s, Sloan only reluctantly switched to war production. All this Sloan did
                    in the name of protecting GM profits and business autonomy.</p>
            <p>As Farber cautions, Sloan's private life and thoughts will probably remain unknown, given a
                    lack of documentation and Sloan's flat refusal to talk about himself. Under these
                    constraints, it would have been better if Farber had left out speculative passages about
                    personalities and how Sloan and others felt or acted in private circumstances. This, though, is a
                    minor complaint about a book which adds a new layer to our understanding of the term
                    "Sloanism."</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Making and</hi> Selling <hi rend="i">Cars</hi>, James M. Rubenstein has taken on the
                    extremely ambitious task of describing the production and marketing of automobiles in the U.S., <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>, and Europe. For readers with a particular interest in the automobile industry or
                    business history generally, Rubenstein offers a broad overview covering the earliest days of the
                    American industry down to the present. He discusses parts production and supply, modes of
                    production, labor, marketing, and the rise of today's global market. The first half of the
                    book addresses manufacturing; the second, sales. Within each half, Rubenstein arranges topics in
                    paired thematic chapters. In odd–numbered chapters, he offers a synthesis of the early
                    history of the industry, which witnessed the introduction of mass–production and
                    standardization. Even–numbered chapters treat more recent developments, encompassing
                    roughly the last quarter century. Examples include the replacement of the Fordist paradigm with a
                    model based on Japanese "flexible production," and changing expectations and hopes
                    for the labor force, ending with a summary of recent activity in other Asian countries, notably <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>. Rubenstein illuminates aspects mostly neglected in standard histories of the industry,
                    particularly in his treatment of Japanese automobile production, which includes an account of how
                    U.S. companies responded, and of the cross–fertilization that eventually led to the
                    present international market.</p>
            <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-100-3-075"/>
            <p>In adding coverage of the last twenty–five years to the classic narratives of the
                    automobile industry by James J. Flink and John B. Rae, Rub–enstein has helped address a
                    long–felt need. The chapters dealing with recent history will particularly interest
                    readers who want to know about the global automobile business since the various crises and
                    challenges that the American industry faced beginning in the 1970s. Specialist readers may wish
                    Rubenstein had utilized more of the recent literature on the larger implications of consumerism,
                    installment buying, marketing, and advertising. More could also have been said about the
                    long–term side effects of the automobile industry, such as safety, environmental damage,
                    and the complicated story of government subsidies which have helped from its earliest days to make
                    the industry possible. Despite these issues, for readers seeking an overview of the industry
                    Rub–enstein's book offers a useful profile, especially for the last quarter
                    century.</p>

            <p>This is a book with a purpose that succeeds admirably in not becoming partisan. It is a serviceable
                    book that does what it sets out to do, which is to create a vocabulary of comparative terms for
                    assessing American downtowns. Is it fun to read? Not particularly. Is it useful? That depends on
                    what you want as a reader. This is a book of information, not big ideas. And if it is information
                    about downtowns you are after, then this may be the book for you.</p>
            <p>Ford's work enters a field already well established, which might be referred to loosely as
                    contemporary city studies. It is a field that starts, maybe, with Jane Jacobs and <hi rend="i">The
                        Death and Life of Great American Cities</hi> (1961), and proceeds through the work of, among
                    others, William H. Whyte in <hi rend="i">City: Rediscovering the Center</hi> (1988), Richard
                    Sennett's philosophizing in <hi rend="i">The Conscience of the Eye: the Design and Social
                        Life of Cities</hi> (1990,1992), and on to the postmodernist Mike Davis's <hi rend="i">City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1990, 1992), and more recent works such as Thomas Bender's <hi rend="i">The Unfinished City: <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                        </placeName> and the Metropolitan Idea</hi> (2002), and Robert M. Fogelson's <hi rend="i">Downtown:</hi>
                    <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-100-3-076"/>
                    <hi rend="i">Its Rise and Fall, 1880–1950</hi> (2001), to which Ford's book
                    bears an immediate resemblance.</p>
            <p>But Ford's work is distinctive in an important way. A geographer on the faculty of San Diego
                    State University for more than 30 years, Ford is not out to intellectualize or interpret so much as
                    he is to describe, and his object is not the city as a whole, but only the downtown: "My
                    goal is to add to our understanding of just what the American downtown has been and what it is
                    becoming. … I feel that we need to describe downtown before we can critique it
                    adequately" (p. 5). To that end, he studies sixteen downtowns of American metropolitan
                    areas with populations between one and three million, downtowns that he knows well and has visited
                    over a period of years: <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Each is amply illustrated with photographs and drawings.</p>
            <p>Each of the sixteen downtowns is graded qualitatively relative to ten variables: physical site,
                    street morphology, civic space, office/skyline, retail anchors, hotels/convention facilities, major
                    attractions, historic districts/support zones, residential activity and variety, and transit
                    options. Each downtown ends up with a composite score, by means of which it can be compared to
                    others. Seattle finishes at the top (91 out of 100 points), Charlotte at the bottom, with a score of
                    48. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Minneapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. "The goal," Ford says, "is to clarify what works and what
                    does not as cities enter the twenty–first century. … I propose a series of
                    generalizations on downtown morphology that I hope will elucidate the processes at work in the new
                    American downtown" (p. 278).</p>
            <p>Ford does not discover anything that people living in his selected cities do not already know.
                    Consider, for example, his conclusion about downtown <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>: "While all of the downtowns on the list have made great strides over the past
                    two decades, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> is a leading candidate for the 'most improved' award. …
                    Today, the city has a lively, compact core and a strong image as a sports and convention center.
                    … The downtown core still has relatively poor connections to most of the surrounding
                    neighborhoods, although major improvements are being made, especially toward the <geogName>White
                        River</geogName>" (p. 286). The value of Ford's study lies not in its
                    political or cultural insight, but rather in the kind of conclusion–making that his
                    comparable data facilitate.</p>
            <p>His overall conclusion is a vote for what (without any implied negative) might be called a
                    Disney–fied downtown: "I present the final composite generalization: the linear,
                    Disneylandlike, megastructure–buffered, amenity–oriented,
                    civic–centered, greater downtown special event venue model. … The pieces may
                    vary from city to city, <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-100-3-077"/> but the linear organization,
                    amenity–orientation, big–footprint buildings, and distinctive subdistricts
                    characterize nearly all successful downtowns" (p. 308). Ford's findings are not
                    path–breaking, probably, but his conclusions are well worth considering.</p>

            <p>This volume began when the editors' father purchased a box of old letters dating from the
                    1860s through the 1920s; his purchase provided a view into Indiana's past through the eyes
                    of the members of two families, the Cateys and the Scotts. The editors have reproduced and annotated
                    selected Civil War–era letters from the collection, including many photographs of the
                    letters and their writers. There are numerous helpful explanatory footnotes, a family tree, and an
                    appendix of biographical notes. This book would be a good addition to the collections of Civil War
                    enthusiasts with an interest in Indiana's volunteer regiments.</p>

            <p>Morrow's <hi rend="i">A Good Night for Freedom</hi>, a work of historical fiction intended
                    for readers ages five to nine, is a story of escape from slavery. Based on the author's
                    research of the Underground Railroad in antebellum southern Indiana, the book tells the story of a
                    pair of runaway slave sisters and the moral struggle of the young white girl who stumbles upon them
                    in a cellar at the home of Levi and Katy Coffin. The sisters, Susan and Margaret, were, like the
                    Coffins, real people. The white girl, Hallie, faces the same moral dilemma that Huckleberry Finn
                    deals with in deciding whether or not to turn in the runaway slave, Jim; Hallie makes the same
                    decision that Huck does and lies to the slavehunters who are seeking the sisters. Illustrator
                    Leonard Jenkins uses spray paint, pastel, colored pencil, and acrylic to <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-100-3-079"/> create an otherworldly effect. A winter landscape of stark trees and
                    harsh skies rendered in unexpectedly strong colors enhances the feeling of danger. <hi rend="i">A

            <p>Anyone with an interest in the history of the Catholic church in Indiana will already be familiar
                    with St. Meinrad Abbey and its training of priests and theologians for both the state and the
                    region. As the abbey passes its 150th anniversary, this book provides a look at its early history.
                    The author includes chapters on the Benedictines (the abbey's founding order) in both
                    Europe and America, the founding and staffing of American parishes, the abbey's role in
                    shaping regional Catholic identity through its missions, societies, and worship, and the central
                    role played by the abbey school. Yock draws extensively on the abbey's archives to tell the
                    story of these years. The book is recommended for readers interested in the history of early
                    Catholicism in the state and the Midwest. Perhaps this well–researched and detailed work
                    will inspire the complete 150–year history which St. Meinrad's deserves.</p>

            <p>Many long–time readers of the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> will welcome the republication of this
                    book; others with an interest in state history, the history of education, or urban history who have
                    not read Cohen's book should do so. The author examines the unique progressive school plan
                    developed for the new city of Gary by progressive educator William Wirt. He follows the initial
                    implementation of the Wirt system through wars, the Depression, and the early challenges of
                    integration in the 1950s. The book was (at its first publication in 1990) and still is, in the words
                    of education historian William J. Reese in his new foreword, "…a landmark volume
                    in the shaping of the historiography of American education" (p. xii).</p>

                    and homes, and scenes of ordinary people at work and at leisure. Racing fans will be fascinated by a

                    regular folks. An index could help readers return to their favorite stories, and source citations

            <p>Drawing almost exclusively on reminiscences and box scores, Guffey assembles chapters on the town of
                    Milan, the team's regular seasons and tournaments of 1953 and 1954, and the lives of the
                    coach and each of the players since beating <placeName>

                    comparisons to the film <hi rend="i">Hoosiers</hi> (1987), but little development of individual
                    personality or broader familial and cultural context. The 1993 conclusion is a prediction that
                    one–class basketball would never die in Indiana, while the 2003 introduction registers
                    the reactions of the book's subjects to the 1996 decision to implement a
                    multi–class tournament.</p>

                    criticisms of Congress (that crooks and lobbyists promote gridlock and pork–barrel
                    legislation because they are out of touch and untrustworthy) and outlines ways that the institution
                    could be more efficient (by enforcing ethics and civility, communicating with the White House, and
                    budgeting biennially rather than annually). He concludes by describing ways that citizens can
                    participate, including suggestions on how to make your correspondence stand out from the 250 million
                    other letters received on Capitol Hill.</p>

                    </placeName> still left as it was before European Americans reworked the topography.</p>
            <p>The book, a "natural" for the coffee table of anyone who loves the
                    Blue–grass State, is a product of thirteen years of exploring woodlands and grasslands.
                    The author is extension wildlife specialist and associate professor of forestry at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>; his one–hundred–plus color photographs speak for themselves of
                    his artistry with a camera. The pictures range from panoramic views of the Big South Fork of the
                        <geogName>Cumberland River</geogName> (p. 123) and Robinson Forest in full fall dress (pp.
                    94–95), to an intimate close–up of the rare grass pink orchid (p. 7). The
                    two–page spread of snow geese filling the night sky horizon at moonrise is hauntingly
                    beautiful (pp. 178–79). The book is geared for the general reader, yet those with
                    stronger backgrounds in natural science will not be bored. One cannot leaf through the pages of this
                    book without feeling a strong urge to see these wild places, but because many of the sites are in
                    private hands, the only access to them is through Barnes's pictures and words.</p>

            <p>Those interested in architecture, interior design, and historic homes will <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-100-3-082"/> enjoy the text and lavish illustrations of <hi rend="i">Governors' Mansions.</hi> Liberman provides short histories of how twelve midwestern
                    states found proper and permanent residences for their governors, as well as offering a more
                    detailed discussion of each state's existing mansion. The story of Indiana's
                    governor's mansion takes many twists and turns before ending with the purchase of a 1928
                    mansion on Indi–anapolis's North Meridian Street in 1974. It is intriguing that
                    Indiana had no official governor's residence between 1865 and 1919 and that governors in
                    that period had to find their own housing.</p>

                    </placeName> Press, 2004. Pp. xxiii, 303. Illustrations, notes, index. $39.95.)</p>
            <p>Examining eight American "gothic" painters (as well as making reference to many
                    other artists and writers), Burns seeks "the art of haunting," which manifests
                    itself as a critique of "the Enlightenment vision of the rational American Republic as a
                    place of liberty, balance, harmony, and progress" (p. xix). Personal and
                    socio–cultural ghosts haunt these painters and the images they created. Burns argues that
                    critics should not view gothic paintings as the antithesis of quintessentially American
                    nineteenth–century landscape paintings, but in stead as part of the canon as "
                    [gothic painting] expands and complicates the canon and suggests productive ways of rethinking
                    it" (p. xxiii).</p>

            <p>Americans are partial to absorbing their nation's history via fiction, the history mingled
                    among the adventures and romances of made–up characters with whom they might better
                    identify than with the likes of generals and presidents. Until the advent of television, much of
                    American historical fiction was disseminated through popular magazines, notably the <hi rend="i">Saturday Evening Post</hi>, in the form of short stories. This volume of thirty–one
                    such stories from the eve of the Civil War through the end of Reconstruction affords
                    today's readers the opportunity to see the events and people of the period from the
                    perspective of contemporaries. The periodicals represented include <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly,
                        Harper's Weekly, Southern Magazine</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Overland Monthly.</hi> Most
                    of the authors of these stories have long been forgotten; Louisa May Alcott and Samuel Clemens (Mark
                    Twain) are the exceptions. The subjects range from an attack on the Underground Railroad to the
                    reminiscences of a former slave.</p>
