            <head>The Gas Boom in East Central Indiana</head>
            <byline>James A. Glass<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>East central Indiana is known for its mixture of agricultural production, medium-sized industrial
                    cities, and small towns with turn-of-the-century architecture. The production of corn, cereal
                    grains, and livestock in the region goes back to the beginnings of settlement before the Civil War.
                    The industrial characteristics were brought about by one of the great booms of the late nineteenth
                    century in the Midwest: the discovery of natural gas. The eruption of real estate speculation,
                    industrial development, commercial expansion and population growth transformed a 2,500-square-mile
                    portion of the state from a landscape of farms, forests, and agricultural villages into a territory
                    in which cities and boom towns dominated, each teeming with factories, neighborhoods, and commercial
                    districts. Between 1886 and 1901, an eleven-county area in the east central portion of the state
                    became one of the leading centers of heavy industrial production in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the principal manufacturing region of Indiana. Although gas ran out after the turn
                    of the century, thereby greatly diminishing the economic vitality and size of many boom towns, the
                    principal cities created by the boom persevered and used the industrial foundation bestowed by
                    natural gas to lure additional factories and commerce. In the smaller cities and towns of the area,
                    the gas boom left a few factories, distinctive brick commercial business districts, and attractive
                    residential neighborhoods.</p>
            <p>In 1886, east central Indiana contained some of the richest farmland in the state. Interspersed with
                    the fields were remnants of the hardwood forests that once covered much of the state. County seats,
                    the largest communities in each county, contained a modest number of stores, lawyers'
                    offices, grain elevators, and furniture or wagon plants. There were a few neighborhoods containing
                    Italianate-style houses erected by well-to-do farmers or merchants and a few churches representing
                    the principal Protestant denominations. The populations of the county seats rarely exceeded 2,500
                    people. There were <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In the county seats there were frequently a couple of wealthy men who had made modest fortunes after
                    the Civil War with small manufacturing operations that utilized the surrounding hardwood forests or
                    agricultural produce. Others had made money in banking, real estate, or by luring railroads to run
                    through their town. In <placeName>

                    fortune operating a bag plant and a handle factory. In Anderson the McCullough family and Major
                    Charles T. Doxey made their money in banking and in real estate respectively.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>There were four major railroad lines that crossed the region in 1886—the

                    persuade at least one major railroad to run through their communities by the mid-1880s. Several
                    large towns, such as <placeName>

                    </placeName>, boasted three or more railroads. Some smaller towns in each county were also located
                    on rail lines. The railroads connected the area with markets for agricultural and forest
                        products.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>In 1886, the discovery of the Karg well in Findlay, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, signaled the end of the slow-paced agricultural life of east central Indiana. Natural
                    gas had previously been found in large quantities in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and had revolutionized the iron, steel, and glass industries of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as industrialists adapted their factories to use the natural gas in place of the more
                    expensive coal. The Karg well demonstrated that gas existed in substantial quantities in the Trenton
                    limestone beneath northwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and a speculative frenzy ensued, as gas companies drilled and real estate speculators
                    drove up the prices of land in anticipation of factories locating in the new boom area.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Within a short time, hometown investors in several Indiana communities also began to drill,
                    anticipating gas in the large Trenton limestone belt that extended into the north central portion of
                    the state. Gas was first struck at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in March 1886. The first well to produce enough gas to make a profit was sunk
                    at Eaton, Indiana, a small town north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in October 1886. The principals involved—George W. Carter, a businessman

                    feet below grade. The flame emitted by the well when it was piped and lit rose ten feet in the air
                    and could be seen in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twelve miles to the south. The sight of the flame, burning brightly and seemingly
                    inexhaustibly, drew crowds of people for many weeks.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>The sensation caused by the Eaton discovery spurred the organization of drilling companies all over
                    the state. In November 1886, gas was discovered at the end of East Jackson Street in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in several locations south of Wild Cat Creek in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Successful drilling took place in Anderson and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> early in the spring of 1887. Between 1886 and 1889, local businessmen and farmers in

            <p>In May of 1887, leading local businessmen formed a board of trade. This board offered the inducements
                    of free land and gas to outside industrial concerns and "landed their first factory, the
                    Fowler Nuts and Bolts Company from Buffalo, <placeName>

               </placeName>. All were
                    attracted by cheap or free natural gas, donated land, and the position of Anderson at the juncture
                    of four railroads. The firms located their plants on undeveloped sites along the northern edge of
                    the business district, the southern edge of the city limits, or along the west bank of White River
                    southeast of the courthouse square.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the initial flush of speculation had passed, local investors in Anderson platted factory
                    suburbs and nearby residential additions. Charles Henry, a local businessman, and Philip Matter, an
                    investor from <placeName>

                    the town limits, and by the early 1890s had attracted four factories: Anderson Glass Company, Wright
                    (later Ames) Shovel Works, North Anderson Pressed Brick Works, and the Anderson Window Glass
                    Company. Former Indiana Lieutenant Governor Will Cumback laid out the Shadeland Addition southwest
                    of the city in the early 1890s as a high-grade residential section, while other investors platted
                    the Hazelwood Addition and Park Place to the south as neighborhoods for both working-class and
                    middle-class houses.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> With the operation of the new factories, the population
                    in Anderson grew rapidly. The 1890 census reported 10,741 people in the city, an increase of some
                    6,000 since 1887.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>During the late 1880s and early 1890s some of the most extravagant real estate speculations and

                    outside investors began to shift attention to developing the many small communities in east central

            <p>This astounding growth in industry, commerce, population, and size came at a
                    price—depletion of the natural gas supply. As early as 1889, state geologist S. S. Gorby
                    noted in his annual report that, although the supply of natural gas in the newly-discovered Indiana
                    belt was huge, an average of one hundred million cubic feet of gas were being wasted each day
                    through wells and flambeaux burning day and night as promotional devices. By the early 1890s, the
                    Find-lay gas field in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and the gas field in western <placeName>

                    </placeName> had both become nearly exhausted due to overuse, and E. T. J. Jordan, holder of the new
                    position of natural gas supervisor in Indiana, alluded in his report for 1893 to the pattern of
                    extravagant consumption and failure in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>.
                            <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
               </placeName> reported that in Indiana gas pressure had
                    declined from 325 pounds per cubic inch in most locations in 1887 to between 200 and 290 pounds per
                    cubic feet in 1892. Using the <placeName>

                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> proposed several conservation measures: a new law prohibiting the burning of flambeaux
                    should be enforced; wells should be carefully packed after drilling to avoid unnecessary escape of
                    gas; the flat fee contract system of selling gas should be replaced with a metered system that
                    rewarded conservation; and more efficient mixes of gas and oxygen should be used by consumers in
                    their gas burners.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite annual exhortations by the natural gas supervisor against waste and despite additional
                    legislation by the Indiana General Assembly to penalize wasteful practice, gas producers and large
                    consumers of the gas belt paid little heed to the alarms and the legislation through most of the
                    1890s. Many towns and individual well owners continued to burn flambeaux three to four years after
                    the torches were prohibited in 1891.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> After several cities supplied by the gas
                    belt experienced shortages during the winter of 1892-1893, most owners finally acknowledged the
                    legitimacy of the supervisor's warnings, and flambeaux-burning declined. With respect to
                    the other conservation measures, however, most producers and consumers refused to give up the low
                    prices that seemed to be the basis for the continuing commercial and industrial prosperity. As long
                    as gas continued to be available at low prices, most consumers were slow to adopt conservation
                        measures.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even with all of the waste caused by flambeaux, flat prices, and inefficient burning apparatuses, the
                    gas in the Indiana Trenton field would probably have lasted well into the new century had not so

                    domestic customers in Findlay and other cities. By 1900, nearly $2 million of the

            <p>As the pressure at the wells dropped below 175 pounds of pressure in 1898-1899, pipeline gas
                    companies and factory owners began to build pumping stations to increase the gas pressure. J. C.
                    Leach, the natural gas supervisor in 1900, reported that, by the end of the 1890s, the unity of the
                    Indiana gas field as a single large reservoir had disintegrated because of the encroachment of salt
                    water into the gas-bearing limestone rock.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Gas pressure dropped below 100
                    pounds in 1901, and producers abandoned many wells thereafter. After 1901, few factories in the belt

            <p>The gas boom came to a dramatic end. Most of the small boom towns in the gas belt experienced an
                    economic bust after 1901. A few of their factories hung on, hoping for new gas supplies or
                    converting to other fuels. By the 1920s, most of these had closed. Communities such as Windfall,
                    Ingalls, Greentown, Converse, Upland, Sweetser, Eaton, Frankton, Matthews, <placeName>

                        demolished, many commercial districts and neighborhoods remain. The trademark architecture of

            <p>This article describes a moment in Indiana's history when many institutions united in a vast
                    educational endeavor to change the philanthropic traditions of the people. Led by the Indiana Board
                    of State Chanties, the progressive forces in philanthropic work self-consciously set out to steer
                    Indiana away from a patchwork system of poor relief and toward a bureaucratic, organized, and
                    efficient system of preventive measures. Their efforts, spanning the last decade of the nineteenth
                    century and the first two decades of the twentieth, proved so successful that the movement was
                    eventually deemed unnecessary and the massive educational front it organized was neglected.</p>
            <p>There are at least two reasons why a study of this process is necessary. A standard history of
                    philanthropy like Robert Bremner's <hi rend="i">American Philanthropy</hi> chronicles the
                    shift from charity to organized philanthropy and from amateur almsgiving to scientifically managed
                    care, but it does not explain how this shift came about. If it is true that "it was the
                    spread of this scientific approach" that impressed reformers as "the great
                    humanitarian achievement of their day," then it would seem important that the historian
                    investigate how this spread was accomplished.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> A second reason is the uniqueness
                    of the Indiana situation. While charity organization was a national movement, its remarkable success
                    in Indiana suggests that at least in this regard progressivism was more potent than standard
                    accounts have noted. The "Indiana way" may indeed be moderation in all things with
                    a tendency to round off the corners and blunt the sharp points of dispute, but the charity reformers
                    of Indiana were notable not so much for their moderation as for their zeal. Their success suggests
                    that the much-touted Indiana love of tradition might need to be qualified, at least for this period,
                    with an equally strong emphasis on innovation. Robert Crunden has suggested the term
                    "innovative nostalgia" as a label for the mindset of progressive reformers. This

            <p>While organized concern for the general welfare in Indiana extends back at least to the original 1816
                    state constitution, which contained notably "progressive" educational and prison
                    clauses, it was 1889 which saw the beginning of the most effective instrument for organizing
                    Indiana's benevolent work, the Board of State Charities. The brainchild of prominent
                    Indiana citizens Timothy Nicholson and Oscar Carleton McCulloch, the board sought to organize
                    Indiana's charitable and correctional institutions along scientific principles and served
                    as the transitional force from the largely private nineteenth-century efforts to twentieth-century
                    government operations.</p>
            <p>Nicholson, dubbed "master <placeName>

                    </placeName>" by his biographer, was beyond question the grand old man of organized charity
                    in Indiana. He was by profession a bookseller in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he served as a trustee for forty-nine years at Earlham College. After the Civil
                    War he embarked on a long career of social action as a leader in administering <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> relief to freedmen. In 1867 he joined the Indiana Yearly Meeting's committee
                    on prison reform, which began his forty-year campaign to regularize and humanize Indiana's
                    correctional facilities. He served on the Indiana Board of State Charities from 1889 to 1908 and in
                    1901 was elected president of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Nicholson personified the board's history, McCulloch represented its vitality. In 1870 he
                    gave up a lucrative career in drug sales to attend the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Theological Seminary, from which he was graduated in 1873. After serving for four years
                    as a Congregational minister in Sheboygan, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, McCulloch moved to the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. By 1884 he had built one of America's first and most successful
                    "institutional churches," where creeds were replaced by lecture courses, savings
                    and loan offices, and organized charity. With <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> as his base, McCulloch created a wide array of philanthropic organizations, including
                    the Charity Organization Society (1878), the Children's Aid Society (1881), Flower Mission
                    Training School for Nurses (1882), the Dime Savings and Loan Association (1885), and the Summer
                    Mission for Sick Children (1890). He was president of the National Conference of Charities and
                    Corrections in 1891 and is perhaps best known for his six-generation study called "the
                    Tribe of Ishmael," charting the heritability of "feeblemindedness" and
                    associated behavioral abnormalities. His work was <list type="footnotes">

                    was elected president of that organization in 1897. Though he also became active in the American Red

                    that mid-nineteenth-century Hoosiers tended to be reluctant to spend on public services, opting
                    instead to "maintain law and order through private efforts," captures well the
                    perception of the Indiana mind held by reformers.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> It was this longstanding
                    belief in self-help, frontier individualism, <hi rend="i">ad hoc</hi> charity, antiplanning,
                    antibigness, and anticontrol that the men who masterminded the Board of State Charity sought to
                    change. They wanted to replace amateur giving with professional management, to shift the emphasis of
                    charity from body to soul and from treatment to prevention, and to prove to the rest of the country
                    that Indiana was no longer backwards and backwoods but in the forefront of corrective planning and
                    organizing.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most visible element in the ideology of progressive charity organizers was the desire to
                    have Indiana switch from outdoor to indoor relief. While outdoor relief supplied handouts freely to
                    beggars or to those in need, indoor relief consisted of institutionalized care properly managed and
                    overseen. It was the firm conviction of members of the board and their supporters that almsgiving
                    meant misfortune for the recipient. The rhetoric on this topic could get quite heated, as comments
                    from W. C. Smallwood of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Society for Organized Charity make clear: "Finally, my co-workers
                    and friends, if you have not…the heart to say 'No' when found
                    'not worthy,' then stay out of the charity work and stop creating paupers and
                    encouraging professionals." Sydney B. Davis, president of the Third State Conference of
                    Charities, expressed the same sentiment: "Much harm to the individual and the community
                    comes from misdirected, ignorant, careless, misnamed charity. Much of our so-called charity is only
                    laziness and selfishness. The man who gives to the vagrant is a public enemy. If there was no
                    back-door giving there would be no tramps."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Essential to the idea of indoor relief was the principle of cooperation for prevention. For indoor
                    relief to work, every citizen and every organization had to present a united front against
                    almsgiving. C. E. Prevey, secretary of Associated Charities in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, explained cooperation as "the centralization of the philanthropic forces of
                    the city corresponding to the centralization which has taken place in the industrial
                    world." These groups needed to unite in a common mission to eradicate handouts, for as
                    Johnson noted, "one of the effects on a thinking mind of many years of varied social work
                    is a profound distrust of relief in every form; a positive conviction that its complete eradication,
                    except in the presence of overwhelming disaster, would be a great social gain."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Along with the idea of prevention was the replacement of concern over bodily suffering with care of
                    the inner person or what came to be called "mental hygiene." Father John R.
                    Quinlan of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul made the connection explicit: "Too many
                    engaged in charitable work are satisfied with relieving without trying to reform. It is more
                    charitable to reform the degradation of heart and soul than to relieve bodily wants."
                    McCulloch, founder and guiding spirit of the consolidation movement, agreed: "life is
                    spiritual and not material…[,] it is our souls, not our bodies, which are the significant
                    things of life." The care of the soul of the weak person was not the sort of thing just
                    anyone could do, so it is not surprising to find reformers advocating the establishment of
                    professional standards for care-givers over the traditional practice of granting such posts as
                    political favors. Board secretary Ernst Bicknell looked forward to the day when "wards of
                    the State will be entrusted only to officers of recognized training and fitness."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the heart of charity ideology was a desire to replace unorganized almsgiving with organized work
                    guided by professionals who would seek to prevent poverty by altering the soul such that the
                    individual would become a productive member of society. The motivations behind such a perspective
                    were diverse and contradictory. As the foregoing quotations demonstrate, a religious spirit
                    permeated the rhetoric. Most of the members of the board and a high percentage of those attending
                    the annual conferences were either members of the clergy or active in local churches. Yet many were
                    businessmen as well, and pecuniary motivations surfaced nearly as frequently as religious ones.
                    Johnson frankly noted the construction of poor asylums served as both "an insurance of
                    every citizen against death by destitution, and … a protection of the well-to-do against
                    the assaults of those who might be made desperate by suffering." W. C. Ball, speaking at
                    the eighth annual conference in 1899, agreed that the poor person "must be helped, or
                    assisted to help himself, lest he keep himself rather wastefully at our expense. Either this or he
                    must be disposed of as Cain disposed of Abel."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor does this practical theme exhaust the motives of the reformers. Pervading their discussions was a
                    keen self-consciousness of the position of Indiana relative to that of other states. The state board
                    and the state conference were only one subdivision of a national movement with its own organizations
                    and conferences, and the representatives <list type="footnotes">

                    everyone else. Nicholson remarked that "Indiana seems to have been a slow state
                    …. But it has been very remarkable how soon our state has come up with the
                    others." Johnson could boast in 1893 that "In many respects the institutions of
                    the State of Indiana and the laws upon her statute books which govern them, compare very favorably
                    with those of the most enlightened and progressive States of the American Union."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> One particular reform effort that was of special concern to Johnson and of
                    which Indiana may justly be said to have been in the vanguard was the issue of sterilization for
                    eugenic purposes. Indiana passed the first law in the nation legalizing sterilization in 1907,
                    though it seems that the procedure had been performed by Dr. Harry Sharp at the Indiana Reformatory
                    since 1899. The law was strengthened in 1927 and made more explicit in 1931. L. P. Harshman reported
                    that by 1935, 168 individuals had been sterilized under these laws, though the actual number was
                    probably larger when unreported cases, especially those before 1907, are taken into
                        consideration.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among progressive charity organizers, the issue of forced sterilization produced much discussion and
                    controversy. Johnson, for example, argued strongly against the practice for a time, advocating
                    instead the total institutionalization of all "feeble minded" persons throughout
                    their childbearing years, even though it was clear that a surgical procedure was more economical
                    than expensive boarding. In 1912 Johnson reluctantly reversed himself on the issue: "the
                    number of the idiots, imbeciles, and epileptics is so appalling that I fear only the method of
                    sterilization is equal to the need." This opinion found ready assent among the majority of
                    his colleagues and proved to be the dominant view until new research in the late 1930s began to
                    suggest the possibility that feeble-mindedness has an environmental rather than an hereditary
                        cause.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for at least the first three decades of the twentieth century, there existed a consensus among
                    charity organizers on the question of eugenics. Their problem then became how to persuade voters on
                    this question. They had to convince their fellow citizens that "a nation which fosters and
                    cares for its good-for-nothings will sooner or later become a good-for-nothing nation" and
                    that "the remedy lies in selective <list type="footnotes">

                    The answer, it seemed, was "by the diffusion of sound information and the enlightenment of
                    public opinion," which would insure that marriages between mental incompetents
                    "could be made as odious in the mind of the general public as they are now to those who
                    have studied and thought upon the question."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The charity reformers had set for themselves the difficult task of changing the thoughts and
                    behaviors of the majority of Indiana's citizens on a series of issues that penetrated to
                    the deepest assumptions about the nature of the person, the responsibility of the individual to
                    further the general good, the method of stewardship, and the procedures of generosity. Success, they
                    came to realize, would require the coordinated effort of many institutions tirelessly serving over a
                    long period of time. In short, educational success would require exactly the same sort of organized
                    effort that they were preaching for philanthropy itself. And so they set themselves to the task.</p>
            <p>At the turn of the century churches still played a powerful role in shaping the opinions of most
                    citizens, and therefore the reformers turned especially to the pulpit for assistance. At the fourth
                    conference in 1895 W. C. Smallwood asked, "how can the Church help the poor from a charity
                    organization standpoint?" and answered, "if the ministry would at least once a

                    here only expanded the program already in effect that asked Indiana pastors to set aside the last
                    Sunday of October as "Prison Sunday." Since 1890 the board had been sending out
                    literature to churches across the state prior to the Prison Sunday sermon "for the purpose
                    of supplying hints and illustrations for such discourses."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Attendees of the annual state conferences began to utilize the pulpit more directly as well. Some of
                    them were pastors in their own right, but even those who were not would often preach as guests,
                    especially on the Sunday after the conference. On this day nearly every pulpit in the town hosting
                    the conference would be filled by some guest speaker fresh from a weekend's collegial
                    stimulation. This tradition of guest-preaching persisted until 1933, when the conference organizers
                    finally capitulated to increasing diversity and decided to hold the conference during the week so as
                    not to offend Jewish delegates or secular persons.</p>

                    influence the press exercised on politics, utilized it for the board's purposes.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Johnson was able to count on the support of the leading men of various
                    professions for plans that had been worked out collectively by such literary groups as the
                    Fortnightly Literary Club and the Commercial Club. In these clubs prominent <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapermen like Bicknell and William Fortune swapped ideas with the charity
                    organizers and in so doing picked up a "scoop" or two, interpreted of course with
                    the most congenial spin. Fortune used his partnership with Colonel Eli Lilly and his own position at
                    the <hi rend="i">News</hi>, to create "civic projects aimed at making <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> into a progressive, modern city which would keep pace with the changing world around
                    it." Included in this modernization project was the organization of the city's
                    philanthropic resources, perhaps most notably in response to the depression of 1893-1894, but also
                    later with the Indiana War Chest, which would eventually become the Board of Public Welfare, of
                    which Fortune would become the first chairman. Surely Johnson spoke from experience when noting that
                    "the enviable reputation of Indiana in social work is largely due to the way the Board of
                    State Charities has made known and has carried into effect, the wishes and desires of the best
                    people of the state."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The press was an early ally to the charity reformers, and the relationship continued for several
                    decades. Bicknell was surprised and delighted to learn that his early association with the board as
                    an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspaperman resulted in his unanimous election as secretary to replace Johnson. Thus
                    the tradition of a close relationship between board and press was continued and even strengthened as
                    the man at the helm combined an insider's knowledge of both domains. In his 1915 address to
                    the state conference entitled "The Newspaper as an Interpreter of Social Welfare,"
                    Tom S. Elrod made this connection clear, stating that "there is a vast difference between
                    printing something about poverty, crime or mental sickness, and printing something that is strong
                    enough to arouse the public to a point where the removal of unnecessary causes will be
                    demanded." This close association was to continue throughout the board's
                    existence. Even in its final years one could find newsmen such as Harold C. Feightner of the <placeName>

                    secretary of an annual report. Under Johnson's administration this report quickly became
                    much more than merely a compilation of the board's minutes or a summation of expenditures.
                    Johnson and his successors Bicknell and Amos W. Butler used the report as a pulpit for proclaiming
                    the gospel of charity organization in ways analogous to Horace Mann's famous reports for
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Board of Education. "There is probably no other part of the work of the Board
                    more likely to subserve the end for which it was created," Johnson stated, "than
                    the plentiful distribution of well chosen literature." Johnson also expanded the role of
                    secretary by advising and suggesting improved methods, speaking at public meetings, and promoting
                    the cause of charity. "In these ways," he concluded, "I have done
                    something towards popularizing the methods of charity which this Board stands for [….
                    which] may be stated in the two words, efficiency and economy."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatest instrument of education employed by the Board was its annual State Conference of
                    Charities and Corrections, explicitly modeled on the national conference. Johnson had noted early
                    the significance of the national conference: "There is nothing more useful to the members
                    of a Board of Charities, in qualifying them to perform their responsible duties to the State, than
                    attendance upon the meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections." In
                    1890 the first state conference, held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was attended by over one hundred and fifty people.</p>
            <p>Delegates to the annual conference had the opportunity to meet others, to hear reports of the latest
                    advances in various fields, to be inspired by nationally known figures, and to have their resolve
                    steeled and their doubts assuaged by the solidarity prompted by the event. Perhaps one of the most
                    important functions of the conference was to provide participants a larger narrative of progress
                    within which each participant could place his or her own struggles. Very quickly the presidential
                    address at the annual conference resembled a grand review, an attempt by a state leader to provide
                    the group with a collective and useful past. Thus every annual presidential address gradually took
                    on the same general tenor, since the familiar story of Indiana's rise from the mire of a
                    past of unorganized charities to the stunning prospects of the current day's heights was
                    told over and over again.</p>

                    shared a common Progressive Era perception of dependent children as having only tenuous ties to
                    their parents that could be snipped and reattached permanently to good substitute
                        families."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Such work begins to demonstrate the relationship
                    between idea and activity and between the intellectual and social histories of welfare policy and
                    practice.</p>
            <p>The 1930s saw many changes in organized benevolence. The state conference, reflecting increased
                    professionalization and the resultant concern for proper nomenclature, had changed its name to the
                    State Conference on Social Work as early as 1925. In 1932 the usual full coverage given of the
                    conference was replaced in the <hi rend="i">Bulletin of Charities and Corrections</hi> by short
                    summaries of all but the major addresses, a move that coincided with the changing nature of social
                    service as a profession. The next year the Board of State Charities reorganized as the Indiana
                    Department of Public Welfare. In 1936 the <hi rend="i">Bulletin</hi> was discontinued and the <hi rend="i">Indiana Welfare News</hi> replaced it. The stated goal of this new publication was
                    "PROMOTION of social betterment among our aged, or physically and mentally handicapped, our
                    wayward and dependent and other wise less fortunate fellow citizens, at the least possible expense

            <p>All in all the new publication was a more popular affair, seemingly intended for leisurely perusal by
                    professional social workers rather than by the "leading citizens of the state."
                    There were sections written in the style of <hi rend="i">Reader's Digest</hi>, which
                    related anecdotes of the humorous experiences of regional social workers or that presented in
                    colloquial dialect some of the grammatical, Freudian, and other slips of uneducated clients of the
                    state. As the years passed the intellectual content of the magazine grew increasingly thin while the
                    production quality rose, as glossy pictures and elegant layout replaced the homespun style of
                    earlier issues. All of this reflected national trends, to be sure, but it also suggests that the
                    movement could afford to dispense with the fundamentally intellectual concerns of explaining and
                    justifying its mission, because its mission had in large measure been accomplished. By the 1950s
                    there was no longer pressing need to expound the message of organized giving. Having no opposition

            <p>Among the many episodes of the Korean War stands the nearly forgotten tale of one of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>' most bitter military blunders: the defeat of elements of the U.S.
                    Army's 7th Infantry Division by Chinese forces in the winter of 1950.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    "It would be hard," notes historian Roy Appleman, "to find a more nearly
                    hopeless or tragic story in American military history."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The swift and
                    overwhelming nature of the defeat left little time for detailed official records, causing many of
                    the specifics of the event to be forever lost. Luckily a few survivors took notes immediately after
                    the action. These fragmented testimonies give vivid proof of the ferocity of the struggle and show
                    that during this defeat came acts of extraordinary heroism.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Among these is the
                    story of a low-ranking assistant motor pool sergeant and high school dropout from southwest Indiana
                    named Charles Garrigus, Jr. Why Garrigus stayed and fought with a doomed convoy of wounded GIs while
                    so many of his comrades ran to the safety of the nearby Marine Corps lines can perhaps be best
                    understood by looking at the Hoosier environment that shaped this gallant and humble soldier.</p>
            <p>At the height of the depression in 1937, the Garrigus clan journeyed southward from Yeddo, near <placeName>

                    King's coal mine. The Garrigus sons were also expected to work and soon were hired by local
                    farmers, who paid them as often in produce as in money. <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>, Garrigus did discover some pleasures in spite of the hard times. The boy, whom his
                    sisters teasingly called June Bug, possessed a shy smile and loved to spend his free time tinkering
                    with engines or driving farm vehicles down the dusty lanes that crisscrossed the Hoosier
                    countryside. School work often got in the way of Garrigus's desire to work with engines,
                    and, like many young males of his day, Garrigus dropped out of school before receiving a high school
                    diploma, content to work with farm vehicles. The onset of World War II, however, changed
                    Garrigus's life forever.</p>
            <p>Serving in the military brought many young men who grew up in the harsh poverty of depression a
                    stability they had not known before. When Garrigus was honorably discharged in November of 1946
                    "by reason of demobilization," the twenty-two-year-old Hoosier traveled to Gary,
                    Indiana, where he tried his hand as a heavy equipment operator. Civilian life, however, lacked the
                    predictability he had come to know in the army, and like many others he soon reen-listed.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The strapping six-footer looked forward to having a career in the army, where
                    he would be able to work with and drive trucks and heavy equipment. When North <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Again he found his life shaped by world events far beyond his control. The surprise
                    invasion fell, said <hi rend="i">Newsweek</hi>, "like lightening from a clear
                        sky."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Although Garrigus had been scheduled to return home on June
                    26, he was quickly sent into <placeName>

                    </placeName> with the first American troops.</p>
            <p>Throughout July and August of 1950, meagerly armed and mostly unprepared American fighting men held a
                    small and vulnerable perimeter around the southern Korean seaport of Pusan. Primarily clerks and
                    truck drivers like Garrigus, many of these initial troops had hardly handled a rifle.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> By the end of July when the military situation had deteriorated to the point of
                    desperation, Americans began to fear the worst. One national magazine demanded to know
                    "Why… US. Troops [are] being pushed around in a place called <placeName>

                    mid-September when U.S. Army and Marine units landed at the western seaport of Inchon and quickly
                    threatened to cut off the North Korean Army pressing in on the Pusan lines. Sensing that the

            <p>MacArthur's plan for ending the war called for the Eighth Army, under Lt. Gen. Walton
                    Walker, to move northwest from Seoul and capture the North Korean capital. X Corps, under Lt. Gen.
                    Edward Almond, would land on the eastern side of North <placeName>

                    Eighth Army before both moved to the <geogName>Yalu River</geogName> and the Manchurian frontier.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Garrigus's unit was the Seventh Army Division, 32nd Regiment.
                    Originally a part of the Eighth Army, the 7th Task Force, made up of about 3,000 men, was sent from
                    the western to the eastern side of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>

                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName>'s capital fell so quickly. Garrigus's outfit was to protect X
                    Corps's flank in the closing campaign in the war. Because of the success of the campaign
                    MacArthur told an assistant that "the boys…will be home by Christmas."</p>
            <p>Strung out along a single precarious mountain road, X Corps was particularly vulnerable to entrapment
                    and possible annihilation. The Marine Corps component of X Corps under Maj. Gen. O. P. Smith had

                    also stayed in contact with one another. The fragments of the 7th Division, however, lacked the

            <p>Back in Indiana, Gladys Garrigus read the uplifting news of the war's sure end but still

            <p>On Thanksgiving Day 1950, marines of the 5th Division enjoyed a hot meal while occupying the eastern
                    side of the Chosin Reservoir. The next day they received orders to leave their positions, proceed
                    south to Hagaru, and then head west to Yudam-ni on the opposite side of the Chosin where a larger
                    group of marines waited. MacArthur's plan eventually called for the marines at Yudam-ni to
                    wheel west and hook up with the Eighth Army. To protect the marines' flank from possible

                    of MacLean's group seemed to have disappeared. A telegram informed the Garrigus family that
                    their son was listed as missing in action as of November 27. In fact, their son was just beginning a

            <p>On November 27 the Chinese struck in below-zero weather, blowing horns, bugles, and shooting flares.
                    Because of the lack of communication, the scattered elements of Task Force MacLean "fought

                    fighting was fierce as well. On the days of the first attack, MacLean held a position at an inlet of

            <p>Fearing air strikes, the Chinese pulled back the next morning, and the scattered groups of GIs
                    reformed their perimeters. Oddly, the commander of X Corps, Lieutenant General Almond, did not seem
                    greatly concerned about the initial Chinese attack. From Hagaru, Almond helicoptered into

            <p>The struggle that took place on the evening of the 28th proved to be even more brutal and intense
                    than the first night's action, as MacLean's camp was almost overrun. The situation
                    was so serious that many units did not "take time to carry rations to the front line. When
                    the food did reach the soldiers after dark, it was frozen and the men had no way to thaw it except
                    by holding it against their bodies."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Faith's group, which
                    included Garrigus, fared little better than MacLean's. The next day MacLean decided it
                    would be best for Faith's regiment to consolidate with his group. In carrying out the
                    request to move, Faith ordered several trucks to be unloaded so that the rapidly mounting number of
                    wounded could be carried out in three-quarter-ton trucks. At dawn on November 29, about sixty
                    vehicles began the dash through heavy enemy fire. As the column crossed a final bridge to arrive in
                    MacLean's perimeter, Chinese fire increased, and two American trucks carrying ammunition
                    and rations were hastily left behind by nervous truck drivers. Later that same day Garrigus gazed
                    across the bridge and saw enemy soldiers approaching the abandoned supply trucks. "On his
                    own initiative," the ht sergeant decided to return for the trucks. Unarmed and dashing
                    "across…300 yards of open snow covered ice," Garrigus brought the first
                    truck across the bridge to safety; then he ran back to get the second truck. His second trip drew
                    the unwanted attention of even more Chinese. As he maneuvered the lumbering truck over the frozen
                    ground, bullets whizzed by and smacked into the truck's body. Somehow the truck made it
                    into the safety of the American lines, stalling as it rolled into the perimeter. Here the sound of
                    the dying engine gave way to the hurrahs of GIs. These soldiers had taken some hard hits from the
                    Chinese, and the sergeant's surprising stunt greatly lifted their morale. "Through
                    Garrigus' quick thinking actions…the supplies were taken from the very grasp of
                    the enemy."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>That same morning MacLean was either killed or captured by Chinese whom he had mistakenly identified

                    the five hundred or so wounded in trucks and jeeps and bring them out as well. Given the horrible
                    conditions of the road, the bitterly cold and snowy weather, and the thousands of Chinese who
                    occupied the hills, the breakout plan seemed an impossible task. Yet more shocking news came to
                    Faith at this time. The beleaguered marines would not be able to send any men to help
                    Faith's party move southward. Other than daily air support from a handful of planes, Task
                    Force Faith, as it was now unofficially dubbed, would be on its own.</p>
            <p>The night before the attempted breakout was brutal. Shortly after midnight the Chinese attack built a
                    greater intensity than all other previous attacks. "All through the night,"
                    recalled one survivor, "we heard the cries from our friendly wounded within the perimeter
                    who were suffering from the cold."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Desperately needed medical
                    supplies were completely exhausted by the next morning. Thus the condition of Faith's group
                    on the morning of the attempted breakout was especially poor. A surviving officer described the
                    hellish scene: "By dawn on December 1 members of the Task Force had been under attack for
                    80 hours in sub-zero weather. None had slept much. None had washed or shaved, none had eaten more
                    than a bare minimum." To make things worse, most of the men were wounded or crippled by the
                    bitter cold. "Everyone seemed to be wounded in one fashion or another…frozen
                    feet and hands were common."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Just as discouraging on that bleak dawn
                    was the rapidly deteriorating weather.</p>
            <p>Garrigus was probably given much authority over the trucks in the convoy, most of which were heavily
                    loaded with the wounded. Vehicles typically carried fifteen to twenty injured men, though some had
                    as many as fifty on board. Just as the convoy began to take off, Chinese troops overran several key
                    defensive machine gun positions at the edge of the perimeter and used those weapons to rake the
                    American lines. Rallying "a group of soldiers," Garrigus led "a daring
                    charge, regained the machine guns…" and immediately turned the weapons
                    "on the enemy, killing 60 or so and wounding many others."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                    Chinese firing died down, and the perimeter was safe once more because of Garrigus's bold
                    actions. The convoy could continue.</p>
            <p>Given the lack of communication and the loss of leadership, it is not surprising that the moving
                    column soon became a disorganized fight for survival. One major noted that once started, the troops
                    "flooded down the road like a great mob and tactical control broke down almost immediately.
                    Officers tried frantically to re-establish control and to order men up on the high ground where they
                    could protect the truck <list type="footnotes">

                    men began to wander off from the wounded men in the trucks and toward the southern end of the frozen
                    reservoir and the safety of marine lines. Meanwhile, Chinese firing waxed and waned as the
                    strung-out caravan snaked through the barren hills. Often groups of GIs with the convoy would charge
                    a particular hill or roadblock to drive the enemy away and then head overland for Hagaru.</p>
            <p>At about 3 p.m. the convoy came to an unexpected roadblock— a blown bridge. The trucks
                    were forced to go down into a muddy stream bed in order to bypass the blockage. The Chinese brought
                    down especially heavy fire as the vulnerable trucks struggled to churn through the mud below the
                    destroyed span. Many of the men operating the trucks were inexperienced with such deplorable driving
                    conditions and soon were mired in the mud. This circumstance threatened to stop the column in its
                    tracks. Once more Garrigus rose to the occasion. The resourceful motor pool sergeant was able to put
                    his long hours of driving vehicles through muddy Indiana farm fields to good use. "Under
                    intense enemy fire," he brought "several trucks across and out of a deep mud hole
                    in the bed of the stream."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Pvt. Alan Cork recalled examining the
                    trucks after they had passed the blown bridge and found that it was impossible to place his hand
                    anywhere upon any of the vehicles without touching a bullet hole.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
                    Unfortunately for the convoy, it took several hours of precious time to get all the trucks of
                    wounded GIs to the other side of the destroyed bridge. It was dangerously dark, and marine air
                    support could no longer protect the men and trucks who struggled down the icy Korean dirt track.
                    About the time dusk fell at 5 p.m. only twenty-five of the original thirty-five vehicles remained in
                    the column. Garrigus, perhaps because of his actions back at the blown bridge, drove the lead truck
                    of the vulnerable convoy. As the vehicles inched forward in low gear, more able-bodied men continued
                    to leave the column, but not Garrigus.</p>
            <p>Around midnight the convoy approached its final destination, five short miles from the marine lines
                    at Hagaru. Enemy fire and mechanical breakdown had knocked out most of the trucks during that long
                    afternoon. Only fifteen bullet-ridden vehicles remained, packed with wounded men. Faith had already
                    died from wounds, and his body sat frozen in the cab of one of the trucks. Maj. Crosby Miller, who
                    had barely been able to cling to the hood of a jeep, recalled what happened next. When the column
                    paused to regroup, the silence was suddenly broken "by two mortar rounds burst[ing] to the
                    right of the road opposite the truck column about 100 yards away." Miller doubted whether
                    the convoy would be able to continue. Before the <list type="footnotes">

                    truck and "moved a 100 yards [ahead] and had not seen or heard any movement." When
                    Garrigus returned to the trucks, he offered to lead the convoy in a last-ditch effort to get the
                    trucks and wounded to Hagaru. Upon Miller's instructions to "move out,"
                    word was passed back to prepare for a final run.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>Two hundred yards down the road "a terrific blast of…machine gun fire
                    hit" the lead truck, causing it to pile into a ditch and effectively block escape for the
                    rest of the convoy.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Garrigus died at the wheel of his vehicle. The Chinese
                    fell on the remaining trucks and their helpless human cargo. For all purposes, Task Force Faith
                    ended here. "At the end," notes Appleman, "each man had his own
                    adventure, and some lived to tell them."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Garrigus and the others of
                    Task Force MacLean-Faith would not suffer or die in vain. Their efforts kept a large number of
                    Chinese tied down for five crucial days, allowing the marines at Yudam-ni to fight their way down to
                    Hagaru where marines and surviving elements of the Seventh Army Infantry Division were then able to
                    carry out their now famous retreat. During this advance to the rear, U.S. forces inflicted
                    tremendous losses upon the Chinese with concentrated artillery fire and air strikes before
                    evacuating the northeast Korean coast at Hungnam. By April of 1951, the Chinese drive had been
                    halted, and by June the war became a grinding, static struggle along the thirty-eighth parallel. By
                    the time the war ended in July 1953, over fifty-four thousand American troops had died.</p>
            <p>For several months Gladys and Charles Garrigus, Sr., were told that their son was missing in action,
                    but by early April 1951, the army had pieced together enough fragmented information from the
                    accounts of survivors to be certain that Charles Garrigus, Jr., had indeed died while leading the
                    final breakout attempt. In a letter that April, addressed to Gladys Garrigus, General MacArthur
                    wrote that he hoped Gladys could find "some measure of comfort" knowing that her
                    son died "in the service of his country and in the defense of a peace loving

                    Gathorne-Hardy. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                    bibliography, index. $39.95.)</head>
            <p>Alfred C. Kinsey, whose "Kinsey Reports," <hi rend="i">Sexual Behavior in the Human
                        Male</hi> (1948) and <hi rend="i">Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</hi> (1953), made Indiana
                    University into a center for research on human sexual behavior, was a controversial figure in the
                    1950s because of his outspoken challenges to official codes of sexual conduct. His success depended
                    upon staunch support from Indiana University president Herman B Wells and the financial backing of
                    the National Research Council and the Rockefeller Foundation. Voted "Hoosier of the
                    Year" by the Sons of Indiana in 1954, Kinsey convinced leading scientists that human sexual
                    behavior could and should be studied scientifically and that the results should inform discussion of
                    public policy. At the end of the twentieth century, however, Kinsey remains a polarizing symbol. He
                    has become the patron saint of gay liberation for his outspoken defense of homosexual acts and, in
                    turn, is demonized by Christian fundamentalists as a sexual predator who used the cloak of science
                    to legitimate personal misconduct.</p>
            <p>Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy's biography of Kinsey, first published in Great Britain in 1998,
                    reflects the contemporary struggles to expropriate Kinsey for service in our culture wars.
                    Apparently Gathorne-Hardy's goal is to explain and defend a "great man"
                    whose work remains the best that we have on human sexual behavior. Following in the wake of James H.
                    Jones's deeply researched <hi rend="i">Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public l Private Life</hi>
                    (1997), Gathorne-Hardy has few facts to add to the record, but he seeks to counter scholars who have
                    written about Kinsey and failed to appreciate him with adequate enthusiasm. The result is a chatty
                    biography in which the narrative is often interrupted both by critiques of Jones and Paul Robinson
                    (whose <hi rend="i">The Modernization of Sex</hi> [1989] included an interpretation of Kinsey) and
                    by amateurish forays into the philosophy of science. Gathorne-Hardy's case for Kinsey is
                    strong on some issues, including Kinsey's methodology and the place of his increasingly
                    compulsive personal sexual conduct within his research, but the argument is weak on the
                    institutional and social contexts that Jones carefully explains and that are essential to this
                    story.</p>
            <p>Gathorne-Hardy justifies another long biography of Kinsey by claiming that "Jones'
                    Kinsey was a man appallingly warped and distorted, driven by vicious personal
                    'demons,' to such a degree and in so many ways that eventually he almost ceased to
                    be a moral being, and largely ceased to be an objective researcher, his data
                    'skewed' and 'flawed' to such an extent that, in effect,
                    essential parts of his <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-096-4-052"/> science were fraudulent" (p.
                    viii). However, Gathorne-Hardy's "totally different Kinsey" is basically
                    the same man as the one portrayed by Jones. Jones certainly tried to make clear his respect both for
                    Kinsey the pioneer sex researcher and for the man whose "great accomplishment was to take
                    his pain and suffering and use it to transform himself into an instrument of social reform
                    …." (Jones, p. 772). Gathorne-Hardy is clearly more sympathetic to the private
                    Kinsey whose homosexual and masochistic acts posed dangers for his research project and ultimately
                    his health, but that special empathy is a poor substitute for the critical perspective that Kinsey
                    commands as one of the modern world's most important advocates of sexual reform.</p>

            <p>This is a slim monograph and properly so, for there is not much to be said for Henry Clay's
                    legal career. He practiced intermittently in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, from 1798
                    to 1852, dealing mostly with routine land disputes and debt collection. Though he was a skilled
                    practitioner who won a number of cases in the state and federal courts, it does not appear from
                    these pages that he trained any lawyers in his office or made much of an impression during his brief
                    stint as a lecturer on law at Transylvania University. Nor did he achieve distinction as a legal
                    writer or expositor of the Constitution. His greatest claim to fame as a lawyer probably rests on
                    his victories in the Supreme Court in four landmark constitutional cases—Osborn v. <hi rend="i">Bank of U.S.</hi> (18241, <hi rend="i">Ogden</hi> v. <hi rend="i">Saunders</hi> (1827),

            <p>In truth, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> was a consummate politician who did not much enjoy lawyering, let alone the science of
                    law. Maurice G. Baxter does not pinpoint the dates, but between 1812 and 1820, and again from 1825
                    to 1829, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> abandoned the practice of law. When he left his post as secretary of state in 1829, he
                    remarked that he was determined "not to return to the practice of my old profession, and
                    nothing but necessity will compel me to put on the harness again" (p. 12611). Always
                    "interested in his remuneration" (p. 109) as Baxter kindly puts it, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> continued to dabble in law after returning to Congress, "though compared with
                    the incomes of other prominent lawyers, his remuneration was modest" (p. 59). In his last
                    letter to his wife, which epitomizes his mercenary zeal for the law, he proudly reported that he had
                    received a handsome fee of $2,500 for winning a case in the Supreme Court.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, (1824-1828) attracted a wide variety of participants. Most historically
                    significant were the scientists and educators led by William Maclure, an early nineteenth-century
                    philanthropist and pioneer in natural science and education. Among Maclure's scientists
                    were Thomas Say, Gerard Troost, and Charles-Alexandre Lesueur. Currently, these individuals have
                    been relegated to secondary or minor roles in mainstream American history. Lesueur deserves more
                    than a brief historical notation. His work in archaeology and natural <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-096-4-054"/> science, extending well beyond <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, helped to lay the foundations of scientific research in both Europe and America.</p>
            <p>Josephine Mirabella Elliott and Jane Thompson Johansen examine the life and work of Lesueur
                    (1778-1846), a many-faceted archaeologist, geologist, zoologist, ichthyologist, ornithologist,
                    lithographer, and artist. They craft a narrative and visual portrait of Lesueur through biography, a
                    summary of his work as a natural scientist, excerpts from his letters and notes, and very
                    importantly, through his artistic sketches, drawings, and scientific plates. Their research has been
                    truly trans-Atlantic, ranging from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Le Havre, <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, where Lesueur was curator of the natural history museum.</p>
            <p>The book is divided into four sections. Part I, a biographical sketch, begins with Lesueur's
                    first expedition, a voyage to <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>
                    </placeName> in 1800 commissioned by Napoleon, which resulted in an extensive collection of
                    scientific specimens and a publication on Australian ethnography and natural science. In 1815 he
                    accompanied Maclure on expeditions to the West Indies and the Great Lakes. Active in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> Academy of Natural Sciences, Lesueur joined Maclure's scientists and educators
                    at Owen's community at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1825. He returned to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in 1837 and became curator of the museum at Le Havre in 1846.</p>
            <p>Part II examines Lesueur as a pioneering archaeologist. His field studies unearthed collections of
                    artifacts, many of which were sent to Le Havre. A skilled artist, Lesueur's sketches
                    illustrated his archaeological discoveries in natural science, especially ichthyology. Resembling a
                    museum catalog, this section provides a framework for further research on Lesueur as an
                    archaeologist.</p>
            <p>Excerpts from Lesueur's research notes and letters to Maclure and other associates, in Part
                    III, offer insights into Lesueur's dedication to his work. A sensitive observer of the
                    plight of the Native Americans, Lesueur observed that "Civilization should have made
                    friends of them, but civilization is still enveloped in this mantle of barbarism
                    …" (p. 19).</p>
            <p>Part IV consists of forty-seven plates and illustrations, most of which are Lesueur's
                    drawings and lithographs. An extensive bibliography lists important manuscript collections and
                    sources on Lesueur.</p>
            <p>Elliott and Johansen succeed in moving their subject into the mainstream, especially in the history
                    of natural science. Indeed, Elliott, who is the definitive historian of the Maclure period at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, again accomplishes her objective of moving <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s notables into a larger historical perspective. Elliott's and
                    Johansen's well-designed and beautifully illustrated volume gives Lesueur a larger place in
                    historical memory.</p>

            <p>Peter Marschalck of the Institute for Migration Research and Intercultural Studies at the University
                    of Osnabrück contributes the opening chapter on "Population and Social
                    Structure." In it the human conditions, especially of the lower strata, are related to
                    economic developments in post-Napoleonic times, presenting a number of causes for massive
                    emigration. In Tecklenburg County, e.g., some 2,900 persons left for America "between 1832
                    and 1848, about one third of those without the consent of the authorities" (pp. 21-22).
                    Those with little familiarity with peculiar northwest German socioeconomic terminology will benefit
                    from the translation of words such as <hi rend="i">Heuerleute</hi> (poor tenant farmers), <hi rend="i">Colonen</hi> (farm proprietors), <hi rend="i">Hollandgängerei</hi> (seasonal
                    migration work in Holland), and others.</p>

                    describes the means of transportation to America, roles and types of legal and illegal agents,
                    governmental regulations, hidden agendas of communities supporting poor or undesirable
                    emigrants' passages, and the price tags for different accommodations, a fine travel
                    supplement to the history of the emigration of families.</p>
            <p>Immigration historian Walter Kamphoefner contributes a chapter entitled "Chain Migration,
                    Settlement Patterns, Integration" that reflects his long scholarly interest in German
                    migration. While new settlers quickly adapted to proven American building and farming practices, for
                    quite some time their interaction with Anglo-Americans was mainly economic rather than social. Among
                    northwest Germans ethnic cohesion continued for the first three generations through homogenous
                    settlement and the retention of cultural and religious heritage by maintaining German-language
                    churches and parochial schools well beyond World War I. In <placeName>

                    and sorrows of migration. The volume achieves a fine balance of scholarship and readability. It is

                    of Charles Sumner by Preston Brooks on the floor of the Senate chambers have all underscored the
                    extent to which violence characterized the struggle over slavery in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> between the 1830s and the outbreak of the Civil War. John Brown has served as the
                    dramatic symbol of those abolitionists who resorted to violence. Until recently, Brown has stood as
                    an anomaly within a movement that has historically been largely perceived as nonviolent. Less well
                    understood, therefore, is how many abolitionists, white and black, male and female, accepted
                    violence as a legitimate antislavery tactic.</p>
            <p>In this collection of essays, historians explore various manifestations of violent antislavery action
                    by whites, slaves, former slaves, and free blacks from the late eighteenth century to 1860. In so
                    doing, they challenge the prevailing myth that the movement was primarily a pacifist crusade until
                    the 1850s, the height of antislavery militancy. The book is divided into two parts. Part one
                    examines efforts by blacks, both slave and free, to use violence as a means of resistance to
                    slavery. Such action ranged from slave revolts to the participation of free blacks in vigilance
                    committees, which were organized after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850 to combat
                    fugitive slave recapture and the kidnapping of blacks. Part two illustrates the various dimensions
                    of white abolitionists' use of violence. Radical white men like Joshua Giddings and Charles
                    Sumner, for example, used their positions as politicians to engage, enrage, and embattle proslavery
                    representatives on the floor of Congress, an opportunity that was denied to all women, most
                    rank-and-file white male abolitionists, and even the best-known black abolitionist men like
                    Frederick Douglass. Other essays in this section illustrate how white abolitionists'
                    discussions over the most effective antislavery tactics were part of a much broader debate about
                    American cultural identity, which included such issues as Christian evangelicalism and <pb n="363" id="VAA4025-096-4-057"/> American norms of masculinity and femininity. That these issues took on
                    regional dimensions, as reflected in the conflict between southern honor and Yankee evangelical
                    conscience (p. 168) in the Congress and in the small towns in the Western Reserve, underscores how
                    much antislavery violence reflected sectional strife over what would constitute
                    "American" institutions and cultural values.</p>
            <p>Given the complexity of abolitionist violence, then, it is surprising that the book is organized into
                    two sections, based upon racial difference, especially given that one of the stated points of the
                    book is to break away from the tendency of historians to assume "irreducible differences
                    between black and white abolitionists" (p. 2). While illustrative of distinctive
                    experiences of black and white men and women in the movement, the editors' decision to
                    divide the book along racial lines unfortunately masks what the essays themselves
                    reveal—that abolitionists were engaged in an intense internal struggle over the use of
                    violence as a tactic at the same time that they negotiated race and gender relations and prevailing
                    conceptions of masculinity and femininity. These themes run through the entire collection and
                    clearly challenge the organizational structure of the book. John Stauffer's essay, for
                    example, seems out of place in part two, a section devoted to white abolitionist activities. This
                    study goes beyond the black/white dichotomy that has characterized studies of abolitionism by
                    illustrating the ways that both black and white abolitionists deployed prevailing images of native
                    peoples as savages in order to justify violent antislavery action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Antislavery Violence</hi> provides the reader with a broader understanding of the
                    various forms of violent antislavery activism, the particular ways in which blacks and whites
                    participated, and the geographic scope of that activism. Like any good anthology, it is also packed
                    with themes that inspire further study, as historians continue to bring clarity to both the history
                    of U.S. abolitionism and the nineteenth century.</p>

            <p>The Union went to war in 1861 armed not only with bullets and bayonets but with popular prints.
                    Prints fell between oil painting, which enjoyed special cachet as an elite medium, and photography,
                    which still wore the attraction of novelty. Printmaking, as Mark E. <pb n="364" id="VAA4025-096-4-058"/> Neely, Jr., and Harold Holzer demonstrate, traded in cheap
                    sentimentality and vast marketability and concentrated more on shaping events to the moral
                    expectations of the purchaser than in transcribing an accurate historical record.</p>
            <p>But at the same time, prints succeeded in encoding a record of popular culture. Based on Robert

                    observe that "what popular prints illustrate is not events or personalities but the popular
                    culture of the times" (p. 17). This is particularly clear in prints devoted to the two
                    themes that dominated the Civil War experience—patriotism and domesticity (the wife
                    surrenders the husband to enlistment, the heroic soldier carries the flag in pursuit of the
                    disheartened rebels, the widowed mother and the orphaned children endure loss, the angelic nurse
                    restores the wounded, the joyful party greets the returning soldier). In that sense, these prints
                    are relentlessly hortatory in nature. As we know from other studies of the Civil War homefront, it
                    was the decay and dissolution of precisely the stereotypes the prints celebrated that was most
                    greatly feared. Although Neely and Holzer fail to make the point, what actually lies behind many of
                    these boisterously assertive prints is an uneasiness that the sentimental ideals the printmakers
                    promoted were threatened by the war.</p>
            <p>Neely and Holzer are at their strongest in sorting the prints and printmakers into the various genres
                    that constitute the bulk of Civil War print productions. Certainly the largest category of prints is
                    portraiture. In addition to print portraits, Holzer and Neely also deal effectively with 1864
                    electoral campaign cartoon prints; the great prints on army life which emerged from the work of J.
                    Nep Roesler, Winslow Homer, Alfred Matthews, and Edwin Forbes; and the increasing inclusion by 1865
                    of African-Americans in what had previously been all-white scenarios. Ultimately, the most
                    successful of all Civil War prints were the postwar chromolithographs, which began to utilize color.
                    The chromolithographs, especially the Louis Prang series, which employed Julian Davidson and Thure
                    de Thulstrup as artists, were some of the most impressive pieces of combat art to emerge from the
                    Civil War experience.</p>
            <p>This is, in every way, a lovely book. The illustrations and plates are beautifully reproduced, and
                    the essays are invariably perceptive and detailed. As difficult as it was for Neely and Holzer to
                    outdo themselves after producing such landmark collections of Civil War iconography as <hi rend="i">The Lincoln Image</hi> (1984), <hi rend="i">The Confederate Image</hi> (1987), and <hi rend="i">Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory</hi> (1991), they have nevertheless succeeded here once more.</p>

                    $35.00.)</head>
            <p>In this social-demographic history, Walter Nugent tells "how the West got its people: why
                    they came and mostly stayed." He describes "the myths, ideals, and
                    dreams" of the West in a narrative that runs from prehistoric times to the present (p.
                    xviii). Admitting that the location of the American "West" is a matter of
                    definition, Nugent defines the West as the "Plains-to-Pacific West, the census's
                    West plus the Great Plains" (p. 17). He also describes five basic "motivators of
                    migration to the West." The first of these was land hunger, typified in the American
                    experience by the "Homestead Ideal" or "Agrarian Myth." In
                    addition was the desire to find and exploit a "valuable resource." Other migrants
                    sought a "better quality of life." Less potent but still powerful has been
                    nostalgia, a lure for the back-tracker and also for those who associate the West with romance, the
                    alleged traits of the cowboy, and with other colorful western types. "Most historically
                    universal of all," argues Nugent, was the desire for self- and family improvement (pp.
                    4-6).</p>
            <p>Nugent presents his narrative in chapters two through nine, breaking them chronologically at 1848,
                    1889, 1913, 1929, 1941, 1965, and 1987. In chapter two he surveys demographic trends in the American
                    West from the prehistoric era until 1848. He follows with an examination of the
                    "capture" of the West by Americans, organizing the chapter around the gold rush
                    era, the agricultural settlement frontiers, the unique <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> experience, and the emergence of an urban West. Chapters covering the years of the late
                    nineteenth-century depression and the "golden twilight of the settlement frontier"
                    bring the story to 1913. Tourism, settlement stories, and population flows from Mexico are the most
                    notable elements in his account of the years from the latter date to 1929. Next come chapters on the
                    Dust Bowl and Great Depression years and on World War II, the baby boom, and the demographic
                    elements and social conditions that led to the uprising in the Watts area of metropolitan <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In chapter nine Nugent chronicles the collapse of the baby boom, the Immigration Act
                    of 1965, the role of counter cultures, environmental issues, and the impact of metropolitan society
                    on demographic developments. He concludes the book with a chapter focusing on the years 1987-1998,
                    in which he discusses current and possible demographic trends, the Immigration Act of 1986, and the
                    faded blooms of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> rose, also venturing some postmillennial projections.</p>
            <p>In his chapters, Nugent describes population flows and trends ranging from massive to minute, relates
                    them to national, regional, and sometimes local, economic and social developments, takes the reader
                    in most chapters on a regional tour to illustrate the demographic developments of the years under
                    study, and leavens his <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-096-4-060"/> narrative with many thumbnail sketches
                    of movers and leavers, winners and losers. The narrative is multicultural, and the reader usually
                    finds something new or fresh in Nugent's accounts of even the more familiar stories of
                    western people—the Dust Bowl migration, the baby boom, or the forced migration of Native
                    Americans. As in his treatment of Filipino repatriation, he incorporates many less well-known
                    aspects of western population history in his narrative. The demographic theory component is
                    unobtrusive in this book, but Nugent obviously has a sophisticated understanding of it. Demographers
                    sometimes produce exquisitely dull prose. Not so Nugent, however; his clear text, sprinkled with his
                    personal experiences, sardonic opinions, and turns of speech, successfully counters the impact of
                    the great many numbers in the book. Perhaps fancy ran too free when he compared the railroad
                    companies' practice of establishing station hamlets along its lines to the activities of a
                    "great ambulant egg-laying duck." This, however, is a very readable volume that
                    also includes comprehensive but concise documentation (p. 147).</p>
            <p>In sum, <hi rend="i">Into the West</hi> is a magnificent book. Anyone interested in American history,
                    whether teacher or general reader, should have a copy on the office or family bookshelf.</p>

            <p>Everett Emerson has written books on Mark Twain and other American literary figures, and he is the
                    founder of the Mark Twain Circle of America. Emerson writes with an understanding of Samuel
                    Clemens's life as Mark Twain that only a scholar who has lived with this enigmatic man for
                    years can interpret and successfully convey to readers.</p>
            <p>Emerson first published a literary look at Mark Twain's life in 1984, <hi rend="i">The
                        Authentic Mark Twain.</hi> In this new volume he continues this investigation of how
                    Twain's writings reflect his private life. Twain liked to say that biography was but
                    "the clothes and buttons" of the man, for he felt that no true biography of a
                    person could be written. Emerson shows that biography consists of the writings of the man or, as he
                    says in the preface, "The assumption behind this book is that one can understand virtually
                    all of Mark Twain's works better if one can read them in their biographical
                    context" (p. ix).</p>
            <p>What goes on in authors' lives spills over into their literary works. Emerson has done his
                    research in the mountainous volumes of writings left by Twain—the letters, notes,
                    published and unpublished manuscripts. He lets Clemens, and thus Twain, tell his life's
                    story in his own words.</p>
            <pb n="367" id="VAA4025-096-4-061"/>
            <p>Emerson accurately points out that this most beloved American writer and humorist is not always the
                    Twain that America has embraced as its own. In good American fashion, Clemens was a contradiction
                    and, ultimately, a man who kept reinventing himself. Born in a log cabin to a poor family, he grew
                    up in a <geogName>Missouri river</geogName> town which supplied him with characters and incidents
                    for his writing career. He was a typesetter, river pilot, prospector, journalist, and lecturer
                    before he became a writer of fiction. In his later life, in his quest to fulfill his American dream
                    of being rich, he was also a publisher and an investor. He married wealthy, refined Olivia Langdon
                    of Elmira, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, and chose to live in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>, often in a fashion above his means.
                    When money pressures got too great, he went to Europe to save on expenses and to find inspiration
                    for the books that sold best during his lifetime, his travelogues.</p>
            <p>Clemens would probably be amused that he continues to be talked of, written about, read, and that he
                    can still stir up controversy. He would be pleased that scholars such as Emerson go back to his own
                    words as a source of the truth about his life.</p>

            <p>One of the most significant population movements in midwestern history was the migration of white
                    southerners to the Great Lakes states during the twentieth century. Some histories have touched on
                    this subject, but <hi rend="i">Southern Migrants, Northern Exiles</hi> is the first attempt to offer
                    a book-length account of the phenomenon. The grandson of southern migrants to Indiana, <placeName>
                        <country reg="cd">Chad</country>
                    </placeName> Berry offers a sympathetic and insightful study of the northward movement and its
                    consequences. Believing that the migration story needed to be told from the viewpoint of the
                    migrants themselves, Berry conducted a long list of interviews, and he quotes at length from these
                    personal reminiscences. Some may take exception to the subjectivity of this approach, but none can
                    legitimately deny that Berry's study admirably illuminates a major development in the
                    history of Indiana and adjoining states.</p>
            <p>Berry begins by discussing the World War I era and the 1920s, when the first wave of white migrants
                    came north to find jobs in the booming factories of the Midwest. During this period and later
                    decades, the appeal of the industrial Midwest was economic. Southerners sought better-paying jobs
                    and found them in Akron, Flint, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Yet they also suffered homesickness, and this yearning to return home is a persistent
                    theme in Berry's book. Despite <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-096-4-062"/> good wages in the
                    North, many lonely and disenchanted whites returned to the South either temporarily or permanently.</p>
            <p>During the early 1930s many more returned home, as the Great Depression reduced the supply of jobs,
                    the Midwest's chief attraction. By the late 1930s, however, the northward migration of
                    white southerners resumed and accelerated during World War II and the postwar period of prosperity,
                    reaching a peak in the 1950s. In the process, southern whites transplanted much of their culture in
                    northern communities. Berry specifically considers the transplantation of southern religious and
                    musical culture, discussing the rise of the Southern Baptist Church north of the <geogName>Ohio
                        River</geogName> and the importance of country and western music in the lives of the newcomers
                    to the Midwest.</p>
            <p>Berry finds that throughout these years prejudice against the migrants was widespread, spawning
                    negative stereotypes regarding the supposed ignorance, poverty, and violence of southern whites. As
                    the elimination of poverty rose to a place of prominence on the national agenda during the 1960s,
                    well-meaning social scientists and social welfare agencies reinforced these stereotypes when they
                    focused new attention on the hillbilly ghettoes of midwestern cities. Berry, however, emphasizes
                    that white southern migrants, though largely blue collar, were not necessarily poor. Instead, he
                    contends that most of them achieved their economic goals and found relative prosperity in their new
                    homes. Yet, not all wanted to remain in <placeName>

                    </placeName> for the rest of their lives. Thus Berry concludes with a short discussion of those who
                    returned to the South after retirement. By the end of Berry's book, however, the reader is
                    aware that even the white migrants who returned to the South left their mark on the history of the
                    Midwest.</p>

            <p>The Kerner Report will insure that the name of Otto Kerner will not be forgotten. The report remains
                    a seminal statement on American race relations more than thirty years after its release. Yet it is
                    striking how little Americans—even most American historians—know about Kerner,
                    the governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> from 1961 to 1968 and the chairman of the commission that prepared the famous report.</p>
            <p>Bill Barnhart and Gene Schlickman have helped repair this deficiency with their new biography, the
                    first full study of this significant politician. Theirs is a sympathetic portrait, covering the <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-096-4-063"/> important phases of his life but ultimately fixated on
                    explaining the sad conclusion of his public career.</p>
            <p>Kerner, Barnhart and Schlickman show, was a reluctant politician despite familial advantages. He was
                    born in 1908 into the Czech community in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His father, a lawyer on the rise, served as an alderman before ultimately gaining an
                    appointment as a federal judge. In 1934, Otto, Jr., married the youngest daughter of Anton Cermak,
                    the late mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and architect of the city's modern Democratic party organization.</p>
            <p>The polished young Kerner—educated at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> University and Northwestern University Law School—was, however, more
                    interested in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> National Guard than in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> politics. His service in the guard led to a commission in the army during World War II.
                    He saw action in North Africa, Sicily, and the Pacific theater.</p>
            <p>During the war, Kerner impressed Jacob Arvey, his commanding officer in the guard and a leader in the
                    Cook County Democratic Party, who encouraged the decorated veteran's entrance into state
                    politics. Kerner's vote-getting ability attracted the attention of Richard Daley, who
                    successfully backed Kerner as the Democratic nominee for governor in 1960.</p>
            <p>At this point, Barnhart and Schlickman back away from a chronological approach and feature
                    Kerner's most notable work as governor: mental health reform, death penalty commutations,
                    open housing issues, and the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders that produced the
                    Kerner Report. This informative topical approach reveals much about public policy in a midwestern
                    state in the 1960s, but it does not produce a comprehensive evaluation of Kerner's two
                    terms as governor.</p>
            <p>The most distinctive feature of this biography is its extensive examination of the context of
                    Kerner's conviction for fraud and other charges in 1973 while he was a federal judge. The
                    history of corruption in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the horse racing scene in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, the rising power of the Internal Revenue Service, the growing distrust of public
                    officials in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and much more are covered in great detail.</p>
            <p>Barnhart and Schlickman argue that Kerner's conviction was unfair and that it would have
                    been overturned had he lived longer. (He died of cancer in 1976 not long after his release from
                    prison.) Their brief is persuasive, but even at the end of this thoroughly researched biography
                    based on dozens of interviews and manuscript collections, Kerner's inept defense against
                    federal charges is striking. This points to a characteristic of this study: though it will likely be
                    the definitive biography of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> politician, the inner Kerner remains elusive.</p>
