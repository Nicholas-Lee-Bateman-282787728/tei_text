                    <l>Crossing wide seas, he reached an alien land:</l>

                    <l rend="ti-1">Shone like a star one lovely Eastern face:</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Undimmed by centuries the colours were,</l>

                    <l rend="ti-2">And saw no more the face, so strange and fair</l>

                            <l>And his weak soul thrilled and trembled at her beauty, and he

                            <l>He would toss and cast his arms out through the silence and the
                                night</l>
                            <l>To those eyes that through the night and through the silence came
                                again,</l>
                            <l>Haunting him with the persistence and the passion of their pain.</l>
