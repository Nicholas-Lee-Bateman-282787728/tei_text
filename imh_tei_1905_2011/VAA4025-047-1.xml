            <p>"To drown the self in an ocean of sociality:" so William Maclure joyfully hailed
                    the experiment which he and Robert Owen were to make on the banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> in the year 1824. Historians, examining the story of this experiment, have kept so much
                    to the Owen side of the story (not unnaturally since Owen's own great-granddaughter even
                    survived to tell the tale) that it has generally been regarded as a failure. Moreover, the nature of
                    the experiment itself has been misunderstood. Owen, it is argued, was a socialist. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> was an experiment in socialism. Socialism was a failure. Therefore <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a failure: just another experiment in backwoods communism.</p>
            <p>That is not the whole story however. Owen's flair for publicity, which carried opinion
                    before it in his own day, cannot always hold sway. The New Harmony project has quite another,
                    American aspect: that of an experiment in social life which outlasted Owen's own interest,
                    and lived to contribute something to the American tradition. To understand this aspect, it is
                    necessary to survey the life of William Maclure: a survey which has been overdue for over a century
                    and which has not yet been undertaken.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>William Maclure (the insertion of the letter "a" in his surname was his own idea)
                    hailed from <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>. Born at Ayr in 1763, he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> and made a name for himself with the firm of Miller, Hart and Company, of 5 Angel
                    Court, Throckmorton Street. In the years of promise that followed 1783, he was to be found visiting
                    America, and soon he took out papers of citizenship. Such deliberate deracination was to mark his
                    whole career. Fortunately for himself, he became wealthy, and, since he remained unmarried, his
                    inclinations for travel could be indulged to the full.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a home base, he began to geologize. Geology in those days was the subject of daring
                    guess: daring since it tended to overturn the cherished concepts of cosmology: guess since Abraham
                    G. Werner, its high priest, had never ventured beyond his native Saxony. Maclure did. Being sent to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> on a government mission in 1803,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> he began to make geological trips
                    all over Europe. In a moment of rare self-revelation he wrote to his friend Benjamin Silliman
                    (sixteen years his junior and from 1802 onwards a Yale professor): "I first began my
                    geological rambles (considering coal as the most useful and valuable substance that nature had
                    bestowed on man). I followed it through all my excursions, and visited every considerable coal field
                    in Europe, with the hope that by an exact examination of the strata, over and under it, I should be
                    able to predict where coal could be found, but was at last forced to content myself with a tolerable
                    guess, at where it most probably could not be found."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> At the same time
                    as he was wandering over the face of Europe, knapsack at hand, his English contemporary William
                    Smith (six years younger than Maclure) was surveying the canals in course of his practice: a survey
                    that was to bring him wide fame as a geologist.</p>

            <p>Maclure not only antedated Smith in publication, but was a man of far wider interests. For in the
                    intervals of combing the countries for rocks, he was combing them for ideas. The magnets which drew
                    him were Philipp E. von Fellenberg and Johann H. Pestalozzi: both of them inspired with a zeal for
                    education. Fellenberg sustained at Hofwyl a great educational colony which embraced all grades of
                    schooling and all social classes: Pestalozzi inspired at Yverdun a coterie of apostles who made
                    order out of the luminous chaos of his ideas, and returned to their own countries as apostles of <hi rend="i">Anschauung</hi>, or as Maclure put it "bottoming education upon free
                    will." He was so impressed with Pestalozzi that he spent seven summers at Yverdun, living
                    with the master.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Failing to get him to come to America, he was successful in
                    persuading a Pestalozzian teacher, Francis J. N. Neef, to emigrate to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1810, five years after Neef migrated, Maclure secured another adherent, this time
                    the geologist Gerard Troost. Both Neef and Troost bore fruit by transplantation: Neef as a teacher
                    and Troost as a scientist. Neef wrote the first pedagogical work in the English language to be
                    published in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and founded a Pestalozzian school; while Troost established a pharmaceutical
                    laboratory, the first alum manufactory, and, ten years after his arrival, became a professor of
                        mineralogy.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Maclure himself spent most of his time doing for America what Smith was doing for <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. On July 20, 1809, he read a paper to the American Philosophical Society on the geology
                    of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. This he expanded eight years later by another paper on the same subject presented to
                    the same body on May 16, 1817. This second paper, published as a separate pamphlet, undoubtedly made
                    Maclure's name known beyond the immediate circle of his American friends. <list type="footnotes">

                            of sensation, has no independent existence as Locke would maintain. This is a significant
                            anticipation of <placeName>

                    <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-047-1-008"/> Some idea of how it circulated may be seen in the fact that the
                    British Museum copy was originally the property of Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society,
                    presented to him by David Hosack, the physician-mineralogist who gave his mineral collection to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1821. The members of the Academy of Natural Science of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> were much impressed, and elected him as president, a post he held for the next
                    twenty-two years. He was a good friend to them: a considerable portion of the first part of their
                    journal was printed in his own house there, while he presented its library with over fifteen hundred
                    volumes.</p>
            <p>Silliman, who was well qualified to judge, said of Maclure's work at this time:
                    "Few men have seen so much of the structure of our globe, and few have done so much with
                    such small pretensions."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The <hi rend="i">Edinburgh Review</hi>, in

                    who have had opportunities of extensive observation, he has found that the theory of the Freyberg

                    Allegheny region, he thought, would be the last part of the continent to be thickly inhabited.</p>
            <p>Restless and searching, he was perpetually on the lookout for fresh talent to add luster to his own
                    intellectual enterprises. His third major recruit was a naturalist, Charles Alexandre Lesueur, who
                    had explored the coasts of <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>
                    </placeName> in the opening years of the century and brought back a hundred thousand zoological
                    specimens. George, Baron von Cuvier was so impressed that he credited Lesueur and his artist partner
                    François Péron with discovering more than all other naturalists had hitherto
                    done, in the modern era. Whether Maclure was drawn to him by the <hi rend="i">Voyage de
                        découvertes aux Terres Australes</hi> and thought that Lesueur's talents
                    would complement his own, cannot be definitely stated. But one thing is clear from
                    Lesueur's biographer: Lesueur was most reluctant to leave his native land, and it took long
                    persuasion by Maclure to induce him to change his mind.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The fact that Maclure
                    was a wealthy man, and was able to offer "un traitement annuel" of two thousand

                    Indies, publishing a report on his return. These observations, dated October 18, 1817, marked

            <p>Maclure himself did not settle. The picture presented by the European progressives was discouraging.
                    Pestalozzi's work at Yverdun seemed to be coming to an end: he had lost his wife in 1815,
                    and in the same year, sixteen of his teachers left him in a body as a protest against his retention
                    of an unpopular teacher. Johannes Niederer, Hermann Krusi, and Johannes Ramsauer, his three
                    standbys, also left, and legal suits, hostile pamphlets, and misrepresentation looked like drawing a
                    curtain on a great experimental drama. All this, to an enthusiast like Maclure, must have looked
                    disastrous, and it is not surprising that he characteristically set about continuing the work
                    himself.</p>
            <p>The site which he selected for his operations was <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Alicante</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he planned a great agricultural school on the lines of Hofwyl or Yverdun. In it,
                    physical labor was to be combined with moral and intellectual culture. It was to do for the
                    education and training of the young what Fellenberg and Pestalozzi had failed to do in harmony.
                    Maclure's enterprise secured him an estate of ten thousand acres, he repaired the buildings
                    and put the whole estate in order.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> He visited various parts of southern <placeName>

                    </placeName> with a view to scientific investigation. Unfortunately for him, the liberal dawn which
                    he so confidently expected to illuminate the country did not materialize: the estate was confiscated
                    and returned to the church, and Maclure received no compensation. But that did not prevent Maclure
                    from continuing with his geological studies. In a letter to Professor Silliman, written from Madrid
                    on August 22, 1822, he took it upon himself to castigate the <hi rend="i">Voyage Minerologique et
                        Géologique en Hongrie</hi> published by the distinguished French geologist F. S.
                    Beudant, the professor of mineralogy at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Maclure was scathing: "all that possibly can be useful, in mineralogy or
                    geology, might, with as much ease, have been put into 50 pages, and the reader saved the labor of
                    turning over from 1500 to 1800 pages of repetitions and descriptions of the same rocks, a thousand
                    times over, creating confusion and fatigue, without leaving in the mind, any clearly defined ideas
                    of the subject. The author seems totally unacquainted with the immense variety of volcanic
                    rocks," and to have been fiercely patriotic: "any observer can obtain a more

                    impulsion of Werner has been long kept in the extreme exaggeration of the Neptunian theory; now that
                    Werner is dead, it is likely to swing as far in the opposite direction, and scorch our globe with
                    fire, as unmercifully as the Neptunians inundated it with water. I have always been of the opinion

                    he wrote to Silliman on October 19, 1822: "It is an axiom with me that it is the positive
                    and real interest of every individual in society to have as many friends and as few enemies as
                    possible. To obtain them he must do as much good and as little harm as possible. In reflecting upon
                    the absurdity of my own classical education, launched into the world as ignorant as a pig of
                    anything useful, not having occasion to practice anything I had learned, …. I had been
                    long in the habit of considering education one of the greatest abuses our species were guilty of,
                    and of course one of the reforms the most beneficial to humanity, and likewise offering to ambition
                    a fair field. Almost no improvement has been made in it for two or three hundred years; there was
                    immense room for change to put it on a par with other functions of civilization. The task appeared
                    easy, and the credit to be acquired by any change considerable, for nearly the same reasons. I
                    adopted rock-hunting as an amusement in place of deer or partridge hunting, considering mineralogy
                    and geology as the sciences most applicable to useful practical purposes, but, like most of the
                    things of the greatest utility, neglected,—having long given up all idea of changing the
                    opinions of man as a labor far above my abilities. I have been endeavoring, for some twenty years,
                    to change the education of children, and stumbled by accident about eighteen years ago on the school
                    of Pestalozzi in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName>, which subserved the useful purposes that I had formed to myself of a rational
                    education. I have been ever since doing something towards propagating and improving the scheme, and
                    the success in the fruits are more than I expected, for it has won some of the most promising men in
                    our country, such as Henry Sybert &amp;c., &amp;c., but has not been able to penetrate deep
                    into the crust of prejudices which is early interwoven with our self-love, so as to make the
                    greatest part of mankind jealous and inveterate enemies of any system that gives knowledge on
                    cheaper terms than they themselves paid for it; though I have little doubt that in time some such
                    system will generally prevail in our country, where the power, being in the hands of the people,
                    through the medium of our popular governments, renders a diffusion of knowledge necessary to the
                    support of freedom, and of course the necessity of an almost equal division of both property and
                    knowledge, which the advantages <pb n="9" id="VAA4025-047-1-013"/> given to those who can afford to
                    send their sons to colleges very naturally counteracts."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> So, to
                    offset his Spanish tragedy, he opened a school in his house in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In it "Boys from eight to ten years old become good mineralogists and
                    chemists, almost equal to the analysis of rocks, and speak and grammatically understand three to
                    four modern languages, mathematics in all its branches, are good arithmeticians, and in short before
                    the arrival of that critical time, the age of puberty, they will possess more useful knowledge than
                    they could have had by the old system at the age of thirty or forty."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                    This little school served as a magnet for other teachers. William Phiquepal and Madame Fretageot,
                    both Pestalozzians, followed the path that Neef, Troost, and Lesueur had taken before them, and, by

            <p>This novelty was the prospect of a political experiment. From being a geologist he was turning
                    towards politics. The gulf between the two vocations was bridged for him by his ideas on education.
                    He told Silliman: "Indeed, one can foresee a state of society where the exchange of ideas
                    would be the only commerce, where mankind will be so well informed, as to raise every thing they
                    want themselves and restrain those wants within the limits of their own productions."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> In <placeName>

                    had just published his <hi rend="i">Lecture on Human Happiness.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">18</hi> This
                    tract attempted to prove, on the basis of figures given in Colquhoun's <hi rend="i">Treatise on the … Resources of the British Empire</hi>, published eleven years
                    before, that labor was being robbed of four-fifths of its produce. Gray's tract was not
                    exactly as communistic as it might have seemed, for in 1831, six years later, he showed in his <hi rend="i">Social System</hi> that what he really favored was nationalization of marketing. But
                    what he said in his <hi rend="i">Lecture on Human Happiness</hi> was enough for the <placeName>

                    on principles of mutual co-operation, calculating that if twenty thousand pounds were subscribed,
                    they could go ahead at once. Interested parties were invited to get in touch with James Corses at

            <p>Maclure was an interested party, but in a different sense. He told Silliman: "A Prospectus
                    of the British establishments, with the first lecture on human happiness, by John Gray, has been
                    published: it places the state of society, in a new and highly interesting point of view, extremely
                    favourable to liberty."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> He also declared "our disgrace and
                    humilitation would be much aggravated, if the two establishments now forming in Britain were to
                    succeed, and the attempt now making in America were to fail."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prevent this, he determined to throw in his lot with Robert Owen, and ensure that "the
                    American one" would succeed. The two men were no strangers to each other: Maclure had
                    visited New Lanark, Owen's Scottish social experiment, while Owen had visited <placeName>

                    beings who had known no other. It was but natural that they should get together, especially as
                    Maclure's considerable wealth enabled him to play the part of joint patron. The agreement
                    was that each should provide the sum of one hundred fifty <list type="footnotes">

                    cause of their parting. Maclure had one asset for Robert Owen which is acknowledged by a recent
                    writer: his decision merely to adhere to Robert Owen "partially counteracted" the
                    "unfortunate publicity" which Owen's public utterances brought upon the

                    fitted it up for the journey. This was the famous boatload of knowledge about which so much has been

            <p>Maclure was sixty-three years old: Owen eight years younger. They should have been able to see eye to
                    eye, but could not. Owen was in a hurry to establish his "half way house to the social
                    state," but Maclure was anxious to promote a more gradual system.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> It
                    was the age old tug of war between the evolutionary and revolutionary personalities. Owen soon found
                    this out, and set up a system of education different to that of Maclure. Indeed, when Owen was
                    washing the dirty linen of his quarrel with Maclure in public, he naively confessed: "Mr.
                    Maclure went out to establish a favorite system of education at <placeName>

                    patience than I ever saw exercised on any similar occasion. I was myself disappointed that he could
                    not organize his operations."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> He attacked Maclure's brother
                    as "a mere tradesman who knew but little except <hi rend="i">to buy cheap and sell
                        dear,"</hi> and continued: "I had, I suppose, somewhat irritated Mr. Maclure;
                    for I had commenced a system of education different from his own—and I therefore made my
                    arrangements independently of him, and commenced my system under the direction of a Mr.

            </p>
            <p>The financial trouble was somehow hushed up: Maclure paid forty thousand dollars and a balance of a
                    further five thousand dollars. Owen admitted defeat on April 13, 1828, and left the field clear for
                    Maclure, who now got into his stride. Earlier he had written in the <hi rend="i">American Journal of
                        Science</hi> his manifesto: "The great and fundamental principle is, never attempt to
                    teach children what they do not comprehend, and to teach them in the exact ratio to their
                    understanding it, without omitting one link in the chain of ratiocination, proceeding always from
                    the known to the unknown and from the most easy to the most difficult, practising the most extensive
                    and accurate use of all the senses, exercising, improving, and perfecting all the mental and
                    corporeal faculties by quickening combination; accelerating and carefully arranging comparison;
                    judiciously and impartially making deductions; summing up the results free from prejudices, and
                    cautiously avoiding the delusions of imagination, the constant source of ignorance and
                        error."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With Owen himself away, Maclure was at last able to establish what he had failed to do in <placeName>

                    (not the infant department, which was Owen's idea) that Maclure devoted all his thought. An
                    industrial department was grafted to the school, so that the child should pay for its maintenance,
                    and gain self respect by so doing. In this, the child chose his trade, and if he had no positive
                    choice, Neef was to assign him to one for which he displayed a special aptitude.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>There were two other schools: one leading to this higher school, and the other leading from it. The

                    might be expected, was under Madame Fretageot, and the vocational school under Phiquepal
                    d'Arusmont. Numbers, according to Owen's son were 130 before Maclure arrived:
                    afterwards, according to Maclure, they were nearly tripled.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Maclure's
                    estimate was: one hundred in the junior school, nearly two hundred in the higher school, and eighty
                    in the vocational department. What is even more important from the point of view of this article is
                    that the education society had purchased from Owen no less than nine hundred acres of land for an
                    experimental farm, several houses, two large granaries, and a public building which was being
                    converted into a workshop. This public building had been a church used by the former Rappite member

            <p>With Owen gone, the community shook off his political ideas and settled down as a happy family.

                    who had managed his affairs so well since 1828. Not for nothing was she the wife of a colonel of
                    Hussars in Napoleon's army: for five years she had managed the little group of advanced
                    students, acting as midwife to all their literary productions. Since her death in 1833 was a serious
                    break in the chain of communicative control by which Maclure kept his hand on affairs in <placeName>

                    especially of natural history and fine art. In addition, he gave to the Academy a ten thousand
                    dollar claim against the Spanish government which he possessed, following it up with a gift of
                    another ten thousand dollars in 1838. Such <list type="footnotes">

                    tug of the ideas which he manipulated, the ambience of the men he brought to the west, and the
                    dominant impress of his own enthusiasm. Undoubtedly his geological enthusiasm weaned Owen's
                    sons from their father's political activities, and set them in the careers which they
                    followed. David Dale Owen's indication of the mineral riches of <placeName>

                    and his official reports, are themselves tributes to Maclure, whose infectious enthusiasm made <placeName>

            <p>Maclure had wider plans than that. He wanted his school of industry at <placeName>

                    </placeName> to print editions of what he would call classics. He had a very real sense of the value
                    of useful knowledge, and savagely attacked what often passed for it. In a scathing indictment of
                    antiquarianism, he wrote: "I see nothing worth the trouble, in searching for antiquities,
                    and studying the learned disquisitions of antiquarians. The only use of both is to retard the
                    progress of the age, by neglecting the useful arts, of which the ancient were totally ignorant. I do
                    not remember ever having the occasion to examine the results of either, of antiquities or
                    antiquarians, but to find them in opposition to the general good, by supporting and enforcing
                    arbitrary maxims of what now may be called despotism; obstructing by sophistry and miscalled logic,
                    all the roads to the comfort and happiness of the millions; reasoning that because the ancients,
                    they call our masters, did not arrive at the same height of perfection, it is impossible for any of
                    the moderns to improve. I would not give a single new fact of the operations of the laws of nature,
                    for all the antiquities that exist."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Here is your positivist speaking

                    aiding instruction. The importance of these libraries in stimulating thought among ordinary people
                    when such institutions did not exist has yet to be calculated. Visitors like Constantine Raffinesque

                    changed by external circumstances. But in no slavish imitation of the follies of Europe, have we
                    been so essentially injured in our vital principles, as in the copy we have taken and still continue

                    and the healthy economy of Fellenberg's industrial schools never blinded him to the basic

                    Europe. He was no doctrinaire socialist, but a pioneer in the scientific movement in the West: one
                    of the creators of the new humanism.</p>

            <p>Petroleum has been known for centuries in various parts of the world, but it was not until the famous
                    Drake well was drilled in 1859 that it suddenly assumed the proportions of an industry. Petroleum is
                    one form of bitumen which also occurs as asphalt, as a semifluid substance called maltha and the
                    natural gas which is so familiar to Americans of the twentieth century. All forms of bitumen were
                    known to ancient people. The word "slime" as used in Genesis probably refers to
                    the soft bitumen of the Euphrates Valley and some form of semifluid bitumen was used as mortar in
                    the construction of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Babylon. Petroleum is mentioned in the early writings of the Arabs and by the
                    historian Herodotus. Pliny described oil that was used in lamps under the name of "Sicilian
                    Oil." The oil springs of Baku, which frequently burned in spectacular fashion, attracted
                    the attention of early travelers including that imaginative globe-trotter, <placeName>

            <p>In North America it seems evident that the Indians, particularly the Iroquois and their ancestors in

                    oil as a base for war paint and as medicine. French missionaries noticed traces of petroleum in the
                    Great Lakes country early in the seventeenth century and by the middle of the eighteenth century the

                    </placeName> sank a well near <placeName>

                    the well was finished it became ignited and the driller, who had boasted on starting the well that
                    he would either find salt or bore into hell, was satisfied that he had accomplished the latter.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>Oil in the salt wells was a nuisance, but the petroleum had some commercial value even in the early
                    frontier period of the west. At the time of the westward migration at the beginning of the
                    nineteenth century the methods of collecting the oil were very primitive. The most popular procedure
                    consisted in throwing a coarse blanket into the oil spring and allowing the cloth to absorb the oil.
                    The blanket was wrung out into a tub or barrel and the operation repeated. Some frontiersmen
                    collected oil in five-gallon kegs which they exchanged in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> for hardware or food staples needed by the family. This method of barter was not
                    dependable since the demand of the local apothecaries was limited and two large barrels of oil would
                    glut the market.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the pioneers believed that the oil had almost miraculous medicinal powers, it was inevitable
                    that every quack and pill vendor of the frontier either used it in his practice or sold it wholesale

                    as a cough medicine, a laxative, a liniment for rheumatism, saddle bruises, and charley horses. It
                    was considered very effective on minor burns and it was used extensively in fly season to bring some
                    degree of comfort to domestic animals. Some men claimed that the oil made a very good hog dip and

            <p>It is pertinent to the theme of this article to notice that the promoters of the early companies saw
                    the practical value of scientists as consultants. At this time it was not the geologist who was

                    tests of the crude oil from the seepages to determine its commercial value. The most important of
                    the pioneer advisers was Benjamin Silliman, Jr., of Yale College who was recognized as an eminent
                    authority in chemistry. He was also interested in geology but his employers were concerned primarily

                    made his historical report which eventually led to the drilling of the Drake well in 1859.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Silliman's report was important for several reasons. For the first time it was
                    scientifically demonstrated that the refined oil was not only valuable as an illuminating oil but
                    that it was superior to any of the important means of artificial illumination known at the time with
                    the possible exception of the English Argand gas burner.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> To prove the point,
                    Silliman invented an original photometer by means of which he brought the petroleum light into rigid
                    comparison with the illumination of camphene lamps, sperm oil lamps, coal oil and gas burners.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Furthermore, he anticipated and described the early methods of distilling
                    petroleum that were to be adopted by manufacturers. He used the method that became known as
                    "cracking" and suggested the use of steam for distillation, an idea that was to be
                    adopted and exploited by Joshua Merrill, a manufacturing chemist on the staff of the Downer Kerosene
                    Oil Company of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Eveleth and Bissell were pleased with Silliman's report. With the hope of securing <placeName>

                    the disturbing effects of the panic of 1857 quickly terminated the activities of this organization.

            <p>The Drake well proved that a commercial supply of petroleum could be obtained by drilling directly
                    into the rock or "oil sands," and the successful operation of this well marks the
                    beginning of the petroleum industry. It attracted the attention of geologists, promoters,
                    prospectors, and businessmen and soon additional wells were being drilled mostly on a helter skelter
                    basis since no one had a sound theory relative to petroleum origin and occurrence. Most of the new
                    wells were drilled on the assumption that if Drake could get oil from a hole in the rock, so could

                    a revolutionary advance over the frontier "soaked blanket" technique. In
                            <placeName>

                    </placeName> the well was drilled with iron or wooden rods, or both combined. If the rock was
                    covered with a layer of soil or quicksand, a cast-iron pipe was driven down to the oil level. The
                    drill hole and the pipe varied from three to six inches in diameter. Great care was taken to drill
                    the hole perpendicular otherwise the pump would never set properly. Small mirrors were used to
                    reflect the sun's rays into the well so that its condition could be determined and errors
                    corrected before the pump was set in place. If the borehole filled with water at a short distance
                    from the surface, it was more difficult, if not impossible, to examine the well accurately.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pump was of copper or iron and operated by a five-horse power engine. Barren water veins above
                    the oil pool were stopped by a "seed bag." This was a leather jacket filled with
                    dry flaxseed and placed around the pump. When in place, the water expanded the seed and the jacket
                    swelled into a water tight packing. Since most of the oil came with water, it was run off into a
                    series of large vats of varying depth which separated the oil from the water. From the last vat the
                    pure oil was drawn off into casks and shipped to market.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cost of well construction varied from place to place depending on the depth of the boring,
                    hardness of the rock, and the price of labor and supplies. In eastern <placeName>

                    hundred and sixty dollars. A four-horse power engine was worth about five hundred dollars and three
                    run-off vats could be purchased for ninety dollars. About five hundred dollars was allowed for
                    operating expenses during the boring process bringing the total cost of the well to fifteen hundred
                    dollars. Daily operating expenses for a moderately productive well were estimated at twenty-five or
                    thirty dollars per day. Such a well, producing at least ten barrels<hi rend="sup">17</hi> per day
                    produced a daily profit of eighty-three dollars when oil was quoted at twenty-five cents per gallon
                    at the well.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the years following the development of the Drake well men pursued the smell of petroleum with
                    the same feverish determination that had characterized the gold prospector in the rush of
                    forty-nine. According to Alexander Winchell, one of the early oil geologists, the wildcatters could
                    not be convinced "that mineral oil is a geological product, fixed in its relations to the
                    earth and to the strata, as unchangeably and as intelligibly as iron or salt. They would not listen
                    to the counsel of science. Every man was confident in his self-wisdom, and never inquired on what
                    grounds he believed and acted as he did."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Of course, in the
                    1860's geologists themselves did not know very much about the subject and they made many
                    mistakes in their efforts to locate oil. These errors in judgment caused promoters and businessmen
                    to look askance at geologists and the science was given a stigma which, while unjust, was difficult
                    to eradicate. The profession was discredited still more by unscrupulous quacks who advertised
                    themselves as trained and reputable geologists. By 1880 it was a common saying among oilmen that if
                    they wanted to make sure of a dry hole, they would employ a geologist to select the location.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    on this subject were T. Sterry Hunt, E. B. Andrews, and Alexander Winchell. Hunt (1826-1892) had
                    been a student in the chemistry course taught by Benjamin Silliman, Jr., at Yale, and in 1847 he was
                    appointed chemist and mineralogist of the geological survey of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. While performing his duties in this connection, he observed that Canadian oil occurred
                    "along the line of a low, broad anticlinal axis."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> This seems
                    to be the first time that the anticlinal fold was associated with oil accumulation. Hunt published
                    his views in an article in the <hi rend="i">Canadian Naturalist</hi> for August, 1861, and modern
                    authorities claim that had he backed up his anticlinal reservoir theory with additional factual
                    evidence based on actual field observation, he would have become an outstanding petroleum authority.</p>
            <p>While Hunt was developing his theory in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, E. B. Andrews of Marietta College came to a similar conclusion after a study of the
                    oil regions of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Andrews published his conclusions in December, 1861, but neither
                    his report nor Hunt's stimulated the comment that they deserved. Nothing more of importance
                    to the oil prospector was advanced by the geological profession until 1865. In that year, Alexander
                    Winchell (1824-1892), who had been surveying the bituminized shales of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, called attention to the very essential need of an impervious rock covering for the oil
                    sands in order to prevent spontaneous distillation. He was the first to point out that wherever the
                    oil producing shales were exposed to the atmosphere or were covered with a porous medium, the oil
                    and gas slowly escaped and were lost. On the other hand, where the oil rock was covered by an
                    impenetrable layer of rock or heavy clay the oil and gas were retained, gradually forcing out the
                    water and saturating whatever porus strata there was in the formation. The saturated porus strata
                    then became a tightly capped oil reservoir.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>Although these theories were fundamentally sound they were given little publicity at this time and
                    several decades went by before a practical working hypothesis for oil prospecting was worked out,
                    successfully demonstrated and generally accepted. Meanwhile, geological field work continued, and
                    the state surveys in <placeName>

                    </placeName> were especially valuable to the growing oil industry and to the geologists who were
                    interested in petroleum. From time to time geologists demonstrated that their scientific knowledge
                    was expanding and that this knowledge when properly applied to a given problem possessed a practical
                    value. A striking example was the successful drilling of a well at Brady's
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Bend</settlement>, <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, in 1865. The Brady's Bend Iron Works Company
                    consulted the well-known geologist J. P. Lesley (1819-1903) for an opinion on the probable depth at
                    which oil could be reached on their property. Lesley, who had made a thorough study of the
                    formations in the vicinity, promptly made his computations and predicted that oil should be found at
                    a depth of eleven hundred feet. Acting on his advice the company drilled the well and struck oil at
                    eleven hundred and twenty feet.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps Lesley was lucky because few geologists made predictions as accurate as this at this time.
                    Generally speaking, in the 1860's and 70's wells were still being drilled merely
                    because the hills or ledges seemed to resemble other topographical features where petroleum had been
                    discovered. In <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, it was noted that the oil pools tended to be elongated, with a nearly straight axis of
                    a fixed magnetic bearing. This caused the development of the "degree lines" or
                    "oil belt" school of thought.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> When founded on fact, such
                    lines proved to be helpful in drilling in certain cases, but frequently the idea was carried to
                    extremes and applied to districts far removed from those where the original basic data had been
                    gathered. One "oil belt" expert ran a line for sixty-five miles through the woods

            <p>John Franklin Carll (1828-1904), who was in charge of the petroleum department of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> survey under Lesley from 1874 to 1885 considered the belt-line theory the best of the
                    old methods, but he was among the first to demonstrate that it was not infallible. He described the
                    belt method of oil prospecting as "an attempt, by means of compass lines, to keep on the
                    axis of the sand deposit," as shown by previous experience and oil well development. It was
                    unfortunate that the oil sands had been directed by the very unstable agent, water, and consequently
                    had not been laid down on a straight and continuous line. This natural condition, he pointed out,
                    was the fallacy in the oil belt theory. Unexpected breaks and curves in the oil sands and gravels
                    made the application of a dogmatic formula of this type a risk and not a certainty in the search for
                    new wells.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to Carll, the best guides for the oil prospector were the rocks themselves and while he did
                    not condemn the anticlinal theory, he was very critical of it and thought that it should be used
                    with caution. He agreed with Winchell that there should be a reservoir to hold the oil and a good
                    impervious cover to prevent its escape.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Carll was the first geologist to

            </p>
            <p>White possessed some of the characteristics of the typical crusader. He was anxious to prevent the
                    waste of man power and the waste of capital in the fruitless drilling for oil and gas in areas where
                    it could not exist. He was also concerned over the stigma that had been placed on the geological
                    profession by skeptical and prejudiced oilmen. Since he believed sincerely that the anticlinal
                    theory was the best guide to petroleum deposits, he was determined to win the support of geologists
                    and oilmen alike and with this objective in mind he began what he called the battle against
                    prejudice by publishing several articles in 1885 that were based on his successful field
                        demonstrations.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> New demonstrations were followed by additional reports and
                    articles. Then in 1892 he republished his most important articles because he was certain that many
                    geologists had not seen them before and he was determined that they should.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Undoubtedly there were many geologists who did not read his articles and some of those who did flatly
                    refused to accept his general thesis. However, it was impossible to overlook his remarkable success
                    in locating oil and gas in commercial quantities. For example, during the 1880's he located

                            Vandergrift, had more faith in geologists than the majority of his contemporaries.
                            Vandergrift had been influenced by William Earseman, a successful oilman who had made a

                    associates and its location was made from purely scientific deductions in which the anticlinal
                    theory was of paramount importance. When White was surveying the field and predicting that oil would
                    be found there, oilmen and geologists were skeptical. The test of his knowledge and of his theories
                    came with the drilling. It was a long and tedious process and even White became discouraged when
                    rocks thickened where they should have thinned and when the intervals between strata were not what
                    the calculations had indicated they should be. Day after day the drill cut deeper into the rock. The
                    geologists became anxious; the scoffers continued to smile knowingly to themselves. And then
                    suddenly, success! On October 11, 1889, the drill struck saturated oil sand and the black gold began
                    to flow in large quantities.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>White's successful demonstration on the Mannington field was a very important episode in the
                    history of petroleum geology. As White himself said, "It taught the practical oil men once
                    for all that they could not afford to disregard geological truths in their search for oil
                        deposits."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The fight against the old prejudices was beginning to
                    be won and White deserves a great deal of credit for his role in the struggle. Certainly he did more
                    than any other geologist to popularize the anticlinal theory. The importance of the accomplishment
                    was clearly summarized by Edward Orton (1829-1899), <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s state geologist (1882-1899), when he asserted that while there was

                    necessary. For example, the heart of the Indiana gas field was not a true anticline but a high lying
                    formation that resembled a terrace, which may be described as a flattened arch or roll, so
                    constructed that the oil and gas could be arranged within the rocks in order of their specific
                    gravity much as they would do in a perfect anticline. Orton's "terrace
                    principle," which was defined about 1886, became an important and practical corollary of
                    the anticlinal theory.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

               </placeName>, was above an anticlinal dip in the oil producing
                    Trenton Limestone of that area. Gas had been discovered there more or less by accident in November,
                    1884, and before long geologists, oil, and gas men were on the scene. Almost immediately the
                    so-called practical prospectors began to lay their belt lines in all directions but especially north
                    forty-five degrees east, which had become the most popular line in the <placeName>
                        <region reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> fields. Advice from the geologists was ignored and numerous wells were drilled on the
                    basis of the belt theory with the expected results from the scientific point of view: most of the
                    wells were failures. This effort, however, was not entirely wasted as the geologists were able to
                    secure valuable information from the drilling without any expense or effort on their part. According
                    to Orton, this wildcat drilling proved again the worthlessness of lines or belts as guides to
                    productive horizons.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> More scientific prospecting helped to develop the Findlay
                    field and by 1886 the town was experiencing a typical boom complete with industrial and real estate

                    ridiculously low figure. Under the circumstances the use of gas was lavish and wasteful and Orton,
                    who had made a special study of oil and gas accumulation, warned of the probability of the
                    exhaustion of the supply. He was the first geologist to promote conservation practices where
                    petroleum products were concerned.</p>
            <p>The contributions of White and Orton helped convince the oilmen that geologists could be assets to
                    their business. Additional prestige was brought to the profession by the publications of the federal
                    survey which were based on extensive field work in the Midwest, <placeName>

                    and beginning of the twentieth century and they brought to light knowledge of numerous oil bearing
                    areas, usually as the result of the application of principles developed by White. At the turn of the
                    century, White was regarded as the pioneer and the guide of the profession of petroleum
                        geologists.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> It would seem that his popularity was deserved because the new
                    oil discoveries gave additional proof of the general soundness of his fundamental hypothesis. In

                    "In a large proportion of the oil fields of the world," he wrote, "the

            <p>In the twentieth century the continued success of the application of geological principles to oil
                    prospecting brought about closer co-operation between oilmen and petroleum geologists. By 1920,
                    although quack geologists and "unwashed" wildcatters were still in evidence, big
                    business fully recognized the value of the trained scientist. Even before the turn of the century,
                    Carll was on the payroll of Standard Oil,<hi rend="sup">50</hi> E. T. Dumble was appointed
                    consulting geologist to the Southern Pacific Railroad, and W. W. Orcutt organized and headed the
                    geological department of the Union Oil Company of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> After 1900 other oil companies began to employ geologists either
                    as consultants or as full time employees. One of the most enthusiastic pioneer supporters of geology
                    as the handmaiden of the oil industry was Frank Adair Leovy of the Gulf Corporation. Leovy was also
                    a pioneer in using applied seismology and geophysics as an aid to the oil prospector. In later years
                    he established at Gulf a complete research department charged with the responsibility of developing
                    improved methods of locating oil fields.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Modern oil companies know the value of trained petroleum geologists and the role played by geology
                    increases in importance year by year. Since modern wells may cost from seventy-five to five hundred
                    thousand dollars, random drilling is a luxury that few companies can afford. The philosophy of
                    modern oilmen was expressed in 1922 when Robert S. Ellison, Vice-President of the Midwest Refining

            <p>In following the main theme of this paper considerable attention has been given to the role of the

                    summarize the distinct contributions made by the industry to the science of geology. These
                    contributions may be grouped under six headings: <list type="ordered">

                            small way to the progress of the science.</item>
                  <item>—The oil industry has given considerable impulse to the study of geology in
                            colleges and universities.</item>
                  <item>—The industry helped to prove the usefulness of applied geology and in doing
                            so, made the science respectable among laymen.</item>
                  <item>—This in turn made it possible for the state and federal surveys to secure the
                            necessary appropriations from hard-headed legislators in order to continue their own
                            research.</item>
                  <item>—The industry helped develop to near perfection field methods for structural
                            mapping.</item>

            <p>It seems obvious that not only has the geology profession been of great service to the oil industry,
                    but the industry in turn has been instrumental in developing the science. The two have become
                    interdependent, but members of the industry would be the first to admit that any balance sheet would
                    indicate a large credit figure in favor of the petroleum geologists.</p>

            <p>Regardless of their mode of transportation, most wayfarers were impressed by the novel character of
                    beach scenery, even if they considered it only a dull, monotonous stretch. Although the more compact
                    sand near the water's edge was best for wagons, it was not always possible to stay that
                    close because of danger from quicksand. Horses were particularly plagued by the shifting granules
                    and often bogged down. On cold nights, however, the situation was reversed; the beach became as hard
                    as any macadamized road. Frequently using sand hills which dotted the shore for protection when
                    forced to camp overnight, travelers compensated for the lack of combustible material along the shore
                    by snapping the hammer of a flintlock gun over tinder to start a fire. After such an open air
                    experience transients afterward vividly remembered the fantastic shapes assumed by white undulating
                    sand masses heaped one hundred to three hundred feet high.</p>
            <p>Their surfaces were covered with stunted pines, while nearer the beach dwarfish poplars, species of
                    bent grass, and a kind of thistle, and other vines predominated. All growths were stunted due to
                    exposure to salt spray. On the other hand, broad, hot expanses of sand, dazzling under the midday
                    sun and bare except for trailing roses, were often compared to desert wastes. In June, 1836, the

                    obscured the view. On a September evening in 1833, for example, blood red lightning that shot
                    intermittently from cloud masses over the lake was suddenly paled by a broad luminous arch which
                    rose skyward from the north. Quivering and shifting perpendicular rays trailed from it, swinging
                    back and forth in brilliant color combinations. The striking panorama was reflected in the calm,
                    liquid mirror of the lake until a bursting thunderstorm blotted out the magnificent spectacle. When
                    the skies cleared again, only a few fading rays remained. At other times the "resplendent
                    fires" of the aurora borealis contrasted strikingly with the livid glare from the burning
                    Kankakee marshes to the south.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Regardless of how intriguing and unusual travel along the beach might have been, shelter was a
                    serious problem. Often, of course, a sand bed was the best to be had. At the ferryhouse across the

                    for tired travelers despite many Indian relatives hanging around the place. In 1831 one party from <placeName>

                    blackbird which the squaw cooked and served with cranberries and a little coffee. Later the
                    proprietors were able to give the same band better food and a little whisky. Their accommodations,
                    however, left much to be desired, and members of at least one caravan found their fare too
                    unpalatable for consumption. Only because of anticipation of better food in <placeName>

                    trying to ford the stream. In the spring of 1835 the small ferryhouse on the north side of the river
                    was still functioning, but two years later travelers crossed with pleasure the Long Pole Bridge,

            <p>Baillytown, on the Calumet about five miles from the mouth of Fort Creek, was the home of Joseph
                    Bailly, a French trader, who built the first house in <placeName>

                    </placeName> there in 1822. With its oak-paneled living room, hand-wrought hardware, a bedroom with

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the house was a showplace in the wilderness. A spacious lawn separated it from the
                    river, and in the rear of the house was the race track where Bailly trained his blooded horses.
                    About 1834 the proprietor made a feeble attempt to plat a town, but no lots were ever bought by
                    white settlers, and it never became more than a trading post and Indian settlement. A third stopping

            <p>Additional shelters along the beach road were also made use of by weary travelers. A party of four,

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the early morning, but no food was available except bread, whisky, and a few
                    potatoes. Every square foot of flooring in both huts was covered with transients. An English farmer,

                    After the natives' hasty departure, Shirreff noted that his companions were soon sleeping
                    peacefully after a meal of bread and whisky in what was inferior to the bed of an East Lothian

                    miles in length. Cedar Lake, through which it would pass, was praised for the fine mill sites on its
                    outlet and for the abundance of bog iron ore in the vicinity. The Calumet's main channel
                    was considered navigable for steamboats, and enthusiasts felt another usable mouth could easily be

            <p>As for the Kankakee itself, impressions of its utility were varied. An unnamed traveler in 1829
                    observed that the river flowed through a winding valley four to eleven miles wide. In summer the
                    stream formed a wide swamp which was impassable in most places for man or beast. The river appeared
                    navigable, however, at least part of the year for thirty or forty miles within Indiana, but the land
                    through which it passed was exceedingly poor.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    nights. The Kankakee was finally crossed by covering the ice with hay which froze into it and thus

                    of English Lake and the mouth of Yellow River particularly offended him, but eight years later the

                    higher ground in barrens or oak openings. Twelve to eighteen inches of dry black vegetable matter
                    over one or two feet of loose clay loam and a hardpan of limestone and pebbly clay promised great
                    soil fertility. The wood-encircled, gently rolling land still impressed its viewers as late as 1859,

                    wind were blowing with great fury, fires were easily stamped and beaten out, although he did admit
                    that the usual fire descriptions were more valid in marsh country where movements of men and animals
                    were hindered.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Population movements into northwestern Indiana lagged considerably behind those into north central
                    Indiana for every counting period between 1830 and 1860. Only scattered notice of the origins of <placeName>

                    northwestern corner of the state made them not readily accessible. Without the beach road, there
                    would have been no major route into the area during the pioneer period. The Kankakee swamps
                    effectively blocked emigration from the south and the large majority of home-seekers from the east

                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> counties proved a definite asset in their growth because the nascent settlement of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the early thirties grew with such rapidity that it benefited surrounding areas.

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. That fact and the road's location also largely explain why the northern
                    sections of the two counties developed first. Finally, all the extreme northwestern area of Indiana
                    was greatly boosted by the tireless publicity efforts of Solon Robinson, who wrote extensively in
                    publications like the <placeName>

            <p>Such periodicals were widely read by farmers and others interested in agriculture who composed a
                    large percentage of the emigrants to northern Indiana. The subsequent history of the Calumet region
                    particularly has proved the foresight of men like Robinson and the early travelers who saw more in
                    the area than a succession of sand hills.</p>

            <head>Letters of William H. Harrison to Thomas Worthington, 1799-1813</head>

            <p>Miss Caroline Dunn of the William Henry Smith Memorial Library called to my attention a group of
                    recently acquired letters which William Henry Harrison wrote to Thomas Worthington, one of the
                    leaders in the Northwest Territory, who became <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator and Governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Miss Dunn supervised the transcription from the originals which are in the William
                    Henry Smith Memorial Library of the Indiana Historical Society at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This correspondence does not shatter any cherished traditions, but illustrates and
                    clarifies minor points of his career, such as the growing factionalism in the territory and the
                    development of the statehood movement. A very small but interesting item is the first letter which
                    introduced Michael Baldwin to Worthington. Several items about the controversy over statehood for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> are mentioned in the early letters.</p>
            <p>Since Harrison wrote to Worthington about things they had in common, there is less about Indiana
                    Territory than might be assumed. There are, however, several items of interest about Indiana in the
                    letters. The passage of the act creating the new territory and the Land Act of 1800 are mentioned in
                    the letter of April 25, 1800. His statement of May 2, 1800, that he would not accept the
                    governorship is a little surprising but it is followed by the explanation of July 13 that his
                    friends had induced him to change his mind. Harrison's support of slavery in Indiana is
                    clearly set forth in the letter of October 26, 1803. Altogether there is evidence that the Governor
                    identified himself with his territory, strove to advance its interests as he understood them, and
                    recognized distinctly what individuals were opposed to his policies.</p>
            <p>Harrison may not have been as self-seeking as has been suggested. On November 20, 1812, he was
                    apparently unconcerned about a high military appointment. But this letter should be read in the
                    light of a previously published communication of July 14 (Esarey, <hi rend="i">Messages and Letters

                    more of a revelation of his intense disappointment at not being appointed earlier than a statement
                    of lack of interest.</p>
            <p>Harrison disavowed responsibility for the massacre at the River Raisin in the letter of January 31,
                    1813. The later letters also throw some light on Harrison's campaign of 1813.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                        <p>At the last session of Congress a bill was brought in and passed through the Senate
                                    for increasing the Judiciary of this Territory from 3 to 5 Judges &amp; as it
                                    was postponed only for the want of time it will be brought forward at the ensuing
                                    Session &amp; I thing there is now doubt but it will be passed into a
                                    law—If this should be the case Mr. Wills<hi rend="sup">3</hi> is desirous
                                    of filling one of [the] to be created seats on the bench of the Genl Court and has
                                    requested me to mention the subject to you as he thinks a letter from you to Mr
                                        Ross<hi rend="sup">4</hi> in his favour will be of great advantage to him
                                    &amp; contribute much toward the attainment of his object. I shall say nothing
                                    of Mr Will's talents as you must be full as well acquainted with them as I
                                    am but only observe that having known him for many years I have always found him
                                    possessed of the strictest integrity. Should you think proper to say any thing in
                                    his favour to Mr Ross I shall esteem it an obligation confered on
                                    myself—but if on the contrary you should not think proper to do so let me
                                    assure that it will produce no other sensation in my breast but regret that you
                                    should not think as highly of Mr Wills as I do</p>

                                    Chilicothe—altho this is a very desirable thing under the circumstance of
                                    Govr St. Clairs Continuing at the helm of our Government yet under any other
                                    situation I should have opposed it upon the ground that Congress have not a right to
                                    pass any law of local arrangement—as the legislature of our Territory has
                                    complete, absolute &amp; final legislative power. The Amendments are referred to
                                    a select Committee—of which I am not a member of choice—having
                                    requested the Speaker to leave me out of the nomination—a sense of
                                    delicacy prompted by the situation in which I was placed by the petitions &amp;
                                    letters in my favor which the citizens of the Territory have done me the honor to
                                    forward to the executive &amp; other public characters. The Committee have
                                    however declared their intention to make their report in every way conformable to my
                                    wishes. This has led me to enquire amongst the Senators &amp; discover what
                                    would be the chance of their recinding the leading features of their amendments
                                    &amp; I find them determined to loose the bill entirely if their amendments are
                                    not adopted. This has occasioned expressions of the warmest indignation from many of
                                    the leading characters in the House of Representatives. There are several of the
                                    amendments made by the Senate to the <hi rend="i">land bill</hi> which the Select

                                    absence—Nothing I assure you was more distant from my intentions than to
                                    accept of the appointment of Governor of the Indiana Territory on the morning of the
                                    day on which the appointment was made but I was assailed by my friends with
                                    arguments which if not sufficient to remove all my scruples were nevertheless
                                    sufficiently weighty to make me abandon my first determination.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> It was suggested to me that as I was better acquainted with the wants and
                                    wishes of the people of this Territory than any other person so it would be more
                                    easy for me to make them Happy and satisfied with their government than a perfect
                                    stranger—to this a powerful motive of a personal and private nature
                                    suggested itself—the state of my affairs would not allow of my
                                    continuence in Congress—if I remained in the upper Territory I could be
                                    of no service to it. The territorial business in Congress was in a fair road to
                                    consummation &amp; could be easily completed by my successor—My
                                    removal could therefore be of no disadvantage—nor would it preclude my
                                    appointment to any office which my circumstances would enable me to accept or the
                                    wishes of my fellow citizens call me to—Under these impressions I thought
                                    it best not to decline the appointment but by accepting it to give myself time to
                                    look about me &amp; take the advice of my friends.—I shall leave this

                                    </placeName> it was my intention to have put the ladies under his care on their
                                    voyage down the River &amp; to have come on by land myself for the sole purpose
                                    of seeing my friends in Chilicothe. I regret this disappointment the more as I can
                                    not now say when I shall have that pleasure. I shall embrace your offer &amp;
                                    keep a constant correspondence with you—the Surveys, I lodged in the
                                    hands of Mr Newman formerly the land clerk in the war office—he is now
                                    chief clerk in that office—of this I thought I had informed you long
                                    since—a line to Newman &amp; to Wagoner the Chief Clerk in the Dept
                                    of State will effect their passage through the offices— particularly if
                                    you mention my name to them they are both my friends. I do not know whether there
                                    are any impediments to the passage of these surveys. I have lost the memorandum I
                                    made respecting them.</p>

                        <p>I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th
                                    May—</p>
                        <p>Your conquest over the arbitary faction of your Territory has given me the sincerest

                                    unexampled—I have no doubt but their Machinations have also extended to
                                    this Territory—for what purpose god and themselves only
                                    know—Unless it was intended to [do] me injury—However their

                                    it would be highly improper to give the certificate you request—indeed if
                                    I recollect well the letter was shewn to me in confidence—which
                                    absolutely precludes all possibility of my giving such a certificate to be made

                        <p>In the first place let me congratulate you upon your elivation to a seat amongst the
                                    wise men of the Nation.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> In this distinguished situation it
                                    will be in your power to render essencial services to your state &amp; indeed to
                                    the whole western Country your Knowl[e]dge of which is perhaps as extensive as that
                                    of any of your brother members &amp; from the activity of your mind &amp;
                                    the eagerness with which you seek information I am persuaded you will possess an
                                    extensive influence in the National Councils—You will no doubt accustom
                                    yourself to deliver your sentiments in the Senate, let me recommend to you however
                                    to speak seldom at first &amp; never to attempt to make a long
                                    speech—When you design to speak on any subject select one or two of the
                                    strongest arguments that occur in favour of the side you propose to advocate
                                    &amp; make use of those alone—there is not one man in a thousand who
                                    is not trained to it by a long course of practice at the bar that ever succeeds in
                                    that figure of Rhetorick called amplification it is indeed the rock upon which young
                                    orators generally split. I am affraid you will think all this advice very
                                    presumptuous &amp; it is very possible that you may be able to instruct me on
                                    those very points in which I have presumed to dictate to you —but I
                                    really feel a warm interest in your success &amp; what I have said proceeded
                                    from the sincerest friendship. Mr Parke<hi rend="sup">26</hi> left this a few days

                        <salute>Dear Worthington</salute>
                        <p>I am very much indebted to you for the exertions you made in my behalf during the
                                    last Session of Congress and altho the object was not obtained for which you
                                    contended my gratitude is not the less on that account.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me strange that Congress should think it proper to make me perform the
                                    duties of two governments for the emoluments which have been for several years
                                    attached to one of them.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> About 5 weeks ago I returned from a

                                    am persuaded I left them much more so than they were on my arrival—What
                                    do you intend to do with that Country?<hi rend="sup">30</hi> I hope that they may be

                                    are certainly not ripe. The people of <placeName>

                                    I must beg the favor of you to get a clause inserted in some law (or a seperate law
                                    passed for the purpose) to authorise the President to make the selection of

                                    arrival. I have enclosed your letter to Mr Coopland who will immediately write you
                                    &amp; enclose the money necessary to reimburse you. I would have done it myself
                                    but I have already drawn for my present quarters salary &amp; there is not a
                                    bank bill to be had here. Mr Coopland is my brother in law &amp; will I am sure
                                    be very grateful for your friendship to him</p>

                        <salute>Dear Worthington</salute>
                        <p>Agreeably to your recommendation I have sent forward a petition to Congress from the
                                    Judges Secretary &amp; myself praying compensation for the duties performed by
                                    us in the District of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                                    </placeName>. It was supposed that it would be better to try our fate first in the
                                    House of Representatives &amp; therefore the petition was sent to my friend
                                    Eppes I have no doubt you will give it all the aid in your power. I have another
                                    favor to ask of you—a new nomination for Governor of this Territory comes
                                    on at the present Session &amp; altho I have every reason to believe that the
                                    President entirely approves of my administration; the affair is of such importance
                                    to me that it would be improper to neglect any honorable means of securing a
                                    reappointment. I know that in all affairs relating to the Western Country grenerally
                                    the members of Congress from that devision of the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                    </placeName> have as they ought to have great influence. I therefore count upon your
                                    exertions in my favor &amp; be assured they shall always be held in grateful
                                    rememberance. I wish you to write to me on the subject as soon as you can ascertain
                                    what the result is likely to be. You are acquainted with our Deligate Mr Parke who
                                    is a very worthy man or I would have given him a letter of Introduction <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-047-1-077"/> to you. He will amuse you with an account of our
                                    Territorial politics.</p>

                                    be with you.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                        <p>If years have passed away without any communication between us it has not been
                                    occasioned on my part from the want of regard and attachment to you. I recollect
                                    indeed some years ago to have experienced for a short time some little uneasiness
                                    from something that I had heard. But it has been so long vanished from my mind that
                                    I have at this moment but a faint recollection of the circumstances &amp; none
                                    of the particulars. I would long since have written to you but I am one of those
                                    unfortunate mortals who procrastinate every thing that is not necessary to be done
                                    immediately &amp; which requires the use of the pen. Writing has always been my
                                    aversion &amp; the great deal of it that I am obliged to do has not lessened by
                                    dislike to it. Petitions have been forwarded to Congress in favor of the sufferrers
                                    in the late action with the Indians. I hope that your talents &amp; influence
                                    will be exerted in their favor. Nothing in my opinion can be more just and politic
                                    than for the U States to provide handsomely for the families of those who were
                                    killed, as well as for those who were badly wounded. I have now in my House a Major
                                    White of <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Shelby County</region>
                                    </placeName> Ky. altho a Major in his state he served under me as a private. He is
                                    by trade a gun smith but I fear that a wound he received in the shoulder will
                                    forever render his left hand useless. What compensation would 5 Dolls per month be
                                    to him? I know also several persons who were killed that had left their families
                                    upon land which they had entered &amp; on which they had paid one or two
                                    instalments that have no other means of making the money for the other payments but
                                    by their labour. This was particularly the case with Lt. McMahon—without
                                    the Interferance of Congress his family will be turned off of the land &amp;
                                    left destitute of <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-047-1-078"/> subsistance. Congress can very
                                    well afford to spare a little of their land to those who have contributed to defend
                                    it with their blood. What is called the new purchase above this on the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> is the finest part of the Western world in my estimation.</p>
                        <p>Whilst I was upon the late expedition Mrs Harrison added to our family a son which
                                    brings up my number of children to eight of whom five are sons. I hope that you have
                                    been equally successful. I enclose you herewith a <placeName>

                                    the purchasing provisions to be taken to the Rapids of Miami by the way of Sandusky.
                                    I have dispatched an express after Col. Buford to bring him to the Sciota. The
                                    bearer goes Express to the mouth of Kennawa for the purpose of directing the Troops
                                    there to take the route by Chilicothe &amp; Franklinton to <placeName>

                                    supply of the Troops and that I wish to see him there. From misinformation I had
                                    designated Wooster as the place of Deposit when it should have been Mansfield.
                                    Indeed I now find that a principal part of the supplies may be taken up the Sciota

                                    transporting our supplies. I had calculated largely upon water transportation for
                                    the left wing &amp; had ordered a considerable number of boats &amp;
                                    perogues to be prepared for a rise of water—the water did
                                    rise—but the boats were not <hi rend="i">quite</hi> ready. The roads on
                                    that wing are nearly impassable for Waggons &amp; our only resource is in Pack
                                    horses—these can be procured immediately but it will take some time to
                                    prepare the equipment for the number ordered &amp; we are very apprehensive that
                                    drivers cannot be procured. I have a large quantity of stores for the army now on

                        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                        <p>You will have heard before this reaches you of the unfortunate affair of the River
                                    Raisin. The Detachment to that place was made without my knowledge or consent
                                    &amp; in direct opposition to my plans. As soon as I was informed of it I
                                    hastened on to the rapids &amp; did every thing in my power to support it.</p>
                        <p>A Frenchman came in last night who left the River Raisin the day after the action he
                                    gives a more favorable account than that previously received He says that the
                                    greater part of the troops behaved extremely well &amp; would have beaten off
                                    the enemy if the center of the line had not given way. The right kept its ground
                                    &amp; never retreated—nor did they surrender until Genl Winchester
                                    was brought back with the few that were taken on the retreat. The Frenchman says
                                    that he saw 61 of the enemy dead &amp; 49 that lay opposite our right flank
                                    taken of [f] in sleds &amp; he heard Colo Babe<hi rend="sup">55</hi> say that
                                    their troops &amp; Indians had suffered as severely as ours. He thinks there
                                    were about 600 of our men taken prisoners If this be so the killed &amp; wounded
                                    (the latter being not included in the 600) will amount to 340. I was reinforced last

                        <p>From the Peculiar Organization of the Militia under the State laws the staff officers
                                    of all the Militia that are now in service are likely to suffer—the laws
                                    of the U States give to each staff officer pay in addition to their pay in the
                                    lines. Intending that they should all be from the lines. There is however scarcely a
                                    militia staff officer which has been taken from the lines The greater part of them
                                    are privates &amp; others selected from volunteers who joined the army. The U S
                                    pay masters refuse to allow them any thing but the additional pay—to an
                                    Adjutant, for instance ten Dollars per month &amp; the Aids de camp 24 Dollrs I
                                    think that it would be proper to allow them what the regular officers receive in
                                    particular the aids de Camp &amp; Brigade Majors &amp; Inspectors to receive

                                    Quarter Masters the Extra pay added to that of Lieutenant. Unless this is done great
                                    dissatisfaction will prevail amongst the Militia. I presume that those members who
                                    come from states that have militia in the field will join you in effecting this
                                    arrangement</p>

            <p>In the preface the author of this handsome book follows closely the facts and theories of many
                    savants regarding the origins and migrations of the people whom <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, mistakenly, called Indians. He holds that their stone age culture, in many ways
                    brilliant, reached its highest point in Mexico and Peru; that it spread to the Moundbuilders and the
                    Cliff Dwellers of our Southwest, and eventually further afield. However, he classifies the various
                    cultures into seven divisions of his own choosing: 1) The plains and lakes, 2) The forest and the
                    rivers, 3) The forest and the sea, 4) The mountain and mesa, 5) The valley, the peninsula, and the
                    isthmus, 6) The coast and the mountains, 7) The pampas, jungles, and islands.</p>
            <p>Some anthropologists may take issue with him for grouping the inhabitants of Labrador and the
                    Laurentian wasteland with the people of <placeName>

            <p>In Central America the Maya culture was already declining and the power of the hated Aztec overlords
                    was apparently slipping when history began with Cortez. No one ventures to predict what the future
                    of the Indian culture might have become if a major calamity had not overtaken it. The coming of a
                    people with the advantage of a thousand years&amp;apos; development in tools and weapons broke
                    the continuity of Indian evolution. The book does not pretend to be an anthropological or an
                    archaeological report. It is intended for a wider audience.</p>
            <p>The point brought out most forcefully by the author is the fact that the Indian arts are not only
                    archaeology, but a still living manifestation. (Incidentally the first exhibition in the <placeName>

                    or two others besides my wife and myself.) The Indians are still producing art in many forms, bead
                    work, pottery, rugs, jewelry, paintings, etc. Their aesthetic activity has, however, undergone an
                    evolution. They are now making things for sale with a hope for profit. Originally the Indian artist
                    produced art mostly for his own use, for his religion, for his safety or well being.</p>
            <p>The author brings out the fact that the Indian was and is, like all other people, a mythmaker, a
                    teller of tales; that his art is mostly ceremonial; that it has meaning and significance beyond its
                    aesthetic value; and that the beauty which it often possesses is incidental and due to his excellent
                    taste. He was not much interested in art for art&amp;apos;s sake, but for
                    religion&amp;apos;s sake, and for a social purpose.</p>
            <p>He attempted to personify the forces and the mysteries of nature by means of visible forms. He
                    attributed to the forms powers by which he tried to propitiate or control these forces or spirits.
                    He seems to have always known what the atomic physicist has just recently discovered, that
                    everything surrounding him, including rocks, trees, winds, has life and power for good or evil.</p>
            <p>The Indian lived in a world inhabited by benevolent and malevolent spirits or forces. So much of the
                    decoration was prayer or magic, but done with taste and skill.</p>
            <p>His pots, baskets, and blankets have a soul. So he leaves a "gate" in the black
                    circle painted in the bowl that the soul may escape if the vessel is broken. Rain was the major
                    concern of the Pueblo in the southwest. Forms associated with water and the growth of plants
                    decorate their pottery.</p>
            <p>The pictures painted on skins by the plains people were, on the other hand, mostly autobiographical,
                    historical, anecdotical, sometimes they were also protective totems. The feminine arts of bead and
                    porcupine embroidery had evolved from nature forms to near hieroglyphics intelligible to the
                    initiated, but aesthetically conceived and appropriate in decoration, line, and color.</p>
            <p>Appleton has logically arranged his book in consideration of the various crafts, giving periods,
                    locations where they flourished, and the reasons. He first takes up basketry as the earliest art,
                    then proceeds to the weaving of textiles. The <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-047-1-091"/> art of the potter
                    being one of the more permanent receives considerable attention.</p>
            <p>Pottery was made only by people who lived in permanent habitations. The author points out how the
                    decoration of pots evolved into stylized designs drawn from nature&amp;apos;s forms. Sculpture
                    was practiced also among the Indians who lived in cities and villages, such as the Moundbuilders,
                    the Maya and the Aztec. The Aztec, overwhelmed with the human sacrifice complex, cursed with an
                    all-powerful priesthood degraded to the level of human butchers, carved blood-thirsty gods part
                    reptile part human in shape, and grinning skulls with evil rampant.</p>
            <p>In the Pacific northwest region of North America, we have an entirely different culture and
                    sculpture. The Haida had their mysterious nature spirits also, but these fisherfolk were
                    "capitalists" who cared little to impress their gods. Hence their totem poles were
                    family coats-of-arms, symbols of family pride and wealth, produced to glorify their ancestors whom
                    they conceived as a mixture of man, animal, fish, or bird, natural or supernatural. They loved form
                    and carved their wooden house posts, furniture, dishes, fishing tackle, boats, or formed their horn
                    spoons into things of beauty. The Moundbuilders carved effigy pipes in stone, sometimes with humor.</p>
            <p>Next come the gold-, silver-, and coppersmiths—Aztec, Inca, or Navajo—producing
                    startlingly beautiful jewelry and the artists who carved gems from jade, turquoise, emerald,
                    obsidian, onyx, and amethyst. We follow the painter leaving his records on rocks, on plastered
                    walls, on tipis, shields, sometimes on clothes, and later displaying his remarkable talent on paper
                    in the present day renaissance. The author does not forget the last of the great sacred religious
                    arts, the Navajo sand painting and its use in healing the sick.</p>
            <p>For the main part of the work—the explanation of the whys and wherefores of the arts of
                    the several regions—the author does a curious thing. He believes that the best way to
                    interpret what the Indian artists meant by their designs, paintings, symbols, etc., is to make use
                    of the Indians&amp;apos; own tales, their expressions of religious beliefs, because, according
                    to the Indians, the origins of all their arts and social institutions stemmed from the workings of
                    the gods. Instead of interpreting the meaning or religious symbolism of each design <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-047-1-092"/> in his seventy-nine pages of colored plates, Appleton furnishes us with
                    one hundred forty pages of folk tales and sacred writ in prose and verse. In an oblique manner he
                    lets the Indian make his own explanation and interpretation. Perhaps that is the best way to have it
                    done, though some readers might have preferred a more direct approach. The author, of course, gives
                    a description of the various techniques employed.</p>
            <p>The seventy-nine pages of plates in color cover all phases of Indian arts and crafts, some seven
                    hundred examples in all. These are not colored photos of the objects done by the Indian artists, but
                    designs drawn and painted, presumably by the author. The objects from one hundred tribes used as
                    illustrations are well chosen and the color is in most cases satisfactory, at least sufficient to
                    give the reader a good idea of the richness of the originals.</p>
            <p>It is quite true that this is the first work of this type in a single volume, as the jacket
                    announces. In case that statement should be misconstrued, however, it might be well to point out
                    that a comprehensive work in two volumes <hi rend="i">Medieval American Art</hi> by
                    P&amp;#x00E1;l Kelemen, was published in 1943, with three hundred and six pages of
                    illustrations, one thousand examples, in black and white, the actual photographs of the objects
                    themselves.</p>
            <p>No one knows if the Indian was in the least interested in any conscious effort to rescue his culture
                    from the oblivion of time. This book leaves the reader aware of great intensity of a sort of
                    "underground resistance movement," by which the Indian seems to be making a
                    desperate attempt to leave a permanent record of his religion and his philosophy of life, by
                    stylized design or a shorthand of realism as a substitute for a written language, that in some cases
                    approaches hieroglyphics. It might have been desirable if the author had taken the innocent reader
                    by the hand and guided him further into the actual interpretation of this strange and rich language
                    of symbols.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Indian Art of the Americas</hi> is a beautiful and useful book. The publishers are to be
                    congratulated for bringing it out. It should acquaint at least some people with the magnificent
                    contribution the Indian has made to our American culture.</p>

            <p>When twenty-two-year-old James Wickes Taylor left his family, his father&amp;apos;s law practice,
                    and his fiancee and exchanged the security of his native upstate <placeName>

                    climate to cure a throat irritation. The future lay in the west and the reports of travelers,
                    especially Harriet Martineau, of life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, he engaged in a similar variety of pursuits. The last twenty-three years of his life
                    were spent as American consul in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winnipeg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Taylor&amp;apos;s useful career was a series of accurate prophecies of the destiny
                    of the westward-moving west. At his death his interest had shifted from vindicating his assertion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>&amp;apos;s wheat-producing potentialities (which earned him the soubriquet
                    "Crazy Saskatchewan") to exploring the possibility of an international railway to
                    Alaska.</p>
            <p>The range of interests that was to make his whole life stands out clearly in the pages of the journal
                    of his first two years in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    variety of its scene with remarkable effect. A single entry, for June 12, 1843, provides a striking
                    example. In it Taylor recounts in succession a hike in the hills "looking down upon an
                    immense amphitheater, perhaps destined to contain a million of people," a visit to the
                    first annual exhibit of the Horticultural Society, a street fight to arrest a drink-crazed Indian of
                    herculean strength, an enjoyable performance by a touring opera company of Bellini&amp;apos;s
                    "Norma," and finally a production of "Henry IV," disappointing
                    because the Falstaff did not accord with his conception of the part.</p>
            <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-047-1-094"/>
            <p>Other entries describe the visits of Lewis Cass and John Quincy Adams; political rallies, meetings to

                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>

                    </placeName> annexation, and soap-box speeches by various orders of religious fanatics. The ferment
                    of the age appears in description of the Wyandot&amp;apos;s evacuation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and of an assembly of Germans bound for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> to establish a communistic community; of the efforts of a farmer to assist the escape
                    of runaway slaves, and of a mob attack on an abolitionist&amp;apos;s shop. Perhaps
                    Taylor&amp;apos;s most unusual faculty is his sensitiveness to the daily scene, his
                    consciousness of accelerating change in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> life and his reporter&amp;apos;s interest in seeing and conveying street noises,
                    snatches of song, scraps of talk. As he falls asleep to the sound of footsteps in the summer night,
                    "carriages rattle by, and about an hour since, I heard a crier, calling a
                    &amp;apos;lost child&amp;apos; …."</p>
            <p>Since Taylor lived during most of the two years at the home of one of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>&amp;apos;s first settlers and most prominent men, he had ample opportunity to
                    become acquainted with the city&amp;apos;s social and civic leaders. He makes frequent
                    references, often astringent and doubtless perceptive, to people, some of whom are still of interest
                    today, e.g., his friend Alfonso Taft, Nicholas Longworth and his daughters, and Jacob Burnet. In
                    this connection it is worth mentioning that the utility of the volume to the researcher would have
                    been immeasurably augmented by an index; witness Frederick A. Pottle&amp;apos;s recently

            </p>
            <p>The legal historian, hoping to find in this volume details about the nineteenth century lawyer, the
                    character of his practice, his technical ability, and the direction of his influence on American
                    law, is destined to disappointment. I suspect he will wonder wistfully what was the nature of the
                    "much personal and other matter not of general interest … omitted by the
                    editor," and lament the fact that the editor took so restricted a view of the value of
                    publishing diaries. (The whole manuscript is said to be only 202 pages long and this will doubtless
                    be its only publication.) The occasional courtroom scene presided over by a famous judge, the brief
                    description of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> bar examination that Taylor passed easily, the allusion to the scant office preparation
                    devoted to cases, only whet the appetite for more information. Perhaps <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-047-1-095"/> the book&amp;apos;s most significant insight in this respect lies
                    in Taylor&amp;apos;s appraisal of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> bar, which he thought "composed of promiscous [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]
                    materials. It is very numerous but there are few lawyers of a high grade. Their professional
                    character seems destitute of refinement and taste. I see few evidences of the meliorating influence
                    of literature, either in thought or diction. They are business men—good
                    practitioners—very little removed above the <hi rend="i">drudge."</hi> Whatever
                    the accuracy of this indictment, I am confident it never applied to Taylor.</p>

                    national stature is warranted. Fortunately, Mr. Woodford always pictures an adequate (but not
                    detailed) background while focusing attention upon the statesman whom he, obviously, has long
                    admired.</p>
            <p>Lewis Cass received the final touches of his boyhood training at the Phillips Exeter Academy in his
                    home town. The author suggests that the qualities of leadership and many other characteristics of
                    personality of Cass were acquired at this time. At the age of eighteen Lewis Cass joined his family
                    at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Marietta</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. He studied law, was successful in practice, and in 1806 was elected
                    a member of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> House of Representatives without any opposition.</p>
            <p>The War of 1812 was a turning point in the career of Cass who served as a Colonel in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> militia. His brilliant record was in sharp contrast with that of General Hull (the
                    governor of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Territory) whom Cass succeeded in 1813, following the American reconquest of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-047-1-096"/>
            <p>Cass demonstrated his capacity for administration as the chief executive of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Territory. Under his guidance and through his personal efforts the territory lost its
                    isolated frontier character. The new governor encouraged settlement by American farmers by proving
                    to emigrants that the territory was a true land of opportunity. Cass handled all the numerous tasks
                    incidental to his office with great efficiency. He was unusually successful in securing treaties
                    with the Indians.</p>
            <p>Cass&amp;apos;s talents were rewarded by his appointment as Secretary of War in 1831. Five years
                    later he was made envoy to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>—an interval of six years upon which Mr. Woodford sheds much
                    light—and demonstrates that his subject was an able diplomat. After his return to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Cass became one of the recognized "top" political leaders. He was
                    the outstanding spokesman of the Northwest. He was a leading figure in the Democratic party which
                    nominated him for the presidency in 1848. (He was also an active candidate at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> convention of 1844.) <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> sent him to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate in 1845 and he was re-elected in 1849. President Buchanan made him Secretary of
                    State in 1857.</p>
            <p>It was impossible for any man prominent in political life to avoid making enemies over the slavery
                    issue. Cass favored any course of action that would avoid intense sectional strife. He championed
                    popular sovereignty before Douglas popularized that doctrine. He, naturally, was anathema to the
                    abolitionists. Nevertheless, Cass refused to accept the demands of southern extremists. In the
                    trying days of secession he counseled Buchanan to take a course of action against the Confederacy
                    and resigned in protest against the President&amp;apos;s policy of vacillation.</p>
            <p>Although the Civil War years constituted a period of political retirement for Cass in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, his influence was ever present in behalf of the Union cause. He found occasion to make
                    recommendations to Seward on the Mason and Slidell case. His active political career had, however,
                    ended and he died in 1866 at the age of eighty-four.</p>
            <p>Mr. Woodford&amp;apos;s presentation of this career is never that of a hero-worshiper. Some of
                    the Cass decisions are questioned and apologies for weaknesses are not offered. Cass is ever
                    portrayed as a man who had definite goals and sought the means to attain them.</p>

            <p>Professional historians may regret the failure to offer more detail on certain questions. The
                    intricacies of the 1848 presidential campaign are not presented. Some of the relationships between
                    Cass and other significant personalities might have been expanded.</p>

            <p>In this provocative analysis of the crystalization of Northern sentiment during the period after
                    Lincoln&amp;apos;s election and prior to the firing on Sumter, the author attempts to show why
                    the North did not permit the South "to go in peace." He holds that although there
                    was little unity at the time of Lincoln&amp;apos;s election the North became one in sentiment by
                    the time of Sumter. In analyzing this change of sentiment he reviews briefly the events which tended
                    to unite the free states and emphasizes the Northern leaders&amp;apos; arguments which made the
                    cause a crusade.</p>
            <p>Upon Lincoln&amp;apos;s election most business leaders and Douglas Democrats, as Professor Stampp
                    shows, favored concessions to the South as a means of preserving the Union. Republicans, on the
                    other hand, advocated calm and inactivity until Southern unionists had regained control and put down
                    secession. Later, after the Republicans realized that the Southern unionists would not get control
                    and that secession was a reality, they began debating methods of preserving the Union. They insisted
                    that secession was illegal and that Southern action was revolutionary. Therefore, they were
                    justified in using force. But what kind of force? They made much of the fact that they favored the
                    enforcement of laws rather than "coercion." If violence came, it must come from
                    the South.</p>
            <p>The author reviews Buchanan&amp;apos;s policy and the North&amp;apos;s <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-047-1-098"/> reaction to his timidity. The removal of troops from Moultrie to
                    Sumter, the firing on the "Star of the West," and the formation of the Confederacy
                    all, according to the author, increased Northern unity. The conflicts in Congress and the failures
                    to make any progress toward compromise increased this unanimity of sentiment. But even more
                    effective, according to Mr. Stampp, were the cogent arguments presented to convince the people that
                    disunion would bring permanent injury to them. The danger of cutting off the Northern navigation of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, the loss of the Southern markets, the difficulty of enforcing the tariff because of
                    the long Southern free trade border, and the danger of repudiation of Northern debts in the South
                    were emphasized. Added to these economic arguments, he reveals, many insisted that secession would
                    destroy the subsequent effectiveness of the Union of Northern states, destroy the growing
                    nationalism, and admit to the rest of the world that the American experiment in democracy was a
                    failure. Some hoped to win and remake the South so that it would be more like the North. In short,
                    they had become crusaders who in fighting a holy cause for the North, the South, and the world were
                    also helping themselves materially.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stampp shows that compromise was never a real possibility because the North, including Democrats,
                    was never willing to make any significant concessions; and the South was unwilling to remain in the
                    Union unless the North acquiesced in slavery expansion and in the elimination of economic
                    inequalities.</p>
            <p>This is a revealing study of this controversial period which in recent years has been treated by many
                    scholars. Although he covers familiar ground and adds little that is entirely new (most of the last
                    two chapters were previously published in the <hi rend="i">Journal of Southern History</hi>), he
                    makes clearer through his exhaustive study of Northern public opinion why secession was resisted.
                    His is a sound and objective study which is based on exhaustive and careful research.</p>

            <p>State party battles in the South during the late antebellum period were never dull affairs.
                    Purposeful or scheming politicians, of national prominence or only local fame, zealous or
                    notoriety-hungry editors, champions of national sovereignty, defenders of state and local
                    rights—all were fierce antagonists for their several causes and some descended to cheap
                    sensationalism in their ungraceful attempts to attract the public eye. And <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, during the whole of the period, through the intensity and vehemence of its factional
                    and party battles occupied the center of the Southern arena.</p>
            <p>The central theme of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> politics during this somewhat fantastic political era was the growing influence and
                    power of the Democratic party, but the Jacksonian democratic dogmas of the 1840&amp;apos;s
                    slowly merged, by the end of the 1850&amp;apos;s, with the credos of John C. Calhoun. During
                    this period of change many of the old leaders of Democracy suffered the agonies of the cross and had
                    it not been for the pressing issue of slavery it is quite possible that numbers of them would have
                    attended the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. As it was, frustrated, uncertain of what their course of action should be, and
                    despairing of saving the old Union, they became the secessionists of 1861 and appealed to the sword.</p>
            <p>But during the whole period the spirit and interests of localism and local politics guided the steps
                    of many <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> leaders. When the editor of the Milledgeville (Ga.) <hi rend="i">Federal Union</hi>
                    wrote on October 31, 1854, "while the North is rallying for the battle, we are up to our
                    ears in a petty dispute as to whether some minor Post Office at the North … is filled by
                    a man who has not, some time in his past life, advocated Free Soil sentiments," he had hit
                    upon the touchstone of Southern political life during the 1850&amp;apos;s. But he should have
                    included the statement that the South, at the same time, was just as much concerned over the
                    postmastership in Milledgeville or Natchez or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredericksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The average Southerner, during the entire decade, was more interested in local matters
                    than he was in the more fundamental and important differences between the North and South. The
                    campaigns for Southern political unity never attained their goal, even during the critical days of
                    1863 and 1864.</p>

                    </placeName> are equal to previous treatments in soundness of interpretation and exceed others in
                    the completeness of narrative detail. A chapter on propaganda summarizes for the first time numerous
                    documents that were published by the secessionists in 1860. His treatment of the forts diplomacy and
                    precipitation of war is based on a critical use of both the sources and the contradictory
                    interpretations of recent historians. Although he does not commit himself explicitly, he seems to
                    lean toward the late Professor Ramsdell&amp;apos;s interpretation of Lincoln&amp;apos;s
                    motives for the reinforcement order. The six chapters that describe the workings of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> government during the war, which include extended accounts of the executive council of
                    1862, state finances, and conscription of men and supplies, were of necessity prepared with almost
                    no assistance from previous historical writings. Not the most exciting parts of this book, they are
                    invaluable for what they tell of the activities of state governments in the Confederate War.</p>

            <p>The first edition of Professor Winther&amp;apos;s study of <hi rend="i">The Great Northwest</hi>
                    appeared in 1947. The volume was a welcome addition to the historical literature of the West, and
                    satisfied, for many, the long-felt need for an authoritative single volume survey of Pacific
                    Northwest history incorporating the findings of recent scholarship. Although several regional
                    investigators had written satisfactory state histories and numerous excellent monographs for
                    professional publications, no person since Joseph Schafer (<hi rend="i">A History of the Pacific
                        Northwest</hi>, 1905) had attempted to tell the whole story of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>, <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="idu">Idaho</region>
                    </placeName>. This book was well received by the reading public and by the historical profession, in
                    general, but some reviewers were harsh in their adverse criticism. As is usually the case with
                    reviews of general <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-047-1-102"/> accounts of history, the constantly recurring
                    theme was the lack of balance. The majority were convinced, perhaps rightly so, that although the
                    book was a good summary of frontier developments, it was inadequate on the last two decades of the
                    nineteenth and on the twentieth centuries. In this second edition the author has obviously evaluated
                    the remarks of his critics and friends and made revisions and additions where, in his judgment,
                    their suggestions were valid.</p>
            <p>With the exception of an adjustment in a single chapter title, no change appears to have been made in
                    the first part of the book on the frontier period. The chapter on the fur trade is excellent and
                    that on transportation reflects the author&amp;apos;s sound scholarship in this field of study.</p>
            <p>Taking 1883, the date of the completion of the Northern Pacific Railroad, as the major turning point
                    in Northwestern development, Winther introduces the second part of his book with a discussion of
                    railroads. The chapter, as it appeared in the first edition, has been expanded to include more data
                    on the twentieth century. A discussion entitled "salvaging the wastelands" dealing
                    both with irrigation and the range cattle and sheep industry has been divided to give chapter length
                    treatment to each subject. Recent economic developments, largely summarized in a single chapter in
                    the earlier edition, now receive ample attention: a chapter on post-frontier husbandry emphasizing
                    reclamation and large scale farming operations; hydroelectric developments, private and public,
                    including a discussion of the co-operative principle in the utility field; industrial and commercial
                    trends relative to manufacturing, mining, fishing, lumbering, coastal and overseas trade, and the
                    tourist business. Professor Winther is convinced that earlier writers on the Northwest have
                    overemphasized the comparative economic importance of the concept that the region is the
                    "Gateway to the Orient." The final chapters present evidence concerning political
                    liberalism, social patterns, and the striving for cultural and literary achievement. No two people
                    will agree concerning the comparative success of the author in discussing these topics. In this
                    reviewer&amp;apos;s opinion, the chapters on range cattle and sheep and on industry and commerce
                    are the best organized and balanced among the new sections of the book. Unusually interesting is the
                    material presented on social and cultural matters. The discourses on agriculture, irrigation, <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-047-1-103"/> and hydroelectricity are such to stimulate the inquisitive
                    reader to further study.</p>
            <p>The last half of this book could aptly be termed an introduction to the subject, and should present a
                    challenge to future students who are willing to undertake research in the field. The bibliographical
                    notes will appear high on any list of the book&amp;apos;s contributions. A speedy reference to
                    scholarly monographs on the frontier period is provided, more up-to-date and easier of access than
                    Professor Winther&amp;apos;s earlier bibliography of <hi rend="i">The Trans-<placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                        </placeName> West</hi> (1942). The contrasting nature and quality of the material available on
                    the early period with that on the last sixty years provides a standing rebuke to the so-called
                    professional historians who have yet to do much digging to obtain the factual evidence essential to
                    the preparation of a truly adequate and interpretative synthesis of far Northwestern history.</p>
            <p>There is extensive evidence of haste in the preparation of the volume. Some discussions end abruptly,
                    transitions are not always clear, and many sentences poorly written. Proofreading was not performed
                    as dutifully as one might hope. For example, on page 401 "Ferment" becomes
                    "Fermen" in the chapter heading and 1896 is recorded as 1869. Such slips appear on
                    a dozen or more pages. However, to each author and publisher must be left the determination of the
                    comparative importance of speed and perfection.</p>
            <p>The second edition is a far better book than the first. Certainly the balance, deemed so essential,
                    is there whether one thinks in terms of geography or chronology. An attempt has been made to
                    consider not only political and economic trends but the social and cultural as well. Professor
                    Winther is to be warmly commended for the necessary courage to undertake an extensive investigation
                    which was too great for more pedantic historians of the region. The magnitude of the proposed study
                    was a challenge, the end result worthy of it.</p>

            <p>Modern historians, particularly those of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, must find ways to utilize efficiently the increasingly overwhelming quantities of
                    source materials available to them. If they do not succeed in this, they are doomed to an
                    unfortunate choice between publishing work based on obviously incomplete research and devoting their
                    lives to the thorough examination of microscopic topics of little or no significance. From the title
                    one might suppose that Dr. Lathrop&amp;apos;s study would fall into the latter category, but his
                    treatment of a limited subject has enabled him to conduct an experiment in methodology that has much
                    wider applicability. Fully half of his text is devoted to the description of available federal
                    census schedules and to exposition of the research technique he has developed to cope with this
                    material. The explanation and demonstration of the method used for the exploitation of an important
                    source for migratory patterns chart a course that should be suggestive to and receive the thoughtful
                    attention of every serious student of American history.</p>
            <p>Recognizing the existence of a wealth of information concerning family migration buried in the raw
                    data showing the age, sex, birthplace, and family relationships of individuals listed in the census
                    schedules, Dr. Lathrop set out to devise a way to extract this information and put it in manageable
                    form. First, he adopted as a working formula the hypothesis that families moved from one place to
                    another midway between the births of two children in different places. Thus, in this
                    "child-ladder method," if one child of the family was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and was shown as four years old in 1850 and a second child was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> and was two years of age, it is assumed that the family moved from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> in 1846-1847. Dr. Lathrop is quite aware that this is not necessarily true and that his
                    formula does not produce an "historical fact" in individual cases; in fact, he
                    discusses its limitations and pitfalls at much greater length than is possible here. The point is
                    that by applying such an unorthodox method in historical research, and by borrowing further from the
                    statistician&amp;apos;s manual in using calculated compensatory factors, it is possible to
                    obtain significant information which is substantially accurate from sources which would otherwise
                    remain unused.</p>
            <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-047-1-105"/>
            <p>If some of our more conventional (and less imaginative) scholars raise their eyebrows at that, they
                    will be even more critical when they discover that the present study is based on a sampling process
                    from beginning to end. The child-ladder method can of necessity be applied only to a comparatively
                    small portion of the listed families (Dr. Lathrop&amp;apos;s experience indicates about
                    two-fifths), and it is limited chronologically by the availability of the census schedules only from
                    1850 through 1880. These are restrictions imposed by the source, but Dr. Lathrop has further
                    confined his analysis to the censuses of 1850 and 1860 and to approximately half of the counties in
                    the part of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> east of the Trinity River. No one who has attempted any work of this kind could
                    possibly find fault with such practical labor-saving limitations, especially in an exploratory
                    venture such as this. One might prefer a solid block of counties within a smaller area instead of
                    scattered counties throughout <placeName>
                        <region type="state">East Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, but the author&amp;apos;s explanation of his basis of selection should not be
                    challenged without investigation comparable to his own. Final resolution of the question is to be
                    found in extension of the project as far as possible in both time and area, perhaps with the aid of
                    tabulating machines.</p>
            <p>The method used on the sample chosen has produced more than enough new information on migration into <placeName>
                        <region type="state">East Texas</region>
                    </placeName> to justify the experiment and to encourage others to extend its coverage. Much of the
                    data obtained is presented in tables and charts. These are accompanied by a substantial explanatory
                    account of the "Origins of the Immigrants," with shorter chapters on
                    "Rates of Arrival" and "Sidelights." The text is concise and
                    clearly written, but both it and the graphic material require careful study. Those who give them
                    this will be well rewarded whether the volume is read for information about migration or, as
                    suggested above, for its broader implications.</p>

                    Furthermore, he has avoided the pitfall of many theatre historians who limit themselves only to a
                    recital of dates of performances or to anecdotes based on an actor&amp;apos;s experiences on or
                    off the stage. The history of the theatre of any specific period or region must be interpreted in
                    the light of the social conditions of the day. John Mason Brown reminds us that the theatre may lose
                    "its flesh and blood, its colors and shadows, its hazards and its expectancy" in
                    the pages of a book. From the contemporary newspaper reports, letters, diaries, and account books
                    the author has heeded Mr. Brown&amp;apos;s warning and has created a lively and sympathetic

               <hi rend="i">Managers in Distress</hi> serves as an excellent example of the importance of theatre
                    history as a barometer reflecting the spirit of the times. The Panic of 1837 and the hard times
                    which followed were the primary causes for the trials of the Messrs. Ludlow and Smith in their
                    endeavor to maintain the reputation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the theatrical capital of the West. The flooding of the country with specie payment
                    had its effect directly on the box office of the theatre and indirectly on the national spirit of
                    the frontier community which comprised the theatre audience. The managers had to exercise extreme
                    care in the selection of plays for an audience whose spirits were somewhat
                    "bluish." These two theatrically wise gentlemen however were equal to the task.</p>
            <p>Noah Ludlow (1795-1896) has been described as an introvert, <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-047-1-107"/>
                    stiff and formal in manner, often despondently unhappy, inclined to self-pity and a fine actor of
                    high comedy while Solomon F. Smith (1801-1869) was known as an extrovert, abounding in energy,
                    admired by his colleagues and a man of versatile talent including proficiency as a lawyer, an actor
                    and a businessman. The dissimilar natures of these two men caused many stormy moments in their
                    partnership which began in 1840 and finally ended in violent disagreement in 1851. Still, they had
                    one common bond—a sincere love and profound respect for their profession. In a community
                    characterized by a strong religious prejudice toward the theatre, Carson points out: "In
                    the theatre they saw, not merely a means of livelihood nor even just a great art, but also a potent
                    instrument for the public good, a powerful teacher of morality and virtue …. They saw to
                    it that the plays they presented were, even by nineteenth century standards eminently proper; and
                    they, furthermore did their utmost to make the members of their companies conform to a reputable
                    pattern of behavior."</p>
            <p>As a result of this attitude, Ludlow and Smith loom large not only in the theatrical picture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> but also in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> where they were connected with theatrical companies.</p>
            <p>The distressing condition of the theatre in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> during this period was similar to the condition of theatres in the larger eastern
                    cities. But even though the money was scarce and the spirit of the people low, Smith and Ludlow
                    during the ten seasons of this period presented 425 plays. They offered light comedy, spectacles,
                    ballets, melodramas, midgets, child actors, lectures and finally in 1844 such outstanding
                    "stars" as William Macready, foremost English actor of the day and Edwin Forrest,
                    already established as America&amp;apos;s leading actor.</p>
            <p>In 1841, they reduced the admission prices of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Theatre from 75¢ to 50¢ in the dress circle and parquette,
                    50¢ to 30¢ in the second tier while the gallery seats remained at
                    25¢. In 1843, they were forced to sell the theatre which they had managed since 1837 and
                    then proceeded to pay &amp;#x0024;3,000 annual rental to the new owner. They utilized every
                    possible type of entertainment often resorting to the newspaper headlines for inspiration.</p>
            <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-047-1-108"/>
            <p>During the presidential campaign of 1840, they offered <hi rend="i">The Parole of Honor</hi>, or <hi rend="i">The Youthful Days of Harrison.</hi> When four negroes were executed in July, 1841, they
                    added the Hanging scene from <hi rend="i">George Barnwell</hi> to their evening&amp;apos;s
                    program. Mrs. Inchbald&amp;apos;s farce, <hi rend="i">Animal Magnetism</hi>, was offered when
                    hypnotism as an anaesthetic was in vogue and when a local father shot his daughter&amp;apos;s
                    seducer in January, 1844, Ludlow scheduled a performance of the melodrama, <hi rend="i">Seduction</hi>, or <hi rend="i">Father and Daughter.</hi> Even as elaborate a production as <hi rend="i">The Last Days of Pompeii</hi> with new music and new scenery could not compete with the
                    newspaper columns of recrimination on the subject of Tyler&amp;apos;s second Bank Bill veto and
                    the offering received only a brief notice in the local newspaper.</p>
            <p>Still, considering the distance of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the eastern theatrical centers and the difficulties of travel, one can readily
                    appreciate the creditable contribution of Ludlow and Smith to the cultural and social life of the
                    city. In addition to Macready and Forrest, they brought other well-known theatrical figures such as
                    James Henry Hackett, Henry Placide and John Brougham. Their local acting company was unusually
                    strong and offered an amazingly varied repertory of plays. An examination of the Appendix listing
                    the performances of individual plays indicates that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> theatre audiences saw the best English dramas from Elizabethan times to the early
                    nineteenth century as well as the most popular efforts of native playwrights. Although Shakespeare
                    was the most popular playwright in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, audiences applauded their own native poetic drama as testified by the popularity of
                        <hi rend="i">Tortesa the Usurer</hi> by N. P. Willis. Dan Marble and Josh Silsbee, both noted
                    for their Yankee characters, appeared in such popular favorites as <hi rend="i">The Forest Rose, The
                        Vermonter</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Gamecock of the Wilderness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the 1844 theatre season drew to a close, Carson notes that the remaining seven years of the
                    Ludlow-Smith partnership were happier and more prosperous than the first seven.</p>
            <p>This volume adds another important chapter in the growing history of native regional theatre. Since
                    nineteenth century American theatre was not limited to the East, historians in the Midwest, South
                    and Far West will find ample ground for examination as well as re-examination in this particular
                    field. The December, 1949, issue of the <hi rend="i">Educational <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-047-1-109"/> Theatre Journal</hi> under the title, "American Theatre History: A Geographical
                    Index," lists regional theatre studies according to states and cities. Only two studies are
                    listed for the state of Indiana. One study deals with the history of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Theatre from 1875 to 1890 and the other covers the professional theatre history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The task, however, is not an easy one. Despite Professor Carson&amp;apos;s
                    excellent theatrical detective work, he notes in a reference to the famous Jefferson acting family
                    that "no one knows to this day just where their travels took this family, but the
                    information probably lies hidden away awaiting only the searching of the curious."</p>
            <p>Professor Carson has done an admirable service for the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It now remains for other historians to do the same for their respective communities.</p>

            <p>This is an account of the cities, towns and villages of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Stark
                        County</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName> (the larger
                    communities being Canton, Massillon and Alliance) from 1805 to 1874, and is the direct outgrowth of
                    successive Sunday afternoon radio broadcasts, the script for which was prepared by Edward Thornton
                    Heald, secretary-treasurer of The Stark County Historical Society. Planned as the beginning of a
                    series, the volume includes the first seventy-six scripts, covering the initial eighteen months of
                    the broadcasts. Much care was taken in the preparation of the scripts, as available printed and
                    manuscript material was consulted, the various localities were visited, and numerous persons were
                    interviewed in many cases. Efforts were earnestly made to check the data for accuracy and to enrich
                    the presentations by the use of diaries, newspapers, and even church, school, and business records.</p>
            <p>The stories of the cities, towns, and villages are introduced in the chronological order in which the
                    communities were originally laid out, with additional material being presented for the more
                    important localities as the succeeding decades are given appropriate consideration.</p>
            <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-047-1-110"/>
            <p>Much expense was involved in the preparation for this volume of photostats of the original plats of
                    each of the settlements as they were officially recorded during the period up to 1874, pictures of
                    each church known to have been organized up to that year, as well as a wide variety of illustrations
                    typifying the varying trends of the times.</p>
            <p>Thus, the material is printed so as to serve as a useful book of reference. Extensive bibliographical
                    notes and a rather adequate index are included. Within the limits of the purposes for which the work
                    is intended, a very commendable result has been achieved.</p>

            <p>"Was Johnny Appleseed a Real Person?"</p>
            <p>The question is still being asked, but one is apt to open a new book on the subject, at this time,
                    with some indifference. The whimsical fabric of the Appleseed legend promises to be too frail to
                    hold out through two hundred and nine pages—particularly in this critical hour when
                    newspapers and radio alike claim our undivided attention with news from the Korean front. The story
                    of a legendary saint in a tattered coffee sack, sowing seeds of brotherly love in the virgin
                    clearings of the American wilderness, might easily be overlooked for more realistic reading.</p>
            <p>Yet, being the omnivorous book-hungry people that we are, it is not likely that a book with as
                    attractive a format as Mabel Leigh Hunt&amp;apos;s <hi rend="i">Better Known as Johnny
                    Appleseed</hi>, will be passed up. Nor will one be disappointed in sampling its fruit: Fall Wine;
                    the Front Door; the Favorite; the Nonesuch; the Sweet Bough; the Fallawater and the
                    Seek-No-Further—all as delectable to the ear as they were to the tongue of our
                    fruit-hungry ancestors.</p>
            <p>James Daughtery&amp;apos;s illustrations clothe Johnny in virile masculinity (a pleasing quality
                    even for a saint) and one wishes there were more of them. Daughtery&amp;apos;s pencil is apt at
                    pioneer characterization as the illustrations of his own work of <hi rend="i">Daniel Boone</hi> have
                    proven.</p>
            <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-047-1-111"/>
            <p>In the Foreword Louis Bromfield says that the legend that has been growing for more than a century
                    around the character of this humble man is not very different from that of Saint Francis of Assissi.
                    Too many of us live divorced and isolated from Johnny&amp;apos;s world—the natural
                    world around us—he claims. But Johnny moves among us still, along the old water courses
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana, and in the deserted apple orchards, a friendly ghost watching over us with
                    the wistfulness of a gentle benefactor.</p>
            <p>Miss Hunt, one feels, has known and loved Johnny Apple-seed for longer time than it has taken her to
                    put his story on paper. She has handled her material with artistry and good taste, against a
                    backdrop of American Colonial history. "Was Johnny Appleseed a real person?" She
                    asks and answers the question that Doubting Thomases still ask. "Assuredly yes,"
                    she says, and in the pages that follow the kindly apple missionary emerges flesh and blood from the
                    mists of partial obscurity. The historical facts of his remarkable life have been carefully gleaned
                    from old county histories and records, from deeds and private documents, and from legends and
                    personal reminiscences. The author&amp;apos;s sincerity and good sense preserves the biography
                    from maudlin moodiness.</p>
            <p>The book falls nicely into three parts: Seed; Fruit; and Harvest—each chapter in the
                    division representing a year, or a period of years, in Chapman&amp;apos;s life.</p>
            <p>John Chapman was born the 26th day of September in the year 1774 in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Leominster</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, of good, but common parentage. His father, Nathaniel Chapman,
                    was a small farmer, one of the Bay Colony&amp;apos;s famed militiamen. His mother was Elizabeth
                    Simonds Chapman who died before the ink was hardly dry on the Declaration of
                    Independence— leaving a baby brother to young Johnny, and an older sister, Elizabeth, to
                    comfort him in her childish way.</p>
            <p>Young Nathaniel Chapman, widower with three small children, did what any good American would have
                    done in that day; he re-enlisted with the Continental Army for three years as Captain of a company
                    of wheelwrights, and the children were left to the care of relatives. Five years later he married
                    again, giving Johnny a pretty, young Lucy Cooley as a mother. The pioneer adage that stepmothers
                    were better than no mothers proved doubly true in this case. Lucy Cooley Chapman took the spindling
                    Johnny under her sympathetic <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-047-1-112"/> young wing until he was old enough
                    to "shift" for himself.</p>
            <p>Johnny was thirteen when the Ordinance of 1787 defined the boundaries and laws of the great Northwest
                    Territory. There is nothing to show that the boy had more than a passing interest in the vast saddle
                    of wilderness country that lay back of the mountains between the Great Lakes and the two great
                        <geogName>American rivers</geogName>, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. For his was the menial task then of peddling small, handmade wooden-wares of his
                    father&amp;apos;s through the countryside. Perhaps he awakened then to the pleasures of youthful
                    independence in the long walks alone, adjusting his peddler&amp;apos;s pack with an eye for the
                    beauty of the "apple blow" on the hillside orchards along the
                        <geogName>Connecticut River</geogName>!</p>
            <p>Some time after 1790, Miss Hunt points out, young John Chapman was apprenticed to an orchardist in
                    the region. He learned how to sow, to plant, to reset and distribute the slim apple switches to the
                    farmers thereabouts. But the "vision" or "call" that came to
                    this plain lad, not yet out of his teens, can not be set down, as an historical fact or incident as
                    was John Wesley&amp;apos;s strange "heart warming" experience in
                    Alder-gate—or Daniel Boone&amp;apos;s compelling hankering for pushing across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> mountains to the lonely places beyond— from his home on the Yadkin.</p>
            <p>Miss Hunt&amp;apos;s treatment of the legends that fill in so much of Johnny&amp;apos;s story
                    (when records fail) is charmingly done in Part Two of her book. In nine chapters, each titled with
                    the name of one of Johnny&amp;apos;s beloved apples, she has compounded the meat and flavor of
                    American folk tale in incidents related to the setting of the Northwest. Here is the soldier and
                    preacher; the muscular, clean limbed settler in buckskin and his wife in linsey woolsey; here is
                    Granny and her memories of back home; and Ippy, Jervis Cutler&amp;apos;s dog (Jervis, son of

            <p>For nearly half a century he had served his brothers in an unique enterprise—expecting
                    neither gain, nor thanks. All that he had asked was a place to plant his precious apple-seed, and

                    "touched" by his religion and the fantasy of an apple-flowering Wilderness. Some
                    picture as above the average in intelligence and common sense citing the host of prominent people
                    who were his friends, among them judges, and statesmen. Miss Hunt has given us the most acceptable
                    version of this eccentric character. She has made him humble, loveable, and kind. And she has given
                    him the stature of a man.</p>

            <p>Towards the close of the first third of the nineteenth century the teachings of Alexander Campbell
                    and his father, Thomas, who had come over to <placeName>

                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> some twenty years earlier, resulted in the organization of a distinct and separate
                    church denomination, which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>&amp;apos;s followers in 1830 chose to call The Christian Church. This was another
                    evidence of the continuation of the Reformation, the search for the true original manner of worship.
                    The story of this evolution, which has been most ably presented in various volumes by church
                    historians, should be consulted for information too lengthy to be included in these pages. Let it be
                    sufficient to say that this evidence of <placeName>

                    </placeName>&amp;apos;s teachings found immediately materialization in southern Indiana, among

                    families had in many instances taken first root in Sullivan, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>As to ancestral nativity the earliest settlers in both counties were generally English, Scots, or
                    Scots Irish (Scots who had been living in <placeName>

                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName>, and a few whose names indicated German origin. There was a sprinkling of those with
                    Anglicized French names dating from the invasion of the British Isles by William the Conqueror with
                    his French barons. A few there were who could have traced their ancestry to the Mayflower or to a <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> provincial governor, or even to the early nobility of Great Britain, had they possessed
                    the time, the inclination, or the facilities to determine such connections. Some families handed
                    down oral traditions of estates in "the Old Country" or of service in the recent
                    American Revolution and its aftermath, the short flurry of 1812.</p>
            <p>As for their religious heritage, there were those from Church of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> families, Baptists, Presbyterians, and others who had come to America as Quakers but
                    through intermarriage had changed to Presbyterians, then Baptists and Primitive Baptist. Here in the
                    wilderness they wanted a church as soon as possible. The earliest church in the community of which
                    Palmers Prairie in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName> was a part was a Baptist (Missionary) instituted in 1821 on the neighboring prairie
                    named for the William Curry family, the first to build a cabin there. When this little church
                    (Little Flock, a mile southwest of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelburn</settlement>
                    </placeName>) celebrated its centennial, the claim was made that it was the oldest church in the
                    county. Whether or not the original Palmers Prairie Church situated a few miles from Busseron Creek,
                    was the first Christian church in the county can be determined only if other churches examine their
                    records, and publish them. At any rate the early membership list includes persons from the region of
                    Caledonia, Cass, and Shakers Prairie (between Oaktown and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Carlisle</settlement>
                    </placeName>), and the place where Sullivan was later established.</p>
            <p>Indeed, this little record book of Palmers Prairie offers certain date problems in connection with
                    that church&amp;apos;s establishmen. An examination of the two title pages encourages <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-047-1-117"/> speculation. An examination of the inside pages discloses
                    conflicting dates. One can only arrive at an approximate date; for this is undoubtedly not the first
                    record ever kept.</p>
            <p>Below the carefully printed first page title appears in a less firm hand a date which might be 1837,
                    1857, or—more likely—1831. But it might be 1859, the date that is found near
                    the top of the first membership list, after the names of Elders John Maxwell and Thomas Nesbit!
                    Then, below that date at the right hand corner of the page are the words: "Organized Jan.
                    17 183 [MS torn]."</p>
            <p>The second title page only adds to the confusion. Above the title, prominently placed in the middle
                    of the space, is the unmistakable date, 1827. But across the top of the figures are two thin crossed
                    curved lines. Can this be intended as a deletion or as a pen flourish by way of decoration?</p>
            <p>On the seventh page from the back of the book, the puzzle becomes more intricate. Here one finds an
                    attempt towards making a summary of the original church officers. This attempted date results in:
                    "Church organized in 1831. (1827)-"</p>
            <p>We are still in the dark; but considering the 1830 separation of the Christian church from the
                    Baptist Association, we are inclined to favor the date, 1831. Perhaps the discovery of the deed for
                    the land upon which the old church and its cemetery stands, or a time-yellowed letter in a family
                    Bible may sometime disclose the truth. Whatever the true date may be, this little list of names
                    which includes those of individuals remembered to be living there even before 1831, should offer
                    considerable stimulus towards genealogical research.</p>
            <p>There are certain features within the book which point towards a still earlier membership list,
                    whether ever recorded or not. Among internal evidences is the absence of the names of several
                    persons contemporaneous with the founding of the church. Indeed, comparatively few of the persons of
                    mature years living in the community in 1830 seem to be listed in these pages. Among these few are
                    the Elders John Maxwell and his wife, Thomas Nesbit, and Rebecca Benefield, who seems to be the
                    mother of G. W., Willis, John, Sally McGrew, Susan Liston, and Mary. Possibly there are many more.
                    One name which one might expect to find is that of Andrew McGarvey, who according to family
                    tradition and that of William G. McClannahan, sexton for almost a generation <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-047-1-118"/> during the middle period, was the first person buried in Palmers
                    Prairie Cemetery. One fails to find either his name or that of his wife, Nancy Ellen, though she
                    long survived him and is likely buried in the Old Shake Cemetery near Paxton, the community of her
                    daughter, Nellie (Mrs. Whita-ker Purcell). One son of this couple, Ezekiel (b. January 1, 1811; d.
                    April 6, 1877), who with his second wife, Martha Lou Rainey (Borders McKinley) and his third wife,
                    Mary Ann Raines, are recorded in this book, is buried in this churchyard.</p>
            <p>This family is said to have come from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> about 1819 and settled first on Turkey Creek between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. The eldest son of Andrew, Samuel, lived there until
                    the end of the Civil War, then moved to Honey Creek Hill, now known as Alandale, at the southern
                    edge of Harrison Prairie and a few miles south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Both he and his wife are buried in the Hull Cemetery. Two other sons, John and James,
                    remained in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Andrew and his wife and the two youngest children, after a few years in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> came to Palmers Prairie before the church was built there. They assisted in operating a
                    cooperative store and distillery on the ground where the church now stands, bearing their share of
                    the flatboat building and operating to and from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the store&amp;apos;s interest. They owned several farms on Palmers Prairie where
                    they manufactured brick and tile, and another a few miles southeast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelburn</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Ezekiel once owned the land where Sullivan Courthouse now stands. Through
                    Andrew&amp;apos;s and Nancy Ellen&amp;apos;s brothers and sisters Ezekiel was a first cousin
                    to Russell McKinley of Sullivan, for whose daughter the hospital is named, and to the Beard brothers
                    and sisters: Felix, John, Stephen, and their sister, Mrs. Edward Roll of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo</region>
                    </placeName> counties, as well as to the Jane (Russell) Hill of this record, and her brother Spencer
                    Russell, all of whom had come from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Another cousin was the second wife of Joseph William Wolfe, early Christian preacher,
                    and lawyer from 1860, and Circuit Court clerk of Sullivan.</p>
            <p>We cannot be certain about the generation of the earliest Raines name on the record, since the use of
                    senior and junior here makes for confusion. William I (d. June 7, 1873), a pensioner of the War of
                    1812, married "Peggy Damson," really Margaret Dampster, in 1817, according to the
                    Mercer <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-047-1-119"/> County Marriage Records at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Harrodsburg</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. They were living at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, shortly
                    before their migration to Palmers Prairie when their fourth child, Mary Ann (b. February 14, 1826)
                    was three months old. This William, whose middle name was Pendleton, had a son William, whose son
                    William is still living in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName>. All these William Raines&amp;apos;s were members of Palmer Prairie Church. William
                    Raines I had also a son Allen, an uncle Allen who moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and a brother Allen (b. March 20, 1797; m. Rosanna Parker, September 6, 1821, in
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Mercer County</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>; d. April 20, 1873). The names of several of the children of
                    this couple appear on the early pages of this record. The son William Mereday handed down to his
                    grandson Bert M. of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> the almost unique name, Mereday. This son William Mereday and his sister, Elizabeth
                    Ferree, were ever closely associated with the Prairie and its church. Other sons and daughters left
                    the community. After the death of his wife, Rosanna, Allen moved in the early sixties to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Sedalia</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
               </placeName>, with his son Cornelius. There were other Raines brothers:
                    James, reputedly a Revolutionary soldier and never married, and Adam who had no children. A sister,
                    Elizabeth, was the second wife of William Patton and had two daughters. Another, probably Mary,
                    married a Hawkins. Still another, Sally, married George Plough, according to the Mercer County
                    records, June 5, 1819. This George Plough was one of the old-fashioned "bleeding
                    doctors" of the community. These were the parents of Dr. George Plough, a graduate of Rush
                    Medical College, who practiced medicine at Hymera until he was ninety.</p>
            <p>Possibly some of the Raines brothers and sisters remained in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    </placeName> is shed by a <placeName>

                    </placeName>, 1911). Much has been written about Captain John Raines who, under General James
                    Robertson, assisted towards the end of the American Revolution in opening up <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. No one, however, has attempted to discover the thread of relationship which likely
                    existed between Captain John and the Mereday <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-047-1-120"/> Raines of this <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> expedition with the Harrodsburg Raines brothers and sisters who in 1826 and somewhat
                    later moved into Palmers Prairie.</p>
            <p>Similar digressions might be made in the discussion of others of the early settlers of Palmers
                    Prairie, whose names, it seems, might be expected to appear on these minutes, if they are indeed the
                    earliest minutes. We must make due consideration, of course, to our lack of knowledge of many of
                    these families and to the known fact that the early families were divided within themselves as to
                    denominational allegiance. We must take into consideration, also, the possibility that some of the
                    earliest generation there were Presbyterian or Anglican and still held to these faiths, despite the
                    absence of these church homes in the region.</p>
            <p>The deciding evidence against these minutes as a first list of members lies not so much in the
                    omissions as in the inclusions. Some of the names which appear on the first pages of this book are
                    recognized as those who were in their infancy when the church was founded. Some were not then even
                    living in that part of Indiana or in Indiana at all. Among these names should be pointed out those
                    of Susan Ann (Benefield) Liston (b. February 5, 1824, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lawrence County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, to William and Rebecca (Bailey) Benefield) and her husband, Edmund (b.
                    December 7, 1814, to William and Nancy (Patton) Liston). Another such name is that of Susan
                    Ann&amp;apos;s sister-in-law, Elizabeth Jane (McGrew) Benefield (Mrs. G. W.) who was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName>, August 14, 1837, to Felix G. McGrew and his wife, Julia Ann Pound.</p>
            <p>Another factor which makes more intricate this maze is that caused by the repetitions of names in the
                    several revisions of the record; yet all this seems to be sufficient data to place this record as
                    one belonging to about 1859, the date which appears after the names of Elders John Maxwell and
                    Thomas Nesbit. If any whose ancestors appear in this list will search their family Bible records and
                    their old deeds and marriage certificates, much more light may be shed upon this early Christian
                    church community of fertile meadows through which flows the creek which rises in the vicinity of
                    Blackhawk and empties its waters into the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> in the vicinity of Oaktown, that creek which memorializes Major Frangois R. Busseron
                    who assisted Colonel George Rogers Clark in the taking of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

            <p>Those who would seek out this little white church and its interesting cemetery, possibly a last
                    resting place as early as 1822, will have little difficulty in finding it. Palmers Prairie is one of
                    a series of small prairies which dot the <geogName>Wabash Valley</geogName> from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This particular prairie about which twines the once exuberant Busseron and its
                    tributaries, Stonequarry and "Kittle" Creek, is situated at the near center of a
                    triangle of which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelburn</settlement>
                    </placeName> (laid out in 1855), Sullivan (incorporated in 1853), and Caledonia are the points. The
                    church is closer to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelburn</settlement>
                    </placeName> than to Sullivan, and the nearest group of houses is the little coal town, Glen-dora,
                    which had its origin shortly after 1903 when the deep coal veins began to be exploited by outside
                    interests.</p>
