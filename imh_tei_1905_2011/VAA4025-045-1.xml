            </byline>
            <p>Clio, the Muse of history and the mythological daughter of Jupiter, was one of a numerous family. Her
                    name in Greek means to celebrate or glorify which gives a clue to one of the purposes of historical
                    writing. Her statues in the Vatican, the Louvre, and elsewhere usually represent her with a wreath
                    on her brow, a scroll in one hand and a trumpet in the other. Thus, it would seem that to the Greeks
                    history was to be valued for the patriotic pride which it could stimulate.</p>
            <p>Some years ago the writer was asked to review a revised edition of a high school text by Professor
                    Albert Bushnell Hart of Harvard University, <hi rend="i">Essentials in American History</hi>. A
                    survey disclosed that this text had been widely used only in the North and West, but that in the
                    South nearly all the larger cities were using a text written by Professor Nathaniel W. Stephenson of
                    Charleston College, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>, <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
               </placeName>. In the first, Sherman's
                    "March through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName>" is described as a brilliantly conceived military campaign, successfully
                    executed by a splendid fighting force under a great general. A boy could scarcely help but feel a
                    patriotic thrill of pride as he read these paragraphs. In the second, this decisive campaign is
                    described as though it were a devastating Nazi invasion accompanied by a wanton destruction of
                    property and the means of maintaining life that brought untold tragedy to the people affected. And
                    ironically, the two texts were published by the same company! Basically, they were written, not by
                    two historians, but by two peoples living in different sections.</p>

            <p>Though most of us teach the principle that history makes the great man rather than that the great man
                    makes history, yet we seem to exalt our own craft and do not apply this principle to it. Recently,
                    it fell to my lot to give a graduate course, "Representative Historians and Their
                    Writings." After the students had surveyed the writings of such historians as Herodotus,
                    Livy, Bede, Gregory of Tours, Vasari, Voltaire, Macaulay, William Bradford, George Bancroft,
                    Theodore Roosevelt, McMaster, and Treitschke, it dawned upon them anew that an historian usually
                    mirrors the times in which he lives and that the people determine the major lines of history, not
                    the historian alone.</p>
            <p>Listen to some sentences from the Russian historian, D. Ilajavski, whose school textbooks went
                    through twenty editions in the generation of Tsarist rule before 1917, tell the story of the French
                    Revolution and Napoleon: "Louis XVI was a peaceable and gentle monarch who in the course of
                    his long reign showed himself particularly skillful in finding expert Ministers of Finance. Loved
                    and honored by his people, the aged monarch died suddenly after a glorious reign, as a result of a
                    fit of apoplexy. He was succeeded by his son, Louis XVII, who was obliged to conduct several wars,
                    wherein the captain of his hosts, the royal marshal, Napoleon Bonaparte, conquered a great part of
                    Europe for his King. Napoleon, however, abused his power and made a public attempt to rebel against
                    his liege lord and to compass his own ambitious ends. Under the leadership of Alexander I, King and
                    Autocrat of all the Russias, the general was deposed, deprived of all his honors and dignities and
                    all claim to pension. He was banished to St. Helena."</p>
            <p>As a part of a stimulating examination for freshmen one could give them this quotation and ask, (a)
                    List all the errors you can discover in this paragraph and correct each as you name it. (b) Comment
                    on this quotation.</p>
            <p>Another example may be found in journalese history. In describing the Hundred Days following Emperor
                    Napoleon's escape from Elba and his march toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1815, <hi rend="i">Le Moniteur Universel</hi>, the leading nineteenth century
                    newspaper of France, reported to its readers: March 14, 1815. "A wretch covered with the
                    blood of a million Frenchmen, flatters himself in vain that he will find partisans among them. How
                    does he dare to offer us his usurping <pb n="3" id="VAA4025-045-1-007"/> and tyrannical yoke.
                    …" March 17. "Bonaparte has dared to set foot on the soil of France.
                    Such an excess of audacity and madness has roused the indignation of the army; it demands the death
                    of a man who can no longer be regarded as the chief of the brigands. …" March 18
                    "… and what Frenchman could ever recognize the titles and rights of a sovereign
                    in the person of Napoleon Bonaparte…?" March 19. "Bonaparte is
                    advancing towards the capital. …" March 23. (An article giving a day by day
                    summary.) "From Castellane to Digne and throughout the department of the Basses-Alpes the
                    peasantry, apprized of the Emperor's march, flocked to the route from all quarters and
                    displayed their feelings with a forcefulness which left no further room for doubt. … From
                    Grenoble to Lyons the Emperor's march was nothing less than a triumph!" March
                    21. "The king and the princes departed during the night. … His Majesty, the
                    Emperor arrived this evening at eight o'clock at the palace of the Tuileries."</p>
            <p>It was Voltaire who defined history as <hi rend="i">une fable convenue</hi>.</p>
            <p>During the "Roaring Forties," with its campaign slogans, "All of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> or None," "The Reannexation of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>," and "Fifty-four Forty or Fight," George Bancroft, the most
                    honored historian of the age, often phrased his concluding paragraphs in hyperboles. Here is his
                    estimate of the American Revolution and the Federal Constitution: "In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">America</region>
                    </placeName>, a new people had risen up without king, princes, or nobles. … By calm
                    meditation and friendly councils they had prepared a constitution which, in the union of freedom
                    with strength and order, excelled every one known before. … In the happy morning of their
                    existence as one of the powers of the world, they had chosen justice for their guide; and while they
                    proceeded on their way with a well-founded confidence and joy, all the friends of mankind invoked
                    success in the unexampled endeavor to govern states and territories of imperial extent as one
                    federal republic."</p>
            <p>Speaking of the significance of the year 1763, he declared, "In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">America</region>
                    </placeName>, the Teutonic race, with its strong tendency to individuality and freedom, was to
                    become the master from the Gulf of Mexico to the poles; and the English tongue, which, but n century
                    and a half before, had for its entire <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-045-1-008"/> world a part only of two
                    narrow islands on the outer verge of Europe, was now spread more widely than any that had ever given
                    expression to human thought. Go forth, then, language of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Hampden, language of my country, take possession of the North American continent!
                    Gladden the waste places with every tone that has been rightly struck on the English lyre, with
                    every English word that has been spoken well for liberty and for man!"</p>
            <p>Professor James Harvey Robinson on one occasion used the following illustration of this general
                    theme. In order to appreciate the arbitrary nature of the selection of historic facts offered in our
                    standard textbooks, let us suppose that a half dozen alert and well-trained minds had never happened
                    to be biased by the study of any textbook or outline of history. Let us suppose that they had
                    nevertheless learned a great deal about the past directly from a vast range of sources, both
                    literary and archaeological. Lastly, let us assume that they were all called upon independently to
                    prepare a world history textbook, suitable for use in high schools. They would speedily discover
                    that there was no single obvious rule for determining what should be included in their review of the
                    past. Having no tradition to guide them, each would select what he considered most important for the
                    young to know of the past. Writing in the twentieth century, they would all be deeply influenced by
                    the interests and problems of the day. Battles and sieges and the courts of kings would scarcely
                    appeal to them. Probably it would occur to none of them to mention the battle of Issus, the advent
                    of Hadrian, the Italian enterprises of Otto I, the six wives of Henry VIII, or the invasion of
                    Holland by Louis XIV. It is tolerably safe to assume that none of these events would be considered
                    for inclusion by any one of our writers as he thought over all that man had done, and thought, and
                    suffered, and dreamed, through thousands of years. All of them would agree that what men had known
                    of the world in which they lived, or had thought to be their duty, or what they made with their
                    hands, or the nature and style of their buildings, or how they tried to establish peace, would any
                    of them be far more valuable to rehearse than the names of their rulers and the conflicts in which
                    they engaged. Each writer would accordingly go his own way. He would look back on the past for
                    explanations of <pb n="5" id="VAA4025-045-1-009"/> what he found most interesting in the present and
                    would endeavor to place his readers in a position to participate intelligently in the life of their
                    own time. The six manuals when completed would not only differ greatly from one another but also
                    from our current textbooks.</p>
            <p>In historiography there are two basic principles competing with each other as guiding principles for
                    the historian. One principle would have him mirror the times and describe events as the people of
                    the period viewed it; the other, to write, not from the point of view of contemporaries, but from
                    the point of view of posterity, lifting out of the experiences of the past those items which most
                    influenced posterity.</p>
            <p>To illustrate: In the 1880's the American public was much interested in river and harbor
                    bills. Usually these were passed through Congress by logrolling, pork-barrel methods. Today, we no
                    longer favor such methods of procedure, but instead prefer scientific planning and the execution of
                    such plans by experts as in the case of the <geogName>Tennessee Valley</geogName> Authority. If the
                    historian follows the first principle, he will give many paragraphs to a discussion of the Rivers
                    and Harbors Bill of 1883 and its veto by President Chester Arthur, but devote only a few sentences
                    to the Mississippi River Commission created in 1879 and headed by the leading civil engineer of his
                    day, Captain James B. Eads. If the historian follows the second principle, he will reverse this
                    procedure and emphasize the work of the engineer rather than that of the politician.</p>
            <p>Another illustration is found in the story of December, 1903. If the history of this month be written
                    from the first point of view, it will devote pages to Theodore Roosevelt and his annual message to
                    Congress. Column upon column of the newspapers of the time and numerous editorials and magazine
                    articles discussed his policies and this message for weeks and months. But during that same month,
                    only a few days after Roosevelt's message was read, Wilbur and Orville Wright made their
                    historic flight at Kitty Hawk, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. Contemporaries paid practically no attention to it. Very few newspapers gave any
                    account of it and those that did had only a few short paragraphs on an inside page. And yet, if a
                    great historian in the year 5000 A.D. should look back upon our age and write its story, he may <pb n="6" id="VAA4025-045-1-010"/> follow the second principle and devote pages to the story of how
                    man learned to fly during this period but pass over the story of Theodore Roosevelt with only a
                    glance.</p>
            <p>The distinguished Italian historian, Benedetto Croce, defines history as "contemporary
                    thought about the past." One of our respected masters, Professor James Westfall Thompson,
                    on the occasion of his being elected president of the American Historical Association was presented
                    with a volume of essays written by his students. In accepting it, he observed: "When I
                    began teaching we all felt that mankind was constantly improving and that there was such a thing as
                    progress which could be understood by the rational mind. We felt that we could know history and
                    understand it, and thought that we could narrate it. Today I am willing to assert that neither a
                    grain of sand nor history can be understood by the human mind. The stream of time has come down out
                    of remote ages and passed headlands and highlands. It has brought down the debris of broken empires.
                    The historian is but a fisherman on the shore, pulling out of the flood a fragment here, a broken
                    statue there, vestiges of the dead past. He then tries to fit these together and make a pattern
                    which we can understand. Is it not presumptuous to assume that we ever can understand?"</p>
            <p>Cross currents in the history of the United States in our own day illustrate the definition given by
                    Croce, "History is contemporary thought about the past." The war which ended in
                    1945 caused millions of Americans to realize how much they loved their country and the rich heritage
                    of its ideals. This spirit is illustrated by the story of a gallant soldier home from the Pacific
                    battlefront who upon returning to the United States knelt and kissed its soil. Never before in war
                    were the American people as united. Their past history has taken on new interest and usefulness.</p>
            <p>In Europe every nationality has been brought to a consciousness of its own inner unity by learning of
                    its past. The story of the common glories and common sorrows experienced by a people weld them into
                    a nation. When Frantisek Palacky, the great Czech historian, undertook to revive the national spirit
                    of the Czechs, he began by writing their history. There has been abroad in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">America</region>
                    </placeName> the intuitive feeling that its citizens cannot give their fullest loyalty to the nation
                    in its hour of dire need without an understanding <pb n="7" id="VAA4025-045-1-011"/> of its ideals
                    and aspirations as these have developed in its past. It was undoubtedly because of this spirit of
                    the times that the surveys of the teaching of American History by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> in 1943 received such immediate and wide attention.</p>
            <p>The first survey reported that seventy-two per cent of the colleges and universities did not require
                    American history for admission, and nearly ninety per cent did not require it for graduation. When
                    the colleges replied that many students' programs left no time for American history and
                    that college students brought a knowledge of this subject from high school, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> examined seven thousand freshman college students and found them woefully
                    lacking in this respect. The day after its results were published, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Record</hi> observed: "It is time for Americans to know their history
                    … a great many of us know almost nothing about these ‘woods and templed
                    hills’ and even less of the history of the ‘land where my fathers
                    died.’" Even the United States Senate considered "the appalling neglect
                    of United States history in our public schools." A resolution instructed its Committee on
                    Education and Labor "to study the ways and means by which the Federal Government may most
                    effectively promote a more thorough study of the history of the United States."</p>
            <p>The two surveys and the conclusions drawn from them became almost overnight the subject of
                    conversation among thousands of citizens, and of discussions at conventions, forums, and other
                    meetings all over the country. They touched off what was already in the minds of many Americans. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> surveys have not been so much the cause of a renewed interest in American
                    history as the result of such an interest.</p>
            <p>The Committee on American History in Schools and Colleges, appointed in 1943, dealt with the question
                    we have been considering—the selection of Historical facts. To avoid duplication of high
                    school and college courses, the committee recommended that the content of the college course be
                    altered to conform to the suggested new title, "American Civilization: its Origins and
                    Development." Such topics as the history of ideas, science and invention, cultural trends,
                    the role of religion, humanitarianism, and philosophy, education, music, and art were to be included
                    and the entire story <pb n="8" id="VAA4025-045-1-012"/> given a proper setting in the history of the
                    western hemisphere and taught from a world point of view. Should such a change not make the course a
                    successful educational adventure for students, the committee would abolish it. Meantime, the
                    committee recommended that students who by an examination revealed no need for such a course be
                    permitted instead to elect advanced, specialized courses.</p>
            <p>To make such a suggested course a success would require the "retooling" of most of
                    the professors who have been teaching the traditional sophomore course. It would mean that topical
                    headings, such as "The French and Indian War, 1754–1763," would be
                    regarded just as narrowly misleading as would the topic, "The German and Negro War,
                    1914–1918," if that were used in a national history textbook of the Union of
                    South Africa to describe African phases of World War I. In the latter case attention would then be
                    centered upon the campaigns in German Southwest Africa while the decisive phases of the struggle
                    which took place in the North Atlantic and in western Europe would be largely disregarded. The
                    proper treatment, of course, would dictate first a study of each war from a global point of view and
                    then an examination of the secondary role played by colonists and aborigines in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sa">South Africa</country>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">America</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The proposed revised course would also mean that much new material would have to be included. The
                    most widely used college texts today do not, for example, discuss the development of radio
                    communication except from a narrow, nationalistic viewpoint. They usually describe the days of the
                    early crystal sets when every American had the liberty, freedom, and independence to erect a
                    broadcasting station and broadcast what and when he pleased, if he pleased. The account then goes on
                    to tell how the resulting mutual interference caused radio listeners to demand a clearing of the air
                    channels. This was accomplished in 1927 by the Federal Radio Act and carried further by the Federal
                    Communications Act in 1934. Here texts stop. They do not interpret this development by calling
                    attention to the fact that by 1934, so far as radio broadcasting was concerned, the American citizen
                    had lost much of his liberty, freedom, and independence and had to submit to regimentation and
                    censorship by a "bureaucracy."</p>
            <pb n="9" id="VAA4025-045-1-013"/>
            <p>Current textbooks frequently feed the fires of isolationism by not presenting the repercussions on
                    America of the work of radio engineers as invention after invention permitted broadcasting in ever
                    widening circles. The only way in which many an American citizen could continue to enjoy his radio
                    and avoid interference by stations in Quebec, Montreal, Vancouver, Havana, and El Paso, Mexico, was
                    by having the United States sit down around a conference table in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mexico City</settlement>
                    </placeName> with <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, Cuba, Mexico, and other neighbors in a North American Radio Conference to parcel out
                    certain wave lengths to each. This was done in 1928, and, as a result, a portion of American
                    sovereignty and some of the free air over the United States for which George Washington had fought,
                    had to be surrendered. But in return, the United States acquired certain reciprocal rights with
                    respect to each of its neighbors.</p>
            <p>In a few decades, when inventors will make it as easy to broadcast around the world as it is today to
                    broadcast in the United States, a world-wide radio conference will again meet and through
                    co-operation among nations clear the air for all peoples of the world. Progress in this direction
                    was made at a conference of fifty-six nations—including the United States—in
                    Madrid, Spain, in 1932. In 1938, sixty-six nations met in Cairo, Egypt, in another conference. Only
                    by teaching American history with such a world outlook can we prepare our students for world
                    government tomorrow, when electricity, the internal combustion engine, and atomic energy will
                    inexorably demand international co-operation. The spirit in man's intellectual life gives
                    fundamental unity to modern civilization.</p>
            <p>Unless American history teachers grasp this outlook, then the present wave of emphasis upon its
                    teaching will result in a dangerous provincialism and narrow nationalism and bring only ashen
                    disillusionment. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in a speech to the American Congress in 1932 in the
                    midst of the great depression asserted: "In these times there is no Italy, no Germany, no
                    America, no Britain apart from the rest of the nations. There is nothing smaller than a world,
                    nothing less than a system which is crumbling around our feet." His words remind one of
                    analogous words by Patrick Henry: "Fleets and armies and the present state of things show
                    that government is dissolved … the distinctions <pb n="10" id="VAA4025-045-1-014"/>
                    between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more. I am not a
                    Virginian, but an American." That so many Americans in the past few decades thought they
                    were living in a country when actually they were living in a world has been due in part to the
                    isolationist flavor of American history teaching. We have taught our boys and girls about Lewis and
                    Clark but not about Alexander Mackenzie who crossed the Rocky Mountains before Lewis and Clark.
                    There came to my desk for reviewing one day Jeannette Mirsky's brilliant book, <hi rend="i">The Westward Crossing</hi>, wherein a continental, not a provincial, motif runs through
                    the pages as she follows Balboa, Mackenzie, and Lewis and Clark.</p>
            <p>"If you will revise your departmental course along these lines," stated a professor
                    of science, "I'll vote to make it required of all students." Especially
                    is such a change needed in high schools which do not require world history. There came to my
                    attention one such high school which enrolls fourteen hundred boys and girls but has only twenty
                    studying world history.</p>
            <p>To a member of the Progressive Education Association, the teaching of history should be more
                    functional. He would emphasize much more history of yesterday, and also regard the events of today
                    as good history, even though still in the making. He would build upon the pupil's
                    interest by proceeding from the near to the remote. To him a fundamental issue is
                    involved—an issue stated thus by Charles F. Kettering of General Motors: "We
                    spend all of our time studying the past. Now I have no objection to history—history is
                    very important, but we've been looking at the past and backing into the future. I want to
                    turn around and back into history far enough to get a good look ahead." A member of the
                    Progressive Education Association would want an area of learning selected for study, and then,
                    starting with the contemporary scene, have the students collect and master such historical data as
                    would be useful for the area selected. History would thus be fused with the other social studies. It
                    may be that fifty years from now this point will be considered orthodox.</p>
            <p>President James B. Conant of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> once reminded us that in the thousand years of the history of universities one fact
                    stands out: universities have flourished when their <pb n="11" id="VAA4025-045-1-015"/> teaching was
                    relevant to the times, but they have withered when they clung to outworn traditions and disciplines.
                    The same principle applies to the teaching of history. A few years ago, one of our great eastern
                    foundations studying successful teaching decided to use the inductive or case method. A list of one
                    hundred outstanding teachers of history in the Middle states was secured. A field man then visited
                    each teacher and talked with him, his students, and official superiors. When the results were
                    tabulated, it was found that some of the one hundred had a sanguine, others a phlegmatic
                    temperament; some were heavy-set, others had that lean and hungry look which Shakespeare mentions;
                    some used objective, others, essay examinations; some used the class period in accordance with
                    old-fashioned methods, others in accordance with new-type methods.</p>
            <p>All, however, had one trait in common: they read their morning newspaper and associated the lesson of
                    the day with the big, busy, teeming world in which their students lived. They possessed a certain
                    alertness and vital interest in contemporary life from which they drew to enrich their teaching.
                    This trait enabled them to transform the history of ancient <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Athens</settlement>
                    </placeName> into modern history. The absence of this point of view, however, would make even the
                    administrations of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin I). Roosevelt ancient history. After all, the major
                    function of teaching history is to enable us the better to understand and interpret the present-day
                    world in which we live. To achieve this end, the teacher must be wide awake and willing to work. It
                    was to this type of teacher that Charles W. Eliot referred in an address at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> when he said: "Two kinds of men make good teachers: young men, and men who
                    never grow old."</p>
            <p>To relate the material studied in history to present day life need not take much time, nor detract
                    from the essential facts to be mastered. A question, a few comments, some pictures, a sketch, an
                    assigned exercise, or a report will suffice. The teacher of history should possess a sufficient
                    knowledge of its content so that he knows what is available in the historical storehouse for use,
                    and, when all is said and done, this is perhaps the most important factor in making history
                    interesting. Today, for example, we are all interested in post-war eras, and subsequent panics and
                    depressions. <pb n="12" id="VAA4025-045-1-016"/> Hence, if we reach into our storehouse and bring
                    forth additional facts relating to the critical years after the American Revolution or the years of
                    reconstruction after Appomattox we shall strike a responsive cord. President James R. Lowell of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> once said: "The art of life does not consist in the solution of problems, but
                    in the selection of problems to solve." Similarly we may say that the selection of facts is
                    critical to the history teacher or historian.</p>
            <p>In an historically-minded age, the potential power of the wrong kind of history for evil is
                    tremendous. Loyalty to country and humanity, as well as loyalty to history, is best served by
                    looking facts squarely in the face and not selecting them to prove an <hi rend="i">a priori</hi>
                    thesis in the interest of any party, creed, system, or nation. Facts need to be interpreted with
                    humility in the hope that one may be somewhere near the truth. Important questions confront our
                    guild. Great, new horizons have confronted us, almost over night. How challenging history teaching
                    is today and promises to be tomorrow!</p>

            <p>The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1864 hinged to a large extent on the fact that the Union party was
                    able to carry the October elections in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. It was generally felt that whichever party carried the
                    October elections in these three states would also carry the national election in November;
                    therefore, both parties concentrated most of their attention on achieving victory in these states in
                        October.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> For a long time the outcome of the October election in Indiana was
                    in doubt. Almost until the very eve of the election Governor Oliver P. Morton was not optimistic
                    about his party's chances of success. One correspondent wrote from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Andrew Johnson, the vice-presidential nominee of the Union party, that
                    "Indiana may be as troublesome to Lincoln as <placeName>

            <p>Early in 1864, the suggestion that Lincoln should be renominated was being considered by a large
                    number of people. The Unionists in Indiana were divided in their opinion as to the desirability of
                    renominating him. The largest group was of the opinion that Lincoln's record had been
                    good enough to warrant permitting him to continue in office for another term. This group was
                    extremely enthusiastic for him and induced a number of TJnion journals in Indiana to declare for his

            <p>The Chase boom was to reach far greater proportions. The Secretary had been working since 1862 to
                    build an organization to carry him to the position which he felt he was born to fill. He used the
                    great patronage of his department for this purpose and also attempted to sell himself to the
                    American public through the propaganda agencies which Jay Cooke had set up to sell government
                        bonds.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> In October, 1863, Chase visited <placeName>

                    Morton, however, was unwilling to endanger his own position by becoming involved in a political
                    venture which was as precarious as Chase's candidacy.</p>
            <p>About the same time that Chase was making his bid for Morton's support, the Governor was
                    also being considered by Indiana politicians for the nomination. Once again he refused to consider
                    such talk. He probably felt that the Indiana politicians and others were merely using him in their
                    effort to prevent the Union State Convention from declaring for Lincoln. The Governor tried to
                    silence this talk in December, but Indiana newspapers continued to mention him as a possible nominee
                    until February.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The withdrawal of the Governor from the race in December

            <p>When the Union State Convention assembled at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on February 23, the Lincoln men were ready to place their state in favor of his
                    renomination. At the very opening of the convention after the temporary organization had been
                    completed, Cyrus M. Allen ascended the platform and introduced a resolution which proposed that
                    Governor Morton be renominated by acclamation and that the delegates to the national convention be
                    instructed for Lincoln. The opposition had not anticipated such a move, and before they could
                    recover their equilibrium the convention had adopted the resolution amid a tremendous outburst of
                    enthusiasm. The Germans attempted to get a resolution adopted declaring that the delegates to the
                    national convention should be "perfectly free and untrammeled" as far as any
                    commitments on the presidency were concerned. The Lincoln men were too strong and quickly overruled
                    the Germans.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this excitement had subsided the permanent organization was completed and Joseph A. Wright, a
                    former governor, was made presiding officer. Governor Morton then came forward to deliver the
                    keynote address. Most of his speech was devoted to a defense of his administration and to a
                    recapitulation of the affairs of the state during the past year. Many times he digressed from this
                    to launch thrusts at the Democrats in Indiana whom he denounced as little better than partisans of
                    Jefferson Davis. After disposing of local matters, the Governor devoted himself to the broader arena
                    of national politics. He skillfully avoided all references to the troublesome questions of the
                    presidency and reconstruction and directed his chief attention at attacking the peace men who were
                    endangering the country. He closed his speech with a magnificent tribute to the Indiana soldiers and
                    said he would refuse to sanction any party or program, either state or national, which would lead to

            <p>The convention then proceeded to the adoption of the state platform. One resolution called for the
                    renomination of Lincoln because they regarded "his re-election to the position he now
                    occupies as essential to the speedy and triumphant end of the war." The delegates to the
                    national convention were instructed to vote for him. Two other resolutions declared in favor of
                    Oliver P. Morton for the governorship and Andrew Johnson for the vice-presidential nomination. The
                    platform further declared for the "full and complete restoration of the just authority of
                    the Union under the Constitution of the United States." The soldiers were thanked, and
                    resolution three declared that anyone who opposed the government, denounced its acts, refused to
                    give it financial support, or who organized secret societies to resist its laws was rendering the
                    "rebel cause more effective support than if they joined the rebel armies."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Presumably this was directed at the Democrats. The convention continued in
                    session throughout the afternoon. Candidates for state offices were selected, as well as delegates

                    of the Lincoln men at the convention, and it insisted that he had merely ridden in on the coattails
                    of Morton, who was so popular with the delegates that anyone associated with his name would have

                    his cabinet. Now it could no longer disregard the wishes of the people by supporting Chase. In a

                    announcement of the proposed caucus had been made. The Chase men learned of the meeting quite by
                    accident, and when they hurried to the chamber they found only sixty-five of the one hundred and
                    nine Union members of the assembly present. James R. Hubbell, Columbus Delano, and John M. Connell
                    directed the Lincoln resolution. The Chase men tried to prevent its adoption and left the meeting
                    when they realized this could not be done. The resolution was then adopted even though there was not

            <p>The radical Germans presented a more serious problem. They not only objected to the declaration for
                    Lincoln but also felt that they had been slighted in the matter of the state nominations. In order
                    to pacify them General Nathan Kimball suddenly declared that he could not accept the nomination for
                    the lieutenant-governorship, and the Union Central Committee conveniently chose the German leader,
                    Conrad Baker, to replace him. Many Germans were still unsatisfied. They met with a few other

                    </placeName>, General Frémont was nominated upon a platform which was quite satisfactory
                    to the radicals. It called for the confiscation of rebel property. For many months Julian had been
                    urging a confiscation bill in Congress to provide land for homesteads for veterans and Negroes in
                    the South. He refused to support Frémont, however, especially after the General
                    repudiated the confiscation plank in his letter of acceptance. The prevailing public opinion in
                    Indiana was against any move which would endanger party solidarity. The Frémont
                    nomination was not generally well received throughout the state.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    Unionists is reflected in the apathy of their canvass during the summer. The party leaders reopened
                    the old internal bickerings, and the jubilant Democrats carefully postponed their convention until
                    late in August so that they would be better able to capitalize on their opponents'
                    misfortunes.</p>
            <p>There were two reasons why the country passed through this period of gloom during the summer months.
                    The first reason was the unpropitious military situation. The great armies massed under Grant and
                    Sherman in May had aroused the confident expectation that the war was rapidly entering its final
                    phase. By June 19, Grant's army had sustained heavy losses and was confronting Robert E.
                    Lee, who was entrenched behind seemingly impregnable fortifications at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Petersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. On June 27, William T. Sherman had been stopped at Kennesaw Mountain and the wily
                    Joseph E. Johnston was preparing to hold him in check from behind his elaborate entrenchments at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Instead of ending in sudden victory the war seemed to be quickly turning into a long,
                    bloody war of attrition. At the same moment General Jubal Early's column made a raid into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> and reached the very outskirts of Washington. That such offensive power could still be
                    mustered by a Confederacy which they had been told was tottering on the brink of disaster came as a
                    shock and a surprise to the people of the North. They invariably blamed the administration for these
                    difficulties.</p>
            <p>Accompanying these defeats came a strong peace sentiment which swept over the whole North. The peace

                    every town of importance. In Indiana, Harrison H. Dodd, Commander of the Sons of Liberty and a
                    leader in the peace party, spoke before a meeting in Hendricks County. He proposed the immediate
                    creation of a Northwest Confederacy and threatened civil war if the administration attempted in any
                    way to interfere with the activities of the Democratic party in the state.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second factor which led to the period of despondency also grew out of the military situation. The
                    defeats in May and June necessitated the issuing on July 19, 1864, of a proclamation calling for an
                    additional five hundred thousand troops, all deficiencies on each state's quota to be
                    made good by a draft on September 5. Governor Morton was alarmed at the reaction to this
                    announcement in Indiana. The prospects of a draft on the very eve of the state election greatly
                    diminished Morton's chances of re-election. The people were shocked to learn of the heavy
                    losses in the army, and the announcement of a new call convinced them that the losses were even
                    greater than had been reported.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> The Democratic leaders did not lose this
                    golden opportunity to show the incompetence of an administration that threw away lives so recklessly
                    and then blandly asked for another half million. They threatened that any attempts to enforce a
                    draft in Indiana would be met with violence.</p>
            <p>Morton's past experience with enlistment in his state proved that this was no idle threat.
                    On October 17, 1863, the government had issued a call for three hundred thousand volunteers;
                    drafting to fill deficiencies was to begin January 5, 1864. The original call was amended twice
                    until when finally issued on March 15, 1864, a total of seven hundred thousand troops were
                    requested, all deficiencies to be met by conscription on April 15. At that time General Carrington

                    refused to comply. He pointed out that his state as a whole had furnished an excess above all

                    for routine duties behind the lines so that troops could be released to deliver the <hi rend="i">coup de grace</hi> to the Confederacy. On April 21, Lincoln and Edwin M. Stanton accepted this
                    offer, although they misconstrued the number as one hundred thousand. Indiana's quota was

            <p>Morton made every effort to raise these volunteers, but in the end he was unsuccessful. The Democrats
                    insisted there was no reason why Indiana should supply additional troops when the eastern states
                    were in arrears. Even the Union papers were not enthusiastic about the calling of volunteers. On May

                    was obvious that the quota would never be met. The state was still nearly twelve thousand five

                    Morton had reached the conclusion that no more volunteers could be expected from Indiana.
                    "Vie Governor says that if more men are required they must be drafted; that it will be
                    impossible to procure volunteers, and that it would be injurious to make the effort and fail in it.
                    I think the difficulty of procuring volunteers, even for the 100-days' service, shows

                    could never be filled except by conscription.</p>
            <p>The Democrats were in an excellent position to capitalize on the situation which prevailed during the
                    summer months, but unfortunately their party was nearly as badly divided as the Union party had
                    been. There were three factions in the Democratic party: the war Democrats, who approved of a policy
                    of all-out effort for victory; the peace Democrats, who demanded an immediate cessation of
                    hostilities and peace even at the cost of the Union. In Indiana this group was led by Harrison B.
                    Dodd. The third group was the moderate group. They were numerically superior to the other two. They
                    wanted peace as soon as possible, but they were unwilling to accept it on any basis other than
                    "the union as it was and the constitution as it is." They disliked Lincoln because
                    of his disregard for civil liberty and his violations of the constitution.</p>
            <p>In Indiana as in the other states the military situation in July gave special impetus to the peace
                    element, who although they were few in number were especially noisy. Lambdin P. Milligan was their
                    choice for the gubernatorial nomination. In a public declaration he went on record as being in favor
                    of disunion rather than to continue a war which was menacing liberty and reducing his people to a
                    "state of pecuniary vassalage" to the East.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Democratic county conventions refused to accept the leadership of the peace men and adopted
                    resolutions in favor of the continuation of the war until the Union was restored. Their chief
                    objection to the administration was that its actions were unconstitutional, and that it had not
                    prosecuted the war successfully enough. In looking forward to the national convention many of the
                    county meetings urged that the party go into the canvass on a war platform with General George B.
                    McClellan as the nominee.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>In the selection of state officers the moderates once again showed their power and easily selected
                    Joseph E. McDonald for governor in preference to the peace candidate, Lambdin P. Milligan. Turpie
                    was nominated for lieutenant-governor, but he later withdrew in favor of General Mahlon D. Manson,
                    when he was nominated for Congress.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the afternoon session McDonald addressed the gathering. He officially opened the Democratic state
                    canvass by firing a broadside at Oliver Morton. He gave a critical estimate of the
                    Governor's administration and attacked his financial policies especially. McDonald
                    insisted that he was a rigid believer in the check and balance system of government, and that he
                    would never interfere with the other branches of the state government as Morton had done. He then
                    turned to national politics and outlined the moderate Democrat policy as follows: "I am for
                    peace at the earliest practicable moment; but peace on the terms of the restoration of the Union
                    under the Federal Constitution with all its rights and guarantees to the several States North and
                        South."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The party platform was another triumph for the moderates. It opened with a scathing denunciation of
                    Morton. "We utterly condemn as revolutionary and subversive of the Constitution of our
                    State, the action of Governor O. P. Morton in counselling the factious and lawless conduct of the
                    Republican members of the last General Assembly … we denounce as worthy of especial
                    condemnation the conduct of Governor Morton in usurping, for personal and partisan purposes, the
                    powers and functions of the co-ordinate departments of the government."</p>
            <p>The platform proceeded to denounce him further for establishing a "financial
                    bureau." The Democrats condemned the federal administration for its "crimes
                    against civilization," its "shamelessly dishonest waste of the people's
                    money," and for having "brought the nation to the verge of bankruptcy and general
                    ruin." The platform then declared that the party desired the "restoration of
                    liberty, and the <list type="footnotes">

                    in conclusion they said they would maintain their personal and constitutional liberty "to
                    the bitter end." The platform was adopted in spite of the protests of the peace men, and
                    the convention adjourned.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The peace men were displeased with the outcome of the state convention, and they continued to keep up
                    a steady opposition. The platform was a disappointment to the Unionists also. For weeks they had
                    been claiming that the Democratic party was the tool of the peace men and that Dodd and his Sons of
                    Liberty would dominate the convention and write a peace plank into the platform. The moderateness of
                    the platform compelled the Unionists to change their tactics. They insisted that the convention was
                    really dominated by the peace men who had adopted a moderate platform simply to deceive the public
                    as to the real nature of their party. This was apparent, they said, from the fact that the platform
                    "had not a single word to say for the Union and not a single condemnation of Jeff
                        Davis."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

                    Indiana Democrats. The platform was a triumph for the peace men. It contained the "war
                    failure" plank which called the war a failure and demanded an immediate cessation of
                    hostilities. The nomination of a war candidate like McClellan was not popular with the peace men. It
                    may have been the intention of the peace men to force McClellan to decline the nomination because of
                    the "war failure" plank. With the popular choice out of the way they could have
                    called another convention and nominated a man more to their liking. The General had said he would
                    not accept the nomination if he did not approve of the platform. If the peace men hoped for
                    Mc-Clellan's refusal, they were badly disappointed for he accepted the nomination but in
                    his letter of acceptance completely repudiated the peace plank of the platform.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Clement <list type="footnotes">

                    party. Throughout 1864 the Democratic party in Indiana was to remain in control of the moderates. It
                    was definitely a union party in the sense that its members believed in the further prosecution of
                    the war until the Union was restored.</p>
            <p>While the country was entering into the doldrums of despair during the summer, both parties launched
                    their election campaigns. Early in the campaign the Indiana Democrats introduced Morton's
                    record as a major issue. His financial policies and his usurpations of executive power were
                    thoroughly exploited by the Democrats, and when the Governor sought to defend himself they attacked
                    him even more. On June 25, for example, Judge Samuel E. Perkins attacked Morton in a speech at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Perkins recounted his numerous usurpations of authority and insisted that the
                    "public treasury of the state was in the breeches pockets of Governor Morton." The
                    Governor replied to these accusations early in July at <placeName>

                    and every Son of Liberty—every Southern spy who is lurking through our borders"
                    preferred McDonald's election. Both men finally participated in a series of debates

                    were running so high at the time that it was not uncommon for men in the audiences to come armed.
                    These debates added little to the issues of the campaign, for they were usually filled with bitter
                    appeals to the emotions of the audiences rather than to their reason. Morton repeatedly attempted to
                    get McDonald to declare his opinion on the question of an armistice and to tell what the Democrats
                    would do if the South rejected their offer of peace with union. Finally, McDonald was reluctantly

                    huge debts, military losses, and aroused the sectional hatreds of the Hoosiers by constantly
                    claiming that the war was reducing the western farmer and laborer to a status of serfdom under the

                    watch for several months on the Sons of Liberty in his state. The Sons of Liberty was an esoteric
                    society. Most of the members were Democrats who probably joined simply because they felt it was a
                    political club organized to advance the interests of their party. They did not feel that its
                    activities were treasonable or dangerous to the Union in any way. It was supposed to be a
                    quasi-military organization. The local chapters were called "castles," Dodd was
                    the "Grand Commander," and there were "generals" and other
                    officials with military titles. These positions existed in name only: no actual military
                    organization was ever carried out. The membership in Indiana probably never reached more than
                    eighteen thousand members, and most of them were inactive.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Morton and General
                    Carrington, the commander in the Indiana district, had been busy for months investigating the order
                    in their state. Their spies and informers could never gather any evidence which proved the existence
                    of treasonable or illegal action. This, however, did not deter Morton and Carrington. They gleaned a
                    large quantity of what Edgar Conkling called "floating testimony." Most of it was
                    pure hearsay, but it could be used to good purposes.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Carrington turned this
                    data over to Advocate General Joseph Holt who immediately published a lengthy report of the
                    treasonable activities in the Northwest. The document was given wide circulation in the Union press

                    except by a gross distortion of the evidence. The Union journals, however, were willing to distort
                    the facts to prove that the Democrats were traitors.</p>
            <p>At the time of these revelations, Dodd and his associates were busy with an absurd scheme which was
                    to ruin their party's chances in the election and play right into the waiting hands of
                    Oliver Morton. Dodd obtained some funds from a Confederate agent in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and devised a plan to liberate some prisoners, unite all the malcontents, and establish
                    a Northwest Confederacy. The uprising was set to take place on August 16, 1864.</p>
            <p>The plans for the uprising were revealed to Morton who immediately took the necessary precautions. At
                    the same time Dodd revealed his plans to some of his friends who quickly realized that such a scheme
                    would ruin the Democrats' chances in the election in Indiana and would also kill them in
                    the national election. They forced him to abandon his plans. August 16 passed without any uprising,
                    and the Democratic leaders breathed easier.</p>
            <p>The party leaders had not, however, reckoned on the resourceful Governor Morton. He knew that much
                    political capital could be made of Dodd's proposed uprising. This would be especially
                    true if he could link it to the Democratic party and the Sons of Liberty. On August 20,
                    Morton's men raided Dodd's office and found four hundred revolvers in boxes
                    labeled "tracts." A large amount of his correspondence was also seized revealing
                    that many Democratic leaders were members of the Sons of Liberty. The Union papers were quick to
                    give the entire affair as much publicity as possible. Two days later while public sentiment was
                    aroused Morton held a mass meeting in <placeName>

                    Democrats. Morton prepared to deliver another blow to his tottering opponents. He decided to arrest
                    some of the men implicated in the August 16 conspiracy and try them for treason. General Carrington
                    refused to arrest Dodd because of insufficient evidence. He was promptly removed by Morton and was
                    replaced by General Alvin P. Hovey. Hovey arrested Dodd on September 3 as the latter was returning
                    from the <placeName>

            <p>On September 22, Dodd went on trial. He at once pleaded not guilty to the charges of conspiracy,
                    giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and inciting insurrection. Dodd and his counselors handled
                    themselves well for the first few days of the trial. The prosecution was not able to prove the
                    accusations. On the twenty-seventh, Felix Stidger took the stand. It was only then that Dodd
                    realized that he had been confiding his thoughts to an informer. The discovery that Stidger was one
                    of Morton's men shattered the reserve of Harrison Dodd. The informer's
                    testimony was complete and thorough, but he at no time could definitely prove that the Democratic
                    party was openly involved in Dodd's schemes or even that the whole affair was inherently
                    a conspiracy.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

            <p>A steady procession of detectives, informers, spies, deserters, and renegades followed Stidger to the
                    stand. Here again no treasonable activities could be proved. In the course of the testimony a
                    sufficient number of the members of the Democratic party in Indiana were involved as members of the
                    Sons of Liberty to forge a link in the public mind between the society and the party. The revelation
                    that Clement L. Vallandigham, regarded by everyone as the chief author of the "war

                    and the society were linked and that both seemed to be implicated in some kind of a conspiracy. The

            <p>Morton sought in other ways to assure a Union victory at the polls. He asked the government to check
                    the migration into Indiana from the South. He felt that these people would be used to augment the
                    Democratic vote in Indiana. He also wanted to have enough soldiers furloughed home in October to
                    assure him a majority. Early in April, he had written to Washington on this matter. Lincoln passed
                    this request on to William Sherman who gave it a cold reception. On July 18, editor J. Bingham,
                    chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee, wrote to Morton that his party would like to

                    that the draft be delayed until after the election. Morton reminded Stanton that the outcome of the
                    national election would probably depend on the state elections in October and that without the
                    soldier vote Indiana would be lost. Stanton passed the request on to Lincoln who in turn wrote to
                    Sherman telling him of the situation in Indiana. Lincoln asked Sherman to send home some troops if
                    it could be done safely. Sherman was reluctant to spare his men during such a critical time. The
                    best Morton could do was obtain permission to bring home only the sick and wounded soldiers. Special
                    agents were at once dispatched from <placeName>

                    was not misplaced for Morton was re-elected by a twenty thousand majority, the state legislature was
                    also captured, and the Union party carried eight of the eleven congressional seats. This sparkling
                    victory was achieved without a postponement of the draft and with far less than the fifteen thousand

            <p>The Union campaigners did not relax for a moment. Important speakers were brought into the state. A

                    treason trials began so that the voters would be reminded just in case they had forgotten the
                    revelations of the Dodd trial.</p>
            <p>On November 8, Lincoln carried the state by a twenty thousand majority over McClellan. He had made
                    some slight gains over the voting in 1860, and his party made a complete recovery after its heavy
                    losses in the election of 1862. The October election was a complete vindication of
                    Morton's administration, and the November election proved that Lincoln still had a real
                    "hold on the affections and confidence of the people."<hi rend="sup">69</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The state elections in October had been long and bitter, but in the end the Union party emerged
                    victorious in each of them. These triumphs were a favorable omen for the outcome of the national
                    election in November. Lincoln was re-elected largely because of three factors: (1), the military
                    victories at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Mobile in September; (2), the Union party victories in the October state elections;
                    and (3), the successful application of the charge of domestic treason to the Democratic party. Thus
                    in the election of 1864 the role of Indiana was very important. She was one of the most critical of
                    the October states, and Governor Morton had greatly facilitated the development of the treason issue
                    by his attack on the Sons of Liberty and Harrison Dodd.</p>

            <p>Although Indiana is well known as the birthplace and home of more famous writers than almost any
                    other Midwestern state—Edward Eggleston, Lew Wallace, James Whitcomb Riley, and Theodore
                    Dreiser, to mention only a few,—individuals seldom realize that numerous
                    nineteenth-century British and American authors were guests of Hoosierdom and wrote historically
                    important impressions of their visits. At least twenty-nine significant writers not natives of the
                    state touched the borders of, passed through, toured, or lectured in Indiana during the last
                    century. This number may not be so large as several eastern states might boast, but
                    Indiana's central location between the Atlantic Coast and the West was, nevertheless,
                    advantageous in bringing within her borders people who were traveling across the country. Most of
                    the writers were attracted by the scenery of the wilderness and were curious about the inhabitants;
                    in general, the Americans were more interested in the aspects of nature, while the English were more
                    intent on studying manners and morals. Seldom was either one concerned with economic conditions. Not
                    the least of the English authors' purposes was to earn money by lecturing and writing;
                    they became piqued when they were poorly received and often stayed for too short a time to obtain
                    accurate impressions. On the other hand, the Americans traveled primarily to see the West and visit
                    friends and relatives. Their opinions were, therefore, in the main more accurate.</p>
            <p>Before frontier civilization had advanced far enough to receive the attention of eastern and European
                    literati, numerous writers of travel narratives, diaries, and letters sojourned in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>An important early British literary figure to visit Indiana was Robert Owen, the reformer, who bought
                    approximately twenty thousand acres of land from the Rappite religious sect and on the

                    communistic plans. On July 17, 1825, he embarked at <placeName>

                    differences about the form of government and religion shortly arose, the experiment was concluded in

                    ground at a time. The primaeval forest still occupies a considerable portion of the ground, and
                    hangs in solemn grandeur from the cliffs; but it is broken by frequent settlements, where we were
                    cheered by the sight of herds and flocks. … Often a mountain torrent comes pouring its
                    silver tribute to the stream, and were there occasionally a ruined abbey, or feudal castle, to mix
                    the romance of real life with that of nature, the <placeName>

                    back woods of Indiana was by no means agreeable, but I screwed my courage to the proper pitch, and
                    set forth." What she saw there were campfires and numerous tents in which people prayed,
                    called aloud to Christ, and sobbed. She wrote that at midnight public worship began and that the
                    preachers incited the people to squirm on the ground as if in convulsions but added that a very
                    satisfactory collection was taken.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Her business venture in <placeName>

                    was eager to experience pioneer life, she toured Door Prairie en route to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> early in the summer of 1836. She and her party traveled by carriage from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. They, therefore, remained with a hospitable farmer and family that night; Miss
                    Martineau noted that his estate consisted of eight hundred acres and had cost him $1.25
                    per acre. His house was made of logs and contained three rooms.</p>
            <p>The next day her party jolted onward across the prairie. A washout forced them and some obliging
                    settlers to build a bridge so their coach could cross a rampant stream. Miss Martineau described <placeName>

                    swamps. Here for the first time she saw Lake Michigan, and she wrote about it enthusiastically.
                    After an evening meal of pork, bread, potatoes, preserves, and tea, the party took a walk. She
                    noticed the wild flowers and insects on the way and gave a poetic description of the sunset and the
                    return. "We walked briskly home, beside the skiey sea, with the half-grown moon above us,
                    riding high."</p>
            <p>The journey continued the following day, and another bridge had to be built. The party spent that

            <p>More and more authors visited Indiana as the century progressed. Bayard Taylor passed through the

                    platform because of need for money. During his 1854–1855 lecture season, he made one
                    hundred twenty-eight separate appearances, asking fifty dollars for each of them. He spoke at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in April, 1854. The subject matter of his talks varied. He discussed culture
                    and the differences between Europeans and Americans, warned against excessive emotion in literature,
                    and adversely criticized the South, which he believed would eventually have to be broken by

                    pleasure," he answered with his typical wit, "but I have not, as yet, found any
                    Americans. There are English, French, Danes, and Spaniards in <placeName>

                    this country during the nineteenth century. At dinner with the governor and his family, Wilde ate
                    greedily. <hi rend="i">The Saturday Review</hi> reported that when he was introduced to ice cream he

            <p>The preceding long array of literary visitors to Indiana during the nineteenth century shows that
                    even during frontier days the state was not without cultural activities. Undoubtedly, the presence
                    of these celebrated figures helped encourage Hoosier interest in literature and stimulated a certain
                    amount of native talent. Although several writers were rather dismayed by the crudities of the
                    wilderness, if they could visit it now, they would see what forward strides it has taken; for,
                    indeed, it has grown from a region where well-known writers have visited to a state where almost
                    equally important ones have been born, live, and work.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>Wherever the Indian and the white man came into contact with each other, as American settlements
                    marched progressively westward, many problems of conflict arose. The inroads of the pioneers into
                    Indian lands were by no means appreciated and often led to trouble. There was ample precedent for
                    Indian suspicion of the Americans. Past experience with the Spanish, French, and English beggared
                    comprehension of the ways of the white man and of his civilization.</p>
            <p>The incongruity, the variance, and the incompatibility of the ways of the two groups led to much
                    misapprehension and misunderstanding. The white man was convinced of the inevitability of his
                    progress westward. The Indian was not thusly convinced but was determined to hinder, to terminate,
                    and, if possible, to turn back these encroachments on his lands.</p>
            <p>The development of the policy of the United States has been an evolutionary one that has looked upon
                    the Indian in turn as a conquered foe, a subject, and a ward. What to do about the indigenous Indian
                    living on and having title to the lands which he coveted, was the immediate problem facing the
                    frontiersman and his government. The reciprocal depredations of the one against the other led many a
                    pioneer to conclude that "the only good Indian is a dead Indian." Others were more
                    humanitarian and directed their efforts to the assimilation of the Indians believing it to be merely
                    a matter of time until they would satisfactorily have acquired the "arts of
                    civilization."</p>
            <p>While the government was party to both extirpation and humanitarianism, its general policy was one of
                    extinguishing Indian titles to lands by negotiated treaties. These treaties made no provisions for
                    new homes for the displaced Indians, and, except for reservations made within the ceded lands by
                    some of the treaties, they were pushed westward treaty by treaty. This policy was gradually changed
                    and <list type="footnotes">

                    stipulated annuity and other trifles, the removal policy provided for an exchange of lands. A treaty
                    would grant to a tribe a tract of government land west of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>
                    and the means of transportation to that tract in exchange for the lands of that tribe that were east
                    of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>.</p>
            <p>As early as February, 1803, Thomas Jefferson, in discussing Indian affairs with William Henry
                    Harrison, indicated that he would look with favor upon a removal policy to territory beyond the
                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. This was before the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Purchase had been made. This, as he saw it, was the only alternative the Indians would
                    have to incorporation "with us as citizens of the US.," and it should be
                    accomplished peacefully. "Should any tribe be fool-hardy enough to take up the hatchet a[t]
                    any time," he added somewhat parenthetically as a corollary to the removal policy,
                    "the siezing <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> the whole country of that tribe &amp; driving
                    them across the Missisipi, as the only condition of peace, would be an example to others, and a
                    furtherance of our final consolidation."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    made to Albert Gallatin a few months earlier. "I think it will be safer," he

                    "in case the said tribes shall remove and settle thereon." A sum of several

            <p>Generally speaking little was accomplished in the next decade and a half to put the removal policy
                    into effect. The practice of extinguishment of Indian ownership to land was carried on by the
                    negotiation of treaties with tribes both individually and collectively. Not until Andrew Jackson
                    became President was the removal plan actively used. By an act of May 28, 1830, the President could
                    specify districts west of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> for tribes that might choose to
                    remove there in exchange for the lands to which they held title. The government would aid and assist
                    these tribes to remove to, and to settle in, districts on the other side of the
                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> While Jackson was chiefly
                    interested in removal of the southern Indians, some attention was given to those tribes north of the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. In 1832, a Congressional appropriation was made for the express

            <p>By treaties of 1832, 1834, and 1836, the Potawatomi of Indiana ceded their lands within the state. By
                    the 1836 treaties they agreed, within a period of two years, to yield possession and remove, at
                    government expense, west of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. In 1838, at the end of the
                    two-year period, they were quite reluctant to leave, and after the white squatters threatened a
                    showdown they were forcibly gathered together for removal.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The story of the

                    correspondence preserved in The William Polke Collection. The letters of Father Benjamin M. Petit,
                    who accompanied the emigration as a missionary, give a vivid description of the removal from Indiana

                    Plans and efforts came to nought, however, as the panic of 1837 spread westward and began to affect
                    the banks of Indiana in the fall of 1839 so that funds were no longer available to carry out the

                        <p>This moment yours of the 29 inst has been received—In reply I have to
                                    state that as yet I am not furnished with any instructions relating to the removeal
                                    of the Potowatamis—but I am to be furnished with instructions reletive to
                                    that matter so soon as I am enabled to say that a portion of those Indians are
                                    willing to go, snd to designate the time &amp;c. I would be pleased to be
                                    posessed with all the information you have on the Subject—You are aware
                                    that it is the object of the Government to remove the whole of the Indians on this
                                    side of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                                    </placeName> to the west of that River—and that the sooner that object
                                    can be affected the bettre <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> for the Indians—I
                                    consider it, a grate and benevolent object and worthy of the exertions of the wisest
                                    and best of our citizens—and in as much as it, (so far as relates to our
                                    Indians), is to be placed under my superintendence and I will glady avail myself of
                                    the aid you tender me</p>
                        <p>Allow me to say that so soon as I am able to say to the department, that a party
                                    worth going with, is willing to go, that the authority, and instructions will be
                                    given to take them to their new homes—and they can [illegible] git
                                    n[e]ither them annuities nor supp[l]ies of any discription in this State, here they
                                    have no homes, and it is necessary for their own good, that they remove—I
                                    have mad no engagements nor given any promise to any one relative to aiding in
                                    removing the Indians it is a matter that requirs deliberation—the
                                    applications are numerous no engagements will be made untill we can settle the time
                                    for Action —I have authorised no one to talk to the Indians on the
                                    subject of emigration and wish to see them myself—and so soon as they
                                    decide to go, I calculate to visit them at their residences or at such place as they
                                    may convene—</p>

                                    unhappy people it was this view of the subject that first made me interested in the
                                    Removal of the Indians and caused me to turn my attention to the subject, in my
                                    Intercourse with the Indians the last few years from the Numerous Inquiries of the
                                    Indians to me on the subject of the Removal I have but little Doubts but the most of
                                    them can be Induced to consent to Remove the present season Indeed they are making
                                    preparations for it Wewissah a Chief who Removed last year with the party and who

                                    I could not tell but whenever they were Ready to go the their great father would

                                    An Emigrating party is so totally Different from any thing that I was ever engaged
                                    in that many little Regulations of police may be Introduced which will lessen both

                        <salute>My Dear Sir</salute>
                        <p>I have just written to Gen Milroy to obtain a situation under him as assistant in
                                    Removing the Indians West, I also understand that you are an applicant for the same
                                    situation and let me assure you there is no man I am acquainted with that I would go
                                    in Stronger for in almost any case than I would for you except myself and further I
                                    do not pretend to claim the talent for the discharge of that business that you
                                    possess, for many reasons, and so have I represented you to Genr. Milroy as my
                                    friend &amp; well wisher, and have requested the Genr. to show you my letter,
                                    not fearing what you <hi rend="i">"would</hi> say <hi rend="i">in relation
                                        to me"</hi> Now there is one subject that I wish to mention and one
                                    favor I wish to ask, that is that I am poor and have great need at this time of some
                                    assistance, You are well off my Old Friend and can very well live without it, I
                                    really wish you to think of these things, Knowing that you always have as near as
                                    you could done to others as you woud have them to do to you, and I am convinced from
                                    what I have seen that such will be your course towards me I have nothing further to
                                    say at this time, only that you will do justice to your own feelings and the result
                                    of such course I am sure will not be injurious to my feelings</p>

                        <p>I have received at last full authority to move the Potowatomy Indians—so
                                    soon as one Hundred or upwards can be raised I am authorised to cause them to be
                                    conducted to a Rendezvous—at which place the[y] will receive the
                                    necessary Rations and a necessary supply of clothing—nothing like force
                                    is to be used they must come volunt[a]rily for to the Randozvous—Be so
                                    oblidging as forthwith on the receipt of this to let me know whether a party can in
                                    your opinion be organized in time to avoid the cold weather I am extremly desirous
                                    of sending of a party late as it is in the season—</p>
                        <p>The clothing for present use food from the leave their <hi rend="i">wigwams</hi> to

                                    at their new home it would seem to me to be strong inducements to these people in
                                    their present situation One Hundred is sufficient to form an emigration
                                    party—Rut I should much rather have more pleas write as soon as you

                                    Reevd Instructions on the subject of the Removal of the Puttawattimes I with you
                                    much Regret that Instructions had not been earlier Received as in that case I have
                                    no Doubts a good emigrating Party might hav[e] been attained I am still of opinion a
                                    party can be had amounting to 100 or 120 and late as it is in the seaso[n] I thinke
                                    it will be less Expence to the government than for them to Remain here as from thier
                                    situation their case will be Desparate and I am fearful unpleasant collisons will
                                    arise between the settlers and Indians I would suggest the propriety of your making
                                    one visit as early as practicable in order to consult with them on the Business it
                                    might be appointed at or near where I now live as a centreal point between the

                        <p>A deputitions of the Potowatomis have been to visit me—with Pash-po<hi rend="sup">28</hi> at their head Mr Barson<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Mr
                                    Robb—and Mr Trucky<hi rend="sup">30</hi> were with them—and
                                    they have given me assurences that they can raise a party of seventy at this late
                                    period—and are disposed to emigrate—they say the[y] have the
                                    winter to endure and they may as well be on they way as any where else—If
                                    on the receipt of this—you also are disposed to go as conductor, on the
                                    terms we spoke of—and a party of the number you above spoken of can be
                                    obtained—you are hereby authorised to take the most prompt measures for
                                    forwarding them here, and every thing shall be ready for continuing th[e]ir
                                    Journey—without any delay—I have given orders to Mr Taber, to
                                    furnish them with blankets—who are here, and will have blankets and other
                                    clothing ready for them when they arrive here—those here will receive
                                    their blankets on their return home—</p>
                        <p>The regulations require that not to exceed 1500 Ibs be taken for every 50
                                    persons—we will not be too particular on this subject, but must conform
                                    as near as may be posible to the regulations—something like or near that
                                    proportion will regulate the transportation of baggage—I suppose five two
                                    Horse teams—will easy convoy th[e]ir bagage—as to officers I
                                    shall leave it very much to you—and will do with as few individuals as
                                    can be got along with—If on the whole you conclude that it is imposible
                                    to go at this late season of the year—you will so inform the
                                    Indians—and request them to hold themselves in readyness for an early
                                    emigration in the spring If however you think it practacticab[le] <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> to go—you will be so good as to take measures for furnishing
                                    them with provisions on the route to this place for which your vouchers will be
                                    duely honoured and from hear a Commisary will be appointed—I have by this
                                    oportunity written to Mr Hamilton to hold himself subject to you orders—</p>

                        <salute>Dr Sir</salute>
                        <p>I wrote you yesterday by Mr Robb I again address you least something may not be
                                    sufficiently understood—I have informed the Indians that none but them
                                    that would actually emigrate should under any pretence whatever have
                                    provisions—and that none should be allowed to have a pound of Government
                                    provisions unless enrolled to emigrate—and that Government would under no
                                    pretence give provisions or articles of clotheing to those who were not disposed to
                                    emigrate—this you will please make known to all the
                                    Indians—and the gre[a]test care must be taken that none enroll to go with
                                    the intention of obtaining provisions &amp;c Ewing and his emisaries are at
                                    work and every fraud will be attempted—</p>
                        <p>I am of opinion that Robb is not to be depended on—and have informed him
                                    that you would be required in the strictest manner to dismiss every man that would
                                    git drunk—I have been told he was drunk when you and me was calculating
                                    on him for public service of the most important character Drunkards in no instence
                                    will be permitted to remain in public employ—the bad example is a
                                    sufficient reason for the enforcement of this regulation—</p>
                        <p>Dr. Sir. I rely on your judgement and discration in all that relates to starting this
                                    handful of Indians so late in the season—The reasons that induced me to
                                    accept of a less emigration than one Hundred is that this party—has been
                                    relying on emigrating and have not made the provision for winter that otherwise they
                                    would have done—and If I would refuse to send them when they are desirous
                                    of going it would most probably be injurious as to future
                                    operations—The[y] say truely the[y] have the winter to endure and if
                                    going they will be clothed for it, if not they are without clothing as well as

                        <p>I have ventured to give those that came to see me blankets. I trust I may not be
                                    cheated by them—we have risks to run with these people—I
                                    calculate to be ready in all respects to send them on very soon on their being
                                    brought hear—a dificulty had like to have arrisen with these people
                                    the[y] pretended to believe that I would furnish wagons to carry all thier plunder
                                    at that rate it would have required a Wagon for every family or man—you
                                    know the regulations and we must conform to them as near as may be as well as
                                    convaying their Bagage to the Randazvous as on the route such deviations as
                                    discretion and prudence would dictate may be made as to transporting their household
                                    stuf hear but from here the regulations must be strictly observed and I have so told
                                    them and it will be proper to so inform them on all occasions—I say to
                                    them that the Government invites them to go on the most liberal terms. While we
                                    would gladly accept half such good terms—if they accept it is well, they
                                    will solicit to be taken before they are again invited—and I hesitate not
                                    to say that as good terms will not again be offered—I hope if they
                                    Indians go it will suit you to go with them we need your experience and your age
                                    will command respect use your discretion as to sending a messenger to let me know as
                                    to the starting of the party and when to look for them if they go—</p>

                        <salute>Dr Sir</salute>
                        <p>After the party of Indians left my house having letters to you from me relative to an
                                    emigration—I went into Delphi and the first news that met me was the <hi rend="i">Bank Suspension</hi>—from which I think it indispensiblc to
                                    wait the orders of the department relative to funds for the proposed emigration. My
                                    instructions did not authorise me to anticipate the Department as to procuring of
                                    funds—tho' for the purpose of sending these people a way who
                                    were so desirous of going I should have done so—but now as the Banks have
                                    all Suspended and suspending specie payments<hi rend="sup">31</hi>—I have
                                    determined to wait the orders of the Department and be strictly governed by my
                                    instructions which is as follows Viz "Funds will be placed in your hands
                                    for the emigration whenever this office shall be informed that they will be wanted
                                    upon reasonable calculation" I am making out this cal[c]ulation, or <list type="footnotes">

                                    Department for an emigration of one Hundred Indians—and so soon as the
                                    funds are received, then if the Indians are still disposed to go, an effort will be
                                    made to send them, not with standing the effort of the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> people—doubtless under the present circumstances you will
                                    think with me—that it is altogether necessary to allow the Department to
                                    furnish the funds as they have promised to do—if the funds are not needed
                                    they need not be drawn from the public depository—I therefore have to
                                    request that you will take such means as you find most convenient to require the
                                    Indians that were disposed to emigrate to hold on for the present, untill funds are
                                    obtained from the Goverment—The funds were and are obtaineable but they
                                    would be in Bank paper—that might become unavaileable on our
                                    hands—You will as requested in my former letter pleas certify the
                                    services of the individuals employed by you to communicate inteligence to the
                                    Indians, as also your own time so employ—as also the ammount of
                                    provisions furnished to the Indians —and a requisition will be made for
                                    the money—to pay the expense I am rather of opinion, Robbs account is
                                    larger as he give it to me, I presume he was drunk a part of the time—</p>
                        <p>You will again hear from me shortly—If it could be ascertained that any
                                    other mode than that adopted by the Government as to sending away the Indians would
                                    be more effecatious or cheaper—I certainly would favour it, and heartily
                                    recommend it to the Government, whether it was by <hi rend="i">Contract</hi> or any
                                    other way—the object is to git the Indians away and if the <placeName>

                                    proper—I care not who moves the Indians, so it be done

                                    propriety of emigrating—and I cannot doubt but the conciliatory measures
                                    enjoined in my instructions will effect much more with these people than measures of
                                    an opposit caracter—for a further view of the proceedings I herewith
                                    transmit extracts from the letters and also the Journal of Judge Polk, which he has
                                    forwarded to me—from these it will be seen, that when a party was
                                    assembled sufficient to warrint their organization, some of those individuals
                                    resident at <placeName>

                                    emisaries amongst them with the civil off[i]cers, and arrested some for debt, and
                                    frightened others to the woods. this would not have occasioned but the postponement
                                    of a few days, had I been furnished with funds to have proceeded according to my
                                    calculation, I had contemplated to have obtained an accomidation on some terms in
                                    Bank, by selling a draft or otherwise for which I had been making araingcmcnts. when
                                    the news of the Rank Suspension reached us, I then conceived it improper to receive
                                    nank paper the value of which was wholely uncertain for Goverment funds—I
                                    was therefore forced to adopt the course of Sending <hi rend="i">them</hi> to their
                                    hunting camps; until further—This party is now prepaired to Start West,
                                    at any time it may be deemed expedient to Send them—Rut I have concluded
                                    in conformity with the opinion of Judge Polk that it would be most proper not to
                                    start an emigration before the opening of the spring when a much larger emigration
                                    can be obtain[ed] than at present—for my Self I doubt not but with proper

                                    and charity call imperiously for the adoption of the course suggested by Mr. Polk to
                                    give limited or rather indispencible supplies to these people for the winter with

                                    their accrueing annuities—this policy of course as reccomended by Mr.
                                    Polk will take them from under the influence of those villinous traders that have
                                    always stood in opposition to the views of the Goverment in this
                                    matter—and place them at once under the guardianship of their natural
                                    protectors the Goverment—I have taken the responcibility though
                                    unauthorised to order a very limited amount of supplies as has Judge Polk as will be
                                    seen by the extract from his letter herewith transmitted—which I trust
                                    the department will approve—and authorise payment—if otherwise
                                    Mr Polke and myself must be the loosers—You will also see that Mr Polk
                                    was constrained to becom security for Pash-po a chief of the party that proposed to
                                    emigrate to have him liberated from prison where he was confined for a debt
                                    contracted for supplies for his people—which supplies was necessary to
                                    enable them to hunt—for food for their families—if the payment
                                    refered to be authorised in every instance bills of particulars with prices
                                    anexed[?] will will <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> be furnished so that no fraud or
                                    deception can be practiced on either the Goverment or the Indians—I will
                                    feel prepared to say that a liberal policy pursued towards these Indians such as is
                                    here suggested will do more as to their removal than any other course whatever that
                                    can be proposed—Under present circumstances it will not be necessary to
                                    furnish funds as required in a former communication to the department for emigration
                                    as it is to be pre-summed that an emigration can not now start until spring But it
                                    is extreamly desireable that funds be remitted to pay the expences incured</p>

                                    hundred [?] as there is a District of country in which there was a good oak most and
                                    Deer is there collected in abundance I think the proper course to be pursued in of
                                    so much Importance that before I goe we undertake the Business I had better have a

                                    We cannot so well do arrange the plan by a Correspondence in which Case when which

                        <p>in Respect to mr Barrons Case I entirely agree with you that he cannot be trusted for
                                    anything or Relyed upon as Interpeter and were he away from the Indians we could do
                                    Better with out him hut situated as he is among them he could do much mischi[e]f

                        <salute>Dr Sir</salute>
                        <p>It may not be improper to inform you that at this time Mr Barron and a party of the
                                    Potewatomies are hear, and as usual the object of this old man is to obtain
                                    something that the Department will not authorise—Pash-po is of the
                                    party—I read the letter to them that is herewith sent to you, so that
                                    they are informed—that they are not to be furnished with supplies for the
                                    winter—Old man Barron, and Pash-po, has had a violent
                                    quarrel—Pash-po accuses Barron with <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-045-1-082"/>
                                    appropriating the grater part of the goods that Vigus<hi rend="sup">40</hi> sued
                                    for, and imprisoned Pash-po for, to his own use. Old Barron as a matter of course
                                    denies it, the truth I doubt not is that Barron appropriated art] least a part of
                                    the goods to his own use—it is his nature so to do—I have came
                                    to the conclusion that it is too uncertain a buisiness to depend on this old man as
                                    interpreter, in making up the emigration, he will tell his own story and not that of
                                    those for whom he interprets—I will not yet say he ought to be
                                    dismised—but an other such deception or so, such as he has been caught at
                                    will procure that <hi rend="i">result</hi>—He may answer as interpreter
                                    on the route of <hi rend="i">emigration</hi>—but it would be very
                                    uncertain to employ him as a home interpreter more of this when I see
                                    you—I think it possible that we will obtain the payment of Pashipo debt
                                    but it was unfortunate that Barron and him got to quarrelling as to which had the
                                    use of the goods if it was intended to the Department, that the entire goods or any
                                    part of them had went to other, than the Potowatomies it would effectually defeat
                                    the payment of the debt—This old man, has been so accustomed to tricking,
                                    that it is dangerous for any one to have any thing to do with him—I
                                    Shamed him for living with the Indians and having a squaw for a wife so young that
                                    she is hardly grown, and also for having more than <hi rend="i">one
                                    wife</hi>—he said in extenuation, that he would give <hi rend="i">them up

                        <p>I hasten to communicate to you a copy of a letter I have received from the Indian
                                    Department you will see that the Commisioner request the suspension of the proposed
                                    Missions of yourself and the Rev Mr Francis—to the Potowatomies of
                                    Northerin Indiana for <hi rend="i">the Present</hi>—The commissioner has
                                    in operation measures for the same object—the result of which he wishes
                                    to see determined, before any other means are tryed—You will therefore
                                    have the goodness to inform the Rev. Mr Francis of the wishes of the Department in
                                    relation to this matter</p>
                        <p>Abram Burnet and a party of his people and others, head men, of bands, have just left
                                    my House—they were hear to learn of me the views of the Goverment as to
                                    thier removeal—they say that all thier several parties are willing to
                                    emigrate and the Goverment terms pleases them, and as to time of Starting, I told
                                    them that it was my wish to start a party so soon as their poneys could live in the

            <p>For more than sixteen years William Henry Herndon was the law partner of Abraham Lincoln. During the
                    time of this intimate relationship, Herndon had an opportunity to observe Lincoln's rise
                    to political power and to know what his qualities were. Out of this advantageous position developed
                    one of the most controversial biographies in American historical writing. <hi rend="i">Herndon's Lincoln</hi>, finally published in 1889, has variously been described as
                    the product of the Civil War president's Boswell and as a gigantic mud-slinging project
                    to defame Lincoln's sacred reputation. Scholars have found it difficult to appraise
                    correctly this basic work in Lincolniana, for the maize of interpretations has been further
                    complicated by the mysticism and tradition that were built up around Lincoln himself.</p>
            <p>David Donald has undertaken this challenging task with great energy and ability. He has brought out a
                    valuable portrait of that irrepressible character in at least two views: Herndon as the law
                    associate and as the biographer of Lincoln. The result is not only the first book-length description
                    of the rampant, impulsive Herndon, but also an important side-light examination of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
            <p>Late in 1844 Herndon became the junior partner of the firm, Herndon and Lincoln, which until 1860 was
                    one of the foremost legal offices in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It was the usual practice for Herndon to keep their crude, inadequate records and to
                    manage the office while the senior partner argued the important cases and traveled the Eighth
                    Judicial Circuit. In the opinion of many critics the partnership was a one-sided affair in which
                    Lincoln was saddled with a colleague of inferior talents. The plain fact that both men continued to
                    be satisfied with the arrangement is sufficient proof that such an estimate is faulty. Lincoln
                    indicated their solid friendship and mutual trust when he said: "Eilly and I never had the
                    scratch of a pen between us; we <hi rend="i">jest</hi> divide as we go along."</p>

                    they were not of similar mind as to most issues of the day, but it does mean that, as the fifties
                    wore on, Lincoln took Herndon less and less into his confidence in these matters. Herndon
                    participated in the anti-<placeName>

                    </placeName> Republican party, and in the hot campaigns of 1856 and 1858. But Dr. Donald finds that
                    Herndon was no president-maker and that by 1860 he was definitely out of touch with the inner
                    councils of Lincoln's managers. The high priests of Republicanism correctly saw that
                    Herndon was too often indiscreet and impolitic.</p>
            <p>"Lincoln's death was the most important event in Herndon's
                    life," writes Dr. Donald. After 1865 Herndon became a famous man because of his one-time
                    association with the martyred president. In 1865 and 1866, Herndon devoted most of his time to
                    collecting facts about Lincoln from court records, newspapers, and interviews. The "Lincoln
                    Record," the compilation of these researches, was the source for Herndoll's
                    biography in 1889. In the intervening twenty-three years Herndon went through many trials: public
                    animosity for defiling the popular image of Lincoln, the débacle of the Ward H. Lamon
                    biography (ghost written by Chauncey F. Black from Herndon's "Lincoln
                    Record"), and pitiful personal poverty.</p>

                    elder co-author furnished the information. The three-volume work that they produced is superbly
                    analyzed by Donald, who points out that Herndon was wrong about Lincolii's alleged
                    illegitimacy and irreligious nature, as well as about the much-discussed Ann Rutledge romance. He
                    does find, however, that Herndon contributed greatly to a down-to-earth understanding of his law
                    partner. Conclusive evidence is found in the fact that all students of Lincoln must know what
                    Herndon said. Now it will be imperative for them to know what Donald said.</p>

            <p>This brief but well-written account of Lincoln watching the final repulse of Early's foray
                    on Washington on July 12, 1863, is of value both for the story it tells and for its critical
                    analysis of the growth of one of the Lincoln myths. It is a well-authenticated fact that Lincoln
                    visited Fort Stevens, and from it observed a minor military action. What developed is several
                    versions of the story recently given wide circulation by the late Alexander Woollcott, that Oliver
                    Wendell Holmes, Jr., ordered his commander in chief to "get down, you fool." The
                    author has examined, and in his book causes to pass in review, all the sources reflecting the
                    incident, making some additions to knowledge by citing some newly published materials.</p>
            <p>In so thoroughly covering a small item of the Lincoln story, Cramer has done Lincoln students a great
                    service by his detailed and objective chronicle of the growth of a myth. He is critical in his
                    approach. Possibly he should have been still more critical. For example, some of the stories have
                    Lincoln standing on top of a parapet, and one reports that Mrs. Lincoln stood beside him. It is, of
                    course, incredible that any woman stood there, and highly improbable that any civilian was on the
                    parapet's top. Azain, no narrator of the episode estimates a shorter range for the
                    Confederate sharpshooters than one thousand yards (no Confederate artillery was used in this phase);
                    only technically was Lincoln under fire. The author's critical standard, however, is
                    commendably high; other Lincoln scholars would do well to equal it. If some are more critical than
                    this, the crying need of objectivity at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> biography will be significantly advanced.</p>
            <p>The greatest usefulness in this worthwhile book is not in its determination of the ultimate
                    factuality of the story of Lincoln under enemy fire, but in its excellent illustration of the
                    criticism of one of the Lincoln stories. Effectively combining literary and historical criticism,
                    the author has probably produced a definitive study of his subject. In doing so he has shown how to
                    utilize a method which must be applied to many more such legends, no few of which are more important
                    than this one. It would contribute enormously to Lincoln research if Cramer and others would apply
                    the same techniques to remaining aspects of the Lincoln myth.</p>

            <p>This work deals with the evolution and organizing tactics of a political group which between 1825 and
                    1853 was "known successively as the Troup Party, the State Rights Party, the State
                    Rights-Whig Party, and the Whig Party in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName>." The latter appellation was not assumed until 1843. The leaders of the group,
                    to whom much attention is devoted, were generally men of unusual intelligence and of more than
                    average means.</p>
            <p>Through a maze of detail and confusion, the author follows the fortunes of the party in both the
                    state and federal theaters of political action. Much of its strength resulted from shrewdly taking
                    advantage of the mistakes of its opponents in matters of state policy. The Whigs were insistent upon
                    economy, a safe currency and a sound banking system; the experiments of the Democrats or Unionists,
                    as they were frequently called in the 1830's, seemed at times inconsistent with the
                    attainment of these objectives.</p>
            <p>Though fundamentally a state rights and an anti-Jackson group in the 1830's the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="gau">Georgia</region>
                    </placeName> Whigs during the 1840's were integrated with a great national party, the
                    economic program of which was scarcely in accord with state rights. The author explains this
                    integration, in large part, in terms of the bona fide acceptance, under changed or changing
                    conditions, of that program; the reviewer feels, however, that the point has been overemphasized and
                    that the desire to avoid sectionalization of parties and to secure the fruits of victory have not
                    received sufficient emphasis.</p>
            <p>The disintegration of the party is admirably analyzed. The satisfactory settlement of principal state
                    issues that had served Whig purposes; the tension with Northern Whigs over the slavery question; the
                    dissatisfaction with President Taylor's policy; the disruptive effects of Democratic
                    strategy in <placeName>

                    disintegrating pattern.</p>
            <p>The bibliography seems adequate, and the narrative is remarkably free from errors.</p>

            <p>In his earlier <hi rend="i">Rampaging Frontier</hi> and <hi rend="i">Pills, Petticoats and
                    Plows</hi>, able historian Thomas D. Clark proved that the way of life of a people can be pictured
                    in minute detail by retelling the tales they told and the pranks they played, or, in the latter
                    book, by describing the things they bought at the country store, why they bought them and
                    how—if ever—they paid for them. In his present work he demonstrates that
                    infinitely more can be learned of their life by scanning the newspapers they read.</p>
            <p>A Mississippian by birth, Dr. Clark is head of the Department of History at the University of
                    Kentucky. He knows the South, from its backcountry farms to its great universities, as he knows its
                    people high and low, and he is rapidly gaining recognition as the leading historian of the region.</p>
            <p>Dr. Clark's scholarship is sound and his research infinitely painstaking; better still,
                    for the purpose of interpreting his subject, he has a keen sense of humor and the patience with the
                    vagaries of his fellow man which social historians too often lack.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">The Southern Country Editor</hi> he has made a fast moving, readable, and
                    thought-provoking survey of the editorial content of hundreds of Southern newspapers which shows
                    what editors preferred to write and their patrons to read during the years since 1865. The study is
                    based exclusively upon country weeklies—entirely proper since the South was and is mainly
                    a land of rural and small town readers.</p>
            <p>The evidence he presents goes a long way toward discovering the reasons for what has been good and
                    what has been ill in the Southland. Members of the morbid current school of Southern novelists might
                    save themselves some of the anguish of their endless soul-searching by skimming through his chapters
                    "The Southern Mind in Thralldom," "Children of Freedom,"
                    "The Day Goes by Like a Shadow on the Heart," "In the Wake of
                    Time," and "Between the Plow Handles of Experience."</p>
            <p>Dr. Clark claims importance for the country weekly because of the very fact of its provincialism. Its
                    editor made <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-045-1-090"/> little or no effort to publish other than local news
                    up to World War I—this held true even in presidential election years because, under the
                    one-party system, the presidential vote was assured and only the gubernatorial contest and the even
                    more interesting ones for county representative, sheriff, judge, and prosecuting attorney provoked
                    local interest. Thus, concentrating upon acceptable news in a locality interested mainly in local
                    affairs, the editor either published what the people wished to read or he failed: if a paper
                    continued publication, its readers opinions were, perforce, reflected in its columns and an analysis
                    of newspaper content demonstrates trends of thought in various districts through the passing years.</p>
            <p>Although Dr. Clark makes no unscholarly effort to prove the point, his book conveys an impression
                    which is at least new to this reader. It is that the most deep-seated ill to which the South is heir
                    developed after reconstruction; that it was an ill of the spirit rather than of the flesh which
                    first became acute when the seceded states found themselves back in full standing in the Union but
                    bewildered and hurt in hitherto high pride; that recovery became hopeful only with the appearance of
                    elusive symptoms when the North and South joined in waging the minor Spanish-American War and that
                    actual recuperation did not begin until 1917 brought the broadening influence of universal military
                    service to its young men.</p>
            <p>The evidence seems to point to this late-developed psychological manifestation, even more than to the
                    facts of the dire war-produced poverty of 1865 and the evil doings of carpetbaggers, as the agent
                    which induced sullen reaction to all change, all progress; which held back efforts to improve
                    education, agriculture, and local government and tended to substitute such morbid interests as that
                    in crimes of violence, in hangings, and in the fire-and-brimstone elements of Holy Writ.</p>
            <p>The chronology of the material quoted indicates that the agrarian South began to feel sorriest for
                    itself not after Appomattox but after Grant's administration; that it lived most
                    precariously not under carpetbagger rule but when, between 1885 and 1905, its own law-enforcement
                    system was at lowest efficiency.</p>
            <p>Present newspaper content, judged by the same standards <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-045-1-091"/> as that
                    of the past, indicates a current improvement as healthful and a future as hopeful in proportion as
                    it was dismal fifty years ago: the country paper, bolstered by a power press and a linotype machine,
                    continues as a more efficient prophet of further improvement.</p>
            <p>That part of the work devoted to the mechanics of editing, printing, and financing a country weekly
                    is as applicable to North, East, and West as to the South—tramp printers, type lice,
                    "patent insides," slow-paying subscribers, belligerent subjects of news items and
                    persons with a passion for publicity were evils common to all localities. There is also a general
                    chapter of enlightening information upon the power which the patent medicine industry wielded in the
                    newspaper field before the Pure Food and Drugs Act broke its grip; that chapter, by typical Clark
                    touch, is titled "Go Tell Aunt Lydia!"</p>

                    prairies. After 1896 the great immigration to the open spaces of the Canadian West began. From the
                    British Isles, the continent of Europe, eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and the American Middle West, the homeseekers came in ever increasing numbers until the
                    outbreak of the First World War in 1914. In 1906 two new provinces, Saskatchewan and Alberta, were
                    carved out of the North West Territories. By 1914 it was estimated that one million Americans had
                    come to the Canadian prairies.</p>
            <p>These American settlers were very popular in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. They brought capital with them and they understood prairie conditions. As a rule they
                    were successful, but they found that they no longer enjoyed the protection of the American tariff
                    and that they "had moved from a national economy to an international economy which relied
                    upon imported capital for its development and upon a world market for the sale of its only
                    commodity." Many of them had taken part in agrarian movements in the United States and were
                    as distrustful as ever of eastern capitalists. They were soon complaining of the domination, not of
                    Wall Street, but of St. James Street, Montreal.</p>
            <p>With meticulous care Mr. Sharp points out that the agrarian revolt in Western <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> was not merely a northward extension of the American movements but that it arose in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> because of the similarity of the agrarian problems existing in the two countries. It is
                    true that many of the leaders were Americans by birth, but others were Canadians or immigrants from
                    the British Isles. The charge was commonly made that the leaders were "American
                    agitators," but such was not the case.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sharp traces, step by step, the progress of the farmers' movements in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mbc">Manitoba</region>
                    </placeName>, Saskatchewan and Alberta. He stresses the importance of the <hi rend="i">Grain Growers
                        Guide</hi>, founded in 1908, and of the Grain Growers Grain Company, the United Farmers of

                        <region type="state" reg="mbc">Manitoba</region>
                    </placeName>, and the co-operative movements. Although the Non-partisan League spread from the
                    United States to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> during the First World War, its success was merely temporary. The great agrarian revolt
                    of the 1920's with its farmers' parties and its wheat pools sprang from the
                    soil <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-045-1-093"/> of the Canadian prairies. The outstanding leaders were
                    Canadian rather than former Americans. The Progressive party which threatened for a time to disturb
                    the balance of the "old-line" national political parties in the end coalesced with
                    the Liberals under W. L. MacKenzie King, but its place was taken in the 1930's by the
                    Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the C.C.F., a former labor-socialist combination which is
                    still a potent force in Canadian politics.</p>
            <p>Taken all in all, Mr. Sharp has done his work competently and thoroughly. The volume is well
                    documented, its style is straight-forward and interesting, the bibliography and the index are both
                    adequate. It is a good study, by an American scholar, of the agrarian movement on the Canadian
                    prairies. Let us hope that it is only the first of many publications from his pen.</p>

                    </placeName> Germans into three parts, part one covering the colonial period, 1640–1790;
                    part two, the middle ages of immigration, 1790–1865; and part three, the last
                    generations, 1865–1940. This appears to be a good division and each section has been ably
                    dealt with by the author.</p>
            <p>To the scholar interested in German immigration, this study should be of considerable appeal since
                    "In no other Middle Atlantic state save Pennsylvania did the Germans play a more important
                    part than in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>German names appeared in the documents of the Calvert Colony as early as 1640. The first group of
                    German immigrants for America, however, did not arrive until October 6, 1683, when the
                    "Cancord" sailed into the port of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Under the leadership of Franz Daniel Pastorius this group had been attracted to
                    America by William Penn. The number of German immigrants at first was insignificant, but between
                    1730 and 1740 "the first wave of German <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-045-1-094"/> mass
                    immigration set in." They penetrated into the backwoods of Pennsylvania and many drifted
                    into the colony of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>. They were bound to the soil and devoted to their church. Concentrated German
                    settlements such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frederick</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> were established.</p>
            <p>Before the American Revolution the Germans displayed little interest in public affairs, but this war
                    furnished "the vehicle upon which the German rode into the previously forbidden territory
                    of local and state politics."</p>
            <p>The German element in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> made its most important contribution after the Revolution in the field of printing. Of
                    the daily papers the <hi rend="i">Correspondent</hi>, a Democratic paper, and the <hi rend="i">Wecker</hi>, a Republican paper, were the most widely read.</p>
            <p>While the Germans had no part in the founding of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, they did play an important role in the development of that city. Many German clubs
                    appeared during the decades after 1840 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Some catered to the social interests, others were geared on an intellectual level, and
                    the Turnverein emphasized physical development. The musical clubs were very important in the life of
                    the Germans, and the "Sangerfest" has been universally identified with them.</p>

                    "What Carl Schurz is for the Americans of German descent on the whole, Carl Heinrich
                    Schnauffer is for the German element in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>; he is the personification and symbol of the great and eternal spirit of
                    1848."</p>
            <p>Professor Cunz has also devoted a number of pages to an excellent description of the Amish. The
                    illustrations by Mrs. Hilde Foss deserve special mention and add to the value of the book.</p>
            <p>The author, an associate professor of German at the University of Maryland, is to be congratulated on
                    this study. It is well documented. The bibliography and the material in the appendix, especially on
                    the German-American Businessmen and German-American Newspapers in <placeName>

            <p>It is to be regretted that the author made such frequent use of the pronoun "we"
                    throughout the volume. On page 279 in a short paragraph of seven and a half lines
                    "we" appears four times. The pronouns "us" and
                    "our" also <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-045-1-095"/> appear but not so frequently. The
                    contraction "48ers" does not improve the appearance of the page.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Poems of Max Ehrmann</hi>, a compact little book of rhymed- and prose-verse,
                    reflects social and political crises in recent American life and includes meditations on the beauty
                    and serenity of the outdoor world and on man's search for values which attained stimulate
                    to further intellectual and spiritual restlessness. There is wisdom in the book—wisdom
                    garnered from a lifetime of sensitive response to a variety of experiences—wisdom
                    characteristic of a high prudence that has learned to evaluate the physical and the ideal, doubt and
                    faith, matter and spirit.</p>
            <p>Throughout the work are echoes now and then of Whitman, Wordsworth, the Bible. "I See There
                    Is a Good Deal of Grandiloquence" is reminiscent of "I Hear It Was Charged against
                    Me." Part II of "My Native City," especially the lines, "O my
                    native city! thou knowest not how often I have thought of thee when far away. When I have wandered
                    amid other scenes, and other men and women and children have passed by me, fondly have I thought of
                    thee," has the prose form and shares the pathos of the 137th Psalm, with phrasing that
                    suggests Wordsworth's <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>How oft in spirit, have I turned to thee, O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer through the woods, How
                            often has my spirit turned to thee!</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>"A Prayer" has been compared for simplicity and majesty to the thirteenth chapter
                    of First Corinthians.</p>
            <p>The chief themes are the tranquilizing serenity and beauty of the outdoors, the charm and depth and
                    promise of love, social injustice, the tragic aspects of war, the worth of the ideal, even when it
                    seems fated for disillusionment, the value of faith and spirit.</p>
            <p>I have remarked on the wisdom of the book. The main question that now confronts us concerns the
                    ability of Mr. Ehrmann to transform that wisdom to poetry. He is a far <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-045-1-096"/> cry from those of our young poets who insist on obscurity, who refuse
                    to be lucid for fear of being obvious and banal, but who mistakenly attain their obscurity from
                    incoherent expression, freedom from the restraint of design, and the use of exotic, dissociated
                    images rather than from philosophic depth and from that right collocation of right words, which
                    exhales an unidentifiable essence of mystery, wonderment, and profundity. In contrast to their
                    too-frequently-unreadable productions I think of the simple utterance in Emily
                    Dickinson's "New Feet about My Garden Go," of Robert Frost's
                    in "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," and of Frances Frost's in
                    "Atlantic Lullaby," each deep like a well where the water is clear but the bottom
                    unseen.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ehrmann's verse has the distinction of being always clearly written. But it fails
                    frequently in overtones—in a stimulating suggestiveness. It does not often enough excite
                    the intellect and emotions with what is only implicit. By telling too much it does not tell enough;
                    it neglects utilizing to capacity the reader's imagination. One is aware of the
                    distinction I attempt if he reads Mr. Ehrmann's "Dream of Youth" and
                    then turns to Ben Johnson's "To Celia." In the former,
                    youth's dream is set out explicitly; in the latter, the reader is momentarily the youth
                    ecstatically dreaming. And would not "Simple Fishermen" be a better poem if the
                    thought of the last two lines were left for the reader to supply? One gets the impression at times
                    that the author feels his convictions so strongly that he cannot dissociate himself from them to
                    view them objectively, as the artist must. Didacticism, at times, results and the sacrifice of what
                    might have come of finer artistry. The compositions which seem to me freest of the fault are
                    "Wanderers," "The Old Philosopher," and "The Dead
                    Wife."</p>
            <p>My pointing out what seems to me a weakness in much of this work of Mr. Ehrmann, would not, I
                    believe, have had his disapproval. He had the courageous modesty to write in one quatrain: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Oh, that in youth but once could I have sung a song that held The magic music of my soul,
                            which ever inward welled Against my tuneless lips! I sit alone and know the truth With
                            broken harp beside the ashes of my youth.</p>

            <p>John M'Coy (he affected that spelling) was a brother of Isaac McCoy, the Baptist
                    missionary to the Indians and one of the truly great and good men of the Midwest frontier. John was
                    himself an ardent Baptist and obviously an admirer of his brother Isaac and the work among the
                    Indians: unfortunately he lacked the foresight to include in his voluminous writings on family
                    affairs any considerable amount of information on Isaac's life which he certainly
                    possessed and which might have made a valuable contribution to the great missionary's
                    memory. Rather, throughout the three hundred and twenty printed pages covered by the diary and its
                    editor's notes, John M'Coy reports chiefly such commonplaces as the state of
                    his health and of the weather, his purchases and his expenditures, his taking of pills, attendance
                    at preachings, the comings and going of members of his. family and the workings of the prized McCoy
                    family madstone.</p>
            <p>John M'Coy was apparently a plain citizen of that solid sort who contributed most to the
                    development of the Middle West: a good man, neither great nor with aspirations to greatness, he went
                    his way providing for his family, serving his neighbors and working in his church. His first travel
                    was by flatboat to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, under constant threat of Indian attack, in 1789; his last extensive trip was by
                    railroad from <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-045-1-098"/> Bennettsville to <placeName>

                        Valley</geogName>. His was a period of almost inconceivable change but he suffered the common
                    lack which marks all but a handful of diarists: the inability to distinguish between significant and
                    insignificant incidents at the time of their occurrence.</p>

            <p>Since histories of Indiana are out of print, teachers and students of the Hoosier State are often
                    hard pressed for suitable reading material and sources of information. It may be helpful, therefore,
                    to mention some of the historical material that is available. Many of the <hi rend="i">Publications</hi> of the Indiana Historical Society are for sale at the office of the society. The
                    same is true of the <hi rend="i">Collections</hi> of the Indiana Historical Bureau. Recently the
                    society has published a small pamphlet written by Donald F. Carmony and Howard H. Peckham which
                    contains a brief sketch of the state's history. The second edition, which may be secured
                    free, has better suggestions for additional readings than the first edition. The past issues of the
                        <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> contain articles and documents about Indiana and
                    the Middle West. The supply of the earlier volumes is now exhausted and the editor would gladly buy
                    copies of many of the earlier issues in order to resell them to some of the larger libraries which
                    do not have a complete file of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>. Most of the issues since 1924 are for
                    sale by the editor, the more plentiful at 50¢ per number or $2.00 per volume,
                    the less plentiful at $1.00 or $1.50 per number. A special discount will be
                    given to libraries on the more plentiful issues when larger orders are placed.</p>

                    represented at these annual meetings and this year should not be an exception. The program committee
                    is arranging an attractive series of meetings and discussions. Reservations should be made
                    immediately in order to secure the more desirable accommodations. The Loraine Hotel is the
                    headquarters, but the Belmont <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-045-1-100"/> and the Park hotels are nearby. We
                    hope that many from Indiana will attend this meeting.</p>

            <p>I am writing a book to be entitled <hi rend="i">The American Lyceum: Town Meeting of the Mind</hi>.
                    It is a study of the cultural, historical, and literary aspects of the lecture system in our country
                    from 1830 to 1860. I would be indebted to any of the readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi> who would let me know if a lyceum existed in their locality before 1860 and,
                    perhaps, where I might write to secure records of the lyceum if it did exist.</p>
