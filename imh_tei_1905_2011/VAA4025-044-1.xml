            <p>Corn-belt landlords have never had their glorious days writ large in the annals of American history.
                    Nor have their fads and follies, their wealth and their culture, their political influences, and
                    their economic power been intimately pictured in any <hi rend="i">Gone with the Wind.</hi> Yet these
                    country grandees of the corn belt, whose landed possessions outrivaled in size and productiveness
                    anything of which the planter aristocrats could boast in the ante-bellum period, had much of the
                    same flamboyant quality, the haughty pride, the lust for life and possessions, the love of display
                    and political power that characterized the slaveowners of the South.</p>
            <p>Nowhere is their influence as far reaching in shaping the early growth of settlement and the land use
                    and ownership patterns of the West as in the Kankakee and <geogName>Wabash valleys</geogName> of
                    Indiana. Here in the mid-nineteenth century were established estates ranging from a few thousand
                    acres to great baronial holdings that spread over four or five government townships. Here in the
                    pioneer period which we are accustomed to equate with equality and democracy there developed an
                    aristocracy that "wore beaver hats… and broadcloth… the high stock
                    collar and the encircling cravat" and maintained "the manners and highly civilized
                    traditions of the East."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Their homes were great rococo mansions set

                    shacks was as great as that which existed between the Eastern industrialist and the low-paid workers
                    who operated his factories.</p>
            <p>The landed aristocracy of the prairies had its origin in two notable groups which started with
                    different objectives but ended with much the same results. The first of these coming somewhat
                    earlier to the prairies consciously planned to establish themselves in the new country as the landed
                    gentry. The second, started as cattle feeders and drovers who, finding it necessary to assure
                    adequate pasture for their livestock, bought many thousands of acres of land for cattle ranges.</p>
            <p>When land was cheap, the titles easy to acquire, and money flush, numerous men of capital bought
                    great tracts in the <geogName>Wabash</geogName> and <geogName>Kankakee valleys</geogName> which,
                    unlike other speculating groups, they planned to improve. Their model was not the Southern planter
                    with his army of slaves but rather the rich and cultured families of the Genesee, the Wadsworths,
                    the Carrolls, the Churches, and the Fitzhughs whose broad acres were cultivated by battalions of
                        tenants.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Some of these ambitious and proud capitalists planned to entail
                    their holdings in order to assure their continuation in the family for future generations. Ponderous
                    Daniel Webster, democratic Henry L. Ellsworth, and aristocratic Nathaniel West are but three among
                    many who acquired large holdings in Indiana and <placeName>

                    the prairie.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> After a tour of the West in the thirties, Ellsworth, then
                    Commissioner of Patents, determined that the open prairies which had been almost entirely avoided by
                    incoming settlers were ideally suited for development by men of means. Through the press, the farm
                    journals, pamphlets, and a wide correspondence, he argued that there were no better opportunities

            <p>Ellsworth's connections with Indiana began in 1835 when his first purchases were made and
                    improvements upon the land were instituted. A decade later, he took up residence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> and thereafter devoted his full energies to attracting settlers to the area.
                    Experimenting with farm machinery, crop rotation and methods of feeding livestock, breaking plows,
                    ditching and corncutting machines, fencing materials, and the feeding of ground corn-cob meal to
                    cattle and hogs all fascinated him. In 1849, he was reported to have twelve hundred acres in corn
                    that averaged sixty bushels to the acre, but his one hundred acres in wheat were ruined by the rust.
                    Instead of driving his livestock overland as was commonly done at the time, Ellsworth transported
                    them on his own boat by way of the <placeName>

                    Ellsworth brought considerable land into use, but he had overextended himself. His plans for the
                    larger development of his great estate were not completed, and his death in 1859 was followed by
                    dissension and litigation among the heirs which ended in the breakup of the estate. Much of the land
                    Ellsworth had held passed into the hands of another and equally bold adventurer in prairie
                    development.</p>
            <p>Despite Ellsworth's persistent plugging for prairie farming and his extensive improvements,
                    the settlement of the flat, wet land of northwestern Indiana proceeded slowly owing to its poor
                    drainage, the numerous sloughs filled with a rank growth of reeds and cattails, and the toughness of
                    its sod that resisted the crude cast-iron plow then in use. To drain the land and bring it into
                    cultivation required more capital than the ordinary frontiersman could raise, and the
                    region—the last frontier of Indiana—was long neglected by immigrants and left
                    undeveloped by the scattered few who settled there. George Ade, whose father was a contemporary of
                    the cattle barons who will be discussed, and who himself came to own twenty-four hundred acres in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Newton County</region>
                    </placeName>, has ascribed this lack of progress to the "backwoodsmen… [who]
                    preferred to loaf," and consume whisky. Here Ade was expressing the prejudice of the person
                    of eastern or foreign ancestry against the Hoosier type. Loafing and whisky drinking, however, were
                    not responsible for the slow progress in settling the prairies.</p>
            <p>Actually this was not Ade's best judgment, for none knew better than he the physical
                    characteristics of the area which long impeded settlement and development. His description of the
                    Grand Prairie and the features that made difficult its improvement is almost classic.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>Our part of the commonwealth was far away from railroads and so shaggy and waterlogged that it
                        was commonly regarded as a hopeless proposition.</p>
                    <p>The untouched prairie which was not wholly or partly submerged was a crazy quilt of high-stemmed
                        and gorgeously colored flowers from late spring until the killing frosts of autumn. To break
                        through the ribbed soil, bury this wild growth and convert a tangy and fibrous flower garden
                        into a corn field was a whale of a job. Every low, spot on the prairie was a slough rank with
                        reeds and cattails, and breeding ferocious gallinippers by the millions. Also a large kind of
                        horsefly, called the "green head," which was so warlike and blood-hungry that
                        when it <pb n="6" id="VAA4025-044-1-010"/> attacked a horse, in swarm formation, it would either
                        kill him or weaken him so much that he had no value as a work animal. Oxen were used in breaking
                        the raw prairie, and even these tough and thick-skinned animals suffered tortures when attacked
                        by armies of green heads.</p>
                    <p>The first ditches…. were deep furrows made with a thirty-inch plow. As many as thirty
                        yoke of oxen would be used in one ditching outfit. On level ground the big plow could be pulled
                        along, ripping and tearing through the tough roots of the bull grass and needle grass and the
                        ironweeds and all the other knotty growth, by fifteen yoke of oxen. In mushy ground and bad
                        going the whole thirty yoke had to be used, some of them to move a capstan ahead of the gang and
                        also to supply power when the pull had to be made by capstan…. You will understand
                        that reclaiming the prairie was no job for a weakling, a lazybones or anyone not prepared to
                        meet a pay roll.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    of acres they had received as swamp land. Passed over by immigrants who, lacking capital to develop

                    widespread domains. They were simply Napoleonic in their aspirations. They owned land by townships
                    instead of sections. They were sometimes friendly with their henchmen and dependents, but never
                    intimate. They were dynamic in energy, forceful of speech, and more than a few of them were

                    on valuable weight. After the prairie grass was killed, the calves were put in covered enclosures,
                    fed on stacked prairie hay with perhaps a small ration of corn or meal, or even corn fodder. Two
                    summers of pasture feeding with some grain put them in shape for slaughter, and they would then be

                    there was at hand a ready supply of immigrants who, in the absence of farms they could buy, were
                    willing to become tenants on the estates of the cattle kings. In this way and without any definite
                    plan, the pastures were slowly divided into quarter, and half, or full-section tracts, which were
                    fenced, perhaps tiled or ditched, and planted to corn. The older generation of cattlemen resisted
                    this change at times and to hold their own turned to better grades of stock or even purebreds. But
                    when the sons of the cattle kings inherited their estates the change to tenant farms with emphasis
                    on grain farming came rapidly. In this way, responsibility was largely shifted to the tenant, and
                    when farm managers were employed to safeguard the interest of the landlord, the latter was
                    completely freed of responsibility. He could thereafter concentrate his attention on banking in <placeName>

                    behind. Absentee landlordism had now arrived for good or for ill. The history of the Fowler estate
                    well illustrates this evolution.</p>
            <p>Slowly a part of the Fowler land was broken up and planted to corn under the charge of a
                    superintendent with the aid of hired laborers or tenants. For example, in 1877, arrangements were
                    made with a tenant to break six or seven hundred acres and to farm it for five years in corn, the
                    compensation to be twenty-five cents per bushel for all corn produced.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> About
                    the same time, ditching was being done on some of the wetter land, sixty miles being dug in 1879.
                    Cattle feeding remained, however, the principal activity, and the sales of livestock comprised the
                    bulk of the gross returns of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year from the operations of
                    the Fowler land.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> A decade later more of the land was being divided into tenant
                    farms of a section each, and a considerable amount of tiling was being done. In 1888, it was
                    reported that "a very large force of laborers have been put to work to ditch and tile
                    several sections" of land belonging to Moses Fowler. At the time of his death in 1889, less

                    first as bonanza farms and then as small tenant farms which supported a substantial population while
                    the Fowler land as late as 1887 had few families living on it. The West respected men of wealth and
                    little criticism of them was permitted in the newspapers, save those of Greenback faith, or in the

                    years, he had built up holdings that exceeded thirty thousand acres. Of this amount, the

                    </placeName> cost him no more than a dollar an acre.</p>
            <p>Sumner's energies were largely devoted to the fattening of cattle upon his land and the
                    production of grain. Four herds of five hundred each ranged over his property. Sumner took pride in
                    his cattle which he loved, and, as he became prosperous and more aloof from the common man, he
                    continued to lavish attention upon them.</p>
            <p>In the fifties, Sumner drove his cattle overland to market in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, the herdsmen starting one hundred cattle every two weeks in the growing season. This
                    was no longer necessary or feasible, however, after the completion of the Big Four Railroad through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                    </placeName>. Thereafter, the reputation of his herds for size and quality attracted buyers who
                    vigorously bid for them to a point that assured him high returns. After all, the land had been
                    acquired at low prices, labor charges certainly were not high, and other costs never became heavy. A
                    granddaughter later recalled two large sales made by Sumner, one in 1880 when six hundred steers
                    averaging fourteen hundred pounds brought $42,600, and the other, two years later, when
                    eleven hundred cattle were bought for the export trade for one hundred thousand dollars.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

            <p>As the advance of settlers forced Sumner to confine his herds, he "built mile after mile of
                    heavy plank fencing, hauling the material with horses and oxen from the nearest stations."
                    To drain the low areas twelve yoke of oxen were kept to haul the heavy ditching plow that was said
                    to cut a drain eighteen inches deep and five feet wide. Caring for such large herds and performing

            <p>Like the other cattle barons of the prairie, Sumner found laborers increasingly undependable, and he
                    slowly turned to tenants to whom he rented a part of his land on a share basis. At first two-fifths,
                    later one-half, of the grain went to the landlord as his share, and the remainder was sold to him at
                    the market price for feeding to his cattle. By 1876, he had fifteen tenants, mostly on the <placeName>

                    grain regularly taken off the land and fed to cattle on the Indiana land, but the cornstalks were
                    cut off at the roots and fed elsewhere, leaving nothing to put back into the soil. No rotation was
                    practiced. The tenant houses which were little more than shacks did not serve to attract the best
                    type of farmers to the land, and the township in which the Sumner farms were located, despite the
                    high quality of the soil, was regarded as backward.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sumner's large possessions made him especially vulnerable when farmers began to display
                    unfriendliness toward monopolistic landowners. He came to look with jaundiced eye upon all
                    assessments and used his influence to beat them down through intimidation, legal action, and failure
                    to pay taxes. For this he was charged with being a "tax shirker" by the local
                    Greenback paper. He was also accused of driving his herds of cattle on to his <placeName>

            <p>In the absence of a will, Sumner's estate was divided among his children, two daughters
                    receiving the Indiana land and a son the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    Sumner lands while three other grandchildren inherited each a ninth and five inherited each a
                    fifteenth. Such a division was unsatisfactory to those with a small share. When Jennie E. Caldwell,
                    the more fortunate granddaughter and a childless widow, died in 1912, she was in possession of
                    sixty-three hundred acres valued at nine hundred thousand dollars, but on which there was a mortgage
                    of one hundred sixteen thousand dollars. Her will provided an unpleasant surprise to the other
                    grandchildren for none of them were major beneficiaries. After some bequests to other relatives, the
                    will provided that the remaining fifty-four hundred acres should be placed in trust for the benefit
                    of the Jennie E. Fowler Home for "honest, virtuous, sick and financially helpless mothers
                    and their babes."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> At this turn of events, the other grandchildren of
                    Edward Sumner began an almost endless litigation to break the will and divide the property among
                        themselves.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Eventually, a compromise was reached whereby the latter were
                    to receive two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in lieu of all claims against the property but not
                    all the litigants accepted this action, and the fight was resumed. When all the contestants were
                    exhausted, there remained to the Home but a fourth of the original tract it was bequeathed. <placeName>

                    the land was first farmed in the sixties had anything but corn and oats been raised on it. No
                    livestock was kept on the land, the corn and stalks were fed elsewhere, and no manure or fertilizer
                    was applied. The owners had "always been opposed to the spending of any money for improving
                    or conserving the soil, the logical consequence having been… that the soil has been
                    robbed of most of its available fertility." Tests showed that the soil would require ten
                    years for rehabilitation because it was acid and poor in available plant food. The tenant
                    improvements were of the simplest and cheapest type, only one of the houses had a cellar, and all
                    were the subject of constant complaint. The fences were in bad repair and required replacement,
                    drainage was inadequate and called for the expenditure of thirty thousand dollars to prevent further

                    hundred horses that were used for farming purposes. Ditching and draining were undertaken on a large

                    thousand acres, was described in 1879 as having "twenty spacious rooms, including dairy and
                    laundry, and exclusive of the large halls, closets and garret. It was built at a cost of…
                    $30,000. The adjoining grounds are laid out with taste and planted with flowers and
                    evergreens. A greenhouse is attached to the premises."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> When recently

                    contracted or mean site. It should stand on a commanding locality… overlooking a fine
                    reach of picturesque but cultivated landscape." This was provided by placing it in the

            <p>Adams Earl built his house on a high knoll in the midst of a ten-acre plot, a part of which was kept
                    for a deer park. No means were spared in making the home fit for the entertainment of the most
                    aristocratic people. High ceilinged rooms with eight beautifully constructed marble fireplaces, some
                    in alabaster white and others in black carrara marble, heavy draperies, carpets covering the floor

                    Essentially a rural aristocracy at the outset, though some of its best-known members always dwelt in
                    towns and cities, there was a tendency to move to neighboring urban centers either in the first or

                    no special regard for its truth or untruth.</p>
            <p>The original Harmonie Community was planted by the followers of George Rapp; a people who seem to
                    have been well below the intellectual average of nineteenth century North European emigrants, who
                    liked to eat well, who were clanish, fearful of an all-avenging God, and willing to confide their
                    lives to the care of any earthly representative of such a God who might be able to convince them of
                    his authenticity by an ability to read, to write, to play upon their own mental incapacities, and to
                    guide them toward material comfort.</p>
            <p>Dull as most of them may have been, they were a people unquestionably skillful in the arts of
                    husbandry, and given such an astute worker upon their superstitions as Father George Rapp and such
                    competent direction in matters temporal as could be supplied by his adopted son, Frederick, they
                    were almost bound to prosper in the fertile <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> bottom land. They did
                    that—enormously.</p>

                    existed no where else west of the Alleghenies, their leaders decided to sell it—and there

                    property as the Rappites' were as nebulous as might well be imagined, and his own formerly
                    remarkable administrative talent had already begun to degenerate. But he still had money, fruit of
                    his early industrial success and of the providence of his wife's father, and he bought the
                    Rappites' Harmonie, lock, stock, and barrel. The buyer was Robert Owen, a character as
                    singular as the nineteenth century produced.</p>
            <p>Thus Harmonie, rechristened <hi rend="i">New</hi> Harmony, had its second proprietor. Rapp, who had
                    been its first and had proclaimed himself a <hi rend="i">spiritual</hi> leader, had an enormous
                    talent for capitalistic exploitation; professedly Godless Owen, second proprietor, bred if not born
                    a capitalist, had a supreme and blind faith in the innate goodness of all men, but of practical
                    ability to <hi rend="i">operate</hi> or to <hi rend="i">govern</hi> not a whit remained! No wonder,
                    under such disparate leadership, that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> developed features not common to her sister communities in the Midwest!</p>
            <p>When George and Frederick Rapp sold to Robert Owen their followers left—possibly with
                    regret, but promptly upon order. When the fact became evident that Robert Owen no longer had either
                    the cash or the intent to feed and entertain the lazy, incompetent and the unfit, who had flocked to
                    the new community at <hi rend="i">his</hi> call, this yeasty body of undesirables left also, though
                    with none of the order which had signaled the departure of the Rappites. When, by 1827, both
                    Rappites and original Owenites had departed, there was left behind only an interesting tithe of
                    citizens who were to make the <hi rend="i">real</hi> contribution of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> to American culture.</p>
            <p>They—and those whom they later attracted—had little interest in the theories of
                    Robert Owen, although they had originally accepted them and endeavored far more zealously to carry
                    them out than did the majority of Owen's avowed and vociferous followers. They had been,
                    with the exception of Robert Owen's sons, mainly followers of that remarkable
                    Americanized-Scot philanthropist, geologist and educational theorist, William Maclure. They were
                    brought to <placeName>

                    </placeName> at his expense and settled there to carry on the educational phase of the program
                    which, at Robert Owen's invitation, Maclure had claimed for his own.</p>
            <p>They were mostly the distinguished people who had filled the passenger list of the so-called
                    "Boat load of Knowledge," a vessel and a cargo which not even a century and a

                    Sunday-supplement stories have made ridiculous. There were, among others, Thomas Say, already a

                    engraver; Lucy Sistaire, later Thomas Say's wife; and Frances Wright, emancipated woman
                    whose gaudy doings filled the press of her day as did those of Isadora Duncan and Aimee Semple
                    McPherson a century later. There was the artist and naturalist, Charles Alexander Lesueur, a
                    survivor of the ill-fated exploring French scientific expedition of the
                    "Géographe" and the "Naturaliste," who had spent his
                    life in sketching strange lands and describing antiquities, mollusks, birds, and fish; there were
                    also Phiqueqal d'Arusmont, alienist and teacher who later married, effectually tamed, and
                    eventually impoverished the spirited Miss Wright; Joseph Neef, Napoleonic officer turned teacher;
                    and Gerard Troost, mineralogist.</p>

                    </placeName> scene after the collapse of Owenism were, oddly enough, the sons of Robert Owen
                    himself. The young men, with the exception of Robert Dale Owen, had demonstrated no great enthusiasm
                    for their father's more radical plans. After he turned to the greener fields for reform in
                    Mexico and <placeName>

                    </placeName>, salvaging what they could of his properties and following their own intellectual
                    pursuits as their varying fancies dictated.</p>
            <p>They were all interested in science, in writing, in educating, and in the general betterment of
                    mankind, and each of those who lived past early manhood—Robert Dale, David Dale, and
                    Richard—made an important contribution in more than one field of activity. During
                    community days, they had been engaged in editing, publishing, and teaching under their father; now
                    they fitted perfectly into William Maclure's program.</p>
            <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-044-1-032"/>
            <p>After some bickering with Robert Owen as to the extent of the property involved, Maclure had
                    announced himself prepared to take over specific buildings and grounds and to carry on the
                    educational experiments which he had planned as his contribution from the beginning.</p>
            <p>The complexion of the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> had undergone an immediate change upon the departure of the parasitic hundreds who had
                    been the most enthusiastic Owenites, and Maclure and his associates now found themselves with a
                    clear field. The almost nightly meetings for the purpose of wrangling over the manner in which
                    Robert Owen's money should be expended to produce the greatest comfort and to entail the
                    least labor for all had ended when there was no longer ready cash enough in Robert Owen's
                    personal till to stir the cupidity of the grasping or to inspire debate in the hearts of the
                    parliamentarians. Now, these classes being happily departed, those who stayed on had welcome time
                    for work.</p>
            <p>Maclure's "School of Industry" was organized, and scholars were solicited
                    and enrolled from most of the Western states who, under as brilliant a faculty as might well be
                    imagined, studied the fine and the graphic arts. The "Maclurian Seminary"
                    announced itself prepared to offer advanced students the classical curriculum of the day.
                    "The Orphan's Manual Training School" provided training in a trade for
                    promising parentless children. The adult educational project, "The Society for Mutual
                    Instruction," began a comprehensive program which appealed, it is to be feared, more to the
                    people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> than to the neighboring backwoodsman whom it was intended to elevate.</p>
            <p>It was probably not always as easy to secure patrons of the schools as it might have been. To many a
                    God-fearing Midwestern parent the name "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>" still meant anathema, but many of the students who did enroll certainly
                    received extraordinary intellectual stimulation, both within and without the classroom, and many of
                    them gained distinction in the arts and sciences during the years to come. One pupil probably not in
                    the least affected by his short stay was Henry Trollope, enrolled by his mother, the Madame, during
                    their <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> residence and removed by her almost at once because young Henry failed to receive the
                    consideration due his elevated station.</p>
            <p>In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                    was to be had in almost every field of human endeavor. Much as the average ten-year old of the
                    thirties might despise it at the time, the military drill administered by "Old
                    Neef" along with his teaching of mathematics, was likely to prove thirty years later to be
                    the deciding factor which gained immediate rank for him as a soldier in the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Children were actually encouraged to attend the theatre and the boy who went to see a performance by
                    the Thespian Society in 1828 saw, not a poor backwoods revival of a second-rate <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> production (probably snitched originally from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>) but a performance of an original American
                    play—"Pocahontas," for instance. It was written by the local editor,
                    Robert Dale Owen, and its scenery painted by Charles Alexander Lesueur, a man who had seen most of
                    the scenery the world had to offer, real and theatrical. If the boy possessed a
                    ticket—not an absolute necessity—it was printed, perhaps by the boy himself,
                    on the Maclure School Press from a woodblock cut by Cornelius Tiebout. The theatre, a wing of what
                    had been originally the Rappite cathedral and later the arena of the Owenite wrangles, featured a
                    curtain upon which Lesueur had painted a scene from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own <geogName>Cutoff River</geogName>.</p>
            <p>Inspired by such spare-time activities, it is no wonder that other twelve and fourteen-year olds were
                    ready to follow the leadership of young George Banvard in painting a diorama of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, building a flatboat upon which to display it and running off to entertain and amaze
                    the river-bottom squatters. This first effort of Banvard's was a forerunner of his gigantic
                    diorama of the <geogName>Missouri River</geogName> which continued a major feature of entertainment
                    in both Europe and America through thirty years. Theatricals, concerts, and entertainments were
                    constant, but they did not interfere with the more important projects of research, study, writing,
                    and educating the young and old.</p>
            <p>Part I of Thomas Say's <hi rend="i">American Conchology</hi> came from the School Press in
                    1830. A Mr. Kellogg, the printer and teacher, supervised it, and the students worked on it. Lucy
                    Sistaire Say drew most of the plates (she had come originally to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a teacher of needlework, drawing, and other lady-like arts with Madame Fretageot),
                    and Caroline Tiebout colored them by hand (making according to Madame Fretageot, two dollars per
                    week thereby). I. Walker, Cornelius Tiebout, and others engraved the plates. Later parts <pb n="30" id="VAA4025-044-1-034"/> of Say's great work were printed under the supervision of R.
                    Beck and William Bennett—the latter of whom must certainly have had, at least, a walk-on
                    part in the mammoth production of "Pocahontas" since he became an ancestor to a
                    theatrical family which still treads the boards with considerable distinction.</p>
            <p>It was Maclures' plan to print editions of the classics at the School Press. They were to be
                    "without frills," but the books produced at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> were indeed beautifully printed. Work was already begun when his own ill-health shortly
                    banished him to Mexico. After Maclure left, production continued under the able direction of Madame
                    Fretageot. There was an edition of François A. Michaux's <hi rend="i">The North
                        American Sylva</hi> printed from the French plates, Maclure's own rambling and wordy
                        <hi rend="i">Opinions on Various Subjects</hi>, an almost mythical edition of <hi rend="i">Aesopus</hi>, and a number of pamphlets. In addition, there was the more or less periodical
                    publication of Maclure's pet, <hi rend="i">The Disseminator of Useful Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                    <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi>, which had attracted nationwide attention under the joint editing of
                    Robert Dale Owen and his then fellow spirit, Frances Wright, was lost to Indiana. It, with Robert

                    </placeName> just before the end of the twenties, where, as <hi rend="i">The Free Enquirer</hi>, it
                    advocated women's rights, easy divorce, the abolition of slavery, and other currently
                    unsettling changes in established custom.</p>
            <p>This beginning, in the post-Owenite period, of scientific research and publication and of the
                    teaching of science drew more distinguished visitors to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and continued to draw them during the next three decades.</p>
            <p>As soon as Say's work on Western conchology and entomology, Lesueur's on the river
                    mounds and the ichthyology of the Great Lakes, and Gerard Troost's on mineralogy became
                    known, these men began to receive frequent visits from a man named John J. Audubon, who left his
                    Henderson, <placeName>

                    Rafinesque, then also of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Very shortly, others and at <hi rend="i">that</hi> time far more famous scholars began
                    to drop in for a week or a winter—Leo Lesquereux, Prince Maximilian zu Wied and his
                    party, Sir Charles Lyell, Henry R. Schoolcraft, Karl Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and, after 1839,
                    when David Dale Owen established <pb n="31" id="VAA4025-044-1-035"/> headquarters of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Geological Survey in the town, all manner of men of science, American and foreign.</p>
            <p>Education, the theatre, the graphic arts, and science did not occupy all the time of all the
                    citizens, however. Josiah <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>, former lampmaker, had tried Owenism in the twenties but had been dubious (even the
                    hopeful Josiah!) of a society in which the contribution of the members was entirely on trust. He
                    returned in the thirties, invented a press which was destroyed in 1840 by fearful <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> printers and which printed from a continuous roll of paper, perfected the stereotyping
                    process which was his most profitable invention, opened in an old Rappite dormitory one of his
                    "Time Stores" (an early effort to exchange merchandise for promises of labor) and,
                    in 1844, announced the perfection of his new system of musical notation.</p>
            <p>In the forties, Robert Dale Owen, who was back in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was elected to the Indiana state legislature, where he was soon deep in the fight for
                    free schools in Indiana. In his spare time, he wrote and published a work on the construction of
                    plank roads, later helped revise the Indiana state constitution, and was eventually elected to
                    Congress, where his efforts resulted, among other useful things, in the setting up of the
                    Smithsonian Institute.</p>
            <p>Free libraries came to Indiana through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> after William Maclure had found death rather than health in Mexico in 1840. One of his
                    favorite projects had been the organization of The Workingman's Institute in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for which he provided quarters and a library. He had also planned, through the
                    instrument of his will, to set up similar institutions throughout the country and to provide them
                    with libraries. His long-time friend and trusted chatelaine, Madame Fretageot (it may be that the
                    terms "friend" and "chatelaine" do not fully cover the
                    relationship), had died even before him. Upon his death Alexander and Anna Maclure (his hitherto
                    dependent brother and sister) became executors of his estate. Through some almost-legal finagelling,
                    they managed to convert most of the property to their own uses before anyone took sufficient
                    interest to force the issue of the library bequests, But finally a brilliant young lawyer with time
                    on his hands (he was Alvin P. Hovey, later governor of the state) took up the case and won it in
                    favor of the free libraries. One hundred and sixty library societies were formed <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-044-1-036"/> in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and qualified to receive a grant of five hundred dollars each. They were more or less
                    well organized, some dissolving and losing their accessions within a very short time and others
                    surviving to become parts eventually of more permanent library organizations. They received a great
                    many books in the period 1855 to 1865, probably some forty or fifty thousand volumes. Even today the
                    Maclurian bookplate is frequently seen in public and private book collections in the
                    Midwesh—evidence, respectively, of careful or slipshod custodianship—but in
                    either case certainly of the foresight and good will of William Maclure.</p>
            <p>Eighteen fifty-nine saw <placeName>

                    </placeName> institute another movement of significance. In 1826, Frances Wright had reorganized the
                    Woman's Social Society of the earlier Owenite community days into a more select group who
                    met for study and discussion. The organization had not survived the general exodus of 1827, but now,
                    after more than thirty years, a few former members and daughters of members, lead by Robert
                    Owen's granddaughter, Constance Fauntleroy Runcie, decided to revive it. On September 20,
                    1859, the Minerva Society began an existence as a woman's club which antedated its nearest
                    rivals, the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> came to life in other ways. Robert Dale Owen, in Congress, did yeomen service as a
                    guardian of the Union against internal friction and as a member of the Freedman's Bureau;
                    while kindly, tireless Colonel Richard Owen became famous as a reformer of military prisons. There
                    was a revival of industry at home, too, which was somewhat reminiscent of the Rappite days.
                    Boom-time pork packing for the Union forces brought quick private wealth to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> which would have chilled the hearts alike of Father Rapp and Robert Owen, had either of

                    </placeName> scientists, beginning with David Dale Owen while he was making his first geological
                    survey of Indiana in the late thirties, had begun to exchange specimens <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-044-1-037"/> with interested instructors in Indiana colleges, and the extensive
                    collections which resulted, developed an interest in the natural sciences, especially at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>, far beyond that of most of the western country. Nevertheless, these colleges were
                    subject to church influences and their instructors were mostly church men, and as such they
                    hesitated somewhat to introduce all of the ideas which were beginning to become manifest to them and
                    to their correspondents. Edmond O. Hovey of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, for instance, might be convinced that certain geological phenomena gave evidence of
                    having required something over seven days for creation, but as a Presbyterian minister he probably
                    hesitated to say so publicly.</p>
            <p>It was in the solution of this conflict that Richard Owen rendered one of his greatest services. He
                    lectured on geology at Indiana University, and he stated the facts as he saw them. But with his
                    ripening years, he had become as whole-heartedly religious as his father had been atheistic. Now, by
                    an involved hocus-pocus far from logical or lucid but nonetheless effective, he managed to tie in
                    the facts of his science with a scriptural interpretation designed to appease even the most
                    primitive Baptist. Foolish as his writings on the subject may appear to us today, they
                    unquestionably served a useful purpose—they made the teaching of science appear to most
                    people to be a more or less respectable undertaking.</p>
            <p>The seventies and eighties saw <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> the center of another interesting activity as the home port of showboat troops and
                    traveling stock companies. This had its origin, certainly, in the cosmopolitan tradition of the
                    little town and in its love for the theatre. There must have been an unfailing supply of amateur
                    actors, for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Thespian Society had begun production in the twenties and had continued—very
                    frequently producing home-written plays—for almost half a century. In the seventies,
                    apparently, most of the more talented members "went professional" and joined the
                    traveling companies organized by Clint G. Ford, Martin Golden, J. P. Bennett, J. G. Stuttz, Walter
                    N. Hammett, Wilbur M. Williams, J. B. Negrotto, and other local impressarios. Some of those names
                    became, and some continue, famous in the American theatre.</p>
            <p>The winter season, when back-country stock companies prepared for the road, must have been lively.

                    years went by before the last of this activity and with its passing, seemingly, went <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Golden Years.</p>
            <p>For the proponents of the other arts and sciences were also almost all gone. Say, Lesueur, Neef,
                    David Dale Owen, Troost, Tiebout, and the others were long since dead. Then, of those who survived
                    longest, Robert Dale Owen, whose interest in spiritualism had become literally a mania, died at his
                    home in the East. Presently, Richard Owen was selected as president of a new agricultural and
                    mechanical college which was being organized at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He was instructed to present a plan of operation to the trustees. To their
                    enormous embarassment Richard Owen reached into the past and drew up an educational scheme worthy of
                    his father in the latter's most opulently dizzy days. But shortly thereafter, he paid a
                    visit to his old friend, druggist Achilles Fretageot, who, afflicted with what was called in that
                    euphemistic day "softening of the brain," confused embalming fluid with mineral
                    water and by his hospitality solved the threat to the future Purdue University's successful
                    launching and the earthly troubles of Richard Owen with one and the same gesture.</p>
            <p>The nineties brought newly prosperous leaders and new standards of culture to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. and Mrs. Edward Murphy, for instance, made a tour of Europe and brought back a
                    large collection of elegantly framed, genuine, hand-painted old masters for the Working
                    Men's Institute Library. Rappite buildings had already sprouted President Arthur fronts,
                    show folks began to be looked upon with the hoisted eyebrow, nice people were not interested in
                    rocks, bugs, fish, or other "varmints," and it was no longer proper to discuss the
                    days of the Communities—either Rappite or Owenite.</p>
            <p>In the first decade of the twentieth century, the picture changed a bit—but at first only
                    a bit—when George Lock-wood, an Indiana newspaperman, gathered all the material he could
                    locate and wrote a serious book on the early history of the town.</p>
            <p>At first the contemporary New Harmonists were not at all amused, but when, presently, American
                    suffragettes occasionally mentioned Frances Wright, and once in a while some casual reference to
                    Robert Owen, William Maclure, or Thomas Say in a magazine article reminded local grade school <pb n="35" id="VAA4025-044-1-039"/> teachers to tell their little charges that these people once
                    lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, some of the citizens began to take notice.</p>
            <p>After a few more years, a new generation of visitors began to drop in from far places. Some of the
                    new rich of the nineties departed. Others became no longer rich and there began to be talk among the
                    descendants of Maclure's followers and the signers of Robert Owen's many pacts of
                    "the happy days of the past… the utopia in the wilderness," and so on.
                    The writing of books followed as a matter of course. Among these were <hi rend="i">Heart's
                        Haven, The Town of the Fearless</hi>, and others less authoritative but much more romantic and
                    more widely read than Lockwood's book.</p>
            <p>The stories of the footprint rock, the golden rain trees, and the vestal virgin (who must have been
                    buried in a secret passage which certainly ought to have existed beneath Father Rapp's
                    house) were enlarged and burnished for the amazement of the tourist trade. Romance was fostered, as
                    is usually the case in old communities of old families, by little old ladies who were always ready
                    to cut the throats of others and to compete in public debate on the ever-present question of whose
                    ancestors had been chiefest in the early days.</p>
            <p>Signs began to appear—sometimes duplicating and triplicating themselves in different
                    locations—announcing the rate of admission to "The Only <hi rend="i">Genuine</hi> House Where This or That Took Place," parlor tearooms were opened, thoroughly
                    inaccurate and horribly printed souvenir guidebooks came on the market, and, as in all such little
                    villages with brilliance in their pasts, a race of strong women and fragile men carried on the old
                    names.</p>
            <p>By the late nineteen twenties, there was some prospect of a moderately prosperous twilight for
                    Harmonie on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, but even as good roads and awakened interest in matters historical and sociological
                    increased that promise, there came the financial crash and by the early thirties troubled times
                    penetrated even to Father Rapp's meadow.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s greatest damage seemed to come not so much from the depression as from the
                    relief with which a benevolent government tried to alleviate its effects. Shanty-boat families gave
                    up their independence in favor of local relief funds, and an invasion of southern Kentuckians
                    descended in search of higher Indiana "rockin' chair pay." There came to
                    be plenty of residents of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> who could not tell the difference between a Rappite and an Owenite <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-044-1-040"/> and few indeed could recognize any of the ancient buildings which did
                    not presently house a beer parlor.</p>
            <p>Through it all, however, the representatives of the old families stayed on. Most of them were
                    desperately poor—existing, usually, almost entirely upon remittances from relatives who
                    had gone away to seek their fortunes. On they lived, proud of their background of
                    culture—if sometimes a bit optimistic as to the extent of its importance—a
                    charming people existing in lavendar, old lace, and an odor of musty Rappite brickwork.</p>
            <p>At the peak of the confusion caused by this mingling of the new reliefers and the proud but usually
                    even poorer aristocracy, came new and far more serious complications. Some one drilled for oil in
                    the valley, and the odor of raw petroleum was added to those of the transplanted shanty boaters, the
                    lavendar, and the musty bricks.</p>
            <p>And trouble followed trouble as the state made a grant of funds for the purpose of restoring historic <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> sites and buildings. Then there was, indeed, a modern exemplification of the true
                    import of the title of that ancient song "Hell on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>," for the ever-smoldering intramural warfare between the contesting old ladies
                    of the old families burst immediately into an open flame which made the doings of roistering
                    oil-field hands and Saturday-nighting Kentuckians seem chill by comparison—the question
                    to be decided being, of course, "Who'll get restored first?"</p>
            <p>That battle still rages, some oil royalties come in, and there are quite a few people on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s streets who define a Rapp as something one serves at the penal
                    farm—but it will pass, as eras have passed before in <placeName>

                    <p>Reports are so contradictory, and I have heard so much on both sides of the question, that I am

                        at the true origin of it; and could I do so, I have no wish to become a party therein. This
                        unfortunate dispute was the cause of two settlements near each other, and most of those who
                        arrived for sometime either joined one side or the other, which increased the difference. But
                        after a time, as more settlers arrived, they considered they had nothing to do with the quarrel
                        between these two gentlemen, and settled in the prairies round…. But the evil of two
                        villages so near each other has been great; for had they been united there would have been
                        better taverns, stores, &amp;c…. This quarrel… has been the cause of a

                    first choice was a quarter section in this prairie belonging to Richard Birkbeck, for which the

                    Hall's bid. "Indeed all who have eligible land to dispose of require what I

                            part contains Thomas Hulme's "Journal, made during a Tour in the Western
                            Countries of America," in 1818. Cobbett's reface explained his inclusion
                            of Hulme's Journal. "It would not Rave been proper to omit saying
                            something of the <hi rend="i">Western Countries</hi>, that Newest of the New Worlds, to
                            which so many thousands and hundreds of thousands are flocking, and towards which the
                            writings of Mr. Birkbeck have, of late, drawn the.pointed attention of all those
                            Englishmen… looking towards America as a place of refuge…. I <hi rend="i">could not go</hi> to the Western Countries; and, the accounts of others were
                            seldom to bei relied on; because, scarcely any man goes thither without some degree of
                            partiality, or comes back without being tainted with some little matter, at least, of
                            self-interest. Yet, it was desirable to make an attempt, at least, towards settling the
                            question: 'Whether the Atlantic, or the Western Countries were the best for <hi rend="i">English Farmers</hi> to settle in.'" Certain that Hulme would
                            give an impartial account, Cobbett included the Journal in his book. "He [Hulme]
                            offers no <hi rend="i">opinion</hi> as to the <hi rend="i">question</hi> above stated. That

                    a result, he was "perfectly impartial in my feelings, and am, therefore, likely to be

            <p>What had misled Birkbeck? According to Cobbett, it was "a warm heart, a lively imagination,
                    and I know not what caprice about republicanism, have led you into sanguine expectations and wrong
                        conclusions."<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cobbett's conclusion was: "I say all new countries are <hi rend="i">all

            </p>
            <p>Such an attack upon the English Settlement could not go unanswered, and It did not. Birkbeck replied,
                    and Richard Flower also rose to the defense of the settlement. George Flower later recalled that
                    Birkbeck wrote there was something in Cobbett's character that threw a doubt on the motives
                    of his statement. Many people admired Cobbett, yet, few implicitly trusted him.
                    "Cobbett's active pen, it was said (with what truth, I know not), was employed by

            <p>Richard Flower included in his second book a letter written by Morris Birkbeck dated May, 1821.
                    Birkbeck professed to believe that enough had been written to prove their success to the public.
                    Those who preferred to enjoy the settlement's "imaginary reverses," could
                    "rely more on the superficial accounts of such people as C. F. &amp;c…. who
                    have never seen the country, or if they have seen it, are incapable of
                    judging…." Birkbeck decided that it was to the settlement's advantage

                    Cobbett's book. Publishing a letter Hulme had written Cobbett, Melish concluded that
                    Hulme's sentiments had not been correctly represented. Melish stated that "nothing

                    Birkbeck. The latter was certain a dreadful crisis impended in <placeName>

            <p>Melish was inclined to believe that Birkbeck had the advantage in the controversy for the latter had
                    examined both sides of the question. Melish highly regarded Birkbeck's two

            <p>One traveler, Henry Bradshaw Fearon, did not visit the settlement, but he devoted many pages of his

                    laughed at Birkbeck's settling in the Western country, according to Fearon's
                    account. What of Cobbett? "My impressions… are that those who know him would

                        disqualified him as an explorer. The families who had commissioned him were interested in the
                        English Settlement; yet Fearon never saw it. While Flower was in <placeName>

                        the group considering emigration. Thompson commissioned Flower to purchase nine thousand acres

            <p>Welby visited the settlement during a period of severe drought prevailing in the West during the

                    hospitably that "from thence alone… [he] was grieved to depart." He

                    moral to overcome." He hoped the Americans would cease becoming angry at the observations
                    of travelers visiting their country. "Though unfavourable reports we give, they are the
                    best proofs of the friendly interest we take in their welfare, and of the hopes we entertain of what
                    they may in time become. Their soreness upon the mention of their faults is truly unreasonable, for

                            for this village than for Albion; every log-house has a cleared inclosure of a few acres
                            attached, and what is done, is done by the occupants or owners, and not by Mr. Birkbeck;
                            whereas, in Albion, all has been done by the purse of Mr. Flower. Both villages are the
                            abode only of the humble mechanic. The farmers live on their quarter-sections, and both are
                            but scantily supplied with water at a distance. Wells, however, it is hoped, will soon be

            <p>Faux believed a gentler and kinder manner toward strangers on the part of Birkbeck would be a good
                    policy, indicating, perhaps, that he was not too favorably received by the founder of Wanborough.
                    Birkbeck had just returned from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, one grand object of which will be, to rid the state of stagnant waters."
                    Birkbeck's house was "very capacious and convenient, furnished with winter and
                    summer apartments, piazzas, and balconies, and a fine library, to which you ascend by an outward
                    gallery. Every comfort is found in this abode of the emperor of the prairies, as he is here
                    called…. It is apity that it is not built of brick or stone, instead of wood,"
                    because of the danger of fire. His estate consisted of sixteen thousand acres, "which he
                    sells as customers offer." At this time, with the exception of a few acres of wheat, it was
                    all uncultivated.<hi rend="sup">104</hi>

                        is esteemed a fine thing, and causes those who express dissatisfaction to be despised. Thus my

            <p>Can the influence of these travelers be estimated? Only indirectly. The results of Morris

                    witness to that fact. Fordham recorded that Birkbeck was known in America by his writings even
                    before he emigrated. And the settlement attracted the attention of land speculators and American

                    Cobbett had remained silent, "hoping that few people would be deluded [by

                    <p>For my own part, although I went to America full of prejudice against the nation, yet I returned
                        with very different impressions, having been always treated with the most unbounded hospitality
                        and kindness. I am confident, that when many enlightened travellers have visited that great
                        Republic, Englishmen will begin to esteem and respect, a people, connected with them, not only
                        by language, manners and laws, but also by that strongest of all ties, Mutual Interest. In
                        contemplating the grand spectacle afforded by this rising, though as yet only infant nation,
                        every unprejudiced Englishman must rejoice, when pointing to it he can exclaim—This

            <p>The English Settlement as an example of a philanthropic experiment in transplantation of agricultural
                    laborers is significant. Morris Birkbeck and George Flower planned to establish an agricultural
                    colony in southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. At first, their plan was based on the hope that Congress might grant them several
                    townships on a deferred-payment basis, their capital could then be used for improvement and the
                    transportation of settlers. Congress was not favorably disposed, and the founders modified their
                    plan, buying sixteen thousand acres of land as a basis for the settlement. They resorted to
                    advertising their project to encourage English emigration. Because of discouraging conditions in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the farmer was disposed to emigrate. Morris Birkbeck's optimistic propaganda
                    for his colony provided the spark for emigration. Some four hundred settlers arrived the first year,
                    settlers who it was agreed were superior to the average emigrant both in intelligence and property.</p>
            <p>Such enthusiastic advertising provoked a counterreaction. Some detractors opposed emigration and some
                    were persuaded the emigrant should remain in the Eastern part of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> to make eyewitness reports, which too often were biased by preconceived ideas.</p>
            <p>Still the emigrants came. The schism between Flower and Birkbeck and the presence of land speculators
                    caused the scattering of the settlers upon the prairies around Albion and Wanborough. Most of the

            <p>Migration of native Americans declined in importance in the forties. Those settlers who were
                    searching for new lands to conquer settled farther west where more land was available. The Quakers,
                    who had provided the largest single group which migrated to the valley up to this time, were no
                    longer coming in large numbers. During the thirties, eighty-eight removal certificates had been
                    received by the four meetings in the valley, but during the forties, this figure had dropped to
                    thirteen, the greatest decrease thus far.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Some inhabitants of the valley were
                    emigrating and going to new homes in the West. Besides the prospect of fertile land, another
                    attraction was the discovery of gold in <placeName>

            <p>Foreign immigration, in contrast to the movement just described, was steadily increasing. The Germans

                    be reckoned with in the life of the valley. At about the same time, the Irish were also settling in
                    this area and many were serving as laborers on the Whitewater Canal, which was under

            <p>In the forties, emigration from Europe was a highly organized affair. It was put on a strictly
                    commercial basis by transport companies set up to take the emigrant from his homeland to the
                    farthest territories of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Great evils were committed in this system. Frequently the emigrants were victimized by
                    unscrupulous agents and ship captains and suffered untold hardships.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, the principal emigration was from the Upper and Middle Rhine, the Grand Duchy of
                    Baden, Wurttemberg, the two Hesses, and Bavaria. In the latter place, entire village communities
                    sold their property and left their homes, led by their clergymen. Those from southern <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> went overland, through <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, to Havre, which was the nearest port. They traveled under such poor conditions along
                    the Strasburg Road that of necessity they endured many hardships. They were poorly prepared, their
                    carts were drawn by half-starved beasts, and only scanty boxes contained their few possessions.

            </p>
            <p>One motive for migration was the success of earlier settlers, such as the Rappites. Other causes were
                    the opportunity to acquire land, the dread of destitution in Europe, "the desire for
                    absolute political and religious freedom; the absence of all restrictions upon the development of

                    care of his livestock and his farm and was the picture of neatness and good order. He preferred to
                    do the larger part of his work using his own hands, assisted by his wife and children. In the town,

                    large part of the population. This acted directly to increase emigration. In the early part of the
                    year 1847, the roads to Irish seaports were crowded with people, attempting to escape from the great

                        land which maintained a family when laid down to potatoes, are insufficient for the purpose when
                        laid down to corn or any other kind of produce; and corn cultivation requires capital and skill,

                    provisioned, and usually undermanned. It is true that the ship, her crew, and provisions passed
                    inspection at Liverpool, from which most of the emigrants sailed, but something strange occurred

            <p>The Whitewater Canal project, begun in a wave of enthusiasm in the thirties, had finally bogged down

                    improved, the canal was turned over to a company organized to complete it—the Whitewater
                    Valley Canal Company, which had been chartered by the legislature of 1841-1842, with a capital stock
                    of four hundred thousand dollars. By 1845, the canal had reached <placeName>

            <p>This ambitious undertaking was destined to suffer one disaster after another. The fall of the river
                    was excessive and the destruction of timber resulted in frequent floods. In 1847 and 1848, flood
                    damage amounted to one hundred thousand dollars and eighty thousand dollars respectively.
                    Considerable damage was suffered by industries along the canal, dams were washed out, and millraces
                    were demolished. The great risk of rebuilding the canal caused many of the industries to disappear,
                    and it is also believed that the flood damage caused an exodus of population from the valley. The
                    canal, however, was rebuilt, but it was doomed to extinction when the railroads arrived.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                    type of reading material which they gave to their families. This attitude had apparently been

                    organized unit, gave much of their time and effort to this movement. In 1840, the Indiana Yearly
                    Meeting had its Committee on the Concerns of the People of Color to investigate possible means of
                    obtaining goods produced by free labor, and their report was made the following year. In January,

                    labor products, to induce merchants to provide free labor goods, and not to be deterred by
                    'pecuniary considerations'." Some of the officers were Benjamin Stanton,
                    Henry H. Way, Levi Coffin, Jonathan Unthank, and Jacob Grave. In April of the same year, they began

            <p>The latter part of the forties witnessed the passing by the state legislature of a common school law,
                    a much needed statute. The act, which was passed in 1849, levied a tax of ten cents per hundred
                    dollars on property and a twenty-five cent poll tax. It also taxed premiums of insurance companies
                    not chartered in Indiana. Proceeds from these sources, together with those from saline and surplus
                    revenue funds and a bank tax, were to form a county common school fund, to be placed in the hands of
                    the county treasurer. Townships were divided into districts under trustees, and voters of a district
                    might vote labor and money up to fifteen cents per hundred dollars to erect a school building.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>The increase in population during the forties was the smallest yet recorded. Immigration from other
                    states to the Whitewater Valley had slowed down considerably, and some inhabitants of the valley
                    were leaving in search of new homes. The population of the region was 54,493, in 1840, and 60,432 in
                    1850, showing an increase of slightly less than six thousand.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> This gain is not
                    an inconsiderable one, however, when one considers the small area covered by the four counties. An
                    examination of the age groups indicates that there was a slight increase in the number of older
                    persons. In 1840, there were only seven per cent over fifty years of age, while in 1850, the figure
                    was nine per cent. In the latter <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Even though the increase in population during the forties was small, new immigrants arrived to take
                    the places left vacant by former residents who had been lured on to seek their fortune elsewhere.
                    The prospect of more fertile land and the Western gold fields appeared particularly attractive to
                    some. Foreign immigration was steadily increasing. This may be attributed in part to the fact that
                    emigration from Europe had become highly organized and was conducted on a strictly commercial basis.
                    The opportunity to secure economic advancement and the desire to enjoy political and religious
                    freedom influenced many to leave Europe. The construction of turnpikes and bridges during the
                    forties improved the transportation system of the valley. The antislavery cause continued to remain
                    in the limelight. The religious and educational developments in the valley were in part determined
                    by the coming of the Europeans.</p>

            <p>After the publication of four of the Rappite letters in the December, 1946, issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, twenty other manuscripts were turned over to the translator.
                    This represents all that the Indiana University Library possesses. All twenty-four manuscripts are
                    without doubt from the estate of Frederick Rapp, the leading business organizer of the Rappists.
                    These documents throw light on ail important period of Rappite history, a period which has been
                    treated rather meagerly and, probably, none too accurately in the published accounts of the
                    community. It is unfortunate that the material is limited, but efforts will be made to search out
                    additional documents. Thirteen of these documents were composed by John L. Baker (originally
                    Langenbacher; he died 1825), one of Frederick Rapp's most efficient assistants. These
                    letters give a picture of the economic life of the Rappite community while it was still located at
                    Harmony, <placeName>

                    and <geogName>Beaver rivers</geogName>, some twelve miles southeast of Harmony, the society

                    Harmony. Goods from Harmony went in the reverse order.</p>
            <p>John L. Baker appears to have begun his term as manager of the depot at Beaverpoint shortly before
                    July 2, 1813, for he states that the <hi rend="i">beginning</hi> of his duties was arduous (letter
                    of July 2). This editor is inclined to think that the community chose its managers at Beaverpoint
                    for more or less definite periods. In the letter of November 21, 1813, Baker bemoans the fact that
                    he must be absent from the services at Harmony "since it has been so ordered." Who

                    there were all of a business nature, and the last correspondence is dated November 27, 1813. This
                    date probably represents the approximate end of his service at that station, for on May 9, 1814, he

                    if we possessed Frederick Rapp's letters to Baker, we should have an equally detailed list
                    of the items sent from Harmony. Some of the manufactured articles are incidentally mentioned in
                    Baker's accounts: boots and shoes, cloth, hats, wines, iron hoops for barrels, and whisky
                    (according to Duss, <hi rend="i">The Harmonists</hi>, page 31, the society produced three thousand

                    Early Kanawha Salt Industry, Indiana University, 1936) contains the following information: In 1797,
                    Elisha Brooks erected in the Kanawha region the first salt furnace in the West; as a result of
                    improved methods, salt manufacturing became big business; in the latter part of 1810, eleven
                    furnaces were in! operation on the Kanawha, each producing approximately four hundred bushels of
                    salt a day; two years later, the same area contained thirty furnaces.</p>
            <p>At Beaverpoint, the community employed a person having a boat. Although Baker says (letter of July 5)
                    : "We have a boat," it belonged to McFerran, who took it with him when he left
                    there; the replacement, Isaac Bean, was also a boat-owner. Frederick Rapp at Harmony had several
                    wagons (letter of July 5) to convey goods at times to Beaverpoint, but Baker laments the fact that
                    he did not possess his own wagon, but was dependent on carters, who were frequently unreliable. The
                    charge was twenty-five cents a hundredweight. Careful, detailed expense accounts were kept, although
                    in a few instances the arithmetic was slightly at fault; e.g., (letter of November 19) 621 lbs.
                    @.27 a cwt. is set down as $l.66 1/2 instead of $1.67 1/2 (actually
                    1.6767).</p>
            <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-044-1-089"/>
            <p>Nowhere in these letters from Beaverpoint is there any suggestion of leaving Harmony; in fact quite
                    the contrary seems true. Baker is busy throughout those months taking orders and buying materials.
                    On July 15, he writes that he has engaged carpenters, who "will board here, on which
                    account I should like fifty pounds of ham and shoulders." He also desired an efficient
                    housekeeper from Harmony. On July 5, he was planning to get salt by boat from the Kanawha region,
                    instead of depending on middlemen. As late as October 24, he was carrying out a wish of Father
                    (George) Rapp by sending him seeds of flowering bushes "which grow on a hill between here
                    and Beaver and blossom beautifully in the spring." One cannot imagine Father Rapp bestowing
                    such loving care on Harmony, if he were about to desert the place. In one of the last letters from
                    Beaverpoint (November 21), Baker expressed a nostalgic longing to be back in Harmony and hoped that
                    his absence would not continue much longer. This might conceivably imply that there were plans to
                    give up both Beaverpoint and Harmony, but a more natural supposition would be that his term as
                    manager away from the community was about over.</p>
            <p>A few months later Baker was in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When the decision to sell out and migrate to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> was made, and the reasons for it, represents a tantalizing problem. The various
                    published accounts pass over the matter cursorily. Aaron Williams, <hi rend="i">The Harmony Society
                        at Economy, <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Penn</region>
                        </placeName>'a</hi> (1866), is not especially interested in this early phase of the
                    Society's history and has only one sentence to explain the motivation for the migration. He
                    writes: "Among their reasons for desiring a change, was the disadvantage of being twelve
                    miles from navigation, together with the unfitness of the soil and climate for the most successful
                    cultivation of the grape and other fruits, to which they desired to give special
                    attention." George B. Lockwood, <hi rend="i">The <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                        </placeName> Movement</hi> (1905), has apparently copied the same sentence. Even John S. Duss,
                    the last trustee of the Society, in his volume entitled <hi rend="i">The Harmonists</hi> (1943),
                    adds nothing new. It is certainly not an adequate explanation for the apparently sudden decision to
                    move into an unknown region five hundred miles distant.</p>
            <p>In Baker's letters from Beaverpoint there is no indication that the removal of the community
                    was contemplated, nor would he have been unaware of the fact if it had been planned <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-044-1-090"/> at Harmony, for he made occasional business trips to Harmony to confer
                    with Frederick Rapp. Thus, on the basis of the letters, it must be assumed that the decision was
                    made during the winter of 1813-1834. Could Frederick Rapp and John L. Baker have been unfavorably
                    impressed with the business outlook in addition to the fact that Harmony was not advantageously
                    located for its diversified industries? Not only were transportation costs relatively high, but the
                    correspondence reveals that business conditions were deteriorating in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> area. One boat load of products from Harmony had to be sold in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> far below the expected price (letter of July 15). In the letter of March 7, 1815, it
                    was stated that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> price for shoes and boots was considerably above the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> price. Even at the very end, the community thought it more profitable to ship their
                    remaining goods all the way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> instead of endeavoring to close them out in the East, "since prices had
                    dropped very much."</p>
            <p>What directed their thoughts to southwestern Indiana? There is a hint in the Memorandum of May 9,
                    1814; here we learn that they had entered into negotiations with a Mr. Jones of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> concerning his land on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. We can imagine that in connection with their business trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> bankers, they became acquainted with this Mr. Jones. Did he give them the idea of
                    moving to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> while offering to sell his land in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName>? The subject deserves more elucidation than DUSS'S statement that "in
                    the spring of 1814, a party of exploration—George Rapp, John L. Baker and Louis
                    Schreiber—in search of another haven in the American wilderness, boarded a river boat
                    headed for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (page 35). It seems rather that they were headed for a definite goal.</p>
            <p>If one may attempt to reconstruct the developments, one should picture them in this wise. The Rappite
                    leaders were realizing the drawbacks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> location; they heard of the land on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, a fertile region on navigable water, and even had a large tract offered to them; other
                    land could be secured through the land office. Alluring as the outlook was, these hard-headed
                    businessmen would not buy a pig in a poke, but set out to look it over. Surely in that short time,
                    they did not plan to undertake a tour of inspection of the western lands. They knew where they were
                    going. They saw the region, it seemed to be what they <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-044-1-091"/> were
                    looking for, and they decided in favor of the migration. They went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the seat of the territory, to enter land. They chose Ewing, of Ewing and Badollet, as
                    their agent. Badollet was the Federal Land Agent.</p>
            <p>On May 9, 1814, one finds John L. Baker in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, conferring with Ewing and entering land. Whether George Rapp and Schreiber were with
                    him is not stated; they may have returned at once to Harmony to acquaint the community with the
                    decision. Baker's Memorandum discloses that he paid the land office $2,109 and
                    also bought land from various individuals. According to Elfrieda Lang's study (December,
                    1946, number of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, page 361), the records show that
                    on May 9, 1814, the Rappites entered 2,435 acres. The Memorandum also reveals that Baker was now
                    ready to close the deal with Jones of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>; Jones seems to have offered his land for approximately fifteen hundred dollars, and
                    Baker now asked for a definite assignment, made before a witness, which was to be acknowledged by
                    Judge Roberts, in order to get a deed issued. After completing this business and leaving further
                    details in the hands of Nathaniel Ewing, Baker returned to Harmony. Soon thereafter, he led a
                    contingent of Rappites to the new site (letter of July 2). There is a widespread belief that Robert
                    Owen first called the settlement on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>," but this is clearly false, for the letters of September 14, 1814 (from
                    Romelius L. Baker to John and Jacob Baker) and that of October 31, 1814 (from Frederick Rapp to
                    George Rapp) employ the designation <hi rend="i">New</hi> Harmony. It is, however, true that the
                    Rappites did not consistently add the <hi rend="i">New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first transport must have left in June, 1814. No time was lost in endeavoring to secure buyers
                    for the old homestead. One learns that in June many persons came to look at the land and the
                    buildings, and one prospective buyer offered seven hundred dollars for the mill and two hundred
                    acres. Others seemed ready to buy the house and the cottages. But the Rappite leaders were hoping to
                    sell the whole plant as a unit. This plan required time and effort. In the letter of December 17,
                    1814, it was stated that they engaged the firm of Baldwin and Cromwell of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> as their agents, who were authorized to offer the land and the buildings for sale as a
                    unit. An advertisement offering the whole establishment for sale was inserted in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Gazette.</hi>
                    <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-044-1-092"/> To close out their furs, they had previously entered into an
                    agreement with two <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> firms, who offered to sell them for the community. Efforts to convert their notes and
                    paper money into gold and silver, proved a failure. They had better success with their livestock,
                    selling twenty head of young cattle, four oxen, and a bull for $404.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the Rappite community was gradually being transferred to the West. The letter of September
                    14, 1814, states that a third transport would be ready to start in six or eight weeks. (The letters
                    have no reference to the second transport.) This third contingent actually left on October 31, 1814.
                    Although Father Rapp was expected to depart with this group, he left earlier and was already in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> when the transport set out (letter of October 31, 1814). Frederick Rapp also made the
                    trip to the West, probably in December, 1814, mainly to arrange for further land purchases. A
                    memorandum in his handwriting, but undated and unsigned, contains the information that Ewing and
                    Badollet had been authorized to enter additional land, the sections to be acquired being carefully
                    noted. Miss Lang (page 361) found that 5,370 additional acres were purchased in the last months of
                    1814 and 4,319 in the next year.</p>
            <p>The memorandum further reveals that John L. Baker had returned to Harmony and was conducting another
                    party to the new settlement. In connection with this information, Frederick Rapp informed Ewing and
                    Badollet that Father Rapp was now about to lay out the new town, and added that John L. Baker would
                    soon arrive in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> with the sketch and would ask the advice of Ewing and Badollet, which they had
                    previously promised.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile John Reichert, Romelius L. Baker, and Christopher Miller (the physician) were winding up
                    the affairs in Harmony, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. In March, 1815, Frederick Rapp was back again in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> to aid in the final liquidation. The letters are silent on the sale of the land and
                    buildings to the Mennonites from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Bethlehem</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>. According to Duss, the price was
                    one hundred thousand dollars, but the buyers failed to meet all their payments. Efforts were made to
                    close out their remaining stock of manufactured goods, but to avoid incurring great loss
                    "because prices have dropped so much," Frederick Rapp closed the entire store,
                    packed up the things, and shipped them to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Shoes and <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-044-1-093"/> boots had been sent ahead earlier. In
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, they expected higher prices and a more receptive market.</p>
            <p>In the last letter (March 13, 1815) there is a solemn warning, not to go further into debt.
                    "Adopt this rule and insist upon it, that borrowing cease, for we have great difficulty in
                    collecting outstanding notes."</p>
            <p>If further documents can be uncovered, the picture will become clearer. At present, one sees through
                    a glass darkly; one knows the facts only in part.</p>

                                    waren, so wurden wir alle so mit Schleim iiberzogen, dass man bei nahe keinen mehr
                                    gekannt hat. Die Board aber sind alle wirklich gut aufgesezt, und wie ich hoffe aus

                        <p>This evening at 9 o'clock I received your letter, but quite unexpectedly,
                                    for Joseph had to leave his wagon behind, because he found it impossible to cross
                                    the Beaver this evening on the flat (raft). If the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> had risen in the same degree as the Beaver, not only would the boards
                                    have been washed away, but probably also the houses.—I had at the
                                    beginning of my work [he may just have been starting out on his duties at
                                    Beaverpoint] untold difficulty and worry as the water began to rise, for just then
                                    the boat from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, fairly well laden, arrived. The goods were immediately unloaded, and I
                                    could hardly rescue them from the rising water. At the same time I saw twenty-four
                                    thousand feet of boards exposed to the water. There I was alone, for I had sent
                                    McFerran to get help, but he could not obtain any; nevertheless I got the things
                                    safely into dry places. With the aid of lawyer Moore, Powers, and other obliging
                                    persons of Beavertown, I rescued the boards from danger in a heavy downpour. Because
                                    the boards were slimy, we were all covered with slime, so that one would scarcely
                                    have recognized us. The boards are really well stacked, and I hope out of all
                                    danger.</p>
                        <p>Herewith I am now sending you as you requested the following wares. [See the original
                                    for the list.]</p>
                        <p>July 3rd.</p>
                        <p>All the goods [from Harmony] I am now having conveyed on your dray to the Beaver and
                                    shall have them transferred to the warehouse. As soon as the Beaver can be crossed,
                                    I shall send the other goods on two wagons, which I have ordered; one of the drivers
                                    is willing to drive to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> [Pa.?] if you request it. I couldn't carry on much business;
                                    the boards and the rain hampered me in every way.</p>
                        <p>I hope to come to Harmony tomorrow to make a further report. The cast-iron wheels of
                                    [the right] size have not arrived as yet, but I expect them by Monday.</p>

                        <p>Ich hatte diesen Morgen eine Unterredung rnit Lawyer Moore, welcher sagte, dass er
                                    sein Boat mit Canawy Salz beladen nächstens envarte, und
                                    wünschte es zu 9 Doll das Bärrel verkaufen, ich aber
                                    wäre keineswegs willens soviel dafür zu erlauben, ob er flour
                                    oder Whisky an Bezahlung nehmen würde. Ich werde mich aber um den
                                    dortigen Preis verschiedener Produkte erkundigen, und dir so bald als
                                    möglich Bericht abstatten. Ich denke da wir doch auch ein Boat haben und
                                    die Produkte an Hand möchte man wohl eine Reise dorthin wagen, um Salz
                                    zurük zu bringen so wohl als andre Leuth, freilich solte man einen guten
                                    Korrespontenten haben, der einem für den Verkauf und Einkauf besorgt
                                    wäre, man möchte vielleicht unter den Pittsburger Bankleuth
                                    einen finden der eine Adresse und Recomman-dation an einen solchen Mann geben
                                    könte. Wunsche wegen dieser Sache deine Gesinnung in Bälde zu
                                    vernehmen. Weil die Erndte vorhanden, so hoffe ich werde ziemlich Whisky
                                    verschliessen können, halte es dennoch für schicklich diese
                                    beide Wägen meistens mit Whisky zu beladen, auch etlich Bbls Common
                                    flour, eine Beisszange, einen grossen und 1 kleinen Nagelbohrer für Haus

                        <p>This morning I had a conference with lawyer Moore, who told me that he expected
                                    within a short time the arrival of his boat laden with Canawy salt and wished to
                                    sell it at $9 a barrel. I am, however, by no means willing to pay that
                                    much, even if he were to accept flour or whisky in payment. I shall, however,
                                    inquire about the price of various products in that region and shall report to you
                                    as soon as possible. I think, since we have a boat and the products [to be sold or
                                    exchanged] on hand, we, as well as other people, could venture a trip there to bring
                                    back the salt. Of course, we ought to have a good agent who would negotiate the
                                    purchase and sale; one might find among the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> bank officials some one who could furnish the address and a
                                    recommendation to a person of that nature. I desire to know your opinion in this
                                    matter soon.</p>
                        <p>Because the harvest is at hand, I hope to be able to store considerable whisky
                                    [probably the whisky can be sold at harvest time?], nevertheless I still think it
                                    advisable to load our two wagons mostly with whisky [to be sent from Harmony to
                                    Beaverpoint], also with a barrel of ordinary flour, a pair of nippers, a large and a
                                    small wet for general use, and a book of large and one of small-sized unglazed paper
                                    for bags and sacks in addition to the previously ordered articles. <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-044-1-097"/> Since I do not have a single good lock on our house, I
                                    am sending two of them to be repaired by our smith; I desire, however, to get them
                                    back soon, since both of them ought to be on the warehouses. The cast wheels and six
                                    sacks of wool arrived already on Saturday. I did my best to send the peasants
                                    [probably the carters] yesterday; they were, however, not ready to go despite their
                                    promise.</p>

                        <p>Diesen Abend habe ich deinen werthen Brief und zugleich die Ladungen beider
                                    Wägen in guter Ordnung erhalten. 1st mir aber sehr leid zu vernehmen,
                                    dass nicht alle gegossene Rader angekommen sind. Hoffe das Boat welches ich schon
                                    lang von Pittsb. erwarte werde sie ohne Zweifel mit bringen. Wie ich durch den
                                    Ueberbringer dieses vernommen, so ist Isaac Bean heute nach Harmonie gegangen,
                                    welcher nicht allein wegen obigen Rädern, sondern auch über
                                    meinen Vorschlag nach Canawy zu fahren Bescheid ertheilen wird. Werden die Rader
                                    ankmmen, so will ich augenblicklich einen Wagen mit denselben und dem Schleifstein
                                    nach Harmonie senden. Diesen Abend öfnete ich das Hanf Samen fass und
                                    habe es ganz verschimmelt und von abscheulichem Geruch gefunden, und ausgeleert.
                                    Heute habe ich mein schon zehn Tage gelegenes Kleeheu vollends auf einen Haufen
                                    gebracht, und Morgen werde ich den Ueberrest vollends mahn lassen. Nichts macht mir
                                    mehr Hinderniss, als dass ich nicht einen eigenen Wagen habe und
                                    genöthigt bin so viel Zeit zu versaumen einen um Lohn zu bekommen und
                                    dabey von lauter ungewissen Versprechungen abhangen muss.</p>
                        <p>Es kommt einem in einer liebevollen und dienstfertigen Brüder-schaft
                                    erzogenen Menschen wunderlich für, sich mit lauter ungeord-peten und
                                    halzstarrigen Leuten böser Art zu plagen, von welchen man <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-044-1-098"/> mit Geld und gut Wort kaum zuwegen bringen kan, einem
                                    nur einen noch halbbetrogenen Dienst zu enveisen.</p>
                        <p>Le [Liebe] Theure Harmonie! Wie gluklich sind die Burger inner-halb deinen Thoren! Um
                                    deiner Liebe und Interesse willen bin ich zwar leiblich von dir abgesondert, werde
                                    dich aber ewiglich in meinem Herzen tragen und behalten. Mit meinem herzlichen Gruss
                                    deinem Andenken anbefohlen</p>

                        <salute>Frederick Rapp:</salute>
                        <p>This evening I received your worthy letter and at the same time the two wagon loads
                                    of goods in good condition. I was sorry to hear that not all the cast-iron wheels
                                    arrived. I hope that the boat, which I have long since been expecting from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, will bring them without fail. As I learned from the bearer of your
                                    letter, Isaac Bean went to Harmony today, not only on account of the above-mentioned
                                    wheels, but also to obtain definite instructions regarding my proposition to make a
                                    trip to Canawy. Should the wheels arrive, I shall at once send them by wagon, along
                                    with the grindstone, to Harmony. This evening I opened the barrel of hemp-seed and
                                    found it completely mouldy and of a horrible odor. I poured it out. Today I stacked
                                    my clover-hay, which has been drying for ten days, and tomorrow I shall have what is
                                    left mowed.</p>
                        <p>Nothing is a greater drawback to me than that I do not possess my own wagon and am
                                    forced to lose so much time in hiring one and at the same time having to depend on
                                    uncertain promises.</p>
                        <p>It is a strange feeling, after one has been brought up in a loving and obliging
                                    brotherhood, to have the torment of doing business with persons who are without
                                    order and stubborn and of the worst sort, who can hardly be induced by money and
                                    good words to perform a service, at which one is usually half defrauded.</p>
                        <p>Dear, beloved Harmony. How fortunate are the members within your gates. Because of my
                                    love for you and my interest for you, I have indeed been bodily separated from you,
                                    but I shall ever hold and cherish you [the Brotherhood] in my heart. With a hearty
                                    greeting and the desire to be remembered,</p>

                        <p>Den Belauf dieser Eisen Waaren habe ich von Barker &amp; Gregg auf meine Rechnung
                                    genommen, muss also auch mir zu gut geschrieben werden, den Ueberrest der beordneten
                                    Waaren versprachen Barker &amp; Gregg so bald als möglich zu
                                    verfertigen and hieher zu senden. Heute habe ich den ersten Tag die Zimmerleute oder
                                    Schreiner urn Lats Hauss zu reparieren, welche auch zugleich hier in Kost gehen,
                                    wozu ich gerne ohngefehr 50 lb Schinken and Schultern haben mochte, wenn der Sailer
                                    3/4 Zoll dike Saile hätte so wünschte ich drei oder vier zu
                                    bekommen. Da ich nun immer viele Leute verköstigen muss, und es
                                    unmöglich ist in McFerrans eigensinnige Familie eine Ordnung zu bringen,
                                    so wünsche ich so bald als möglich eine taugliche Haushelterin
                                    zu bekommen, welcher man eine Haushaltung anvertraunen könnte. Robt
                                    Moore's Salz Boat kam gestern hier an, mit 87 Bbl Salt und halten das Bbl
                                    zu 9.50 Doll. Sie konnten gar die Producten nicht verkaufen welche sie mit genommen,
                                    als unter geringerem Preis, den man hier dafür bekommt, das Bu. Salz
                                    werde dorten für 80 cts. verkauft und nur paar Geld sey der beste Article
                                    dorthin zu schiken. Die lezt gesendete Güter habe ich in zimlich
                                    Güter Ordnung erhalten, ausgenommen die feine Hüte haben
                                    Schaden qelitten durchs Iieiben gegen einander. Der Wagen mag Whisky oder Highwine

                        <p>The amount for the iron-wares from Barker &amp; Gregg I have put on my account,
                                    it must therefore be credited to me. The remainder of the ordered wares Barker
                                    &amp; Gregg promise to have ready and to send them here as soon as possible.
                                    Starting today I have the carpenters here to repair Lat's [?] house. The
                                    men will also board here, on which account I should like to have about fifty pounds
                                    of ham and shoulders. If our rope-maker has three-quarter inch ropes, I should
                                    desire about three or four of them. Since I must constantly supply meals for many
                                    people, in part laborers and in part other persons, and since it is impossible to
                                    establish any order in McFerran's headstrong family, I should desire as
                                    soon as possible an efficient house-keeper, to whom I could entrust the household.
                                    Robert Moore's salt-boat arrived yesterday with 87 barrels of salt, which
                                    he is offering at $9.50 the barrel. They could not even sell the products
                                    which they took along except at a lower price than one would receive here. A bushel
                                    of salt costs 80 cents there and cash is the best article to send there. The last
                                    goods which you sent arrived in fairly good condition, except that the fine hats
                                    suffered damage by rubbing against one another. The wagon may bring back whisky or
                                    highwine.</p>

                        <p>Wird durch Georg Knodel den vom Vater verlangten Samen erhalten, der an dem
                                    Hügel von hier nach Beavertown an einer Staude wächst, die im
                                    Frühling so schön blüht. Ich habe mnit Christ
                                    Impson geredet wegen den Distill Gefässer, er sagte mir er wolle mit dem
                                    nächsten Wagen, den ich sende, mit nach Harmonie gehen, die
                                    fässer zerlegen, hieher bringen und selbst in Eisen binden lassen.
                                    Wäre mir such lieb wenn ich bei nächster Gelegenheit folgende
                                    Artikels erhalten könnte, viz red flannel</p>
                        <p>different plains</p>

                        <p>Bedfords, merino hats, Boots &amp; Shoes.</p>
                        <p>Der McFerran ist mit dem Boat am Dienstag Mittag von hier abgefahren, und seine
                                    Familie denselbigen Tag nach Beavertown gezogen. Morgen wird Isaac Bean mit einem

                        <p>Will receive per George Knodel the seed which Father has asked for, which comes from
                                    a shrub growing on the hill between here and Beavertown and which blossoms
                                    beautifully in the spring. I have spoken to Christ Impson about the barrels for
                                    distilling. He said he would go to Harmony with the next wagon which I shall send,
                                    will take the barrels apart, transport them here, and himself will have them bound
                                    with iron. I should like to receive at the next opportunity the following articles,
                                    viz.</p>
                        <p>red flannel</p>
                        <p>different plains</p>
                        <p>do common broad cloth Bedfords, merino hats, boots and shoes.</p>
                        <p>McFerran left here with the boat on Tuesday noon, and his family moved on the same
                                    day to Beavertown. Tomorrow Isaac Bean will arrive with a boat.</p>

                        <p>Gestern Abend um neun Uhr habe ich die Güter in ziemlicher Ordnung
                                    erhalten, sehe aber dass ein Stük bleifarbes Tuch für David
                                    Nahon welches schon über drei Monath in der Walk ist, noch nicht
                                    gekommen, da der Mann schon sechsmal hier gewesen um es abzuholen, so
                                    wünsche so es würde bei nächster gelegenheit
                                    geschikt werde. Auch fragt I. Barker alle Tage nach dem Stük Drab Tuch,
                                    und zugleich möchte er auch wissen, ob er ein Stuk Drab Linen bekommen
                                    konte. Möchte auch wissen ob des Impsons Still gefässen auf
                                    einem abgebrochenen Wagen konnten geführt werden, so wolte ich diese
                                    Woche eine Ladung von Bretter schiken dass der Thos. Reed einmal seine 300 fuss
                                    bekämme. Hier angehengt folgt ein Bill von den beiden letzten Wagen
                                    geschikte Articles—habe auch wieder neun Weiber und acht Mannes Sattel
                                    Bäume bekommen, und die, für Wagen Sattel werden diese Woche
                                    gemacht werden, sind auch etliche paar schon längst bestellte Schuh noch
                                    nicht gekommen.—Wir sind wirklich mit Welschkorn meistens
                                    beschäftiget—sonst geht es alles wie vorher. Meinen herzlichen

                        <salute>Frederick Rapp,</salute>
                        <p>Yesterday evening about nine o'clock I received the goods in fairly good
                                    condition, but notice that a piece of lead-colored cloth for David Nahon, which has
                                    been in the fullery for over three months, has not arrived. The man has already
                                    called for it six times, so I wish that it be sent at the next opportunity. And I.
                                    Barker inquires daily about the piece of drab cloth and asks whether he could also
                                    obtain a piece of drab linen. I should also like to know whether Impson's
                                    still containers [for distilling whisky] could be transported on a dismantled wagon,
                                    in which case I would send back a load of boards this week, so that Thomas Reed
                                    would finally get his 300 feet.</p>
                        <p>Appended to this is a bill for the articles sent on the last wagon. I have also again
                                    received saddle-trees, nine for women and eight for men, and the wagon saddles will
                                    be made this week. Also a number of pairs of shoes which have been ordered long ago
                                    have not arrived. <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-044-1-106"/> We are very busy getting in
                                    the corn [maize]. Otherwise, things are much the same. Hearty greeting.</p>

                        <p>Meine Haushälterin Charlotte Haily lässt dich bitten, du
                                    möchtest ihr diese neun Sträng wollen Garn zu flannel weben
                                    und braun färben lassen, so wie allgemeiner flannel gemacht wird. Es hat

                                    Brüder zu sehen, und als ein Elender und armer Mensch auch die

                        <p>My housekeeper, Charlotte Haily, requests you to weave these nine hanks [or skeins]
                                    of woolen yarn into flannel and have it dyed brown, just as the ordinary [domestic?]
                                    flannel is made. Nothing worth mentioning has happened; I can't get any
                                    information about McFerran.</p>
                        <p>I wish I were able to go to Harmony today, for time drags on during the fourteen-day
                                    absence without being able to see my fathers and brethren. As a forlorn and
                                    miserable person I must even miss the meeting [religious services], but since it has
                                    been so ordered, I commend myself to their memory, in the hope that it [the absence]
                                    will not be long drawn out.</p>

                                    für wetter ihr hattet vom 9. bis 18. dieses, und 14 Tag vorher hatten wir

                                    kanst. nemlich ich mijchte gem wissen, ob man sich vorzusehen hat mit allen sorten

                                    dafür Ihr werdet Papoos für Pfirsich zu essen haben, doch

                        <salute>Much beloved John.</salute>
                        <p>My spirit rejoices as I contemplate the rapid and unexpected arrival of our father in
                                    your midst, what happiness and joy it will arouse as you see him in person
                                    accompanying you and giving you firm confidence to dispel timidity and despair, for
                                    I doubt not that you were often perplexed how to manage this or that matter. This
                                    soon to be expected joy [the arrival of Father George Rapp in their midst] was
                                    accelerated by the long and heavy period of rain during this month [with the flooded
                                    condition of the land, Father Rapp probably felt that there was little he could do
                                    at Harmony, Pa.]. I wish you would make a note of the amount of rain you had in the
                                    period from September 9 to 18; fourteen days ago we had a great flood which washed
                                    away Basse's bridge.</p>
                        <p>While it is very fitting for great people to be concerned with important matters, I
                                    shall now ask about small things, which however must also be attended to. And <hi rend="i">you</hi> especially can give us the best information in this regard. I
                                    should like to know if we must provide ourselves with all sorts of trees, that is,
                                    apple, pear, peach, both trees and seeds; also plums, cultivated and wild currant
                                    bushes and seeds; <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-044-1-110"/> poplars, large and
                                    small-leaved, and thorns, and yellow senna bushes, sumac seed or bushes, yellow
                                    willows, etc., and what kind of cuttings could be used? There are more items that do
                                    not come to mind. As time and paper permit, make a note of the things of this nature
                                    which one might need. I believe you will be eating papaw instead of peaches;
                                    however, I do not. know whether they grow in the region in which you are. Concerning
                                    other matters you can obtain information orally from those who are now about to join
                                    you.</p>
                        <p>The wound caused by your departure will not heal. Yes, indeed, you [my departed
                                    friends] must bind it up and heal it again, especially this wound of mine, for I can
                                    not recall to memory the experience of having accompanied you to the hill where you
                                    departed from us, nor to have given you the bitter-sweet kiss of farewell. Forgive
                                    me, dear brethern. I hope to see you in good health, probably towards the end of
                                    April, when we shall probably all see each other again. In the meantime, however, I
                                    wish you well-being, and close with hearty greetings to you John, Fritz, John E.,
                                    and also to all the other brothers and sisters.</p>

            <p>Few subjects in European History have been more intensively studied than the Crusades. Yet Professor
                    Andressohn's scholarly monograph indicates that there is still need for critical studies to
                    expand or correct the work of Kugler, Röhricht, Von Sybel, and other authorities.</p>
            <p>The present volume falls into two well-defined portions. In the first, which scholars probably will
                    find the more useful, the author presents a careful, completely documented account of the ancestry
                    and life of Godfrey prior to the beginning of the First Crusade. The second portion of the book
                    (Chapters III-IV) is primarily the story of the First Crusade, with attention concentrated on
                    Godfrey as directly as the sources permit. Although the material on the Crusade is familiar to
                    students of the period, the author's views on controversial questions enlist close
                    attention and, in the main, concurrence.</p>
            <p>In dealing with the early life of Godfrey, Professor Andressohn follows Breysig in holding that the
                    duke was born in 1060. Although Godfrey of Bouillon was named the heir of Godfrey the Hunchback, the
                    Emperor, Henry IV, did not grant him possession of Lorraine on an hereditary basis. Indeed, title to
                    all the former possessions of the Hunchback was disputed by his widow, Matilda of Tuscany, who, with
                    the support of Pope Gregory VII, was a formidable antagonist. The author rightly maintains that
                    Godfrey of Bouillon fought under the banner of Henry IV in the Investiture Wars and accompanied him
                    to <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> in his counter-offensive against Gregory VII. The view that Godfrey finally received
                    Lorraine in 1087 is also presented in convincing fashion.</p>
            <p>In his account of the Crusade, Professor Andressohn rightly refutes Von Sybel, who erroneously
                    believed that Eustace of Boulogne accompanied Godfrey on the expedition. The author follows Albert
                        (<hi rend="i">Alberti Aquensis historia Hierosolymitana</hi>) in believing that legates of
                    Bohemond prompted the Emperor, Alexius, to come to an agreement with Godfrey and regards the
                    struggle at Tarsus a reflection of the conflict between factions headed by Godfrey and Bohemond.
                    Although <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-044-1-114"/> tempted to accept Albert's recognition of
                    Godfrey's primacy among the crusading leaders, Professor Andressohn correctly rejects this
                    interpretation in view of Godfrey's third place among the leaders named in a letter to Pope
                    Urban II. Nevertheless, with the siege of Arcas and the reaction against Raymond, "attempts
                    were made to wrest the active control of the crusading operations from Raymond and place it in the
                    hands of Godfrey" (p. 93). Raymond declined the crown of Jerusalem, the author believes,
                    because he "hoped for a more lucrative conquest, a coastal stretch, probably in the region
                    of Tripoli" (p. 104).</p>
            <p>Professor Andressohn brings keen critical appraisal to bear upon the traditional concepts of
                    Godfrey's character and competence. The duke's "conduct toward church
                    property was by no means exemplary. Like many other lay princes he profited by the confusion and the
                    turmoil of the Investiture Struggle" (p. 48). Piety did not impel Godfrey to go on the
                    Crusade; "Rather then unusual religious fervor, it was the example of the princes of
                    Northern <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> that stirred in him the spirit of adventure, the willingness to give up the]
                    'certain for the uncertain' " (pp. 48-49). Yet despite the brevity of his
                    regime and the multitude of difficulties he encountered as the first head of the Latin Kingdom of
                    Jerusalem, Godfrey "had transformed Palestine from a doubtful asset to a coveted
                    prize" (p. 124).</p>
            <p>No student of the Crusades, or of Medieval History in general, can overlook Professor
                    Andressohn's study. In clear, straightforward style, the narrative is presented with
                    careful attention to balance and perspective. Controversial issues are faced four-square, with the
                    author's interpretations bolstered with appropriate citations and often excerpts from the
                    relevant sources. The appearance of such a study under direct auspices of Indiana University is
                    additional cause for gratification among scholars who will look forward to the appearance of other
                    volumes in the <hi rend="i">Series</hi> with great interest.</p>

            <p>For the past quarter of a century Southern historians and historians of the South have made rapid
                    strides in collecting materials and in writing and rewriting the history of that region. Their
                    labors have borne good fruit in the generally objective and critical studies which they have
                    produced. This volume, by one of the more productive Southern writers, is the first published of the
                    ten-volume comprehensive history of the South.</p>
            <p>The author begins his volume with the remark that "The Civil War was not worth its
                    cost…. What good the war produced would have come with time in an orderly way; the bad
                    would not have come at all." Undoubtedly, the costs to the South were great: a billion or
                    more dollars in slaves ("the most stupendous act of sequestration in the history of
                    Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence"—Beard); two-thirds of her railroads destroyed or
                    crippled; a skipped generation of young men with five per cent of the total white population not
                    returning from the fields of battle; burned cities and devastated countrysides; a banking system
                    destroyed; insurance investments canceled; empty sleeves and trouser legs; and a people who had made
                    living an art as effectively wiped out as the nobility of the Old Regime. To this partial listing of
                    injuries, one should add the "insults" of the Treasury agents, the withdrawal of
                    all pensions from Confederates who had earlier served in the wars of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and the "iniquitous and unequal taxes." The South was able in time
                    to repair the property and spirit, damage to which was in large measure incident to the war and
                    conquest and not to the malice of the invading armies. Reconstruction, however, was another matter.</p>
            <p>There was common agreement that both North and South had honorably laid down their arms, and war
                    memories quickly began to fade—four years was not enough to hallow the Confederacy. The
                    North helped little in the rehabilitation of the South, but the South readily accepted the Lincoln
                    and Johnson plans of Reconstruction. In the eyes of a small group the South had not suffered
                    sufficiently, for only through a different type of reconstruction could the radicals perpetuate
                    themselves in power and enable their economic allies to continue to exploit the resources of the
                    country. Thus, in 1867, the Southern territorial units—which were states for the purpose
                    of ratifying amendments—were subjected to Reconstruction Acts written "not with
                    a pen but a sword."</p>
            <pb n="112" id="VAA4025-044-1-116"/>
            <p>Radical reconstruction, however, failed to accomplish its first aim when the "intelligent,
                    the honest, the steadfast were lumped together and declared evil," and the Southern
                    Republican party was made up of Negroes, carpetbaggers, and scalawags. The programs for the Negroes
                    were based in idealism, not reality. Slavery had left the Negro untrained for freedom; he desired
                    land but was given the vote—the implications of the revolutionary confiscation idea were
                    too dangerous to be toyed with; the South had to bear responsibility for the Negro's
                    presence, but was allowed no freedom in solving the riddle. Coulter describes well the various
                    injustices to the Negroes, and it seems clear that they needed to be "saved from their
                    friends."</p>
            <p>Military occupation, corruption, waste, excessive taxation, election frauds, profiteering, and other
                    seamy features of the Radical Reconstruction era are treated with objectivity and freshness of
                    approach. During this period, it is worth noting, resentment toward the Negro was intensified,
                    especially among the poor whites, and generally the abuses of Reconstruction seemed to endanger the
                    principle of white supremacy. When one realizes that what people believe to be the fact is often
                    more important than the fact itself, some of the devices used by the Southerners against Radical
                    Reconstruction can be better appreciated. In this connection, it should not be overlooked that the
                    Ku Klux Klan became so obnoxious that early members and leaders made an effort to disband it.</p>
            <p>The Republicans' use of every possible device to hold their hybrid Southern organization
                    together was matched by the Democrats (Conservatives) in their efforts to destroy it. The
                    realization by the Negro that the Democrat was to play a much larger role than the Republican in his
                    economic existence, splits between the carpetbaggers and the scalawags, plus the inexperience,
                    ignorance, and exploitation of Republican officials gave the final victory to the South which had
                    regained much of its spirit and was not to be cheated of its soul after 1867.</p>
            <p>Approximately two-fifths of the text of this volume is devoted to a discussion of agricultural
                    reorganization, transportation, new economic horizons, cities and factories, cultural developments,
                    fashions and recreation, and schools and churches. These chapters, dealing with positive
                    accomplishments and advances, are more pleasant to read than the others, and the subjects have been
                    treated with competence and reasonable brevity.</p>
            <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-044-1-117"/>
            <p>Coulter feels that both North and South failed to recognize the psychological factors in
                    reconstruction, and that the South was too prone to feel that she alone had suffered. Radical
                    Reconstruction did accomplish what four years of war had failed to do: the unification of the
                    Southern people. The aims of the radicals, however, were not fulfilled, and political reconstruction
                    was an "utter failure." The total effects might be summed up in one of the
                    author's statements: "North might or might not be North, as it pleased; but the
                    South would be South" (p. 183).</p>
            <p>This volume bears evidence of discerning and discriminating use of extensive sources, but there seems
                    to be an excessive emphasis on the newspapers of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. The states of the upper South have been treated rather summarily since this is the

                    the South. These shortcomings are minor. The style of the narrative is easy and clear; the
                    well-known wit and humor of the author is sometimes transferred to the printed page through the
                    medium of tongue-in-the-cheek remarks; the bibliography is selective and critical; the index is
                    good; and the text is remarkably free from errors. The <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The supplementtary account was written by Robert Allen <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was completed in 1899 and covered twenty-five years (1874-1899). Mr. Brown
                    restudied the period covered by Judge Banta and found new material. Miss Palmer began her study in
                    1919, and, while she worked principally on the period since 1899, she also gathered new material on
                    the preceding seventy-five years. The entire history as now published was written by her.</p>
            <p>The plan of, treatment includes a chapter on the general history of the Presbyterian church and a
                    second chapter dealing with the founding and early years of the local church. These chapters are
                    followed by six others. The headings of which are: "Pastors and Pastors'
                    Wives," "Church Property and Church Houses," "The Sunday
                    School(' "The Music of the Church," "The Women and Young
                    People," and "Sons and Daughters." The title of the ninth chapter is
                    "Through the Years." To general readers, this will prove the most interesting and
                    valuable chapter. It would have been possible to incorporate with the material contained in this
                    ninth chapter everything included in the preceding chapters, thus making the whole, book into a
                    single narrative of something like nine chapters.</p>
            <p>The tenth and last chapter is in reality no more than an appendix with two main divisions. In this
                    chapter valuable records are printed and thus preserved and made accessible to all. Lists of pastors
                    and church officials from 1824 to 1944 are included, and also both chronological and alphabetical
                    rosters of church members for each of the years of the church's history (1824-1944).</p>
            <p>As a whole, the volume will prove especially interesting and valuable to present members of the
                    congregation of the church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>. However, the book contains accurate facts about a large number of people and many of
                    these will be of value to others as well as to persons principally interested in church history. The
                    printing and binding of the volume are satisfactory, and it was prepared by a very competent author.
                    All concerned with its publication have reason to feel a pride in the completed work.</p>

                    Ewbank, and Mrs. Ama Lana Nowlin Baker, Secretary. (n.p., [1947], pp. 104. Illustrations.)</head>
            <p>Our ancestors often began housekeeping with a family Bible as their most cherished wedding present.
                    Into it they recorded all the family history. What a wealth of genealogical data some of these old
                    books contain! Genealogy is not ancestor worship, it is history. Carlyle said, "History is
                    the essence of many biographies." It is very encouraging to find some member interested
                    enough in the history of his own family to collect and record dates and places of birth, marriage,
                    and death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">John and Ann Ewbank Family</hi>, is such a collection. It is a neat little volume of 104
                    pages, clearly printed on good paper with nice wide margins and the photographic illustrattions add
                    to its attractiveness. A great deal of painstaking care has gone into the compilation of this book.</p>
            <p>The authors have a clever way of arranging the family tree. The children of the emigrant are referred
                    to as "Tribes." The descendants of each tribe are kept separate. Thus in the Tribe
                    of Thomas, his children, grandchildren, and four generations of great grandchildren, follow the
                    names of their parents in logical order. This arrangement must give a great amount of satisfaction
                    to each family. To the outsider, the genealogist, however, this plan is very confusing. It means
                    leafing the book through page by page and scanning each page carefully when searching for a name and
                    not knowing definitely under which tribe to look. An index would have increased the working value of
                    this book ninety per cent. A few notes showing who has the family Bible records and where important
                    data was obtained, would also have added to its value. Source material references are absolutely
                    essential in genealogical research.</p>
            <p>The John and Ann Ewbank family is a good example of the sturdy stock from which we Americans sprang.
                    The life of John, the emigrant, should serve as an inspiration. Born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in 1752, he found himself penniless in 1805, due to the treachery of a friend. He
                    resolved to try and retrieve his fortune in America. Bidding goodbye to his nine children (the
                    oldest of whom was fourteen) and to his wife (who was expecting her tenth child), he set sail for
                    the new world.</p>
            <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-044-1-120"/>
            <p>After two years of hard work, he had saved enough money to send for his family. After four more years
                    of work, John felt that he had saved enough money to finance the family venture to the Old Northwest
                    Territory. At the age of fifty-nine, we find John Ewbank located near Tanners Creek in the present
                    state of Indiana ready to carve a home out of a vast wilderness. Was he successful? Read the short
                    sketch of the family, look at the pictures of the home John built, and judge for yourself whether a
                    man can make a success of life after he has reached the age of sixty.</p>

            <p>The career of Carl Fisher, the Fabulous Hoosier, is a story of the automobile age. He began his
                    business life repairing bicycles and patching tires, but soon became a racer and a dealer. From
                    these activities he passed to racing and selling automobiles. Prest-O-Lite, which he did not invent,
                    made him a millionaire. He was a leader in the development of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Speedway, the Lincoln Highway, and the Dixie Highway. With the Prest-O-Lite millions,
                    he built the great resort city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Miami Beach</settlement>
                    </placeName>, literally making the land upon which it was constructed. From this he turned to
                    Montauk Point on the tip of Long Island. "Fisher luck" deserted him, this project
                    was not completed, and Carl died a poor man. He made millions and carried great projects through to
                    completion, but he did not learn how to live. He enslaved himself and forgot how to relax. His story
                    is unique in its details, but it is similar to several other stories of men who rose from poverty to
                    power and riches without understanding how to use their newly acquired wealth and influence.</p>
            <p>The work is essentially the memoirs of his wife, who was closely associated with him until near the
                    end of his life. Although the facts are related frankly, the work is uncritical and savors of hero
                    worship. It is, however, a fascinating story, a story that began in Indiana.</p>

            <p>Not long ago an elderly woman walked into my office, said she had been cleaning up the old house and
                    had found something the Library might like to have. Digging around in her purse, she produced three
                    small books. One of them was a nineteenth century pocket edition of Shakespeare, worth ten cents if
                    it had not been torn; the others were little better. Curious about old houses, I questioned her, to
                    learn that her family had settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> in the 1830's, was related to the Chases, and that that very morning she had
                    carried out into the back yard and burned a bushel-basket full of letters to her grandfather from
                    Philander Chase, the first Episcopal bishop of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and later of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, founder of Kenyon College. Almost no letters of Bishop Chase have survived; what we
                    know of him comes only from his autobiography. We have now lost another chance to learn more.</p>
            <p>Two years ago the priest of one of the oldest Catholic churches in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, in one of the oldest towns, climbed up into the convent attic, found there as he says,
                    "quite a number of old papers," ordered them taken down and destroyed. Among them
                    were in all probability documents relating to the extraordinary individual who built the church and
                    the convent a century ago, a Dominican priest, Father Samuel Mazzuchelli, in whom burned no scant
                    measure of that divine genius which can fashion the poor materials of a primitive pioneer community
                    into structures of proportion, grace and dignity. Unknown today to the Midwest which he once
                    enriched, Father Mike, as his parishioners called him, will, if his bungling successors continue
                    their work, sink deeper into the shadowy limbo of oblivion from which, on this earth, there is no
                    recall.</p>
            <p>Now the lady and the priest were, for all I know to the contrary, kindly, even good people. I may be
                    wrong. Perhaps her smile of regret when she learned what she had done was assumed; perhaps that

                    pranced about and gloated over the pyre in the backyard. For pyre it was. She burned that morning,
                    not a human soul, but the record of one. She put in her mite—and enough of them add up to
                    much—towards keeping the human race a race of animals. Dogs, I believe, have no knowledge
                    of the history of dogs. Their memories extend to their own individual experiences only, at what
                    doors they may expect the best handouts, at what hours they may reasonably plan on being taken for a
                    walk. Dogs, of whom I happen to be extremely fond, are nonetheless uncivilized beings, and partly
                    because %hey have never developed their memories to extend beyond their own time and
                    place, to take in the experiences of all dogs. They have no knowledge of the great dogs of the past,
                    no <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> dogs, or Lincoln dogs, no dog heroes or dog artists, no dogs from whose achievements
                    they may take courage and comfort, and resolution to continue. They have no recollection of a race
                    of dogs which, beginning long ago with nothing but teeth and paws, conquered the earth, and now and
                    then came so close to conquering themselves that they can still hope, no picture of dogdom in slow
                    and torturous movement towards some goal as yet unknown and undefined.</p>
            <p>Since the human race has those aspirations because it has those memories, and since those memories
                    are based upon records, whatever destroys the records of the human race destroys also, to some
                    degree, the quality of a civilization. If the Old Library at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName> had not been burned in the wars between Caesar and Pompey, if we had had ever since the
                    first century B.C. the records of that marvelous Hellenistic world which went up then in flame, we
                    would have been a little farther along than we are now.</p>
            <p>The letters of Bishop Chase or of Father Mike are not exactly the lost poems of Sappho or the
                    complete philosophic writings of Anaxagoras, but there will always be men and women who will wish
                    that they could read them. The world is a little poorer because they have been burned.</p>
            <p>These are but two instances of an almost daily holocaust. Of so much destruction through
                    deliberateness or carelessness do I keep hearing that the repetition becomes a little numbing and
                    only the more stupid stories stick in the mind: of a street commissioner shoveling out into his
                    truck the contents of the attic of a one-time public courthouse; of the <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-044-1-123"/> southern janitor, in charge of the archives, who made room for new
                    accretions by consigning to the flames the eighteenth century records of East <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>; of rats in a warehouse reducing to fodder the unique papers from which the story of a
                    pioneer business enterprise could be written. With what abandon we destroy our past, matched only
                    perhaps by the abandon with which we destroy our future—our topsoil, our forests, our
                    natural resources.</p>
            <p>Prodigal as we are of our older records, it is arguable that the frontier period of our history is
                    better known and better documented than the later, the post-Civil War period. For so long a time,
                    now some fifty years, we have been taught to say that America was unique because we shared the
                    virtues and robust culture of the frontier that we have forgotten the most astounding fact of our
                    history, which is not the frontier, but the growth of an industrial and financial might un-equaled
                    in all the records of mankind. We can trace that growth in a fashion through the newspapers, through
                    a few books, here and there through state and national documents; but the real story of it has not
                    been written. We are in the same position in regard to the growth OP business enterprise as we would
                    be in regard to political developments if we had no Supreme Court records, no records of Congress,
                    no papers of our presidents or governors—if we had nothing but campaign biographies,
                    newspaper editorials, magazine articles, and such prejudiced materials. Within recent years the
                    railroads of the country have expressed almost unanimous willingness to open their archives to
                    scholars, and in some cities a few business houses, realizing that the truth cannot on any count be
                    as damaging as the lies told about them, have undertaken to set up archives of their own and to keep
                    permanently records like board minutes, ledgers, reports of a general nature, and letters of high
                    officials.</p>
            <p>You special librarians in charge of company archives—how many of you can produce those
                    files, unbroken, from the first beginnings of your firm? Men come to me occasionally, wanting to
                    celebrate the fiftieth or hundredth anniversary of the founding of their business by a history that
                    shall be both accurate and exciting. They depart in disappointment, for the bricks of history cannot
                    be made without the straw of manuscripts, and they have none. The records of a few railroads, of at
                    least two manufacturing companies, and of at least one great newspaper have been saved in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-044-1-124"/> but no one can ever do the tremendous story of
                    the meat-packers, or of Marshall Field's, or of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>

                    </placeName>, even now approach the legendary obscurity of Charlemagne's peers, of
                    Pontiac's chieftains.</p>
            <p>Non-librarians in this audience, if there be any such, may very likely be thinking that I am making a
                    great to-do about old pieces of paper. What depths of human asininity are here being uncovered, they
                    may be saying, and why should a man fuss so about useless, forgotten stuff when the present, and the
                    future, need more thought than ever before. America did not become great through fiddling with old
                    pieces of paper, they say. Well, such critics have a point. I would be the first to admit that the
                    only countries which have done very much towards preserving manuscripts, on a national basis, are
                    the countries whose great glories now lie in the past. <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, for instance—and maybe now <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, where a National Register of Archives has just been set up, with plans for an
                    elaborate card catalogue that will let you spot at once the location of a muster roll of a militia
                    regiment in the 1790's. I don't suggest for a moment that all of us should give up
                    everything we are doing and chase old manuscripts, but I do suggest that the preservation of as much
                    of the past, out of which grew the present, as possible is one of the duties we owe to the future.</p>
            <p>Librarians know why. They, better than anyone else in the world, know the meaning of the word
                    "curiosity." They know the unquenchable and infinite variety of the questions
                    which people want answered. How erratic, how unpredictable that curiosity is! How do I make a
                    sidecar cocktail? What is the source of this quotation? Miss Jones, get me the curve of our
                    production figures in 1920. Who built that circular staircase in the old statehouse at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Iowa City</settlement>
                    </placeName>? (Who indeed, I answer parenthetically, built that staircase—who but Father
                    Mike.) And then the more serious—I shouldn't say more serious, really, because
                    every person who asks a question at a library should be presumed to be serious—but the
                    broader, more sweeping questions: "I am writing a history of the Irish in the
                    Midwest." "Where can I get material on the first steel used in bridge construction
                    in this country, with a complete chemical analysis of its composition?"
                    "I'm tracing <pb n="121" id="VAA4025-044-1-125"/> the development of tenant
                    farming, and I want some letters from farmers in each of the last four decades of the nineteenth
                    century; where may I find them?" "I'm preparing a cultural atlas of the
                    Midwest, to show the lines of variation in speech and customs in every county. What have you that
                    will help me?" "I'm concerned with the causes of price variation, and I
                    need detailed data on prices in Indiana, in every town, in every year since 1830."</p>
            <p>Those folk who think that old newspapers answer questions like these are simple indeed. They cannot
                    be answered fully except from manuscripts, and often in the strangest and most unlikely letter a
                    scholar will pick up the lost clue for which he has long searched. Librarians know well how common
                    that occurrence is, and some of them also know that books which are written out of other books, or
                    out of newspapers, or out of official documents alone are so thin as scarcely to be worth the
                    reading, and certainly not the permanent saving on library shelves. There is a connection between
                    our failure to preserve manuscript materials and the increasnig spate of so-called
                    "popular" books—I won't say there are not other reasons.</p>
            <p>Let me give you one instance of the value of manuscripts. An Eastern professor turned up at the
                    Newberry a couple of years ago with a completed typescript on the business career of Jay Gould, that
                    fabulous railroad promoter and financier of the 1870's. It had been written out of
                    newspapers because few manuscripts of Gould's were known. In our <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Archives he found such a wealth of manuscript material for one phase of
                    Gould's career, including many of Gould's own letters, that he completely rewrote
                    several chapters. One of the railway officials, who had been a little suspicious of the
                    company's decision to open the railway's central-office files to scholars, was
                    completely converted when he read the professor's revised typescript. That part written
                    from newspapers, he said, was shallow, dull and untrue, and in marked contrast to the solidity and
                    interests of the sections based on manuscripts. There is a story to tell doubting businessmen, of
                    whom there are fewer now than before, and to tell doubting Thomases in any walk of life.</p>
            <p>Let me return to "curiosity" for a moment. The only development which may curtail
                    it in the future is some form of totalitarian rule, always of course a possibility; yet even under a
                    strangling of free speech as rigidly enforced as in <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-044-1-126"/> Nazi <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> the number of scholarly books that was turned out, as evidenced by the books-in-print
                    catalogues, is surprising. In many fields a man could write what he pleased; in some others he
                    needed to include merely a bow and an upraised arm to write pretty much what he pleased. Scholarship
                    even Hitler considered one of the glories of his rule, and the best reason yet given for his refusal
                    to bomb <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> is that he hoped to see that university, under Nazi control, the center of the
                    world's learning. So the safe assumption on which to proceed is that people will be asking
                    just as many questions in the future as in the past—more of them, we hope. In some areas
                    of study, sociological history, or cultural anthropology, or psychiatry, even in history and
                    literary criticism, not to mention scientific fields where I do not pretend to keep up with
                    research, it is well known that we are only at the beginning of our studies. New
                    worlds—limitless worlds to conquer—in the greatest and most lasting war of
                    all, against ignorance. And for those searchers, now unknown and unborn, these manuscripts so
                    blithely and carelessly consigned to the flames today would have been opening vistas without end.</p>
            <p>Is it beginning to dawn upon this audience what I am suggesting Indiana librarians might do? You
                    brought down an innocent entertainer, and look at him—he is uncovering one of those
                    things known as a challenge. Well, if it be a challenge, I'll not hurl it at you. I only
                    want each of you, if you have been turning up a nose at documents, not to turn it up any more.
                    Whenever you see a man about to burn a bushel of letters, or even a peck, stop him, plead with him,
                    cajole with him. Tell him, please, for the sake of his old father, for his dear mother in the auld
                    country, not to burn until somebody who knows about manuscripts has looked them over. Better still,
                    though you may have plenty of influence in Montezuma, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ferdinand, or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, urge nonetheless the forming of a committee of those townsfolk who are interested in
                    their town. In Galena, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, an old and a great town in those parts, though no older than many an Indiana town,
                    just such a committee has recently been formed to "seize upon, sort, and appropriately
                    deposit" the town's remaining historical documents. They have printed a letterhead
                    with the names of the sponsors on it, and my guess is that there will not be a single attic in
                    Galena to which they will be denied access. This resembles a recent <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-044-1-127"/> development in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, where in Lancashire a similar committee is at last beginning to rout out and to
                    catalogue and to save not merely the routine county archives of every description, but the muniment
                    rooms of the remaining country gentry.</p>
            <p>It is my guess that the forming of such committees could be no difficult matter. After all, no one
                    lives for long in a town or even in a city without developing some pride, some affection for it. You
                    need only to tap that pride; and you need have no compunction in tapping it, no sneaking suspicion
                    that you are doing something underhanded and sly. There are still a few pure sentiments left in this
                    country, and one of them is love of your town, love of the curve of the dunes, of the bend of the
                    river, of the winter sunset across the icy fields, of the dogwood in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
                    </placeName>, and the knee-high corn in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. Patriotism does not consist of sweeping pronouncements about free enterprise, or the
                    dire lot of the underprivileged, or the necessity of developing cultural relations with the Burmese.
                    That boy in Sicily in 1943 had the right answer, when an officious interviewer asked him for what he
                    fought. "Hell," he says, "I want to get back to Walkerton and start a
                    garage." Don't mistake it; whenever patriotism is dislodged from the soil and the
                    streets to become an ideology, something terribly wrong has happened. Hoosiers know this about as
                    well as any people in the Union. There lies your path—I'm only asking you to
                    help trim its edges, make it fair.</p>
            <p>Now, before I finish, a technical word or two. Should you attempt to save everything, every scrap of
                    old paper, every letter, every ledger? In direct denial of all I've said before, I would
                    answer "no." Believing in buying printed books by a high standard of
                    selectivity—and how I believe in it; that's another speech—I believe
                    also in exercising discretion in saving manuscripts. Some of them, however old, ought to be burned.
                    There are plenty of manuscripts—let me hasten to say—that I would refuse to
                    give houseroom to. I don't really believe, for instance, that anyone a century hence will
                    be interested in a letter which says that Aunt Mary has been visiting for the last week, that the
                    Jersey cow had a calf, and that we don't know what in the world we are going to do with
                    James. Unless, of course, James' last name happens to be Riley. My point here, let me make
                    it Clear, is that nothing shall be destroyed, by your insistence <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-044-1-128"/> and help, until someone who knows about manuscripts has looked them over. If he says to burn
                    them, and your committee doesn't want to, get an advisory opinion. One expert may be wrong.
                    Beware of the isolated letter, unless it is long and full of information. The ideal manuscript
                    collection is a full run of letters and accompanying papers, vast in extent, incapable of being
                    compressed into a single book, but nourishing a succession of seekers, its riches inexhaustible. I
                    doubt if you find many such ideal collections, but I warrant also that somewhere in this state,
                    lying away in someone's attic, is hidden a day by day diary, covering a score or more of
                    years, an Indiana Pepys. When you find it, keep it.</p>
            <p>Storage of course is another problem—your problem. I don't believe at the moment
                    it matters very much where documents are stored, if only they are saved. They don't take
                    much space, unless you get fifteen tons of them at a time, as we have done in the Newberry. I am
                    always amazed to see how many letters, pressed out flat, will fit into a dust-proof box that takes
                    no more room on a shelf than a copy of <hi rend="i">Forever Amber.</hi> And there are always the
                    historical societies to which you can send your finds—that is the reason, some of you may
                    not know, for historical societies.</p>
            <p>Let your cataloguing fit your collection. With great good fortune you may acquire papers of such
                    richness that every single one of them deserves a card, and a folder, to itself. If you get such a
                    collection, I don't imagine you will begrudge the time or expense. But normally, at any
                    rate, again, for the moment, a single card in a catalogue will suffice, provided it gives the
                    character of the collection, the name of the family or company or organization concerned, the number
                    of pieces, and the dates covered.</p>
            <p>Well, there you are. There is excitement and high adventure in this business of being a librarian, if
                    you look for it. You are not dealing merely with little things, with trivia. Though I have few
                    illusions that many of you will—some of you may start down the dusty road I have drawn
                    tonight, a road very many great librarians have traveled, their names now forgotten, but their
                    memory green forever in the hearts of the curious searchers they have served.</p>
