                                                  <p> The MLA Bibliography staff has created a
                                                  thesaurus of over 50,000 terms and 200,000 names
                                                  to ensure consistency in the terms and names
                                                  assigned during indexing. The VWWP project will
                                                  utilize a subset of the MLA Thesaurus to assign
                                                  genre headings to the VWWP texts. The genre terms
                                                  are further enhanced by definitions compiled from
                                                  various sources such as <title level="m">The

                                                  <p>ONCE upon a time there lived a certain family
                                                  of the name of Skratdj. (It has a Russian or
                                                  Polish look, and yet they most certainly lived in
                                                  <placeName>England</placeName>.) They were
                                                  remarkable for the following peculiarity. They
                                                  seldom seriously quarrelled, but they never agreed
                                                  about anything. It is hard to say whether it were
                                                  more painful for their friends to hear them
                                                  constantly contradicting each other, or gratifying

                                                  and was "only their way."</p>
                                                  <p>It began with the <persName corresp="#MrSkra">father</persName> and <persName corresp="#MrsSkra">mother</persName>. They were a
                                                  worthy couple, and really attached to each other.
                                                  But they had a habit of contradicting each other's
                                                  statements, and opposing each other's opinions,
                                                  which, though mutually understood and allowed for
                                                  in private, was most trying to the by-standers in
                                                  public. If one related an anecdote, the other
                                                  would break in with half-a-dozen corrections of
                                                  trivial details of no interest or importance to
                                                  anyone, the speakers included. For instance:

                                                  contributing to the small-talk of the
                                                  dinner-table. Thus:—</p>

                                                  herself. When she was yet a bride, and young and
                                                  timid, she used to collapse when <persName corresp="#MrSkra">Mr. Skratdj</persName>
                                                  contradicted her statements, and set her stories
                                                  straight in, public. Then she hardly ever opened
                                                  her lips without disappearing under the domestic
                                                  extinguisher. But in the course of fifteen years
                                                  she had learned that <persName corresp="#MrSkra">Mr. Skratdj</persName>'s bark was a great deal
                                                  worse than his bite. (If, indeed, he had a bite at
                                                  all.) Thus snubs that made other people's ears
                                                  tingle, had no effect whatever on the lady to whom
                                                  they were addressed, for she knew exactly what
                                                  they were worth, and had by this time become
                                                  fairly adept at snapping in return. In the days
                                                  when she succumbed she was occasionally unhappy,
                                                  but now she and her husband understood each other,
                                                  and having agreed to differ, they unfortunately
                                                  agreed also to differ in public.</p>

                                                  of their domestic relations. They would interfere
                                                  with each other's conversation, contradicting

                                                  squabble at a certain distance is interesting,

                                                  range of guns. In such a position one may some day
                                                  be placed oneself! Moreover, it gives a touch of

                                                  unmarried friends thought a terrible abyss of

                                                  was a very kind master, and <persName corresp="#MrsSkra">Mrs. Skratdj</persName> was a
                                                  very kind mistress, and yet their servants lived
                                                  in a perpetual fever of irritability that just
                                                  fell short of discontent. They jostled each other

                                                  mania. He was not a brave dog, he was not a
                                                  vicious dog, and no high-breeding sanctioned his
                                                  pretensions to arrogance. But like his owners, he
                                                  had contracted a bad habit, a trick, which made

                                                  him. She said he "put her in

                                                  evening was very lively. There were a Christmas

                                                  with its welcome cakes and furmety and punch. And

                                                  which moved like the body of a snake. And the room
                                                  was full of these <persName corresp="#SnapDrag">Dragons</persName>. In the face they were like
                                                  the dragons one sees made of very old blue and
                                                  white china ; and they had forked tongues, like
                                                  the tongues of serpents. They were most beautiful
                                                  in colour, being sky-blue. Lobsters who have just

                                                  violet and indigo of a lobster's coat is nothing
                                                  to the brilliant sky-blue of a <persName corresp="#SnapDrag">Snap-Dragon</persName>.</p>
                                                  <p>How they leaped about! They were for ever

                                                  very rough kind; for as they jumped, they snapped
                                                  and barked at each other, and their barking was

                                                  other's heads with their claws, and scattered it
                                                  about the floor. And as it dropped it was like the

                                                  seemed as if part of the skin went too. But that

                                                  utterly discountenanced snapping in the nursery.
                                                  The example and admonitions of elder children are
                                                  a powerful instrument of nursery discipline, and
                                                  before long there was not a "sharp tongue" amongst
                                                  all the little Skratdjs. But I doubt if the parents ever were

                                                  accomplished. She could make very spirited
                                                  sketches, and knew how to colour them after they
                                                  were outlined and shaded in Indian ink. She had a
                                                  pleasant talent for versifying. She was very
                                                  industrious. I have it from her own lips that she
                                                  copied the figures in my picture-book from prints
                                                  in several different houses at which she visited.

                                                  which were familiar to my mind. There were Guy

                                                  get exactly what she wanted, she had a clever

                                                  people, or talking about ourselves. Why, papas and
