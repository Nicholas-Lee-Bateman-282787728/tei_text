            <byline>Darrel E. Bigham*</byline>
            <p>One of the many unfortunate side effects of war is the facility with which loyalty and race or
                    nationality are confused. Such confusion had special meaning for the thousands of Indiana's
                    German Americans during World War I, when governmental, business, and civic organizations promoted
                    the notion that Germans belonged to some subhuman species. Even those German Americans of
                    untarnished reputation were subjected to a variety of indignities, including loyalty oaths for
                    teachers of German, laws forbidding the public use of the German language, and crusades against
                    foods of German origin. Such occurrences were common in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, a city with many citizens of German ancestry. For example, prominent civic
                    leaders forced Frederick Lauen-stein, an eminent citizen and the publisher of the German language
                    daily, the <placeName>

                    Lauenstein's crime, according to his critics, was that the continued appearance of this
                    German language newspaper—published since the Civil War—was an obstacle to the
                    city's gaining the reputation of being "100 percent American."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    come to Indiana's "Cresent City" shortly thereafter. A chemist by
                    training, he found work with a retail druggist, Crawford Bell, but in 1854 he went into partnership
                    with August Carlstedt and set up a wholesale drug firm at 38 Main Street. In the same year he became
                    an American citizen. During the next forty years, his business connections in the pharmaceutical
                    trade varied. He was partner for a time with his brother-in-law, Alexander Lemcke, and later with
                    August Carlstedt and Peter Vierling. In 1890, he established Charles Leich and Company, aided by
                    Lemcke and by Carl Leich, his eldest son. The firm, which dealt primarily in wholesale drugs and
                    sundries, was situated at 117–121 Upper First Street until 1914, when it was relocated at
                    Fifth and Bond streets, occupying the building which had once housed Lemcke's <placeName>

                    and Scotch Irish establishment and took up residence in its posh riverside district. He and his

                    after wintering on the French Riviera. Like many heirs of the German revolutions of 1848, he and his
                    sons were anticlerical in religion and Republican in politics. The family had virtually no
                    connections with the city's more recent German settlers, who had immigrated between 1870
                    and 1890 and taken up residence on the city's west side. Like their father,
                    Leich's sons were interested in the wholesale drug business and, with his advancing age,
                    took a greater hand in the operation of the family firm. They too resided on either Riverside Drive

                    would receive enough financial assistance from them so that he would not tax the resources of his
                    daughters.</p>
            <p>The elder Leich's stay in his native land was complicated by two unforeseen events. In
                    February, 1914, Ida's husband died, leaving her with only moderate means of support, and
                    thus the sending of funds to her father, who was staying with her in Flensburg, a city in
                    Schleswig-Holstein near the Danish border, became even more important than before. On March 20,
                    1914, moreover, Ida wrote Walter and his wife that her father would not be able to return to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> because of ill health and old age. "At his age," she warned,
                    "it does not take much to bring about a change, or rather every illness or excitement shows
                        doubly."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Hence she decided it was better for him to remain with
                    her. The outbreak of the war in Europe in the summer of 1914 added a final obstacle to
                    Leich's return. While the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> remained officially neutral, however, the State Department permitted the family to
                    transmit funds to him. As late as October 28, 1916, Undersecretary of State Frank L. Polk took a
                    personal hand in insuring that $1,000.00 reached Leich. It seems clear that the
                    relationship of Clarence Leich and Secretary of State Lansing had been an asset in this matter, for
                    such a high ranking official as Polk would not ordinarily have been involved in such an apparently
                    trivial matter.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The advent of American involvement in the war on April 6, 1917, changed everything. The breaking of
                    diplomatic relations in February had made communication between Charles Leich and his sons nearly
                    impossible, despite Leich's deteriorating condition, and the state of war increased the

            <p>The reply of the State Department, although direct, was not at all pleasing, for it established harsh
                    terms under which the brothers would have to operate for the next eighteen months. The chief of the
                    State Department Bureau of Accounts, William McNeir, stated that Lansing had instructed him to
                    advise that "owing to the severance of diplomatic relations … the Department can
                    only accept funds for such American citizens therein, as desire to return to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> …." Should it be so desired, the State Department would
                    "endeavor to transmit a sufficient amount through the Spanish Ambassador at
                        Berlin."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing that Lansing would prove to be difficult to persuade in wartime, Carl asked Congressman George
                    K. Denton, an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Democrat, to do "anything you may be able to do." He explained the
                    plight of his father and added that, although the brothers had sought in February to remove their
                    father to a neutral country, their sister Ida had wired that "the authorities would respect
                    his age."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Denton replied on May 28 that he had taken up the matter
                    with Henry D. Flood, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, but then he wrote on June 6
                    that Flood had been unhelpful. Denton added that he had personally called on Lansing, who declared
                    it was impossible to permit any money to be sent to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, for "no matter to whom the money is sent, it will be spent there and <placeName>

                    </placeName> will thereby profit to that extent." Lansing also said that Charles Leich was

                    through the family of Judge Foster but to no avail." Lansing had noted that "your

            </p>
            <p>Unwilling to relent, Carl wrote Lansing on June 8 and requested that the State Department at least
                    advise his father "through the Spanish Ambassador at Berlin that if he will move to a

                    Lansing on June 18 that the department needed more information, but another official wrote several
                    days later that the department could do nothing because the person involved was not an American
                    citizen. Charles Leich, it was alleged, had lost his citizenship by the presumption of expatriation,
                    since he had not applied for a new passport while in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. Carl immediately consulted Denton about the matter and also sought the advice of his
                    youngest brother, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chester</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who had visited his father in early 1916. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chester</settlement>
                    </placeName> suggested requesting the name of the former American consul at Hamburg, through whom
                    Charles Leich had in 1916 sought to obtain a passport renewal. The State Department wrote that the
                    official, Francis R. Stewart, had since become vice consul at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vera Cruz</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mexico. On July 5, Carl wrote asking Stewart if he remembered his father's
                    seeking a passport renewal and noted that the reply would help to disprove the allegation of the
                    State Department that Charles Leich had renounced his citizenship. Meanwhile, Carl wrote Denton on

                    several days later he asked Denton to transmit another statement, in which was included a letter
                    recently received from former Consul Stewart, who remembered that Charles Leich had "had a
                    valid passport when I left or had recently applied for one." Stewart added that Leich
                    "was in no condition of health to make a journey to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> the last time I saw him, late in 1916." He suggested this fact be brought to
                    the attention of the State Department, since "the applicant's residence abroad is
                    in good faith for reasons of health and he eventually intends to return to the <placeName>

                    not go to some neutral country, this will be the last remittance they will permit to be sent to

            <p>On August 9, Lansing wrote Denton that the information provided him was sufficient to prove that
                    "Charles Leich is a naturalized citizen of German origin, and … that the
                    Department is of the opinion that he is in a position to overcome the statutory presumption of
                    expatriation …." He indicated that Carl's check for $300.00
                    was being sent to the Spanish government via the American ambassador at Madrid. The Spanish would
                    then transmit the sum to their representative in Berlin. Lansing added, however, that the elder
                    Leich would be informed by the Spanish officials that "his son will send further
                    remittances to him only in case he proceeds to some neutral country." The Spanish
                    ambassador in Berlin was being authorized to "take Mr. Leich's application for an
                    emergency passport of this Government to facilitate his departure."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                    Despite Lansing's help in conveying a message and a sum of $300.00, the State
                    Department had maintained its insistence that Charles Leich should—and
                    could—leave <placeName>

            <p>The partial settlement of that crisis proved to be much easier for the Leichs than the handling of
                    subsequent challenges to their father's loyalty. On October 6, 1917, Congress passed the
                    Trading with the Enemy Act to "define, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy, and for
                    other purposes." The terms "enemy" and "ally of enemy"

                    In addition, all contracts entered into with such companies before April, 1917, could be abrogated.
                    Creditors of those companies would then have to file claims with the custodian. All money received

                    Alien Property Custodian, A. Mitchell Palmer, to declare that a part of the company's
                    assets was owned by his sisters, who by their marriages had become German citizens. In each letter
                    the writer asserted that the Leichs had "no desire nor method of paying over to them [the
                    sisters] these sums or any part of them during the duration of the war …. We can see no
                    harm to this government in leaving these sums on deposit with us and it would necessitate our
                    borrowing this money elsewhere if we were obliged to pay it over to a U.S. Custodian."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> He also informed Palmer, in another letter, that his father, who some might
                    consider an enemy because he happened to live in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, was in fact an unfortunate victim of circumstances. To prove this, he quoted the State
                    Department's position given in July. His father's interest in the firm, he added,
                    was the largest of any partner, and the surrender of that share would force the business to close.
                    On October 23, 1917, the assistant secretary of the treasury notified Carl that his department was
                    not responsible for such matters, but four days later Palmer wrote curtly that complete information
                    both on the sisters' shares in the firm and on Charles Leich's situation had to be
                    supplied on proper application forms.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the basis of the information supplied, but unknown to Carl or his brothers, Palmer's
                    Bureau of Investigation determined in December that Charles Leich, an "alien
                    enemy," had interest in the company totalling $133,414.57. The Alien Property
                    Custodian's Bureau of Trusts then proceeded in January, 1918, to inform Leich's
                    insurance company that under the terms of the Trading with the Enemy Act all insurance benefits and
                    dividends belonging to this "enemy" had to be reported to the custodian and held

                            trade or enemy ownership. See, for example, the Alien Property Custodian, Bureau of

                    assistant director of the Bureau of Trusts, in response to a query from the War Trade Board, stated
                    that Charles Leich and Company was "a partnership with an enemy interest which partnership
                    has not applied for license to continue in business."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The Alien
                    Property Custodian, in a word, was proceeding with an investigation not only of the sisters but also
                    of the father without acknowledging that Charles Leich was in fact an American citizen stranded in
                    his native land.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the response of Charles Leich's sons to both problems—communication
                    with their father and control of the firm—was complicated by information received from
                    Congressman Denton on November 19, 1917. Undersecretary of State Polk had notified Denton that the
                    American embassy in Madrid had been advised by the Spanish government that the elder Leich had
                    received both the money and the message that he was to depart for some neutral country. The Spanish
                    reported, however, that Leich was unable to travel and provided a medical certificate as proof.
                    Leich was so old and infirm that "he was not able to undertake a short journey to Hamburg
                    to report the details of his case to the [Spanish] Consul." Not only his bodily infirmities
                    but also his declining mental faculties meant that it was "out of the question that he will
                    ever be able to move from his present home." Accordingly, the Spanish embassy in Berlin
                    recommended that the State Department "see its way to permit the continued remittance from
                    his son to the old gentlemen [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] in his decline."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                    With that additional information, the brothers on December 3 requested of Palmer that their father
                    "should not be considered an enemy as he lived practically all of his life in this country
                    and was always a loyal American and a good citizen, and we hope that it will not be necessary <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Despite these pleas, more difficulties emerged. Carl was notified on December 11 by Thomas Francis of
                    the Bureau of Enemy Trade, War Trade Board, that he would have to complete appropriate application
                    forms and return them to that office before any other messages or money could be sent to his father.
                    This development indicated that the State Department was no longer involved directly in the case.
                    After Carl complied with this new agency's requirements, Francis wrote on December 21 that
                    he should send any letter he wished transmitted to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> to the Bureau of Enemy Trade, which would then decide whether a license was to be
                    granted so that the message could go through. On December 24, Carl sent Francis a lengthy letter to
                    be forwarded to his sister Ida.</p>
            <p>Unaware of Carl's communications with Francis, another officer of the Bureau of Enemy Trade,
                    F. M. McGonigal, requested that Carl fill out more application blanks for sending a message but in
                    the same letter informed him that a license had been granted for sending additional funds. In the
                    future, Carl was instructed, it would be necessary to apply to McGonigal's department for a
                    license for each additional remittance. On January 4, 1918, a license to transmit money was sent
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and three days later Carl wrote out a check for $300.00 and returned it to
                    the Bureau of Enemy Trade. On January 25, William McNeir, chief of the Bureau of Accounts of the
                    State Department, informed Carl that the sum had been sent but in his letter listed Ida's
                    address incorrectly as Hamburg rather than Flensburg. Carl wrote immediately that there had been a
                    mistake, but McNeir responded that the address used was the one Carl had provided and that if an
                    error had occurred Carl, and not he, was responsible.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> In any event, there was

            <p>To complicate matters further, McGonigal of the Bureau of Enemy Trade wrote on January 23 that
                    "we find that under present conditions it is impossible for us to transmit for you your
                    letter to Mrs. Schnak [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>." The reason given was that Charles Leich was "a German
                        subject."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Upon receiving this information, Carl sent a brief but
                    bewildered reply, reminding the bureau that Leich's citizenship had already been
                    acknowledged by the State Department. After apparently checking with the State Department, the
                    bureau did grant Carl a license to communicate with his father, in care of his sister Ida, on
                    January 31. Included in the license was a copy of the message which was in fact sent to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. Parapharased from Carl's original long letter, it was only a few lines in
                    length: "All of your children and their families are well. No births or deaths in the
                    family except brother Clarence's father-in-law [John H. Foster] died last summer. <placeName>

                    made two remittances to you of three hundred dollars each."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The problem of communication, however unclearly resolved, did not recur during the remainder of 1918,
                    but it proved small compared with a new crisis which began on March 1. On that day, F. J. Home,
                    assistant director of the Bureau of Trusts in the office of the Alien Property Custodian, demanded
                    delivery of the shares in Charles Leich and Company of the sisters, Ida and Anna, whom
                    Palmer's agency had determined were enemies of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> under the terms of the Trading with the Enemy Act. On March 5, Carl wrote Congressman
                    Denton that it was his "impression that it is altogether a matter of discretion with the
                    custodian whether to demand transfer of such property or to leave it in the hands of those
                    previously holding it." In his case there was "no means or any desire to send this
                    money to an enemy country and the hardship would fall on <list type="footnotes">

                            All told, the family requested licenses six times from the bureau and received approval in
                            each instance. According' to the records of the bureau, licenses to send either
                            money or messages were granted December 28, 1917; January 2, 31, March 22, July 11, and

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> businesses, would "be expected to buy additional amounts of Liberty Bonds and
                    also pay considerable sums in the way of Excess Profit and Income Taxes." The shares
                    requested by Palmer had been no "temporary deposit to be used for purposes inimical to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government" but had been "a permanent loan or deposit used in
                    carrying on and extending our business …."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> On the same day
                    he also wrote Palmer that Denton "will no doubt confer with you regarding the matter in a
                    few days. We beg to assure you that we are at all times willing and anxious to conform to all
                    demands …."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite Denton's efforts to alter the ruling of the Alien Property Custodian, on March 18
                    the congressman informed Carl that Palmer felt no exception could be made in this case. Palmer,
                    whose reply to Denton on March 16 was attached to Denton's letter to Carl, had declared
                    that the two cases of the sisters "clearly come within the class designated by Congress as
                    enemies in the Trading with the Enemy Act." Denton noted that he had "explained to
                    them that it might cripple a firm to take this money out, but they say that under the law they have
                    no option in the matter." If it could be shown that Charles Leich and Company would be
                    ruined and that it could not borrow the money elsewhere, he added, "I might be able to get
                    the ruling modified, but otherwise, we seem to be up against it."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> On
                    March 19, the Bureau of Trusts notified the company that there must be "a forthwith
                    compliance with the demand heretofore made upon you."<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The brothers made a final appeal to Palmer on March 21, when they stated that, since "all of
                    the active members of this firm have done hard work in the Liberty Loan campaigns and subscribed
                    liberally for the bonds," it would be fair to "expect [the company] to do the same
                    thing with the prospective issue …." They suggested that "you permit

                    Hence, they argued, "we will have done our share and can hold up our heads among our

                    commendable, was unacceptable, and he repeated his previous demand for the sisters' shares
                    of the firm. On April 1, the firm sent the sum, amounting to nearly $4,200.00, to
                    Palmer's office, where the money was to be invested in government war bonds in the name of
                    the Alien Property Custodian.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the next several months, the Leichs attempted to maintain their company as best they could,
                    while participating actively in the war effort. One brother, Clarence, showed his patriotism by
                    going to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to become associate director of purchases, division of supplies, at American Red Cross
                    headquarters, for the salary of one dollar a year. Carl, Herbert, and Walter remained in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and continued periodically to apply to the War Trade Board for licenses to transmit
                    money to their father. During the spring and summer of 1918 they encountered no difficulties with
                    that agency and heard nothing more from the Alien Property Custodian. It appeared that their
                    troubles with the wartime bureacracies had been ended.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The relatively placid atmosphere was shattered, however, by three events. First, on June 11, L. F.
                    Spear, deputy commissioner of internal revenue, wrote to Charles Leich at his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> address a letter asserting that Leich owed $30.00 on his 1915 tax return,
                    because, "as it appears from your return that you are a non-resident alien, the specific
                    exemption of $3000 has been disallowed."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Carl Leich wrote
                    on his father's behalf to Spear's superior on June 13, saying that the additional
                    tax would not be paid. It "is not so much the amount of additional tax of $30.00
                    involved as the principle that he is an American citizen," Carl wrote, and he enclosed
                    Lansing's letter of August 9, 1917, as proof of his father's <list type="footnotes">

                    it was his purpose to "establish his [father's] citizenship rather than to save

            </p>
            <p>The second distressing event was the news that Leich's health was worsening. The State
                    Department informed the family on June 24 that the Spanish government had reported that
                    "the old gentleman … is very grateful for the news from his children and will be
                    glad of the assistance of the American Legation in transmitting a message on his behalf
                    …." The report stated that he was "fairly well and cheerful,"
                    considering his age, but added that "his decay both bodily and mentally has advanced
                    considerably of late …."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither of these developments was as traumatic as the letter received on Monday morning, September
                    23, from Joseph F. Guffey, director of the Bureau of Sales of the Alien Property
                    Custodian's office. Guffey demanded no less than "the right, title, and interest
                    of Charles Leich, of Flensburg, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, in your firm." To facilitate the work of his department, which was located in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The reply of the brothers to Guffey was immediate and frank. Writing for the company, Walter Leich

                    a certified copy of the partnership agreement but asked for a special investigation of the
                    company's case, as allowed under section 7(c) of the Trading with the Enemy Act. He
                    repeated the various ways in which his father's citizenship and loyalty had already been
                    proved and noted the impossibility, because of old age and illness, of his father's leaving <placeName>

                    </placeName>. He reaffirmed the loyalty of himself and his brothers and requested that Guffey
                    "bear in mind that the reputation of a strictly American firm might suffer great damage by
                    being mentioned in connection with the Alien Property Custodian, thereby having the suspicion of
                    Pro-German leanings cast upon it by its customers."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This crisis should not have been wholly a surprise, for the brothers should have been alerted by a
                    letter from Home of the Bureau of Trusts on March 27, in which Horne had requested further
                    information about the elder Leich. Carl had sent the required details and for the next five months
                    had heard nothing more of the matter.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> But during that time, while the nation
                    was being urged as never before to give unselfishly to the war effort and Congress was passing such
                    comprehensive legislation as the Sedition Act, designed to end antiwar conversation, the various war
                    agencies were intensifying their activities. Exemplary of the new energy of the Alien Property
                    Custodian's office was a bulletin from that agency, doubtless released wdth
                    Palmer's approval, which was published in the September 14, 1918, issue of <hi rend="i">Literary Digest.</hi> The bulletin announced that, since millions of dollars of enemy owned
                    property had been disguised by "Teutonic camouflages," it was the duty of every
                    loyal citizen to communicate "any knowledge, or even any well-grounded suspicion"
                    of such camouflage. Although 140 firms, including the Bayer Chemical Company, Merck and Company, and
                    the Hayden Chemical Works, had already been taken into custody, the author of the bulletin declared
                    the fight was not over, <list type="footnotes">

                            interest in the business was delivered to the Alien Property Custodian's General
                            Business Office on May 31, and late in the summer it was turned over to the Bureau of
                            Investigation, Office of Alien Property. See Guffey to Horne, October 7, 1918, Alien

                    disguised the control which it had accrued over every vital American industry before 1917. Because
                    the expanse of the enemy conspiracy was enormous, it was "the duty of every 100 per cent.
                    American to keep his eyes and ears open for any clue, no matter how slight, that may lead to the
                    detection of money and property of enemy character." Even "rumor or
                    gossip" should be reported, since the "simplest rumor may be a lead to a large
                    amount of enemy-owned property." The Trading with the Enemy Act, the writer asserted,
                    allowed no exemptions—"American citizens included"—under its
                    definition of enemy and enemy ally, but it depended for its implementation upon the individual
                    citizen who was willing to be alert for possible enemy owned companies, money, or property
                    interests. Any firm or minority interests which the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> took over would "be sold at public auction and the money therefrom invested in
                    Liberty bonds." Therefore do not "let a single dollar of enemy-owned money or
                    property get away," the writer urged. "Help ferret it out, so that more
                    ammunition, more food, and more of the other things so necessary for the success of American arms
                    can be sent to the men on the firing line."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> In another public
                    statement, Palmer himself argued for government confiscation of enemy owned factories at the end of
                    the war, not merely retention of custody until the conflict was over. "The government finds
                    itself with a large organization at its own expense preserving property," he said, property
                    "which was placed here originally as a hostile act looking to the conquest of
                        America."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The amount of work that was being generated in Palmer's office is evident in the number of
                    complaints written by lower level officials to their superiors in which there were frequent
                    descriptions of evening and Sunday hours. This increased activity clearly reflected
                    Palmer's desire to make his work completely successful. At a meeting of Alien Property
                    Custodian officials on July 12, 1918, Palmer stiffened previous policy, saying that he would
                    "not intervene unless the enemy's claim appears to be meritorious and
                        substantial."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> As a result, in the late summer and early fall of

                    demands be honored. On August 29, Guffey of the Bureau of Sales wrote Home of the Bureau of Trusts
                    requesting a list of all companies which had not complied with previous services of demand, and on
                    September 11 Home sent the list to Guffey.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Shortly thereafter, a number of
                    firms, including Leich and Company, were contacted by Guffey and requested to comply.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>On October 2, in the face of a challenge which could all but destroy the company and dishonor the
                    family name, Walter Leich wrote Guffey to inform him that his brother Clarence, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in his capacity as an official of the Red Cross, would soon be contacting the office of
                    the Bureau of Trusts and that in the near future all correspondence would be with either Home or
                    Palmer. The situation was made even more urgent as the result of notice received shortly thereafter
                    from Francis P. Garvan, head of Palmer's Bureau of Investigations, to the effect that
                    because of the need for increased revenue in wartime the Trading with the Enemy Act had been amended
                    to allow the Alien Property Custodian virtually a free hand in deciding what to do with the property
                    he secured. Particularly distressing was Garvan's remark that the amended legislation
                    permitted the sale of enemy property at public auction.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Immediate and decisive
                    action was required to save the company and the family reputation.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, Herbert Leich travelled to <placeName>

                    custody. On Friday, October 4, the two visited Palmer's office, and, although Palmer was
                    absent, his secretary surprised the brothers by stating that their case was extremely strong and
                    that the evidence justified a favorable decision without the director's personal approval.
                    Upon hearing that, Herbert sent a telegram to <list type="footnotes">

                    office, the Bureau of Trusts, and were amazed to discover that none knew much about the matter and
                    that they were not even familiar with the various decisions concerning the citizenship of Charles
                    Leich. The three lawyers agreed that the case needed further investigation. One of them suggested,
                    as Clarence wrote on Saturday to Walter, that the brothers buy out their father's interest.
                    The attorneys also agreed after considerable discussion to consult documents left by Clarence and
                    Herbert and to return a decision on Monday, October 7. After hearing that, Clarence proceeded to
                    Lansing's office, where he arranged to see the secretary of state on Monday morning. As he
                    wrote to Walter, <text>

            <p>Writing to his wife, Herbert Leich was less charitable than Clarence towards Palmer's

                    Home, Whittaker, and Kinella, he and his brother had become "red hot and had to force
                    ourselves not to fly up in a rage," and when the Leichs "painted to them the
                    distress and ruin that would follow, they simply said 'that's the law and

                    stated to Clarence that the two should consult Lansing and made reference to the fact that secretary
                    was a cousin by marriage. This remark "made the triumvirate sort of sit up and take
                    notice." Herbert commented that he thought "our form of government is molded too
                    much by lawyers who like to 'get their records complete,' as these fellows said,
                    and a strong injection of business common sense is badly needed." If necessary, he
                    declared, "we will try to carry the case up to the President." Whatever the
                    result, he added, "we would certainly like to see that bunch get a good 'bawling

            <p>In the meantime, according to Herbert, the brothers in the nation's capital spent Monday
                    seeking an end to the crisis. At 9:30 that morning Clarence telephoned Lansing's office,
                    and the secretary of state's private secretary, Richard Crane, inquired with whom the two
                    had been dealing in Palmer's office. When Clarence replied it had been Horne, Crane said
                    that he knew him. While Clarence held the phone, Crane went in to discuss the matter with Lansing
                    and returned with the news that he was going to telephone a Mr. Davis in Palmer's office
                    and to indicate to him that the custodian ought "to go very slow in this matter and not to
                    take any action unless they were absolutely sure of being right." At 11:45, the brothers

                    ought to have taken a common sense approach to the case instead of being so legalistic, and he
                    promised to discuss the case with Palmer at noon. The two Leichs were then to meet Davis in
                    Horne's office at 3:00.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

            <p>When the brothers saw Horne, he insisted he had already met with Palmer the previous Saturday,
                    October 5, and had been instructed to defer action on the Leich case until March 1, 1919, and to
                    allow periodic extensions of the deadline thereafter. Home showed them an order to that effect,
                    dated October 5 and signed by Palmer. In turn, the brothers were asked to accept the service of
                    demand, even though "this was only to complete … [the bureau's]
                    records" and would not effect the Leich's title to the firm. On October 8, Davis
                    telephoned Clarence to assure him that nothing more would come of the matter. It seems possible that
                    Lansing's acquaintance with Clarence and his personal help on October 7 had influenced the
                    Alien Property Custodian, despite Horne's assurances that Palmer's decision on the
                    Leich case had been made earlier. It must also have been helpful that on Monday the State Department
                    had been informed the Central Powers had accepted Wilson's Fourteen Points, thus, for all
                    practical purposes, ending the war.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly thereafter, both the Bureau of Trusts and the Bureau of Sales of the Alien Property Custodian
                    confirmed in writing the postponement of action on the Leich case. On October 17, Guffey informed
                    the company that Palmer's <placeName>

                            Alien Property Custodian, there is no written evidence of a conversation between Lansing and
                            Palmer or of Palmer's order dated October 5, although one suspects that there was a
                            telephone conversation or meeting between Horne and Palmer or between Palmer and Lansing on
                            October 5 or the morning of October 7. That the decision to defer action was made before the
                            Leich brothers visited Horne on Monday afternoon is reinforced by a letter from Horne to
                            Guffey, dated October 7, in which he informed Guffey of the decision to delay action. He
                            noted "Mr. Leich will call at this office today and we will obtain the service of

                    communication with Charles Leich, however, was fully resolved. An additional sum of
                    $300.00 was permitted to be sent to <placeName>

                    </placeName> on October 25, but on January 13, 1919, Carl requested permission to send a message and
                    $1,000.00 more to his father, since he had been informed that the elderly gentleman
                    needed the constant attention of a trained nurse. In March, after having received no response,
                    Clarence wrote a similar request, only to be informed that with the cession of hostilities the
                    Bureau of Enemy Trade's jurisdiction in cases of communication with residents of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> had been transferred to the State Department. After forwarding the money through the
                    proper channels, Carl was notified by a second assistant secretary of state that the sum had been
                    sent via the American ambassador at Berne, <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>

                    man, the State Department was also unable to indicate, until July 15, 1919, whether any messages had
                    ever actually been received by or sent from the elderly Leich. At that time it confirmed that his
                    health was failing rapidly, although he was well cared for.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

                    Leich's interest in the firm was lifted—Over three years after the end of the

                    Leich's share in the firm prevented the execution of his will until March 11, 1922, when
                    Alexander G. Bentley, head of the Division of Trusts, wrote that since it had finally been proved
                    that Charles Leich was an American citizen and that his heirs were therefore "eligible as
                    claimants under Section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Act," the government had decided to
                    withdraw the demand" for custody of his share of the firm. Several times in the letter,
                    Bentley referred to Charles Leich as "the enemy." The effect of this decision,
                    Bentley informed the Leich brothers, was "to permit you and all others concerned to govern
                    yourselves with respect to that property without restriction from this office."<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

            <p>Although Charles Leich and Company survived its wartime threat from the federal government and
                    although the family was able to have some communication with the elderly gentleman, the bewildering
                    legacy of their struggle, like the legacy of the loyalty tests faced by thousands of other German
                    Americans, remained. So far as the Alien Property Custodian was concerned, Charles Leich died as an
                    enemy of the country in which he had held citizenship for over seventy years. When compared with the
                    enormousness of the war effort, both home and abroad, the Leich case might have <list type="footnotes">

                    incomplete without control of even this small company. The problems faced by the firm, the sons, and
                    the father were partially the result of the broad definition of enemy given in the Trading with the
                    Enemy Act and partially the effect of Lansing's earlier insistence that the aged, infirm
                    man travel to a neutral country so that his income would not in any way aid the German government.
                    Yet, although certain federal departments—notably the State Department, the War Trade
                    Board, and the Internal Revenue Service—ultimately recognized the citizenship of the aged
                    man and made allowance for his plight, for some reason the Alien Property Custodian's
                    office continued to describe Charles Leich as an enemy even after it decided not to assume control
                    of his interest in the wholesale drug firm. If Leich had not been ill and aged, moreover, it is
                    possible that his fate, and that of his company, might well have been worse. It also seems clear
                    that the timely news of the German and Austrian peace overtures, as well as the relationship of
                    Clarence Leich to Robert Lansing, were of great value to the Leichs in their struggle with the
                    bureaucracy. The affair would not be forgotten by a firm established by a man who, at the age of
                    eighty-six, died in his native land as a presumed enemy of his adopted one and whose sons had to
                    undergo a series of challenges to keep in touch with him in his last days, uphold his honor, and
                    save the business he had founded. It is ironic that all this should have occurred shortly after
                    President Wilson, speaking on Memorial Day in 1916, had insisted that Americans should
                    "love the places of their birth and the sources of their origin. We do not wish them to
                    forget their mothers and fathers, running back through laborious generations, who have taken part in
                    building up the strength and spirit of other nations."<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

                            the Conine family letters. The complete, original Conine letters, in addition to

            <p>Letters which the disperse members of the Conine family wrote to Mary Ann are now in the possession
                    of her granddaughter, Ruth Seymour Burmester of Reedsburg, <placeName>

                    between 1849 and 1851 and published in the December issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of

                    midnineteenth century America. The subjects which occupied the Conines' attention in this
                    second group of letters, as in the first, are the everyday events of the farmhouse, school-house,
                    and meetinghouse, the three centers of pioneer life. The affairs of the hearth—marriage,
                    birth, the struggle for a livelihood, the hope of prosperity, death—are the constant
                    concerns of these narratives as they were of the writers' lives.</p>
            <p>One respect in which this second collection of Conine letters differs somewhat from that previously
                    published is the amount of attention given to religion. The church at Burke Hill in <placeName>

                    Methodist Episcopal Church's Genesee Annual Conference, a district troubled throughout the
                    1850s by conflict between conservative and liberal groups of clergy and laity. The conservatives,
                    called "Nazarites" by their opponents, felt that American Methodism's
                    ever greater accession of members, wealth, and influence during the first half of the nineteenth
                    century was being attended by increasing materialism and a dangerous blurring of the stark witness
                    of the earliest followers of John Wesley regarding purity of personal living, simplicity of worship,
                    and some points of Christian doctrine and experience. They vigorously set to work to stem
                    "the oncoming flood of worldliness,"<hi rend="sup">3</hi> forcefully denounced
                    what they saw as "an accommodating, compromising policy, pandering to the vices of the

                    brethren, whose motives for opposition ranged from heartfelt disagreement on doctrine to fear that
                    the Nazarites' stringent rules of personal behavior and campmeeting revival methods would
                    "drive away men of influence <hi rend="i">needed tot the Church.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">5</hi> During the early stages of this controversy, in 1853 and 1854, the Burke Hill
                    meeting was served by one of the foremost Nazarite preachers, William C. Kendall, who was assisted
                    during part of that time by his father-in-law John H. Wallace, a persuasive orator of the holiness
                    school. The letters of Jane Conine during this period give an intimate view of the influence of
                    Kendall and Wallace upon the Burke Hill congregation and, in particular, upon Jane herself, an
                    impressionable young woman of twenty.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>The Conine family letters provide no deep insights into what many observers would consider the
                    important movements, events, and personalities of the day. Politics and politicians are completely
                    absent from the correspondence, for example, nor is there any mention of the burning issues of
                    slavery and sectionalism. Yet there is value in the letters' very ordinariness, in their
                    unwavering focus on their writers' day to day lives and concerns. From such testaments one
                    can begin to understand the essential character of that preeminent nineteenth century phenomenon,
                    the American pioneer.</p>

                        the Methodist Episcopal Church and the formation of the Free Methodist Church on Nazarite
                        principles in 1860. Local Methodist Episcopal congregations split when many lay persons and some
                        preachers of Nazarite sympathies withdrew, or in some cases were expelled, and joined the new
                        denomination. About twenty-five people, including Delia Jeffres and other members of the Jeffres
                        family so often mentioned in the Conine correspondence, were "read out" of the
                        Burke Hill meeting. See Donald E. Poste, "Centennial of the First Free Methodist Church

                                            that Jane Conine was writing in haste. This and other sentences are
                                            obviously unfinished. Delia Jeffres was a daughter of Thomas H. and Palmyra
                                            Jeffres of Perry Township. She was about twenty-six years old in 1853.
                                            Others who can be identified as members of this family are Delia's
                                            brothers Christopher, Clarn, John, Ezra and Elam (twins), Eugene, and
                                            Thomas; her younger sister Frances; and Betsey, who may have been
                                            Delia's sister or perhaps sister-in-law. All except the younger

                                    &amp; felt that I was called upon to decide my eternal destiny. I saw plainly my
                                    position, the consequences of my deciding. O! you cannot imagine what I
                                    endured, for nearly two week I remained in this state. Bro—Kendall plead

                                    &amp; truly speaking, I think I suffered more than to die a natueral death. I
                                    remember of saying to Bro K at one time, I am diing by inchies. He laughing said
                                    that is just what we want, die to sin that you may live unto God. At this point I
                                    had given up all but one thing. When ever I attempted to pray that article was hung

                  <hi rend="sup">47</hi> John Wesley, in his sermon "On Dress," denounced the
                        wearing of rich clothing, expensive adornment, and gold ornamentation on the grounds that such
                        things engendered pride, vanity, and anger; tended to create and inflame lust; and diverted the
                        Christian's attention from the divine to the profane. See John Wesley, <hi rend="i">Sermons on Several Occasions</hi> (3 vols., <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                        </placeName>, 1818), II, 423-33. Until 1856 the Methodist Episcopal Discipline charged
                        Methodists to "receive none into the church till they have left off superfluous
                        ornaments" and ordered ministers to read Wesley's sermon "at least
                        once a year in every society." By the 1850s, the extent to which preachers insisted on
                        compliance with this rule was one of the characteristics which distinguished Nazarites from
                        their more liberal colleagues. In 1856 the Discipline was altered so that the explicit
                        prohibition of costly array was dropped and the required reading of Wesley's sermon was
                        replaced by a recommendation that "all our people be exhorted to conform to the
                        spirit" of simplicity of dress and adornment. Nazarites regarded this change as one of
                        several indications of the increasing worldliness of the Methodist Episcopal Church. See
                        Marston, <hi rend="i">From Age to Age a Living Witness</hi>, 146-49. Marston quotes the
                        Discipline on page 147.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi rend="sup">48</hi> Methodism from Wesley's time had "maintained the
                        distinction between justification, wherein power is received to live without committing sin, and
                        entire sanctification, where the inner impulses to sin are purged away." By the
                        midnineteenth century liberal churchmen were inclined to regard sanctification as something
                        acquired gradually through self discipline, and they favored admitting
                        "seekers" into full Methodist fellowship. Conservatives regarded
                        sanctification as an instantaneous "work of grace through the Holy Spirit changing the
                        core of a man's being," and they wished to make evidence of the

                                    preachers. We have Mr Wallace &amp; Kendall, the former is much smarter, than he
                                    used to be. he has preached here three times, &amp; stayed with us to nights, we

                                    O! how I love to talk with him. the last time he was here, we had quite a

                                    I did not think, I had any call, or I would. I wonder that he &amp; Kendall do
                                    not both get discouraged with me. but I guess <hi rend="b">he</hi> has not, for he
                                    went from our house, to John Saffords &amp; told him he should see me again.

                                    about your tall corn but if it beat ours it must have got up pretty tol. I never saw

                        <p>Finds me the sole occupant of our little room, "the south chamber."
                                    it looks very much like old times, so much so that I think you could feel quite at
                                    home here. O! those wer happy days! but we knew it not, then
                                    as now. sweet yet painful reccollections, are they. Truly has it been said of life,
                                    "tis a dream" when I detect myself living those days over, for a
                                    moment I almost think I an dreaming, but a second thought remooves this delusion and
                                    numarous[?] facts present themselves to prove it a reality. For some
                                    reason I feel wonderfully iritable to night &amp; noise confuses me.
                                    how! I wish our folks would stop talking &amp; take a journey to the
                                    land of Nod. I may attribute my feelings to my rather poor health the same reason
                                    answers for my being at home now. I only stayed half of the spring term. I have a
                                    pain in my head the most of the time &amp; I find rest quite beneficial. I have
                                    had to much to do since I came home for my good but hope now that house cleaning is
                                    through with to give more attention to myself. I am but a poor peice of machinery
                                    &amp; I think I am concious that even now the material is on the decay. My head
                                    aches so Mary I shall have to leave this until an other time. It is only in the back
                                    part that I feel the pain &amp; that at times becomes almost numb. I never have
                                    said anything to our folks about it &amp; ought not to have writen it to you.
                                    dont give yourself any uneasiness about it. I am quite confident of feeling better
                                    ere long. Good night Mary &amp; may we both arise on the morrow with renewd

                        <p>Again will spend a short time with you, Mary. on reviewing the above I am surprised
                                    at the sickliness of the language, writing from the impulse of the moment is a bad
                                    practice for one of my temperament, but enough of this. We are to have a
                                    Camp-meeting to commence July 5th on the same ground occopied last year.
                                    Notwithstanding Rev Wallace tells me I had better run away just bfore that time, I
                                    am looking forward to it with much pleasure: he says it will be to hot for me, and

                                    well he has brought a good share of the church over to his belief, &amp; the way
                                    he &amp; they pelt away upon me is truly astonashing.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> evry

                                    will be unnessary to say any thing to you, but I make it a rule never to leave
                                    untill his phir contracts. I am surprised that he should take such an intrest in one
                                    like myself, how I wish you could have heard him pray for me two weeks ago tomorrow
                                    night. I almost played the <hi rend="b">woman</hi> under that prayer. Mary, I do
                                    dress plain, waring no ornaments of any description neither do I want to, but there
                                    is a certain few who have imbibed the belief that we must not ware a bit of edging
                                    &amp; triming of any kind &amp; because <hi rend="i">I WILL</hi>, believe me
                                    to be almost a monster. I think some go a little beyond the pictures [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]: but having a larger cloak of charity than they, [I] admitt that I
                                    think them concencious. I am confident that in their treatment of miself they have
                                    my good in view. Delia Jeffers has even taken the fring[e] off from her window
                                    curtains now I love Delia &amp; believe her to be one of the best of christians

                                    when I am convinced that the Lord requires such thing I hope to be found willing to

                                    infatuated, no that is not the correct term. No it is nothing more or less than a

                                    of late to think of writing. We are now nearly through with our fruit. We had

                                    to dry. This is a particular blessing of ours, always fruit enough to work to kill
                                    common people; but I will not complain; tis finished &amp; I do not realize any
                                    meterial loss. We are all enjoying usual health. Mother expects to start tomorrow in
                                    company with Mr &amp; Mrs Buckhout for N.Y. so you see I am to be left alone. I
                                    verily believe I shall enjoy it. What say you to spending a part of the time with
                                    me. If you are not hear by the last of next week I shall not look for you. Shall we
                                    ever meet again is a question I often ask myself. I often repair at the twilight
                                    hour to our chamber. This hour always produces meloncholy yet I think it the

                                    know Mary how that eavning found me. I was living over again the days of childhood
                                    listning to kind sisters voices. Those wer days long to be remembered but
                                    O! how lightly at the time wer they appreciated. As I gaze upon the moon
                                    &amp; stars they seem to me a sweet link connecting us with the absent. Not only
                                    with the living but the glorified. They are but a screen drawn between the spirits
                                    of earth &amp; heaven. Do you ever as you look above desire to draw asid this
                                    courtain. How the sight would dim our vision; t'is not for mortals eyes to
                                    behoid. We must be content to wait our appointed time: each day leaves but the
                                    number less, soon, soon the sun will rise &amp; set for the last time to us. O
                                    then may our unmortal spirits quit with joy this tenement of clay to enjoy the bliss
                                    of Heaven. Mary I do not wish for a long life Yet I can say the will of the Lord be
                                    done. I have nothing to bind me to earth, as you have, those <hi rend="i">TENDER</hi> ties I never felt, but these must all be severed; how supporting in
                                    that trying hour to feel that God doet[h] all things well. He never worketh without
                                    a purpose &amp; his chastisements are always sent in love. Mrs. Jeffers died
                                    August 28th she bore her sufferings with great patience through nearly all her
                                    illness near the last mind &amp; reason seamed to looss its sway She grieved
                                    much for not having set abetter example before her children &amp; before the
                                    world &amp; sought in evry way to make amends. I often think if she who had
                                    always to all appearencs lived so devoted; as she neared the grave saw so much in
                                    her life to condemn, what will be the feelings of many professing godliness.
                                    T'is an awful thing to live Do we realize that for each thought, word
                                    &amp; act we shall have to give an account, it is an easy matter to assent to
                                    the trouth of this, but [to] feel it is quite another. Eugene Jeffres is seeking
                                    religion, his mother endeavored to obtain a promis to this effect but invain. We
                                    hope &amp; trust that he has counted the cost &amp; will continue in the
                                    ways of well doing. Ezra [Jeffres] &amp; wife experienced religion last winter.
                                    I never can be thankful enough that, that affair of ours closed as it did what days
                                    of misery I have escaped; we never could have been happy to gether. neither was
                                    there ever any real <hi rend="i">AFFECTION</hi>; subsisting between us. Rather let
                                    me live &amp; die as I am, than form a connection with one who cannot simpathize
                                    with me; with him this would have been <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-070-2-065"/>
                                    impossable I speak &amp; think of simpathy in higher terms perha[p]s than I
                                    would have done, had I never felt the want of it. Yet after all mine has not been a

                                    point. It is a question which at present troubles me but very little: things are not
                                    as they used to was. As free as free as the winds that fly is the song of your

                                    Did we but realize that each left but the no [that is, one] less, which we have to
                                    spend here, how differently would we live. When will our eyes become open to this
                                    awful trouth that eternity is fast approaching. Death is on our track, whatever we
                                    have to do must be done quickly.</p>

                                 <hi rend="sup">94</hi> The news, apparently, was that someone had died and
                                            left some money to each of the Conine children. The fact that the children,
                                            rather than Derrick Conine, were the beneficiaries suggests that the
                                            deceased was a relative of Abigail Bates Conine, the children's
                                            mother. Abigail herself died in 1841. It has been conjectured that her
                                            father died about 1850. See Baker, "Conine Family Letters,

                                    but then you always liked children, of course one would like their own!
                                    thats naturel! I spose! I like good, smart, pretty children,
                                    but then, I should get tired of them I know. I have some, just such, here. I can
                                    endure them at school but, when they throng around me after I have whalked a mile or
                                    more, &amp; I feel just like sitting down in one corner, all alone by myself,
                                    tis then that I think of Job, &amp; wonder if he ever taught school &amp;
                                    boarded around. By this time I suppose you have a little anxiety to know where I am,

                                    teaching, but I dont like boarding around. I intend to be differently situated if I
                                    live, &amp; teach another season. I dont know whether the dis. like me or not,

                                    wer not governed at home. That is I would not go into such a school if I knew it but

                                    painful in the extream to be seperated. we keep up a monthly corrispondence. I wish

                                    Mary, were it not for friends I should be a <hi rend="i">very unhappy</hi> mo[r]tal.
                                    I am thankful that I do not inherit our Fathers suspicious feeling. I am ready, to
                                    count all as friends untill they prove themselves, contrairywise. I thank God, that

                                    in them, that I would shun at present to open my heart, to them, no, no, but then, I

                                    writing to do, &amp; I usually spend this time in that way. I sent two letters

                                    think, that I should not bear such treatment as gracefully, from you. I had begun to
                                    be almost provoked, but your letter proved sufficient to restore me to good humor
                                    again. Uncle Henry spent nearly two weeks with us in June, he looks &amp;

                                    it is with no small degree of reluctence that I give up the thought which I had so
                                    fondly cherished for months past; of seeing you this fall. They had spoken to me
                                    about teaching here again this winter before I received your answer, after that I
                                    was quite undecided &amp; but had I known at that time of some one that I could
                                    have had for company, I should have come. I have learned to day that Mr. Shelden is

                                            September 20, 1856, burning a shoe store, a jewelry store, a
                                            "photograph car," and a drug store. Five days later fire
                                            struck again, destroying eight stores, the post office, the Perry <hi rend="i">Times</hi> newspaper office, two lodge halls, and two
                                            residences. Arsonists, or "incendiaries," were blamed for
                                            the fires. The village history notes that the "loss of buildings
                                            was mainly with Rufus H. Smith, who carried no insurance." Judge
                                            Smith was probably the village's most prominent citizen, having
                                            been interested at one time or another in a flouring mill, a carding mill, a
                                            saw mill or two, a foundry, and a grist mill. He erected a block of business
                                            buildings in 1857. Several of the others who lost everything in the fires
                                            were young men who had recently begun in business. Roberts and Clarke, <hi rend="i">History of the Town of Perry</hi>, 54, 55, 60, 65, 70, 74-75,

                                    age, good standing in society, good principals a miember of the Presbytirian church,
                                    is worth not far from fifteen hundred He is said to look very well. All I have to
                                    say on this point is, &amp; which will be the same as describing him to YOU, he
                                    is just the reverse of what I have pictured to myself, however that is not my
                                    objection. My views at present are these, that we never should think &amp; feel
                                    alike. <hi rend="i">He</hi> is ve[r]y quiet, unassuming; infact my counterpart in
                                    evry respect. Such a contrast as would remind one of the Eagle &amp; the Dove.
                                    What say you Sister Mary are you in favor of such a union; think you it would result
                                    in mutual profit? after having seriously canvassed the subject please
                                    favor me with your decision. Father says do just as you think best. I do not feel at
                                    present like having one of those, <hi rend="i">untiab[l]e knots</hi>, tied, when
                                    thare is no real affection on my part. I would not have you think that I am looking
                                    for perfection in a companion. 1 have faults of my own &amp; consequently would
                                    not if I could be united to a faultless one; but I do think did this subject receive
                                    its due attention; was reason allowed to govern instead of passion, much of the
                                    misery which now seemes inevitable might be avoided. We can scercely take up a paper
                                    at the present day unless our eyes are greeted with one or more paragraphs of
                                    divorcement. And to what are we to attribute this state of things, does it exist
                                    where thare is sympathy of feeling; where thare is union of hearts; far from it.
                                    'tis only where the conubial yoke has proved to galling where the man
                                    pulled one way &amp; the wife the other. Deliver me from <hi rend="i">Such</hi>

                        <salute>Dear brother &amp; sister</salute>
                        <p>With pleasure I improve a few moments writing to you. we were very happy to hear from
                                    you. I received a letter both from father &amp; Jane at the time I received
                                    yours. Jane had just returned from Perry but had not received her goods; she said
                                    they had painted and papered their house anew, &amp; had got lots of furnature I
                                    expect she will <hi rend="i">out-shine</hi> us all. She should have some good things
                                    for we think she is wonderfully cheated in her man we disliked the match wonderfully
                                    and tried every means in our power to break it up but you might as well undertake to
                                    move the Alps, have him she would. Old Mr Skinner advised her to have him but no one
                                    else. She was married at our house. Horace was so mad he would not come to the
                                    wedding and I could not have felt much worse to have buried her. He has alway been
                                    engineer and that is all he knows I should want to have him run the mill both night
                                    &amp; day for his abscense would [be] more agreeable than his presence. She has
                                    an idea that he is agoing to be rich, his father pretendes to give him
                                    1,000$ but we do not <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-070-2-086"/> think so Unless
                                    he manages better than we did while here he will soon run out of custom<hi rend="sup">113</hi> every one disliked him for being so overbearing you must
                                    take this letter for a match after you have read it I hope our worst fears will not
                                    be realized we will hope for the best. Jane did not teach last winter I had
                                    20$ a month had as high as 57 in a day, pleanty of business but a very
                                    pleasant time. Our school is not worth much this summer Horace was here yesterday
                                    they are all well. William Skinner was here not quite two weeks ago he is getting
                                    rich we are only in the shade and expect to be while we have such seasons as we have
                                    had for awhile and this beats all previous seasons people can do nothing it rains
                                    every other day and some of the time two &amp; three days at a time it does not
                                    appear as though corn could come to any thing this year, poor people will suffr for
                                    they can get no work.</p>
                        <p>It will be wonderfu[l] bad building unless it comes of[f] dry pretty soon we expect
                                    the carpenters soon. I am in hopes we can get it to live in next winter for our hous
                                    roof is very poor indeed if it had been a good season we would have had it all done
                                    nice but the rains have made the roads so bad that it will be almost impossable to
                                    get to any place and John's health is very poor, he will not try to work
                                    much after the house is done he would be quite comfortable if he was able to live
                                    without work. Our dairy is quite small only three cows we lost 2 last fall and
                                    winter and sold the rest to build with butter 10 cts, hardly worth making. I have 36
                                    lbs of wool to spin this summer.</p>
                        <p>You say Clarinda thinks we do not care about her but she is mistaken neither
                                    H… nor I know whare to direct a letter to her if Mary-Jane will write and
                                    let us know whare to direct I would be very glad to hear from them and will answer
                                    all her letters<hi rend="sup">114</hi> I would be glad to see you all but the
                                    prospect is poor for us Mary can read in the 3 reder an spells in the first class
                                    but cannot sing a single tune She is quite tall which makes her look older than she

                        <p>While sitting here all alone this eavening listening to the pattering of the rain as
                                    it comes against the windows, I bethought me of your unanswred letter &amp; I

                                    one. he did not much fancy the music, &amp; I guess thought he could do as well

            <p>Calvin Fletcher was one of the earliest and most prominent residents of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a diarist able and willing to comment informatively on people and events in his
                    town, state, and nation. The period covered by this second published volume of Fletcher's
                    diary coincides with the most severe recession in antebellum America, and the political and economic
                    consequences of this recession in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Indiana provided much of the substance of Fletcher's entries. Like other
                    speculators, Fletcher saw the economic promise of the early 1830s fade during the late 1830s and
                    early 1840s as investments in land, internal improvements, and other enterprises threatened to bring
                    insolvency rather than profit. Fletcher's careful accounting of his assets and liabilities
                    shows that he weathered the storm more successfully than most of his contemporaries, in part because
                    his debt collection business provided substantial returns.</p>
            <p>In addition to recording his financial trials and those of others, Fletcher also commented
                    extensively on the conflict that centered around the State Bank of Indiana and especially its <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch—a conflict that generated the primary economic and political debates
                    of these years. As a director of the State Bank and later of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch, Fletcher was a participant as well as an observer in the local bank war. The
                    diary provides information on this subject unavailable elsewhere, although Fletcher's
                    financial conservatism, especially on the subject of credit, and his anti-Jacksonian political
                    persuasion gave a definite bias to his analysis of events. Despite professed desires to retire to a
                    farm, Fletcher devoted increasing attention to banking and by the end of this volume is well on the
                    way to becoming the city's leading banker and its wealthiest citizen.</p>
            <p>The diary contains much more than business and political commentary. Fletcher was a man of wide
                    ranging interests and activities. He was a leader in organizations devoted to religion, temperance,
                    colonization of blacks, charity, <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-070-2-090"/> and education, and he was very
                    much interested in agriculture, devoting thought and study as well as occasional manual labor to his
                    farm lands outside <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In his leisure time he read Alexis de Tocqueville, George Bancroft, and William E.
                    Channing and kept up a large correspondence with family members traveling or resident in the East.
                    Fletcher's diary also provides an abundance of local color in its descriptions of people
                    and events in everyday <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Gayle Thornbrough and Dorothy L. Riker have added greatly to the value of
                    Fletcher's almost daily scribblings. Their excellent editorial work includes a survey
                    introduction, chronology, index, and full and informative notes, often derived from such primary
                    sources as newspapers and manuscript collections. Although scholars working in almost any aspect of
                    the period will find something of value simply by using the index, the diary provides such
                    informative and entertaining reading that anyone interested in the past will benefit from this
                    opportunity to know Calvin Fletcher and his contemporaries.</p>

            <p>Indiana University has fared well in the hands of its most recent historian, Thomas D. Clark, in the
                    second volume of his <hi rend="i">Indiana University: Midwestern Pioneer.</hi> In this volume Clark
                    describes the university during the first third of this century dispassionately, with humor, and
                    with awareness of other educational developments in the Midwest.</p>
            <p>Because of William Lowe Bryan's protracted term as president of Indiana University from 1902
                    to 1937, Clark inevitably gives considerable attention to Bryan and to his policies. Clark assesses
                    Bryan's career judiciously, though one suspects that he may well have agreed with
                    Bryan's friend and colleague, President Lotus D. Coffman of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, who, when Bryan told him of his intended retirement, replied: "Fine, you
                    should have done so ten years ago" (p. 385).</p>
            <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-070-2-091"/>
            <p>Clark does not shrink from reporting the unpleasant truth that Hoosiers did not have a distinguished
                    state university at the end of Bryan's term in 1937. Indiana then compared unfavorably by
                    most standard academic criteria (per cent of faculty with doctorates, number of faculty listed in
                        <hi rend="i">Who's Who</hi>, amount spent on research, size of library) with most of
                    the other midwestern state universities. Fighting for the bottom position with it in several
                    categories was Purdue, its arch rival in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">West Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Such a situation is an indictment both of the presidential leadership (or lack of it)
                    and of the state legislature. Customarily the responsiveness of the legislature to the
                    university's needs is influenced by the persuasiveness of the president. Clark accurately
                    notes that Bryan found it difficult temperamentally to deal in the slightly disreputable arena of
                    Indiana state politics.</p>
            <p>Bryan prided himself on increasing the enrollment at Indiana during his tenure as president, and he
                    was correct in noting the tremendous increase in the number of students. Whether this should be
                    regarded as a major achievement, however, is another question, for burgeoning enrollments were
                    typical of all the state universities and many of the private ones as well during this period. Clark
                    notes as one of Bryan's accomplishments that he fought "to make his institution a
                    university instead of a normal school" (p. 395). Again, this seems a modest achievement
                    since Indiana never really was in danger of being a normal school, although like many other colleges
                    in the late nineteenth century many of its graduates went into teaching. Their vocational choice was
                    determined much more by vagaries of the employment market than by their college curriculum. The
                    professional schools which Indiana added during Bryan's presidency were rare in the
                    nineteenth century, and most institutions added them or expanded them only in the twentieth century.
                    If anything, Indiana was a little slow in making the additions.</p>
            <p>In one of his most perceptive sections Clark notes the prestige of administrators during the latter
                    years of Bryan's presidency. Promising faculty members were often promoted to department
                    chairmanships or to deanships, both of which paid considerably more than professorships. The
                    additional money and stature that came with these positions were lures to keep the professors at
                    Indiana, but as Clark observes: "It was rare for a man of creative talents to make
                    significant <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-070-2-092"/> scholarly contributions after he had accepted an
                    administrative assignment" (p. 373). Nonetheless, such was the prestige at Indiana and many
                    other state universities that able professors deserted scholarship for petty administration, thereby
                    depriving the institutions in the long run from achieving academic eminence. Bryan's
                    successor, Herman B Wells, with whose assumption of the presidency Clark concludes this volume, knew
                    better and encouraged subsequent Indiana professors to remain scholars. This action finally brought
                    intellectual distinction to the university.</p>
            <p>Much of the charm of this volume lies in Clark's amused accounts of various nonacademic
                    aspects of life at Indiana, including the Book Nook, athletics, and, especially, the unenviable role
                    of the dean of women during the early years of Bryan's administration. Clark describes
                    Bryan's ideal candidate for this difficult position as "Lydia Pinkham and
                    Whistler's mother draped in a sorority gown and adorned with a master's
                    degree" (p. 29). Such a paragon was hard to find and harder to keep.</p>

            <p>Joseph Neef is best known to Hoosiers as the schoolmaster at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> who conducted a school in Owenite days that featured "modern"
                    education. He was a disciple of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, the German Swiss originator of the
                    system of learning by observation and by doing rather than from textbooks or from teachers. These
                    principles are now firmly imbedded in the educational systems of today, and it is enlightening to
                    read about some of their origins in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.</p>
            <p>Professor Hackensmith tells the story of Neef's background in Europe, his days in the army
                    of Napoleon Bonaparte, his teaching experience at Pestalozzi's school at Burg-dorf in <placeName>

                    not always <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-070-2-093"/> pleasing personality—Neef was never
                    completely successful. He was therefore glad to join Robert Owen's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> adventure but did not stay there very long, either.</p>
            <p>There is a need for a good biography of Joseph Neef, although, because Neef is a secondary character
                    in the <placeName>

                    called for. Hackensmith has been commendably industrious about assembling all the material there is

                    biographical effort about David Dale Owen when it was a doctoral dissertation, said that a
                    biographer should never let his typewriter stray from his subject. Regrettably, Hackensmith has not
                    followed this first precept of the biographer; it is not until the beginning of chapter four on page
                    fifty-three that Neef is even mentioned. Even after that the reader is continually led into long
                    diversions about Pestalozzi and his educational theories, Robert Owen's enthusiasms, the
                    mechanical contributions of Oliver Evans, or the peculiarities of William Maclure. It is only with
                    hard work and much use of the index (fortunately it is satisfactory) that one can follow
                    Neef's life and career through the book.</p>
            <p>This volume has typographical, spelling, and other errors (this reviewer's name is given as
                    "William," for example). A few discrepancies appear in the footnotes, and other
                    faults exist that one frequently finds in privately printed books. Every author needs an

            <p>The Indian is in our national conscience. Now is the time to write about the native American and
                    about those non-Indians, such as Thomas Loraine McKenney, the <placeName>

                    </placeName>' last superintendent of Indian trade (1816-1822) and first superintendent of
                    the Bureau of Indian Affairs (beginning in 1824), who have understood Indian rights and sympathized
                    with Indian grievances.</p>
            <p>A <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, McKenney defended federal management of Indian trading posts, believed that the Indian
                    had the "capacity… for the highest attainments in civilization" (p.
                    34), and attacked repeatedly white injustice, bad faith, and cruelty toward the Indian and the
                    government's "radically, fatally wrong" (p. 238) Indian policies. In
                    spite of McKenney's integrity, honesty, and conscientious direction of the Indian Bureau,
                    President Andrew Jackson fired him in 1830, ending McKenney's career in public office.</p>
            <p>McKenney's <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, published originally in two volumes in 1846, tell far
                    more about the public figure than the private man. A contemporary reviewer estimated correctly that
                    the volumes were of "slender value in a literary sense," and Herman J. Viola,
                    director of the National Anthropological Archives of the Smithsonian Institution, comments in his
                    introduction to this edition that the <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi> did not "refurbish his
                    [McKenney's] public image, silence his critics, [or] pave the way for a restoration to
                    office" (p. xxvii). Nonetheless, the <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi> are generally accurate and
                    still palatable. They tell a lot about McKenney's life as a second string federal
                    bureaucrat, give the day by day details of his long western tour in 1827, and show how and why he
                    became an Indian advocate.</p>
            <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-070-2-095"/>
            <p>In addition to the <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>, McKenney also published a record of his first (1824)
                    journey to Indian country, entitled <hi rend="i">Sketches of a Tour to the Lakes</hi>, and between
                    1836 and 1844 published a folio edition of the many Indian portraits he had commissioned earlier.
                    The portraits and other Indian materials that he collected while in office established his
                    reputation as a pioneer ethnologist—a reputation that blended with his successful effort
                    of 1819 to persuade Congress to finance Indian schools and with his humanitarian plans for
                    resettling eastern tribes in the West.</p>
            <p>The current market for books on the Indian has encouraged new editions of McKenney's works.
                    In 1972 the portraits were republished with a vivid biographical sketch of McKenney by James D.
                    Horan. The <hi rend="i">Sketches</hi> were reprinted recently with a short introduction by Viola,
                    who has also introduced succinctly this new edition of the <hi rend="i">Memoirs.</hi> The original
                    documentary appendix of volume one is included, but the publisher failed to add either an index or a
                    map. Volume two, largely a collection of McKenney's speeches, was not reprinted. Yet, it
                    seems accurate to say, quoting the <hi rend="i">North American Review</hi> of October, 1846, that
                    "the purpose and spirit of this book place it aside from the technical canons of
                    criticism" because, given all the limitations of memoirs, it "is the tribute of a
                    sincere philantropist to a cause to which he [gave]… the substantial efforts and costly
                    sacrifices of many years" (<hi rend="i">The North American Review</hi>, LXII, 481).</p>

            <p>The fascination for high society so long monopolized by novelists, adoring biographers, and debunking
                    journalists is finally sparking serious historiography. Edward Pessen's analysis of the
                    upper upper one per cent in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the quarter century before the Civil War is an exhaustively researched analysis of
                    wealth (not income) distribution, family background, residential <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-070-2-096"/> preferences, marital choice, club life, and political influence. It is the best such study to
                    date and hopefully will stimulate further research. But that stimulus should come more from
                    Pessen's superb bibliography of sources and social science rather than from his refusal to
                    use either the best analytic techniques available or even crude shortcuts.</p>
            <p>Two disappointing examples of inferior technique deserve sharp criticism. In his key chapters on the
                    distribution of wealth and on the change in fortunes over time, Pessen presents his carefully
                    collected data in such garbled fashion that neither the layman nor the expert can interpret it
                    easily. This charge is reinforced by the fact that Pessen misinterprets his own tables. Each of his
                    tables on wealth distribution uses different categories (for example, a $30,000 to
                    $75,000 category in one table, $35,000 to $90,000 in the next,
                    $50,000 to $70,000 in another). Comparison over time or between cities is thus
                    rendered very difficult, and Pessen refuses to use well established summary measures which would
                    make comparisons simple for anyone. Later, when trying to prove that fortunes seldom rose or fell
                    precipitously, Pessen faced a problem easily solved by simple regression analysis. Instead he
                    presents a bewildering variety of tables, each constructed differently, and draws the wrong
                    conclusions. Of thirty-five very large <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> fortunes assessed in 1837 and the 1840s, fifteen declined in size (by an average of
                    fifty-two per cent), while only two grew faster than six per cent per year. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> between 1845 and 1856, merely eighteen per cent of the 945 men worth $45,000
                    to $100,000 or $100, 000 to $250,000 moved into a higher wealth
                    bracket, while thirty-nine per cent remained stationary, thirty-two per cent declined, and the
                    remaining eleven per cent were not on the tax rolls because of death, removal, or poverty. Pessen
                    avows that he has provided "the most powerful refutations of the [Tocquevillan] thesis that
                    fortunes were made and lost overnight and circulated with inconceivable rapidly in antebellum
                    America" (p. 146). It is baffling to conceive what evidence (outside the South from 1860 to
                    1870) Pessen would think sustains Alexis de Tocqueville's thesis.</p>
            <p>Pessen would have reached a different conclusion if he had correlated his data statistically instead
                    of impression-istically. Table 7-4, showing the 1845 wealth of the rich New Yorkers of 1828, is
                    illustrative. Using a few minor assumptions <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-070-2-097"/> necessitated by the
                    crude data displays, correlations and regression coefficients can be calculated. (This reviewer
                    assumed half the 1828 men not on the 1845 tax list were dead or removed, and the other half had mean
                    wealth of $5,000, and that the mean of the richest categories in both years was 1.5 times
                    its lower limit.) Then for 443 men worth $25,000 or more in 1828, the correlation with
                    their wealth in 1845 was a very low +.36 and the best prediction of a random rich man's
                    holdings in 1845 was ninety per cent of his 1828 wealth plus $50,000. This shows
                    remarkable turnover in fortune in the span of seventeen years. Put another way, the holdings of rich
                    men in 1828 explain only thirteen per cent of the pattern of holdings of the same men half a
                    generation later.</p>
            <p>Many analytical shortcomings mar Pessen's book. His measurement techniques are crude
                    (assessed wealth times six equals true wealth), and he equates class with money. He shows that many
                    rich girls married rich boys, but he ignores the web of marital interrelationships, the functions of
                    dowries, and the incidence of interclass (or interwealth group) marriage.</p>
            <p>Pessen's bibliography testifies that he is aware of modern techniques (though he misses <hi rend="i">Inequality</hi> by Christopher Jencks, which provides the techniques he lacks).
                    Instead, the author harks back to the classical narrative historians— George Bancroft one
                    supposes he means—neglecting the analytical heritage of Frederick Jackson Turner and
                    Charles A. Beard. But Bancroft's style was not honed by following a short insight with long
                    repetitive lists of names every few pages. Pessen's readers would have been better served
                    by scattergrams than his scattergun method.</p>

            <p>The eldest of Lyman Beecher's children, Catharine, shared her father's social
                    consciousness and evangelical zeal. <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-070-2-098"/> Her career began in 1823
                    when she opened a school for girls which under her capable leadership expanded into the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName> Female Seminary. In efforts to improve the school's curriculum she was one of
                    the first educators to utilize visual aids and to institute calisthenics in a physical education
                    program for girls.</p>
            <p>Concerned about the problems and prejudices she and her peers faced because of their gender Catharine
                    Beecher sought ways to improve the status of women. Drawing upon her Calvinist heritage she
                    interpreted the virtues of self sacrifice and submission to give women more importance in society.
                    Women might contribute to the welfare of family and community by sacrificing personal inclinations
                    and needs which conflicted with those of others. Men in positions of power in the wider spheres of
                    life would be encouraged by such an unselfish example, she reasoned, to emulate it in their lives,
                    thereby benefiting state and nation. This doctrine of self sacrifice gained acceptance since it
                    accorded women an honorable position while not disturbing social order and unity.</p>
            <p>Catharine Beecher conceived her vocation to be that of educating women to become teachers in the
                    West. An adept publicist and fund raiser, she worked through such organizations as the Ladies
                    Society for Promoting Education at the West and the Central Committee for Promoting National
                    Education to create interest, recruit prospective teachers, and obtain financial assistance for her
                    cause. Largely through her efforts scores of women, including nine who migrated to Indiana in 1847,
                    received academic instruction and professional education prior to becoming teachers.</p>
            <p>Catharine Beecher wrote prolifically on the topics of domestic economy, education, moral philosophy,
                    and theology. Her <hi rend="i">A Treatise on Domestic Economy</hi> brought her national recognition
                    and financial independence. Encouraging the standardization of many domestic practices, it is
                    considered a pioneer work on household automation.</p>
            <p>Major emphasis in this biography is devoted to the impact of her gender in shaping the direction of
                    Catharine Beecher's life and thought. The analysis of the development of her views
                    regarding the proper role for women in nineteenth century America is a valuable addition to the
                    literature about the women's rights movement. The book is less satisfactory <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-070-2-099"/> in its treatment of Catharine Beecher's significant
                    educational innovations, advocacy of professional education for teachers, and the considerable
                    influence she exerted upon her remarkable siblings.</p>
            <p>Three examples will indicate the nature of errors present. Reference to Samuel P. Chase (p. 133)
                    should have been to Salmon P. Chase. Edward Beecher is cited (p. 133) as the only Beecher involved
                    in the abolitionist movement in 1837, yet George Beecher was active in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> State Anti-Slavery Society a year earlier. To assert that George Beecher committed
                    suicide (pp. 140, 147) seems unwarranted when in the author's notes (p. 305) it is stated
                    that the coroner ruled his death accidental.</p>

            <p>Henry Ward Beecher spent the opening ten years of his ministry in Indiana, first at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was a decade of preparation for the young Beecher, whose ambition seemed always too
                    large for his western parishes. He accepted the pastorate at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> because of its proximity to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where his famous father, Lyman Beecher, presided over Lane Seminary and New School
                    Presbyterians. Henry Ward's call to the more promising <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> post in 1839 raised the father's hope that a Beecher would be in the vanguard
                    of converting the West. It placed the son in intimate contact with state leaders and gave him a
                    pulpit worthy of his oratory. He used the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> experience to broaden his intellectual interests in numerous directions: horticulture,
                    writing, mesmerism, temperance, education, anti-slavery, evangelism, polity. By the close of his
                    Indiana residency he enjoyed a national reputation as the rising scion of the Beecher clan.</p>
            <p>Elsmere strictly limits her study to the period described in the title. She draws no comparisons
                    between the young pastor and the mature <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> divine. Searching through <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-070-2-100"/> various collections of
                    Beecher family papers, the author discovered less of the budding reformer than of the pampered
                    preacher, an elitist who hobnobbed with the wealthy while his debts piled up. Although equipped with
                    physical courage, he cowered before public opinion, hesitating to rankle audiences over sensitive
                    issues. Late in his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> tenure Beecher delivered two unemotional antislavery sermons only after local debate
                    became too hot to ignore. As a reformer he felt more comfortable fighting prostitution and gambling,
                    subjects included in his first major publication, <hi rend="i">Seven Lectures to Young Men.</hi> His
                        <hi rend="i">Lectures</hi> had the additional asset of earning him recognition in eastern
                    churches.</p>
            <p>This book leaves some judgments unclear. Elsmere's admirable insistence on thorough
                    documentation at each step of her narrative seems to inhibit her from gathering loose ends into firm
                    conclusions. Readers will learn that Eunice Beecher was considered a liability to her
                    husband's work and that he was attractive to women; but they will have to guess about the
                    true nature of the Beecher marriage. The idea that Beecher left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> under an onus of failure because he "never endeared himself as a pastor to his
                    church" (p. 297) is difficult to reconcile with his popularity as a preacher and his deep
                    involvement in church work. In most respects the documentation clarifies the complex Beecher
                    personality at an important period of his development. The man's wit, egoism, and essential
                    brilliance are carefully presented.</p>
            <p>Elsmere, a native Hoosier, wrote on Beecher because she "wanted to know the daily
                    circumstances of his life and the people he encountered" during his Indiana years (p. ix).
                    Her work is valuable as social history as well as biography. There are the usual struggles against
                    disease and death, the attempts to smooth with eastern sophistication the roughness of a young
                    western city. Beyond that there is fresh reconstruction of routine concerns of middle and upper
                    class residents of the new urban West. Like Beecher, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was in its formative years. Also like Beecher, his neighbors had every confidence they
                    were still in control of their destinies.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Abraham Lincoln: Theologian of American Anguish.</hi> By Elton Trueblood. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1973. Pp. ix, 149. Notes, index. $4.95.)</head>
            <p>Elton Trueblood has written a short but significant work devoted not to Abraham Lincoln's
                    religion but to his religious thinking. One of the most important features of the
                    president's religious thinking, according to Trueblood, was that the Illinoisan's
                    theology underwent significant development from 1841 to 1862. As a result of his broken engagement
                    with Mary Todd in 1841, the death of a son in 1850, the death of another son in 1862, and the
                    growing abolition agitation, Lincoln's theology matured. Ended forever was the
                    light-hearted irreverence of Lincoln's youth. Central to his new spiritual development was
                    the belief that he was acting less and less on his own wishes and was becoming more and more the
                    instrument of God's will.</p>
            <p>In connection with this development, Trueblood also stresses that Lincoln became profoundly aware
                    that God acts in history. He believed that God not only dealt with individuals but also with nations
                    and that the Civil War was a terrible penalty God placed on America for the guilt of cherishing
                    slavery. Just as he maintained that the country was being punished for slavery, the president also
                    believed God had plans for a better America. His concern then was to learn what God's will
                    for America was. Lincoln's overwhelming conviction, the author relates, was that
                    God's will could be partly known and that the only hope for finite men lay in conformity to
                    that will.</p>
            <p>Professor Trueblood also states, but in a less convincing manner, that Lincoln outmaneuvered the
                    Radicals by making the Emancipation Proclamation a war measure rather than merely an act of detached
                    idealism. Many readers may doubt that the Radicals so emphasized abolition that they neglected the
                    need to preserve the Union, as Trueblood maintains, and they may ask for further clarification on
                    how the proclamation saved the Union and kept alive the opportunity for a life of freedom on the
                    part of all involved.</p>
            <p>According to the author, part of Lincoln's greatness was that he reached political decisions
                    at a level far deeper than that of politics. Underlying all of Lincoln's decisions was a
                    moral revulsion against slavery, a mystical sense of the importance <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-070-2-102"/> of the Union, and an abiding conviction that the divine order could be
                    ascertained and followed.</p>
            <p>It is apparent throughout the book that Trueblood admires Lincoln as one of the greatest figures in
                    American history, but was the president as profound a religious thinker as the author
                    depicts? The reader may wonder if what is at times presented in this book is really
                    Lincoln's religious thinking or is a careful mixture of Lincoln's theology and
                    Trueblood's theology.</p>

                    given to construction of the three successive courthouses as well as to their architecture and the
                    historical events associated with them. The present courthouse, an unusually attractive example of
                    Greek Revival architecture, was completed at the middle of the nineteenth century. Built at a cost
                    of only $13,561.85, it is one of Indiana's most prized courthouses. It replaced
                    a modest stone structure erected in the early years of statehood at a cost of $3,950.
                    This building had been contracted for $4,000. After some controversy the county
                    commissioners sought to dock the contractor, the well known <placeName>

                    in the development of American Indian policy from 1816 until his administrative head was severed by
                    Andrew Jackson's patronage axe in 1830. This volume, the content of which is suggested by

                    with the "most glaring" errors in spelling, grammar, and topography

                    </placeName>, 1973. Pp. iv, 332. $3.50.) This <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> embraces a wide
                    variety as well as a large number of items collected by the State Historical Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> since its founding in 1857. "Documents included," as the compiler
                    explains in the introduction, "are in manuscript, typescript, and some in printed form.
                    Each entry is listed alphabetically by the name of the collection, usually a person, organization,
                    or subject." Part of the entries are cross referenced by name or subject. A helpful tool
                    for researchers, including genealogists, the guide provides information concerning items relating to
                    national history or to that of other states. <hi rend="i">Passim</hi> items regarding
                    Indiana's history illustrate this point. For instance, there are entries concerning Eugene
                    V. Debs (pp. 88-89) and Benjamin Harrison (p. 129). State historical societies might make the
                    compilation of such a guide—or the updating of previously issued guides— a
                    part of their observance of the American Revolution Bicentennial.</p>

                    selected bibliography, appendices. $4.95.) The many pictures and meager commentary of
                    this volume tell the story of fire fighting equipment used in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    the 1800s. The illustrations are particularly informative in tracing the technological progress in
                    the development of fire fighting equipment from the early volunteer bucket brigades, prevalent in
                    most towns and cities in the early decades of the nineteenth century, to the more sophisticated fire
                    fighting methods of the initial decades of the early twentieth century.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> University Press, 1973. Pp. xi, 225. Notes, bibliography, index. Paperbound,
                    $2.65.) This is a sympathetic study of the noted historian, Carl Becker, who died in
                    1945. His life, his writings, his status as a professional historian, and his role as a citizen are
                    all considered and evaluated. Becker's views about the writing of history, the
                    responsibility of historians to the generation in which they live, and the hurdles which fallible
                    humans face in their search for truth are interestingly presented.</p>
