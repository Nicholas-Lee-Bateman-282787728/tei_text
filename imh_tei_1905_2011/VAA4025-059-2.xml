            <p>The impact of the Second World War on Hoosier labor and the magnitude of Hoosier labor's
                    contribution to the war effort are not easily calculated. Reaching into the life of every wage
                    earner in the state, the war left an imprint of great complexity. Socially, economically, and
                    politically it transformed the daily existence of the population. It altered relations between the
                    worker and his government, introduced a new era of labor-management relations, and affected the
                    day-to-day routine of the individual. It modified attitudes toward the employment of women and
                    minority groups, accelerated the breakdown of racial barriers, and inaugurated new concepts of
                    working conditions, rates of pay, and standards of production. It produced methods for recruiting a
                    labor force of unprecedented dimensions, necessitated the development of techniques for the rapid
                    training of men and women to a high degree of skill, and produced new principles to govern the
                    settlement of industrial disputes. It transformed a group of relatively weak labor organizations,
                    ravaged by a decade of economic depression and years of internal strife, into highly organized,
                    aggressive, and confident trade unions. Finally, it proved that the labor force of a single state,
                    when adequately trained and properly motivated, can produce the tools of war in almost incredible
                    quantities.</p>
            <p>While these achievements were neither smooth nor painless, a complex system of motivating factors
                    caused them to be completed with surprising speed and a high degree of effectiveness. The
                    necessities of the national emergency, stimulating the patriotic spirit of the people to heroic
                    proportions, drove both labor and management toward the attainment <list type="footnotes">

                    Present to a considerable extent, also, were the less admirable forces of raw ambition, greed, and
                    selfishness. Extreme necessity and an inflated economy afforded a multitude of temptations and
                    opportunities for profiteering, not all of which were successfully avoided. Organized labor
                    sometimes took advantage of wartime conditions as it regained the ground it had lost during the
                    depression decade and placed itself in a position of extraordinary power.</p>

                    outbreak of the European war in 1939 failed to materialize, but initiation of the lend-lease
                    program, inauguration of national defense measures, and the <placeName>

                    growth of industrial employment gathered momentum in 1942 as large industries converted to war
                    production and new installations were completed. Minor labor shortages appeared in a few Hoosier
                    industries by late 1941; a year later the need for additional workers was becoming serious. In
                    January, 1943, industrial employment passed the 600,000 mark–nearly double the 1939
                    average-and labor shortages were so acute that the creation of new governmental agencies and
                    controls became a matter of necessity, The peak of the critical condition occurred as the war neared
                    its climax in mid-1944, after which employment began a steady decline. In November it dropped below
                    600,000 for the first time in nearly two years, and by the war's end it was just over
                    500,000.</p>
            <p>The huge wartime labor force differed in many respects from the prewar working class. Barriers
                    previously restricting the industrial employment of women were lowered to such an extent that by the
                    end of 1943 females constituted more than one third of Indiana's industrial work force.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> State and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>There was, however, a limit beyond which the labor force could not be expanded, and as this point was
                    approached emphasis was placed upon achieving the most effective utilization of each employee.
                    Broadly speaking, two devices were used to reach this goal: (1) increasing worktime, and (2)
                    improving productive efficiency. Initially individual worktime was increased by voluntary extension
                    of the work week to 48 hours, but in February, 1943, a presidential order authorized the chairman of
                    the War Manpower Commission to designate those industrial communities, termed "labor market
                    areas," in which the 48-hour minimum week would be compulsory for essential industries.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> To establish a basis for application of the order, the War Manpower Commission
                    periodically classified the labor supply of the various labor market areas as

                    "plentiful." Critical areas usually were placed under the compulsory 48-hour
                    minimum week. In Indiana ten labor market areas originally were designated; as war production

            <p>Still another device to increase productive capacity was the controversial incentive plan, which an
                    executive order in April, 1943, empowered the War Labor Board to authorize. Subsequently, two
                    general types of incentive plans were approved by the board: (1) the traditional piece rate system,
                    which facilitated the payment of premium wages for individual efficiency; and (2) an over-all,
                    plant-wide type of plan which involved devising a uniform measure (such as pounds of aircraft
                    produced per man hour) by which production increases could be calculated and premium wages awarded
                    on a group basis.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> So popular were these plans that applications for their
                    approval literally swamped the staff of the Regional Wage Stabilization Board. By the end of 1943
                    two-thirds of the more than three hundred incentive plan applications from Indiana had been
                        approved.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Recruiting, training, housing, and transporting the wartime labor force taxed the capacity of the
                    nation's resources and called into existence an array of governmental bureaus and agencies
                    which left a permanent imprint on the working class and the labor movement. In the early stages of
                    the emergency, labor recruiting was done largely by private and local initiative. One of the best
                    examples of local action in the entire nation occurred in <placeName>

                    a series of informal meetings in November, 1941. This group evolved into the Indiana Labor Supply
                    Committee, which was formally recognized, early in 1942, by the <placeName>

                    turnover–two of the major causes of labor shortages–to an average of about 5
                    per cent. In Indiana the stabilization program reached its ultimate degree of stringency on October

            <p>Shortages of housing and transportation posed serious and persistent problems for those concerned
                    with providing for the needs of war workers. Although privately financed housing, which had fallen
                    far behind minimum needs during the depression decade, expanded dramatically during the war years,
                    it failed to keep pace with increasing demands.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> The National Housing Agency,
                    created in February, 1942, co-ordinated the efforts of subsidiary housing agencies to overcome the
                    shortage already in existence and to meet subsequent demands. By January, 1943, thirty-five separate
                    war housing projects, totalling 11,936 units, were either completed or under construction in
                        Indiana.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> And this was only the beginning. A homes registry service
                    facilitated the renting of vacant apartments and rooms; the so-called "white
                    elephants" program converted hundreds of abandoned buildings into dwelling units; and
                    trailer camps, both privately and publicly financed, became a normal part of every industrial center

                    rationing), the Office of Defense Transportation, and various other agencies and organizations

                    reduce the strain on public transportation facilities, numerous special bus routes and rail
                    schedules were established, and great ingenuity was applied to the task of stretching the lives of

                    of all proportion to employment.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Beginning in 1943 a concerted attack against
                    industrial accidents was launched. Governor Henry F. Schricker convened a special state Safety
                    Congress, but the most effective work was done at the level of the individual plant. Safety
                    committees were created in most plants throughout the state, interplant and interdepartmental safety
                    contests were sponsored, and company publications as well as newspapers and radio stations waged an
                    unceasing campaign against industrial carelessness. Among the more practical results of this
                    campaign were the shielding–or painting in contrasting bright colors–of moving
                    parts on dangerous machinery, and the adoption of safety clothing–fireproof chaps,
                    shatterproof glasses, crushproof hats and shoes–in a large proportion of war plants.
                    Consequently, the incidence of industrial accidents leveled off during the later years of the war.
                    Especially noteworthy was the record of the highly dangerous munitions industry, which took such
                    elaborate precautions that in 1944 its safety record was second only to that of the women's
                    garment trade.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>During the war years leisure time was decreased by longer working hours, but the opportunities for
                    entertainment also were curtailed. Many movie houses, bars, amusement parks, and similar facilities
                    were forced to close or reduce services, while transportation problems reduced the utilization of
                    those that remained. Hence, the war worker found himself with greater monetary means for recreation
                    and entertainment than ever before but without access to the usual public facilities. Working

            <p>In addition to making entertainment and recreation an integral part of their employees'
                    working conditions, Hoosier industrialists did much to promote the morale and general welfare of
                    their employees by providing them with a wide variety of special and sometimes ingenious benefits.
                    Inconvenience and loss of time caused by the lack of adequate eating facilities close to the plants
                    led to the installation of many in-plant restaurants and cafeterias. Some companies provided low
                    cost financial aid to needy employees, and at least one establishment instituted a free insurance
                    plan for its personnel. Another opened a filling station to supply service "at a
                    substantial saving" to its employees; a number of companies provided day nurseries for the

            <p>Another significant result of wartime conditions in Indiana was the emergence of "big

                    bickering, Hoosier organized labor in 1940 was still fighting to regain the ground it had lost
                    during the early 1930's. Membership in the state Federation of Labor (AFL) was at a low
                    point; the state Industrial Union Council (CIO), organized in 1938, claimed only 64,000 members; and
                    District 11 of the United Mine Workers had been drastically weakened by the decline of the Hoosier

                    in most Hoosier industrial centers; and company-dominated unions were common in many areas. By 1945,
                    however, the membership of the state AFL organization far surpassed all previous levels, the state
                    Industrial Union Council claimed more than 200,000 dues-paying members, and District 11 of the UMW
                    was strong enough to outdo even John L. Lewis in defying both public opinion and the federal
                        government.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> The steel industry, along with dozens of others, was solidly
                    organized; company unions were virtually extinct; and picket lines, collective bargaining, and union
                    security devices were integral parts of Indiana's industrial system.</p>
            <p>The remarkable gains made by Hoosier organized labor during the war were due to a combination of
                    circumstances. Severe labor shortages placed trade unions in an ideal bargaining position while the
                    lucrative profits of defense contracts, especially those of the cost-plus variety, made employers
                    amenable to the demands of their workers. In addition, the various governmental agencies created to
                    handle labor-management problems were generally sympathetic to the conditions of the working class
                    and responsive to wartime demands for peak production.</p>
            <p>Of prime significance to the future of the Indiana labor movement was the fact that hundreds of
                    Hoosier plants were organized for the first time. As early as mid-1942 Powers Hapgood, regional
                    director of the CIO in Indiana, declared that most large industries in the region were organized and
                    that there was a notable increase in organizing activities within the smaller establishments. The
                    desire of workers in previously unorganized plants to reap the benefits of collective bargaining
                    lured them to the office of the regional director in increasing numbers, so that by early 1943 he
                    reported that the office staff no longer had time to solicit business. Most <list type="footnotes">

                            Official publications of the state CIO organization give a lower membership figure, but it
                            is based on per capita dues payments and thus probably does not include all Hoosier CIO

                    undue difficulty and had led to the signing of satisfactory contracts.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Equally important were the gains made in the area of union security, working conditions, and fringe
                    benefits. Primarily through the War Labor Board's approval of maintenance-of-membership
                    clauses, many Indiana unions for the first time achieved a large measure of security. More liberal
                    fringe benefits in the form of paid vacations, shift differentials, sickness and accident insurance,
                    and similar extras, characterized a growing proportion of labor-management contracts.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Labor also pushed its advantage into the political arena. The Indiana CIO, which "put
                    Indiana in the lead of all the states" by initiating the first state Political Action
                    Committee in August, 1943,<hi rend="sup">33</hi> became more openly active in state politics than
                    any previous labor union in Hoosier history. In spite of their jurisdictional disputes and
                    organizing competition, the two major labor organizations maintained a fair degree of cooperation in
                    the political realm. At the state level they joined with other labor groups to achieve an
                    effectively united front during the legislative sessions of 1943 and 1945. On the day that the 1943
                    General Assembly convened Hoosier representatives of the AFL, CIO, UMW, Railroad Brotherhoods,
                    Typographical Union, and the Brewery Workers, agreed upon a four-point legislative program which
                    advocated: (1) liberalization of the unemployment insurance act, (2) improvement of the

                    $20 per week for 20 weeks. Another forward step was taken in 1945 when a state department
                    of labor, long advocated by labor leaders, was created.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

            <p>That Hoosier labor, ensconced as it was in a new position of power, did not disrupt defense
                    production was due in large measure to two factors: (1) the nationwide no-strike, no-lockout pledge
                    made by labor and management early in the war; and (2) the work of the National War Labor Board and
                    its regional agencies. Throughout the national defense period preceding actual war, Hoosier labor

                    1942, the President created the National War Labor Board. The jurisdiction of this agency originally
                    extended to those labor disputes for which "procedures for adjustment or
                    settlement" were not otherwise provided, but in September it also was given authority over

                    adjustment cases. Under the new setup Indiana remained in Region VI and a number of Hoosier labor

            <p>During the period 1941-1945 the Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded for Indiana a total of 782 work
                    stoppages involving 436,000 workers and resulting in the loss of 3,476,000 man-days of labor.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Alarming as these figures may appear, they lose much of their impact when
                    compared with total time worked during that period. Using the employment figures given in Table I
                    and the formula of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for computing man-days worked during any period
                    for which average employment is known, one arrives at a total of more than 783 million potential
                    man-days of work in Indiana during 1941-1945.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Hence, the time lost due to
                    strikes and work stoppages amounts to less than .5 per cent of total worktime. The proportion is
                    reduced still further if one eliminates the figures for 1945, in which year a major portion of
                    strikes occurred after the war had ended.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On a comparative basis the strike record of Hoosier labor was at least as good as that of other
                    states. Throughout the war Indiana ranked eighth or ninth among the states in industrial employment
                    and production. In 1942 Indiana had a total of 93 work stoppages that involved 32,200 workers and
                    resulted in the loss of 221,000 man-days, giving the state a ranking of eighth in each category. In
                    1943 Indiana ranked sixth in the number of workers involved in strikes but retained eighth position
                    in total number of stoppages and total number of man-days lost. The following year the state dropped
                    to ninth place in total number of stoppages but rose to fifth and sixth places respectively in the
                    number of workers involved and the number of man-days lost. Thus it would appear that during this
                    critical period the strike record of Hoosier workers followed the pattern indicated by the
                    state's industrial capacity. The figures given, however, indicate only the relative
                    standing of Indiana and do not reveal the size of the gap between her record and those of states
                    which ranked above her. In the number of man-days lost as the result of work stoppages in 1943 only

            <p>With the exception of the coal strike of 1943 there were no really serious or prolonged strikes in
                    Indiana during the most critical stage of the war. A large majority of the stoppages that did occur
                    were of the unauthorized, wildcat variety; some of the causes from which they stemmed were petty
                    enough to warrant the public indignation which they engendered.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> The 1943 coal
                    strike constitutes quite a different story. It involved almost a half million
                    workers–including Indiana's 10,000 miners–and seriously affected
                    scores of vital industries as well as the comfort, health, and welfare of a large proportion of the
                    nation's population. Furthermore, it marked the first time that a labor organization openly
                    and deliberately abrogated the no-strike pledge. Before it finally ended, the coal strike had
                    probably damaged the reputation of organized labor in Indiana more than all other Hoosier wartime
                    strikes combined.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> In addition, it threatened to disrupt the entire pattern of
                    wartime labor controls, revived talk of a national service law, and motivated Congress to pass the
                    War Labor Disputes Act authorizing the President to seize any war production facility in which a
                    strike or other labor disturbance threatened essential production.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

            <p>Altogether the War Labor Board handled some 600 disputes cases in Indiana before the war ended;<hi rend="sup">51</hi> thousands of other cases were settled short of the strike stage. Although
                    labor leaders consistently denied responsibility for most of the work stoppages, the fact remains
                    that union members– whether of their own volition or on orders from their
                    leaders–did interrupt war production with disturbing frequency.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, however, that Hoosier workers followed the nationwide tendency of labor to use
                    the national emergency as a lever to force significant wage increases. Labor shortages and lucrative
                    defense contracts placed management in a vulnerable position and wages might easily have skyrocketed
                    had it not been for the wage stabilization program invoked by the War Labor Board.</p>
            <p>Whereas in prewar years the establishment of maximum hours and minimum wages had been a major
                    problem, the war years created a situation in which the primary concern was that of maintaining
                    minimum hours and fixing maximum wages. Establishment of the compulsory 48-hour week solved the
                    hours problem and the Little Steel Formula of July, 1943,<hi rend="sup">53</hi> became the basis for
                    curtailing the wage spiral. The basic principle of the wage stabilization policy, as originally set
                    forth in the War Labor Board's Little Steel Formula was to stabilize wages at not more than
                    15 per cent above their January, 1941, level. Later an act of Congress set the base date at
                    September 15, 1942, and a presidential order established additional principles for determining basic
                    wage rates.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

                        following day authorized the board to approve wage increases to "correct maladjustments
                        or inequalities, to eliminate sub-standards of living, to correct gross inequities, or to aid in
                        the effective prosecution of the war." Note, however, that stabilization applied to
                        rates of pay rather than to take-home pay, and that there still were numerous ways in which
                        total earnings could be increased. <hi rend="i">Termination Report of NWLB</hi>, I, 187;

            <p>Increases in the cost of living caused labor to complain bitterly about the wage
                    "freeze," but despite surface evidence to the contrary wages were never really
                    frozen. Many of the hundreds of wage brackets formulated by the War Labor Board's Wage
                    Stabilization Division exceeded the Little Steel Formula and paychecks were further increased by
                    premium wages for overtime work and by the numerous fringe benefits.</p>
            <p>On the basis of almost any type of analysis it is clearly evident that the persistent trend of
                    wartime wages in Indiana was upward. For example, 70 per cent of the 40,000 cases handled by the
                    sixth regional wage stabilization board from January, 1943, to June, 1944, resulted in upward
                        adjustment.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Inasmuch as the sixth region embraced six mid-western states,
                    most of which were considerably less industrialized than Indiana and only one of which (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>) had a greater concentration of war industries than Indiana, it is reasonable to assume
                    that more than one fourth of the 40,000 wage cases involved Hoosier establishments.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> It can be concluded, therefore, that at least 7,000 of these wage increases involved
                    Hoosier workers. Increases ranged from two to fifteen cents an hour, the average being approximately
                    five cents. Not only were basic wages increased; night shift premiums, vacation pay, incentive
                    plans, and Christmas bonuses were also affected. Some of the decisions terminated wage controversies
                    of long standing and contained retroactive clauses dating back as far as 1942.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
                    Further evidence of the general trend is the fact that for the year ending October, 1943, the per
                    capita income of Hoosiers increased from $1,067 to $1,141.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The over-all success of the wage stabilization program was one of the major achievements of the war
                    years. For the first time in the history of the nation a governmental agency told workers that they
                    could not have wage increases which employers were willing to grant them or which could easily have
                    been secured through collective bargaining. Hence, it <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-059-2-024"/> is not surprising that the work of the Wage Stabilization
                    Division evoked much criticism and, in view of the magnitude of the program, it was inevitable that
                    mistakes would be made. There were cases in which prices rose more rapidly than wages, and vice
                    versa; in some instances wage increases were unfairly withheld; in others they were unjustifiably
                    granted. But the fact remains that severe inflation was avoided. That the program was, on the whole,
                    fairly administered is indicated by the fact that criticism came from all sides–labor,
                    management, and the public–in approximately equal amounts. It is doubtful that under the
                    circumstances, and considering the general lack of experience in such matters, a more effective
                    program could have been devised. In any event, the round of significant wage increases which
                    occurred in 1942, and which many feared would set the pattern for succeeding war years, was not
                    duplicated until after the war ended.</p>
            <p>Recruiting, training, stabilizing, and providing for the labor force thus confronted the state and
                    nation with a multitude of knotty and complex problems. The manner in which labor responded to the
                    wide variety of programs and regulations devised to solve these problems serves as one important
                    measure of its attitude toward and its support of the war effort. It seems apparent that the
                    response of Hoosier labor was about average–neither worse nor better than that of other
                        states.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the final analysis, however, the contribution of labor to the war effort must be measured in terms
                    of its production record and from this point of view the achievement of the Hoosier labor force
                    takes on added significance. A revealing measure of labor's devotion to duty and the
                    attainment of its production goals during the war years was the Army-Navy E award. Inaugurated in
                    1942, this emblem was admittedly a promotional device designed to appeal to the worker's
                    ego, but the standards under which it was awarded were nonetheless demanding. Quality and quantity
                    of production were prime factors in the selection of recipients, but overcoming <list type="footnotes">

                    a low rate of absenteeism also were important considerations. In short, the E award went only to
                    those plants in which both labor and management were doing an outstanding job of maintaining war
                    production at a high level. By mid-1944, when only about 3 per cent of eligible war production
                    plants had received the award, Hoosier recipients numbered 110. Although it is difficult to
                    determine the precise number of eligible plants in Indiana, indications are that the proportion of
                    Hoosier recipients exceeded the nationwide 3 per cent. The awards went to a wide variety of
                    industries in every part of the state; a few plants received three and four annual renewals.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the E awards indicated that a job was being done well, military security prevented the
                    publicity that would have told the full story of wartime production as it unfolded, the air was
                    charged with activity and the man in the street knew that unprecedented records were being set but
                    he had an intimate knowledge only of what was happening in his own particular shop; even there the
                    work was usually so decentralized that his comprehension of total output was vague. It was not until
                    near the end of the war, therefore, that significant fragments of the production drama began to
                    appear and it is doubtful that the full story can ever be clearly revealed.</p>

                    there rose within a few brief months plants which were to play a vital role in supplying the most

                    cartridges in less than two months. Staggering as the figure may be, these five million shells could
                    have been quickly expended by the 500,000 submachine guns capable of firing 450 rounds per minute
                    which were manufactured by the General Motors Guide Lamp plant at Anderson. Equally impressive was
                    the work of the General Tire and Rubber Company's Wabash plant which produced 250,000

                    occasionally were less dedicated to their tasks than the nation's best interests demanded.
                    Production was sometimes disrupted by petty and selfish motives and in a number of cases union
                    interests were given priority over national ones. The evidence suggests, however, that Hoosier

                    responsibilities of the national emergency and that they contributed their fair share to the war

            <p>For me, this is St. George's Day. Late one evening on our Minnesota farm in the early
                    1940's, unable to sleep, I twisted the dial of my shortwave radio and picked up a broadcast

                    remarking on the occasion, saying that St. George's Day was the one day in the year when he
                    was allowed to speak as an Englishman. The rest of the time he was required to be a Britisher. Today
                    is one of the few days this year when I am allowed to speak as a history teacher. Most of the time I

                    </placeName>, the great Prime Minister's first concern was for the Empire. While it is

                    </placeName> and her contributions not only to the Empire but to the world, at least the British
                    members of the Commonwealth cannot be considered for long in isolation from one another. And, while
                    it is helpful to consider history apart from its sister disciplines, such consideration cannot go on
                    for long without a narrowing of vision. I hold my degrees from the University of Minnesota in
                    history, but it has helped me, even as a history teacher, to have studied there also geography and
                    contemporary social sciences. The social science building at Minnesota is named Ford Hall, after a
                    distinguished historian. In Ford Hall, the offices of the Department of History adjoin those of the
                    Department of Geography. Between them hangs a quotation from John Smith. (The cost of framing it was
                    borne jointly by the two departments.) It reads, "For as geography without history seemeth
                    as a carcass without motion, so history without geography wandereth as a vagrant without certain
                    destination." It is from this kind of educational background that I speak as a history
                    teacher tonight.</p>
            <p>One more matter I would like to make clear. When I use the term "social studies," I
                    do not mean a new subject. "Social studies" is a convenient label for a group of
                    closely related but separate subjects. It is comparable to the term "science." And
                    no one assumes that by organizing science departments in schools we have abolished biology,
                    chemistry, and physics. I believe in teaching history as history, with due regard for its relation
                    to other subjects and for its broad, synthesizing nature. But I do not believe that synthesis can be
                    delivered, readymade. It must be achieved in the mind of the individual learner.</p>
            <p>There is some effort these days to substitute the label "history and the social
                    sciences," as more precise, for the label "social studies." The only
                    difference I see in the terms is that of length. Yet, length of titles in America is important. We
                    are a people in a hurry. Many high school freshmen in America study something called
                    "civics." The authorities in the school I attended wanted a more precise label and
                    called it "Community Life and Civic Problems." We students called it
                    "CLP" when we were in a hurry. Otherwise we called it by more opprobrious terms. I
                    once was required to teach a <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-059-2-031"/> twelfth grade course under the
                    pretentious title "An Introduction to the Social Sciences." Like my ninth grade
                    teacher, I carefully explained the meaning and significance of the title to my students. But I am
                    afraid that the explanation did not take. They called it "sock sigh" in my
                    presence. I don't know what they called it when they had time and inclination to take a
                    deep breath first. At least the term "social studies" has the virtues of meaning
                    and brevity. They are the school subjects that deal with society. I would hate to see our field join
                    the American alphabetical soup as "HSS" or something worse.</p>
            <p>I <hi rend="i">am</hi> concerned about the future status of history in the schools. There are several
                    dangers to it. The greatest comes from the fact that the whole social studies field has been largely
                    overlooked in the post-Sputnik curricular reaction. That more students should do more and more
                    effective study of the sciences, mathematics, and foreign languages can hardly be disputed. But we
                    must bring about that situation as part of a broad upgrading of education all along the line. If we
                    do otherwise, we may gain the world but only at the loss of our soul.</p>
            <p>There is also a danger from the new interest which our sister disciplines are showing in the school
                    curriculum. History has lost ground to other social sciences in the past half-century. Fifty years
                    ago, a four-year high school program in the social studies was at least seven-eighths history. Today
                    it is typically half history and often is even less. When I look at all the demands on the high
                    school, I really do not believe that we can expect to have more than two years of history required
                    of all students. The other social sciences do have much to contribute to the education of citizens.
                    And fields other than the social studies are vital too.</p>
            <p>But, as a matter of fact, we never gained a two-year requirement in history in this country. The
                    history program of fifty years ago was largely elective. My worry is that history may be losing
                    ground instead of gaining it today, and not only to science, mathematics, and foreign language.
                    Through most of the past seventy years, and especially during the twenty years following 1892, the
                    historians exerted great influence on the social studies curriculum. No learned society in the other
                    social sciences had anything like the influence of the American Historical Association. But I am not
                    at all <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-059-2-032"/> certain that this situation will continue. All of our
                    sister disciplines are seeking a place in the curriculum. The economists are well on the road; the
                    political scientists, the geographers, the sociologists, even the anthropologists, have committees
                    at work considering the relationship of their disciplines to school programs.</p>
            <p>Do not misunderstand me. As a professional educator I welcome the long overdue interest of academic
                    scholars, especially social scientists, in the world of the schools. I only wonder whether the
                    historians are sufficiently concerned to hold their own.</p>
            <p>It is not that the historians have shown no interest in recent years. Indeed, it might be argued that
                    they have shown more interest in the past decade than in any previous one. The American Historical
                    Association has established the Service Center for Teachers of History<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and, for
                    the first time, a standing Committee on Teaching. Through the Service Center more than half a
                    million copies of nearly fifty Pamphlets, written by historical scholars for the benefit of history
                    teachers, have been distributed. The Service Center has also contributed to the conduct of scores of
                    institutes and conferences for history teachers in many parts of the country. It has sought to
                    provide the services of historians as consultants for school curriculum programs, and would be more
                    successful in this attempt if history teachers would see that their school systems call upon the
                    Service Center for help. And historians have helped the schools in other ways than through the
                    Association. A score of historical scholars contributed fine essays to the Thirty-First Yearbook of
                    the National Council for the Social Studies.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Professors of history have served

            <p>With increasing help from historians, we will do a better job of instruction. But how much history
                    will there be to teach? The scholars in other fields are campaigning for school programs that will
                    give more emphasis to their subjects. Do historians need to campaign also? I think so. Historians
                    with whom I talk seem reconciled to settling for the two years of history we think we have. But they
                    seem to feel that those two years are not in danger, that the weight of tradition and the force of
                    public opinion will preserve them. There is much reason to hold this belief with regard to the
                    traditional year of high school American history. If the schools should decide to give that up, the
                    legislatures would not allow it. But I suspect that the current pressures for anti-Communist
                    education will, by requiring teachers to spend long periods of time on a topic which should already
                    pervade the curriculum, take more time away from the study of American history than they give to it.
                    And I keep hearing recommendations that we might well give up the junior high school course in
                    American history because we have too many cycles of the subject.</p>
            <p>Granted that the year of high school American history is relatively safe. The world history course is
                    in no such secure position. It never became a uniform requirement across the country. Some schools
                    recently have substituted world geography for it, or made world geography an alternate elective. The
                    recent mandate in Pennsylvania that all high school students must devote at least a semester to the
                    study of world cultures may be a portent of the future. And I have not found anyone who yet knows
                    the ultimate content of a course in world cultures. I find little reason to believe that it will be
                    a world history course. But it may become a substitute for the world history course and thereby
                    displace more history than it will provide.</p>
            <p>One trouble is that there is general dissatisfaction with a world history course that attempts to
                    cover in one year everything from Pithecanthropus to Souvanna Phouma. At the same time, there is no
                    agreement on what is needed for improvement. We hear a lot of talk about "sinking postholes
                    and stringing a few wires between them." To an old farmer the idea of stringing wires
                    between postholes seems odd. (It is probably one of the results of urbanization.) But we cannot go
                    on adding to a course which is already impossible to <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-059-2-034"/> teach, and
                    it would be better to teach some parts well than to have a comprehensive but superficial course.</p>
            <p>We badly need a study of the world history course, but we also need a campaign for history
                    instruction. Over the main entrance to the library at the University of Colorado are the words,
                    "Enter here the timeless fellowship of the human spirit." There used to be a card
                    by that entrance that read, "When the winds blow and the weather turns cold, please enter
                    the timeless fellowship of the human spirit by the side door." I hope that we do not find
                    history entering by the side door before we recognize the change in the weather.</p>
            <p>If we are to have a campaign for history instruction, it will have to be conducted in terms that the
                    American public will understand and support. It will have to be in terms of the usefulness of
                    history to the citizen. Other reasons for studying history are valid, but they will not persuade the
                    American people that history should be required in the schools. Not long ago I was invited to attend
                    a conference of geographers who were seeking ways of increasing and improving the study of geography
                    in the schools. I was pleased to hear scholars emphasizing the uses of geography to the average
                    citizen. Some of them even sounded like professors of education as they said that the study of
                    geography should change the behavior of the student. But I had a letdown in a later conversation
                    with one of the geographers. He said that the study of geography was unrelated to its usefulness,
                    that he was one of several who felt this way. Nevertheless, he did want more geography in the
                    schools. I asked him why one does study geography. His response was, "There is a
                    traditional answer to that. Somebody asked a geographer why he studied a particular mountain, and
                    his answer was, 'Because it is there."' "I can safely assert
                    that if he were to give speeches along this line, they would hurt more than they would help the
                    cause of getting more geography into the schools.</p>
            <p>And he put me in mind of one of my own good professors of history. This professor used to ridicule
                    all the noble purposes set forth for studying and writing history. He compared history to symphony
                    music, saying that the only reason for studying it was that the student enjoyed it; the only reason
                    for writing it was that the scholar enjoyed it. Now I agree that studying and writing history should
                    be enjoyable. But they are worth doing even when they are tedious, as they <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-059-2-035"/> are bound to be sometimes. It is all very well to study a mountain
                    because it is there or to study history for the fun of it–if you can make an honest
                    living some other way or if you can find a patron. But the patron of the schools of America is the
                    American public. And I expect that it will not be very generous in its support of school subjects
                    unless it is convinced that they have values beyond the provision of pleasure. History has gained
                    the place that it has in the schools because the American people have considered it necessary to
                    loyal and enlightened citizenship. It will keep, gain, or lose ground there as that belief is
                    maintained, strengthened, or weakened.</p>
            <p>That history has major responsibilities for citizenship education has come under fire in some
                    quarters. A recent speaker quoted a recommendation of the National Association of Secondary School
                    Principals: "Young people who have a rich background in social studies are able to
                    recognize the struggle for freedom when it occurs and to detect, appraise, and overcome the enemies
                    of freedom in whatever guise they appear." Having quoted this passage, the speaker
                    commented, "Such exaggerated claims harm both the schools and the subjects." In
                    another place he said that "we should rid ourselves of the idea that history and the social
                    sciences have the job of making good citizens.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Now, of course, the social
                    studies are not the only means for making good citizens. Not even the schools are that. But the
                    social studies, and history in particular, have the responsibility in a unique way. In terms of
                    school subjects, and in the mind of the American public, only the social studies, and history in
                    particular, have the making of good citizens as their <hi rend="i">primary</hi> responsibility. This
                    has long been true.</p>
            <p>The passage which was quoted from the secondary school principals is only a weak paraphrase from
                    Thomas Jefferson. Listen to the author of the Declaration as he explains, even during the

            <p>There is the clarion call for the study of history in the schools. It will not be disputed with
                    success. It has been stated many times since, but never so eloquently. Moses Coit Tyler, probably
                    the first full-time professor of American history in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, said that his first consideration in teaching history was its value to his students as
                    citizens. The Committee of Seven of the American Historical Association, the most influential
                    committee on the social studies curriculum our country has had, said in 1899 that the prime value of
                    historical instruction was its contribution to citizenship. Only last year did <placeName>

                    </placeName> give up the term "Citizenship Education" as its official designation
                    for "history and the social sciences" in favor of the term "social
                    studies." The hope for maintaining and increasing the study of history in the schools is
                    the belief of the citizenry that history is essential to "rendering the people the safe, as
                    they are the ultimate, guardians of their own liberty."</p>
            <p>For the people to be safe guardians of their own liberty, what is needed from them is wise conduct,
                    right actions, growing out of the wise use of knowledge. Such conduct will include keeping informed
                    on issues, weighing evidence, deciding on desirable courses of action, working effectively to bring
                    about such action, and demanding democratic rights for themselves and others. These kinds of
                    behavior will grow out of desirable attitudes. The speaker I have quoted said that
                    "Attitudes cannot be taught in formal classroom situation.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> That

                    taught directly and effectively through devices which appeal to the emotions. And our schools must

                    states, and civilizations, dates and events, and routes of travel and military campaigns. These
                    items are necessary for instruction in history, but the real content of history has to do with <hi rend="i">people</hi> who "lived and felt and had their being." It must treat
                    of how they met and solved, or failed to solve, their many problems. How did they overcome, adjust
                    to, or become overwhelmed by the physical characteristics of the regions in which they lived? How
                    did they force nature to yield its riches, exploit these riches while yet conserving them, or lose

                    conserve? How, in modern times, has the dizzying pace of the acceleration of material progress
                    become one of mankind's greatest problems, and what subproblems does that acceleration
                    pose? What ways have men tried for organizing their economic activity, and how well have they
                    succeeded? What systems have been developed for governing people and with what success? Under what
                    conditions has human liberty thriven or succumbed? How have men learned to work together peaceably
                    to their mutual advantage? What causes have led them to conflict, and what means have they employed
                    to eliminate conflict or its causes? How have civilizations developed? What institutions have
                    civilizations found necessary to their existence and strengthening? What forms have these
                    institutions taken and what successes or failures have they had? What personal and societal values
                    have people developed as guides to their activities? What means have people taken to bring up their
                    young so as to preserve and enlarge their heritage? Such questions as these and the search for their
                    answers are the stuff of school history. And in the course of their consideration our students must
                    learn, to some degree at least, how the historian works to find out the answers.</p>
            <p>My first emphasis in this discussion of history teaching today is on the importance of knowledge. And
                    knowledge is important; it is all that we have with which to work. But all knowledge is of little
                    value unless we work with it. When the King of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> referred to James I of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> as the wisest fool in Christendom, he meant that although James had memorized a
                    tremendous collection of facts he did not use his knowledge to advantage. Herbert Baxter Adams, who
                    through his seminar at The Johns Hopkins University did more than any other one person to bring
                    order and respectability to advanced historical study in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, said that it was as important to teach a young person how to study history as to teach
                    him history itself. Alfred North Whitehead defined education as "the acquisition of the art
                    of the utilization of knowledge." We must remember to give proper attention to utilization.</p>
            <p>History students should learn many skills in getting knowledge: the various skills of reading; of
                    using the library; of interpreting maps and globes, graphs, and charts; of <pb n="131" id="VAA4025-059-2-039"/> listening, questioning, and interviewing; of taking notes, outlining,
                    and summarizing.</p>
            <p>Let me turn to a few examples in the skills of using knowledge. One such skill is the construction of
                    generalizations that will prove valuable long after the names of many persons and places have been
                    forgotten.</p>
            <p>Specific facts are required for the construction of a generalization. William James said that no one
                    sees farther into a generalization than his knowledge of the details permits. But the ability to
                    construct significant generalizations is necessary to free citizens, and it is one of our
                    responsibilities in teaching history to help develop that ability. The student who has memorized the
                    names and dates of a few dozen inventions and discoveries but has not constructed for himself a
                    generalization concerning the acceleration of material progress, or the student who has read of a
                    dozen revolutions by colonial peoples but has not constructed a generalization about the effect of
                    education and communication on the views and actions of subject peoples toward their oppressors, has
                    missed a very significant portion of his education.</p>
            <p>In addition to developing the ability to formulate generalizations, another responsibility of history
                    teachers has to do with the ability to draw inferences from generalizations. There is something
                    wrong with the education of a person who, having studied the effects of education and communication
                    on the views and actions toward imperialism of the peoples of Europe and the Americas, fails to draw
                    any inferences from these studies concerning similar developments in Asia and Africa. And the
                    student who has established generalizations about the acceleration of material progress and the
                    interdependence of peoples but does not draw any inferences concerning the probable effects of these
                    situations on his own life is ill-prepared indeed to cope with problems which the future holds in
                    store for him.</p>
            <p>The student must also learn caution in the application of generalizations and the drawing of
                    inferences. Generalizations about conditions which tend to cause revolt may not apply to a given
                    situation. Inferences may be faulty. Nevertheless, these are essential skills.</p>
            <p>Constructing generalizations from an assemblage of related facts and inferring particulars from
                    established generalizations <pb n="132" id="VAA4025-059-2-040"/> are but two of many significant
                    skills in the use of knowledge that we are challenged to teach through history. Others include
                    distinguishing fact from opinion, detecting bias, and discovering the motivation behind statements
                    and actions. The person who lacks these skills will be handicapped severely as he struggles with
                    promises of advertisers, issues in elections, propaganda techniques of big business and big labor,
                    or the cunning arguments of anti-democratic ideologies.</p>
            <p>In reporting on his tour of European schools in 1843, Horace Mann told a story of one of his
                    experiences which has lessons for us today. He said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>When visiting the schools in Leipsic, I remarked to the superintendent, that most
                            accomplished educationist, Dr. Vogel, that I did not see on the
                            "Study-Plan" of his schools the title "Exercises in
                            Thinking." His reply was, "No; for I consider it a sin in any teacher not
                            to lead his pupils to think in regard to all the subjects he teaches." He did not
                            call it an omission, or even a disqualification, in a teacher, if he did not awaken thought
                            in the minds of his pupils; but he peremptorily denounced it as a "<hi rend="i">sin.</hi>" "Alas!" thought I, "what expiation will
                            be sufficient for many of us who have had charge of the young!"<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>It will take intellectual study of history, knowledge, and skill in getting and using knowledge, to
                    render "the people the safe, as they are the ultimate, guardians of their own
                    liberty."</p>
            <p>The Muse of History must be bemused about the status of history in American schools; how much more
                    bemused she must become when she considers the manner in which our history teachers are prepared.
                    There are great variations in institutional requirements in breadth of liberal education and in
                    professional education. I do not know of any subject, or indeed core of knowledge, that is uniformly
                    required for a bachelor's degree in America. I will make a few remarks about the academic
                    specializations through which history teachers are prepared. This specialization may come through a
                    major designed for prospective teachers, a liberal arts major in history set up without regard to
                    student purpose, or a minor.</p>
            <p>I have made an analysis of the minimum requirements for something called a major for prospective

                    teacher preparation. The ten include teachers colleges, state colleges, private universities, and
                    public universities. The type of institution cannot be determined from the nature of its
                    teacher-preparation program. In these ten institutions, the total requirement in the social sciences
                    varies from thirty-five to fifty-seven semester hours. While all institutions require some breadth
                    in the field, the number of social sciences required varies from three to six. The minimum
                    requirement in a single social science varies from twelve to twenty-four semester hours. Four
                    institutions require sixteen or fewer semester hours in any single social science. The only
                    uniformity is that all ten institutions require some history. The minimum history requirement varies
                    from eight to twenty-one semester hours. Nine of the institutions require at least a year of
                    American history, but one does not require any. Eight of the institutions require at least a year of
                    non-American history, but two do not. Clearly, there is not much agreement among the alleged experts
                    as to what it takes to prepare a teacher of the social studies.</p>
            <p>There are those who say that a history major in a liberal arts college will provide the best
                    preparation for history teaching. They often use the expression, "a good, solid
                    major," showing their assumption that there is such a thing. I have analyzed the
                    requirements in history and the social sciences for history majors in eleven public and private
                    universities which have substantial programs for students other than prospective teachers. The total
                    requirement in history and the social sciences varies from twenty-nine to forty-two semester hours.
                    There are no common requirements in history, although ten of the eleven institutions do require a
                    course in the history of civilization or the history of Western civilization. Only six require a
                    course in American history. One does not require any of these three courses. Six of the institutions
                    do not require a history major to have any of the other social sciences on which the school social
                    studies curricula are based, and none of the other five requires more than eight semester hours of
                    such social studies. I should say that several of the universities claim to require history majors
                    to take related work in other social sciences. But included under that heading are subjects almost
                    unrelated to school social studies, such as art history, journalism, <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-059-2-042"/> philosophy, psychology, public health, and speech. Clearly, to know
                    that a liberal arts student has majored in history is to know very little about what he has studied.
                    This fact is recognized as a major difficulty by advisers in fifth-year programs of teacher
                    education.</p>
            <p>To compound the difficulty, many states and institutions recognize so-called
                    "minor" programs for the preparation of teachers. Minors in the field of the
                    social studies vary from eighteen semester hours (the equivalent of a beginning course in each of
                    three social sciences) to thirty-four semester hours. Minors in history vary from twelve semester
                    hours (likely 8 survey course in Western civilization and one in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>) to eighteen semester hours. I have found no professor of history or education who
                    believes that a minor provides adequate preparation, but minor programs do exist.</p>
            <p>The analyses which I have just presented only begin to indicate the confusion with regard to what
                    constitutes the preparation of a history teacher. Undoubtedly an analysis of the requirements in
                    more institutions would show greater variations. And the confusion is further compounded by the fact
                    that administrators often assign the task of teaching history to persons who do not even pretend to
                    have prepared for it.</p>
            <p>The American Historical Association will publish soon a set of recommendations on the preparation of
                    history teachers. I hope that it will receive careful consideration from the right persons.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Clio may well be bemused over both the status of history in American schools and the preparation of
                    American history teachers. But we cannot leave the resolution of these situations to the Muse.
                    History teachers and history professors must involve themselves in the matter.</p>

            <p>This British traveler would be the first to agree that there is more in this situation than meets the

                    early nineteenth-century inn found it necessary to stoop. Once through the door he lost whatever
                    distinction he may have had, drank at the bar with the drover, ate at the <hi rend="i">table

            <p>Some entered without conscious claims to distinction and others readily cast them off, but those slow

            <p>Whether the traveler chose to stay where he was or decided to try the inn down the road, he found
                    very little difference among frontier inns between 1775 and 1850. On the frontier the simple wayside
                    inn, which is the central focus of this study, was–as Featherstonhaugh
                    noted–usually a roughly constructed one- or two-room log cabin.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    Except for the tavern sign it could not be distinguished from a private dwelling. If it was located
                    near a settlement, the tavern served in varying degrees as a civic, news, and social center for the
                    community as well as an accommodation for travelers.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>As population or travel in an area increased the typical tavern was enlarged and changed to meet the
                    new demands. Usually there would be a sitting room or lobby with a bar in the corner and a large
                    fireplace on one side. Sometimes there was a separate barroom. A large kitchen, a dining room, and
                    several dormitory-type bedrooms might complete the list.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> One of the last rooms

                    the east into <placeName>

               </placeName>, and Wisconsin on the west. Within this geographic area
                    there were at any given time both differences and similarities among inns. Logically, the taverns in
                    the established communities differed from those on the newly opened frontier. Obviously, Mrs.
                    Moore's "farm-log-house tavern" in southern Indiana in 1820<hi rend="sup">13</hi> did not compare with Moses Gragg's tavern of the same date at Dedham, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. At Dedham the winter sleigh riders drank "mulled wine" until Mr.
                    Gragg said it "was a caution."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> At Mrs. Moore's,
                    there were no winter sleigh riders and the principal drink was probably whisky.</p>
            <p>In general during the period under consideration, the inns in the more industrialized New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> developed into attractive and well kept facilities while in the South, which continued
                    to be predominantly rural and agricultural until after 1850, the roadside inn remained less adequate
                    either as a temporary lodging or as a community center.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> There were, however,
                    fundamental similarities between the inns of 1775 and those of 1850 and between the inns of

                    development of a region but served the same basic purpose regardless of the date or their location.</p>

            <p>Every part of the inn–the barroom, the dining room, and the bedroom–supported
                    the egalitarian philosophy of the tavernkeeper. As John Bernard pointed out, this was especially
                    true of the one-room log tavern since, "having no internal divisions," it placed
                    "all upon a level" and forbade "the existence of parties."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> There was no place for protocol, class distinction, or conceit in a one-room
                    inn where shelter from the cold or rain was an object of major moment and where even floor space was
                    at a premium. John Heckewelder found only enough room for sitting or standing at a tavern east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1785. His wife, who was pregnant, was allowed the luxury of space for a bed on the
                        floor.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The combined barroom and lobby and the sitting room or common parlor were also ruthless levelers.
                    Travelers frequently complained, as did Isaac Holmes, of this "one public room, where all
                    are indiscriminately blended,"<hi rend="sup">19</hi>–a blending which included
                    liquor fumes, tobacco smoke, and spittal as well as people. Strange compounds indeed, in addition to
                    mint juleps, flip, or mulled wine, could be found in the barroom. Such mingling produced a sort of
                    unhappy stew in the case of Margaret Dwight, vivacious but chaste twenty-year-old niece of the
                    Reverend Timothy Dwight who traveled by wagon with a deacon and his family from

                    barroom was frequently the common or public room and was usually filled with as many migrants and

                    the loftiest and lowliest in rank and station are all placed upon the same level of

                    a brunette with a trace or more of Indian blood, a "Gothic" blond, and a Negro.
                    The men were equally diverse, so that the assembly was "a complete medley of all ranks,
                    ages, professions, trades, and occupations, brought together from all parts of the

                    their effect on tavern democracy was more nominal than real. It was a standing principle that the

                        guest.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> It might even be worse: he might have an experience similar to that

                    two strangers, of whom one was an avowed eye-gouger with the smell of liquor on his breath.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> It may not be altogether facetious to observe that the ubiquitous bedbug was

            <p>Foremost, perhaps, was the western American's strong tendency to equate the desire for

                    Connecticut in 1780 or 1781 provides droll support to Mr. Duncan's observation. Arriving at

                    his dismay, he was followed to his apartment by some of the drovers, who were drinking considerable
                    amounts of "grog and cyder," and who took the liberty of looking over his shoulder
                    at the map he was studying. It intrigued them. When they located <placeName>

                    Hall, might lift his eyes or turn his head to find others "fully prepared with reply,

                    against such invasions of private conversation might, according to James Flint, bring the retort

            <p>Tavern conversations mirrored democracy in other ways. Here the common man matched his wits and
                    opinions with the minister, the statesman, and the wealthy merchant. In a public inn in a free
                    country one was entitled to voice his convictions and to be heard with respect. When Fortescue
                    Cuming stopped at Habach's Tavern at Greensburgh, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, in January of 1808, some residents of the town followed the universal custom of
                    dropping in after supper to collect information from the travelers. "We had a long
                    political discussion," he reports, concerning the purpose of Aaron Burr's
                    activities, and no two were in complete agreement. Cuming's conclusion at the close of this
                    discussion related to procedure rather than to content: "in this country every man thinks
                    for himself, or at least he imagines he does, and would suppose himself insulted, was another to
                    attempt openly to bias his opinion."<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>This exercise of the right to be heard with respect was carried westward from an earlier period. In

                    and obtrusive fellows," evidently of Republican sentiments, arguing vociferously with
                    several "eminent lawyers" and a prominent judge about the merits of Jay's
                    Treaty of 1795. The debate continued throughout the evening and was resumed for a time after all had
                    retired to the common bedroom, but "at last sleep closed their eyes, and happily their

            <p>It is even possible to build a case for the leveling effects of the fights associated with some of

                    blood. When "King" Charlie Williams, founder of <placeName>

                    Phillipe, he responded by ejecting him bodily, and most unceremoniously, from his tavern.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> The effect would not have been quite so egalitarian had the young nobleman
                    won the tilt. When swaggerer "Big Johnson" at the Dell House on the Wisconsin
                    River insisted on knowing what an eastern dandy was carrying in his odd-shaped bundle, the latter,
                    who turned out to be a wrestling instructor, promptly tied him in knots.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> In a

            <p>One of the significant tavern mixtures was that of local clientele with travelers. It was not merely
                    gossip that lured the local gentlemen to the inn of an evening; it was also a wholesome curiosity
                    about a larger world. This was one of the most effective ways the provincialism of the townspeople
                    was modified by a wider environment.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

            <p>Another mixture that had especial significance, however, in relation to tavern democracy was that of
                    travelers with employees. While most Americans declared it was proper and right for maids, hostlers,
                    stage drivers, and landlords to mingle with guests, the Europeans usually found this disgusting.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The tavern servant in particular offended and baffled the foreign tourist.

            <p>Few Europeans, however, resisted the democratic leveling they experienced at American
                    taverns–and on the road–as much as did an unnamed French aristocrat who
                    described his difficulties to Henry M. Brackenridge when they met at a tavern in
                            <placeName>

               </placeName>, early in the nineteenth century. According to the
                    nobleman's account, when his barouche had stuck fast in the mud he had found that his
                    command, reinforced by money and cocked pistols, could not induce the passing
                    wagoners–who had no intention of taking orders from anyone–to pull him out. On
                    another occasion the Frenchman had thought that beating his own servant and threatening to shoot him
                    was his own affair, but local authorities had deemed otherwise and detained him. He reported also
                    that at one inn he had told the landlord that what the latter called pigeon dung on the sheets had
                    originated from another biped; the nobleman indicated to Brackenridge that he had found it
                    incredible that the lowly landlord had threatened to throw him out.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>Many other foreign tourists experienced similar difficulties in America, although most were not so
                    frustrating as those of this anonymous Frenchman. Some of the reactions of Mrs. Trollope, George W.

                    Baily, and several others, have already been indicated. To this list must be added Basil Hall and
                    his wife Margaret, who delighted in downgrading about everything they saw or experienced in America;
                    Count Francesco Arese, who declared that the individuals encountered in American hotels were

            <p>Even some native sons opposed the democratic discipline of the tavern. Thomas Fairfax, Virginia

            <p>On the other hand, there appeared to be converts to tavern democracy. Charles F. Hoffman seemed to

                    kettle," for the mixing experiences of the tavern lacked the smoothness of the melting
                    process with its homogeneous result and resembled more the stewing procedure with its generation of
                    steam pressure and heterogeneous end product. People were not so much melted together in the tavern
                    as stewed. Some resisted the process openly and others conformed because of necessity.</p>
            <p>Tavern discipline was arbitary, impersonal, and egalitarian. It was arbitrary in that it insisted on
                    attempting to squeeze all guests into one mold. It was as impersonal as the door lintel on which
                    Featherstonhaugh struck his head. Guests, housemaids, hostlers, landlords closed ranks to bring
                    informal social pressure on the nonconformist. It was as socially democratic as sleeping in a common
                    bed or eating at a common table could make it.</p>
            <p>That tavern society imposed its standards upon all its guests and that the nonconformist patron
                    suffered frequent indignities for his temerity seems clear. But there are indications also that the
                    patron who submitted reluctantly to the stewing process was not completely ineffective in his
                    resistance. Changes were taking place. The simple inn with its lack of class distinction and its
                    primitive accommodations was acquiring new characteristics. The barroom floor was being replaced as
                    a sleeping room by the common bedroom, and the latter soon gave way to private bedrooms and
                    apartments with doors which could be locked. In many cases these rooms were designed for serving
                    food in privacy as well as for sleeping in seclusion. Washroom facilities moved from the barroom or
                    outside bench to the private bedroom.</p>
            <p>Other changes were even more significant. Inns catering to particular social and economic classes
                    appeared. In and near large cities the inns operated primarily for stage passengers had better
                    facilities than the wagoners' stands, and sometimes would not accommodate wagoners. By the
                    end of the eighteenth century, inns near the large eastern cities where drover met butcher were
                    clearly distingushed, even by name.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Inns that specialized in

                    Although the tendency toward specialization seems to be exaggerated by some writers,<hi rend="sup">69</hi> there is evidence that a considerable variety of taverns did eventually develop.
                    Specialization remained less pronounced, however, in the regions west of the Appalachians, where its
                    complete development was prevented by the coming of the railroad which resulted in the demise of the
                    inn.</p>
            <p>The symbols of equality embodied in the simple American inn were often loyally defended by both
                    guests and proprietors, but it appears they were quickly dropped as soon as circumstances permitted.
                    This tractability would suggest that the patrons of the inn did not really enjoy its democratic
                    atmosphere but, since there was no alternative, they sometimes pretended and declared that they
                    delighted in it. Evidently those who were vocal in its defense secretly resented the communal
                    tyranny of the wayside inn as much as did the nonconformist. The conclusion must be, therefore, that
                    the American inn of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was a "stewing
                    kettle" and not a "melting pot."</p>

                    <p>This seems to be the time for the emergence of new plans to resurrect the social studies from the

                        schools throughout the country. In an effort to meet the challenge to provide outstanding
                        programs of instruction in social studies, schools are advised to begin with critical
                        examination of existing programs. To provide a sense of direction, Dr. Michaelis and the
                        contributing authors present a comprehensive overview of problems, issues, and recent trends in
                        organization of the social studies in elementary schools. These are identified through a
                        treatment of topics ranging from a concern for the social and psychological foundations of

                    <p>Throughout the book emphasis is placed on the need for a social studies program that will develop
                        within the elementary school child insights and understanding of people, their ways of living,
                        and their responses to the activities involved. Today's rapidly changing society
                        presents a whole new concept of man in relation to his environment. Television, newspapers,
                        films, recordings, travel: all are making a tremendous contribution to the child's
                        perception of the world in which he lives.</p>
                    <p>The authors point out that no longer can the traditional history and geography provide the
                        content for social studies. Teachers are urged to find ways to include strands of study in all
                        areas of concern about man in his changing environment. More utilization of learnings from all
                        the social sciences including history, geography, anthropology, economics, sociology, political
                        science, philosophy, and psychology are recognized as being essential to providing balance in
                        the social studies.</p>
                    <p>Teachers should be well informed in the social sciences and aware of the contribution of each to
                        a balanced social studies program. They should know also that social maturity cannot be attained
                        without understanding of how man solved problems in the past. No formal program of history is
                        needed for the young child. The daily experiences of children provide opportunities for teaching
                        simple units of time and chronology. As the child grows in maturity he reaches out for
                        historical understandings of a cultural or social nature. Although history is only one of the
                        social sciences, it rightfully holds first place in the elementary social studies.</p>

                        enables her to integrate these various disciplines through a balanced program of useful and
                        appropriate experiences.</p>
                    <p>Resources for the selection of materials for instruction are noted as being "as broad
                        and varied as the imagination <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-059-2-063"/> and resourcefulness of a
                        creative teacher" (p. 219). The selection and use of such are valid only in relation to
                        sound purposes and goals. Teachers are advised to use "textbooks as 'teaching
                        assistants' rather than content to be 'covered and
                        remembered'" (p. 228). Much concern is expressed over the proper use of
                        commercial and educational television. Many problems are yet to be solved but the potential of
                        television is unlimited.</p>
                    <p>As in every area of instruction, planning a social studies program for pupils of varying ability
                        is a problem that is the concern of the entire staff. Many schools attempt to meet this problem
                        through some plan of organization such as the non-graded school, team teaching, or through
                        special classes for exceptional children. Basic to all planning is an atmosphere wherein the
                        child learns self-appraisal, critical thinking, cooperation, and a desire to excel.</p>
                    <p>The chapter devoted to skills and processes describes social studies as providing the best
                        curricular opportunity for developing in the pupil the skills of critical thinking and problem
                        solving since it is the area most closely associated with his daily life. The pupil will have a
                        genuine need to develop communication skills, group work skills, and map reading skills. Through
                        dramatic play he can put himself into the shoes of another thus gaining new and deepened
                        insights into human relationships. In the last section of this chapter an attempt is made to
                        validate the controversial issue of the function of industrial arts. It is pointed out that
                        through creativity resulting from a culture study, firsthand experiences become
                        "springboards to intellectual understandings" (p. 215).</p>
                    <p>In the final chapter a variety of devices and methods, both formal and informal, are recommended
                        as necessary for evaluation of the social studies. Effective use of these devices depends upon
                        teacher recognition of their limitations and the interpretation of results in relation to the
                        child, his ability, and his background.</p>
                    <p>A realistic position is taken by the several authors with relation to the selection and placement
                        of content, the pattern of organization, the use of instructional materials, and the
                        individualization of instruction. Although many suggestions are given for use by teachers in
                        developing the social studies, the authors quite frankly admit that the real job of curriculum
                            <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-059-2-064"/> development remains in the hands of the teacher working
                        cooperatively with the children.</p>
                    <p>An examination of this book will reveal that while no attempt has been made to establish hard and
                        fast rules for developing a pattern of social studies, significant suggestions for improvement
                        may be found throughout its contents. <hi rend="i">Social Studies in Elementary Schools</hi>
                        will serve as an excellent guide to elementary school administrators and teachers who accept the
                        challenge to immediate action in the development of outstanding programs of instruction in the
                        social studies. Every elementary school principal and teacher will find this book a valuable

                    <p>The editor writes, "This Yearbook has been planned to provide an overview of recent
                        trends, issues, and problems in the social studies in elementary schools" (p. viii). In
                        pursuit of this objective thirty-three professional education experts subject the social studies
                        in elementary schools to an exhaustive and, at times, exhausting methodological and
                        philosophical examination.</p>
                    <p>Ere long, the reader–undoubtedly one directly associated with education–is
                        convinced (if he did not already know) that the elementary teacher must be a many-skilled
                        professional. The reader is readily apprised, too, of the magnitude of the burden which the
                        social studies are expected to carry in elementary schools. To develop a respect for people and
                        a desire to improve society; to contribute to a wholesome self-concept and a positive
                        perception; to liberate intelligence and correlate the demands of a democratic society with the
                        process of socialization–these are but a few of the more esoteric goals with which
                        the elementary social studies are charged. Furthermore, the reader is informed, the teacher
                        must, at the same time and continuously, formulate objectives; design units; plan for specific
                        classes; develop map reading and communication skills; use dramatic play and industrial arts;
                        and, with his class, participate in civic activities. Finally and constantly this same teacher
                        must apply evaluative devices to appraise growth in attitude, information, and skills and use
                        the evidence to help each child, regardless of his ability, <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-059-2-065"/>
                        achieve maximum development. These are but a few of the more tangible tasks with which the
                        teacher of the social studies is charged.</p>
                    <p>This Yearbook, in articulating the role of the social studies in elementary schools, should prove
                        helpful to teachers and curriculum planners. The guardians of the social studies are properly
                        reminded of the demands for competence and scholarship rightly placed upon them. Careful
                        selection and use of many of the scores, even hundreds, of suggestions presented by the
                        contributors could improve the social studies in elementary schools.</p>
                    <p>Many readers, in company with this reviewer, will find much that is provocative depending
                        probably upon their training, ideology, and educational philosophy. A typically stereotyped
                        explanation of the American Revolution introduces a suggested social studies topic for grades
                        four, five, and six (p. 103). That one contributor sees a problem in "the continuing
                        preoccupation of too many schools with the subject matter of . . . history" (p. 126)
                        indicates a distressingly parochial view of the nature and content of this discipline. Recurrent
                        throughout the Yearbook is the contention that one of the most, if not <hi rend="i">the</hi>
                        most, significant concern of the social studies is social education designed to meet social
                        needs and teach social skills for better social living. Educators could well be more concerned
                        with the nebulosity of social education than with attempts to
                        "intellectualize" the curriculum, which one contributor laments (p. 212). This
                        reviewer rejects the charge that teachers in the first three years, or teachers in any year,
                        should stress the concept of our "responsibility for the welfare of people all over the
                        world" (p. 106).</p>
                    <p>In general, it appears that the contributors to this Yearbook have formulated what seems to them
                        to be an ideal program to be applied in an ideal situation. Unfortunately, few, if any,
                        elementary schools enjoy such ideal circumstances. Further study might be made of the
                        implementation of this program within the realities of the usual school system. Few elementary
                        teachers are as adequately trained in economics, anthropology, sociology, political science,
                        history, geography, and philosophy as this study presumes. Nor do they appreciably fortify this
                        subject matter deficiency during their graduate training. Continuous protestations of concern
                        for <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-059-2-066"/> the individual child are made while large classes, mass
                        instruction media, and the teachers' crowded program contribute to depersonalization.
                        Myriad non-educational and expendable chores assigned to teachers consume irretrievable time and
                        attention. Too many school officials are more concerned with public relations and the school
                        image than with a truly effective educational program. Then, too, in each of the areas of the
                        elementary school curriculum equally formidable demands may be made of the same teacher who is
                        here charged with responsibility for the social studies. It need not be surprising then that, in
                        reality, an effective social studies program, as measured by the characteristics and purposes
                        listed in the Yearbook (pp. 3, 4), eludes realization.</p>
                    <p>Healthy differences of opinion do exist among the contributors. The trend away from teaching the
                        social studies as separate subjects such as history and geography is approvingly cited by one
                        (p. 107). The same contributor asserts that "there is relatively little significance
                        for children in giving attention to the structure and organization of separate
                        disciplines" (p. 129). In defense of the teacher-team concept, another contributor
                        suggests that "to do a full-size job, more, and more specialized, people are
                        needed" (p. 283). Citation of this difference of opinion is not intended to accuse the
                        contributors of indecision. It reflects, rather, the concern of this reviewer about the
                        increasing indifference shown toward the nature and purpose of specific
                        disciplines–in this case history.</p>
                    <p>New disciplines or combinations of old disciplines with new labels have inexorably nibbled away
                        at the literal province of history, until history is becoming academically peripheral. In
                        reality the province of history is universal: no music is played, no surgery is performed, no
                        building is constructed, no function of man occurs outside its purview. Traditional disciplinary
                        barriers may be altered; semantic fog may envelop the curriculum; but history must continue to
                        give meaning to culture, and method and system must be subordinated to meaning. Neither by
                        ignoring or hiding it nor by crossbreeding it into oblivion can the body of history be
                        dispelled. Professors of history who maintain a pontifical detachment from the issues of
                        education and who are equally indifferent to their own pedagogical obligations must share
                        responsibility for the waning status of their discipline in the public schools.</p>

                    <p>This Yearbook of the National Council for the Social Studies represents a collective effort by
                        thirty-three college professors of education and school administrators to discuss leading
                        problems and trends in teaching the social studies at the elementary level. It follows a
                        companion volume published last year by the same organization on the teaching and interpretation
                        of American history in the high schools. Widely distributed as they are, the two volumes may
                        considerably influence many teachers.</p>
                    <p>Most of the essays repeat familiar principles of educational psychology of the past half century,
                        though there is frequent reference to new experiments and findings. Basic in all of them is the
                        view that the purpose of the social studies is to develop the child socially and emotionally as
                        well as intellectually. Thus one encounters the terms skills, values, and attitudes on nearly
                        every page. Lists of goals, always important to educationalists, include skills in such areas as
                        working in groups, communications, and map reading. Desirable cultural values and social
                        attitudes (notably tolerance and cooperativeness) also receive heavy emphasis as the authors
                        explore the outcomes to be achieved. For the pupil's intellectual development, each
                        writer strongly recommends the instructional process called "problem solving"
                        in order to avoid unprofitable memorization and aimless drill. Solving problems, it is argued,
                        demands critical thinking–one of several valuable skills–and results in
                        achieving generalizations. Some techniques found helpful are homogeneous grouping, independent
                        study, team teaching, and acceleration; yet, as the experts admit, precise knowledge about
                        planning for children of varying ability is scanty. Always the teacher has the difficult
                        responsibility of evaluating what has been done. In a paper on this topic, a contributor
                        approvingly describes various methods of testing and analysis, but he obviously prefers the
                        short-answer, "objective" examination to the kind requiring essays.</p>
                    <p>A part, though a minor part, of the book concerns what is taught. The title of the subject has
                        special significance. It is social studies, not social science, which means that the educator is
                        concentrating upon the pupil's total personality rather than his understanding of the
                        content. Accordingly, the teacher must borrow from the social sciences as he seeks to develop
                        the child's skills, values, and attitudes; however <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-059-2-068"/>
                        he must rely upon other "resources" as well. One of these is current affairs.
                        Quite convincingly, it is urged that this be closely correlated with the whole course of study,
                        but much of the luster of the idea fades as he mentions with apparent satisfaction the hoary
                        practice of dedicating each Friday to the student newspaper. Another resource is television.
                        There is wisdom in the insistence that however valuable this medium of instruction is, it cannot
                        replace the individual teacher in the classroom. Indeed the "receiving"
                        teacher must know more and do more. Several other resources are discussed; but not much is said
                        about books, except for some apt, though fairly general, remarks about biography.</p>
                    <p>Elements of the philosophy permeating the book will favorably impress the reader. If history and
                        the other social sciences have anything to offer the elementary school child, they must be
                        taught as subjects with broad interest and meaning, not as empty exercises of memorizing facts.
                        Few would deny that the measure of the teacher's success is the degree to which he can
                        involve the pupil in the great adventure of critical thinking. Most of the authors have at least
                        implicitly responded to recent criticism of educational practices on intellectual grounds.
                        Whether the response is adequate remains to be seen. Nor would anyone quarrel with the
                        educators' fundamental premise that the social consequences of the instructional
                        process are crucial to the future of the republic. These consequences include, but go beyond,
                        the mere political relationship of the individual to his country, the prefaces in many textbooks
                        to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
                    <p>Still there are disquieting features of the book. The educators' determination to
                        eliminate the labels of history, political science, geography, economics, and sociology and to
                        conceal the places in the elementary school course where each subject is brought into play has
                        serious defects. After every allowance is made for the value of cross-disciplinary study, the
                        fact remains that it is largely through these disciplines that knowledge is derived. Each
                        discipline has a unique methodology and its own body of literature. To homogenize them beyond
                        recognition materially reduces the intellectual quality of the contents. A possible result is
                        that neither teachers nor pupils will have much proficiency in anything in particular. It is
                        probably not accidental that on many of <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-059-2-069"/> the lists of class
                        activities throughout the volume, reading books is well down toward the bottom.</p>
                    <p>The anxious search by educators for generalizations, to be supplied by the social scientists,
                        seems to violate their own psychological principles. Generalizations and concepts cannot be
                        transferred complete and mature from one person to another; they are the outcome of free and
                        industrious inquiry. The same criticism might be applied to the detailed curricular plans drawn
                        up by supervisors and experts for the teacher's use. One man's plan is not
                        very valuable to another, for it will be little understood or irrelevant to the special
                        circumstances at hand. Even more objectionable is the idea of transplanting prefabricated values
                        and attitudes. This comes perilously close to indoctrination.</p>
                    <p>After considering the strong and weak points of this report on teaching social studies, one is
                        compelled to inquire why there were not bolder departures from the educational thinking of the
                        last fifty years. The great problems of the present can be solved only by more drastic reform.
                        One fruitful approach might be to provide some specialization of teachers at the elementary
                        level–in the social sciences, the humanities, and the natural
                        sciences–just as there are specialists in physical education, art, and music. In the
                        large consolidated schools of today such an arrangement might be effective. Another reform might
                        be to close the gap between administrators or experts and the classroom teacher. Sometimes what
                        the one is saying and what the other is doing are two wholly different things.</p>

            <p>Centennials, sesquicentennials, and similar observances are usually heralded by the appearance of new
                    historical studies of the celebrated events themselves. The causes of the War of 1812 have long been
                    of interest to scholars. The principal facts are general knowledge. Controversy arises when relative
                    importance is assigned to them and when they are evaluated and interpreted. Newly discovered details
                    do not substantially alter what is already known about the course of events; they merely give
                    additional support for the various interpretations.</p>
            <p>Horsman's <hi rend="i">The Causes of the War of 1812</hi> is the outgrowth of a doctoral
                    dissertation. <hi rend="i">Prologue to War</hi> is the second of a three-volume series in which
                    Perkins is concerned with Anglo-American relations from 1795 to 1825. <hi rend="i">The Causes of the
                        War of 1812: National Honor or National Interest?</hi> launches a new series of <hi rend="i">American Problems Studies</hi> with Oscar Handlin as editor-in-chief. Its format,
                    sophistication, and other high standards augur well for the series.</p>
            <p>In his analysis, Horsman uses the renewal of the Anglo-French struggle in 1803 as his point of
                    departure. He contends that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was as "inextricably" involved in European affairs and that isolation
                    was as "impossible" then as it proved to be in 1914-1917 and in 1939-1941 (p. 24).
                    Before Trafalgar, the most serious problem was impressment, a question on which <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> would fight rather than yield. After the European war entered its "commercial
                    phase of blockade and counter-blockade" American commerce was "crushed between the
                    two Goliaths" (p. 57). The freedoms of neutrality suffered because British patriots were
                    anxious to stop American aid to the French and British shipping interests were envious of
                    America's growing commercial power. The belief that peaceful coercion would eventually
                    bring concession from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> led the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to delay declaring war until 1812. Anglo-American affairs, of primary importance to
                    America, were of minor concern to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> when compared to her struggle with <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. The American government did not realize this and frequently predicated her policy on
                    the supposed sensitivity of the British government to every minor fluctuation in American affairs.</p>
            <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-059-2-071"/>
            <p>The "final tragedy" was that when <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, in the midst of the depression of 1812, finally decided to give in to a major part of
                    the American demands, America had finally given up hope and had made an irrevocable commitment to
                    war (p. 60). Horsman asserts that basically the war was caused by certain British policies that were
                    largely dictated by European rather than American considerations. If the Anglo-French peace of
                    1801-1803 had been maintained, "there would have been no Orders in Council, no impressment,
                    and, in all probability, no War of 1812" (p. 267).</p>
            <p>Perkins in general agrees with Horsman that the war came because specific British actions and
                    policies threatened American interests; but, heretofore, he asserts, too many American historians
                    have "virtually caricatured" British policy rather than devote the considerable
                    attention to it that it deserves (p. vii).</p>
            <p>Perkins departs from Horsman, however, when he suggests that tangible and rational reasons for action
                    have been too much overemphasized by scholars while "national pride, sensitivity, and
                    frustration" have been slighted even though the evidence "leaps to the eye.
                    Emotion, chance, and half choices" often determine international relations "as
                    much as or more than cool reason" (p. vii). This was clearly the case in the years before
                    the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>Friction developed because America's choice was neutrality while Britain was engaged in a
                    life and death struggle against Napoleon. Many Englishmen regarded Americans contemptuously,
                    insisting that "these bastard Englishmen" be treated as "upstart
                    commercial rivals and political incompetents" (p. 2). British attitudes were governed by
                    emotion and not reason; but besieged nations are not given to dispassion and long-range thinking
                    when they formulate policy. Many Americans still held on to the Anglophobia of the Revolution and
                    were acutely aware that Britain and other European powers regarded them as unimportant in world
                    politics. Thus, when American legislation failed to secure concessions from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the only alternatives seemed to be war or national humiliation. Perkins also charges
                    the presidents with considerable blame as the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> muddled its way toward war. For example, after the election of 1808 Jefferson
                    "virtually abdicated," merely marking time until he could leave for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. 178). And his successor, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, did not point out any way of reaching a "promised land of peace" and
                    for over two years the country "wallowed in purposeless humiliation" (p. 223).</p>
            <p>Selections from the writings of several historians who have interpreted the coming of the war make up
                    the <hi rend="i">American Problems Studies</hi> pamphlet. Suffice it to indicate here that Leonard
                    D. White and Herbert Heaton examine the breakdown of America's aggressive diplomatic
                    weapon, economic coercion; Henry Adams and A. L. Burt stress maritime issues; Louis M. Hacker and
                    Julius W. Pratt debate the role of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>; George R. Taylor and Margaret K. Latimer assay the effect of the depression of
                    1811-1812; N#2 K. Risjord and Horsman de-emphasize the importance of the West per se
                    (Horsman's <hi rend="i">Causes</hi> was not yet available to the editor); and, finally,
                    Irving Brant, Perkins (from his <hi rend="i">Prologue</hi>), and George Dangerfield <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-059-2-072"/> evaluate the performance of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This commendable and convenient package offers much for undergraduates to chew over
                    and wrestle with in research papers and seminar discussions; it is also an excellent introduction to
                    the literature of the subject.</p>
            <p>The Horsman volume and Perkins' <hi rend="i">Prologue</hi> are both products of prodigious
                    and meticulous scholarship. Perkins examined heretofore inaccessible English and American papers and
                    archives and re-examined others in light of recent scholarship; English-born Horsman was blessed
                    with the advantage of English and American training thus giving him an unusual perspective for his
                    study. Horsman's strength is readability and clarity; Perkins' forte is detailed
                    corroborative evidence. The Perkins book will appeal primarily to scholars; the Horsman study will
                    attract the lay reader as well.</p>
            <p>Both add new detail which they have uncovered; but their principal contribution is interpretive. But,
                    as Perkins points out in his introduction to the pamphlet, "Not one of the interpretations
                    discussed . . . was left unmentioned, either by advocates or opponents of war, in 1811 and 1812. . .
                    . Thus, in one sense, historians have really only continued a contemporary controversy. Their
                    disagreements . . . suggest that the problem of war causation is highly complicated." What
                    is still needed is for someone "to correlate and synthesize the various sets of
                    causes," a suggestion as valid today as when it was made in 1941 by Warren H. Goodman in
                    "The Origins of the War of 1812: A Survey of Changing Interpretations" (<hi rend="i">Mississippi Valley Historical Review</hi>, XXVIII, 185). The Perkins pamphlet is a
                    helpful introductory move in that direction.</p>

            <p>As stated in the editor's preface, this volume of articles was published primarily to

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> General Land Office, predecessor of the present Bureau of Land Management. An advisory
                    board of scholars on the history of the public lands was set up to select for republication two
                    dozen articles from some sixty. Because the subject is basic to so many fields of historical
                    interest, the articles have appeared in many diverse and even obscure journals. Perhaps a majority
                    of the articles selected have been published since the Second World War, thus demonstrating a
                    growing interest in the subject. The editor and advisory board are to be commended for bringing
                    these articles together under one cover.</p>
            <p>The articles are arranged in five parts with a commentary heading each part. Part One includes three
                    articles on the origins of the public land system; Part Two, nine on the distribution of the public
                    lands; Part Three, nine on criticism and interpretation of public lands <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-059-2-073"/> history, including the well known "safety-valve"
                    hypothesis; Part Four, three on the problems of protection and management; and, lastly, Part Five is
                    a useful appendix consisting of several maps, charts, a recent evaluation of public lands records, a
                    table of the various district land offices, and a compendium containing a brief biography of each of

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> public land commissioners. Many of the articles in the first four parts also contain
                    charts, tables, maps, and illustrations.</p>
            <p>Centennial celebrations often have the desired effect of stimulating further research and
                    publication. There are still many materials–even important public lands
                    records–in depositories throughout the public lands states. Many of the records in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., have barely been touched. While excellent articles and books have been published
                    on state studies, there are still many states without histories of their public lands. It is hoped
                    that graduate students will take note of the opportunities for research in this important field.
                    Indeed, the definitive history of the public lands of the <placeName>

            <p>Father Prucha concentrates on American Indian policy from 1790 until 1834 when "The
                    formative years were over, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> looked to the future with an Indian policy that was considered reasonable and
                    adequate" (p. 274). Three initial chapters provide valuable background about historical and
                    administrative precedents from the colonial era through the early 1790's. Chapter IV adds a
                    concise and useful account of the development of the "Indian Department" as a
                    division within the War Department. These early chapters indicate that problems concerning
                    Indian-white relations which the Americans faced had earlier beset the British but in a modified
                    context.</p>
            <p>According to Prucha, though American Indian policy was expressed in formal treaties with the Indians
                    "it took shape primarily in a series of federal laws 'to regulate trade and
                    intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontier'" (p.
                    2). "To maintain the desired order and tranquility it was necessary to place restrictions
                    on the contacts between the whites and the Indians. The intercourse acts were thus restrictive and
                    prohibitory in nature–aimed largely at restraining the actions of the whites and
                    providing justice to the Indians as the means of preventing hostility. But if the goal was an
                    orderly advance, it was nevertheless advance of the frontier, and in the process of reconciling the
                    two elements, conflict and injustice were often the result" (p. 3). Prucha recognizes that
                    governmental policy "remained more an ideal than a reality because the means applied had
                    been out of all proportion to the magnitude of the problem" (p. 276).</p>
            <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-059-2-074"/>
            <p>Chapters V-VIII detail innumerable examples of white exploitation and abuse of Indians, especially as
                    regards the fur trade, disposition of whisky, intruders on Indian lands, and crimes in Indian areas.
                    At times these chapters are perhaps more repetitive than necessary. Limited attention is given to
                    Indian removal and efforts to civilize the Indians.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, Prucha attempts to tell his story in as factual a manner as possible. He searches hard
                    for facts upon which to base interpretations and conclusions, not for facts to buttress a largely
                    preconceived framework. Thus, unlike too many ethno-historians, he is principally concerned with
                    explaining what happened in the context of the period, not what should have happened in terms of
                    subsequent developments and concepts. The result is a book which makes a significant contribution to
                    increased knowledge and understanding of the formative period in American-Indian relations.</p>

                    </placeName>: Indiana Historical Society, 1962. Pp. xiv, 195. Illustrations, index.

            <p>Many architects would be prone to isolate those houses whose architectural style they prefer and
                    neglect all others. (For example, it is difficult for me–feeling as I do that all
                    architecture from 1850 to 1950 was based on eclecticism–to see much of value for future
                    historians. So, with my biased point of view, I am exceedingly enthusiastic about all the early work
                    south of the old National Road and quite a lot of the work along the northern end of the state.) In
                    this scholarly production, however, Wilbur Peat has recorded with accuracy the most representative
                    Indiana residential architecture of the 1800's, described the changes that took place, and
                    shown the reasons for those changes. <hi rend="i">Indiana Houses of the Nineteenth Century</hi>
                    gives the reader a fine interpretation of that architecture, identifying its many details with
                    margin drawings describing cornices, bargeboards, bay windows, doorways, and many other examples of
                    each period.</p>
            <p>In his first chapter, Mr. Peat has summarized and clarified the styles of architecture prevalent in
                    the nineteenth century. This will be most helpful to the general reader, but will prove of interest
                    as a refresher course for architects and historians as well. In subsequent chapters the author has
                    grouped houses into their various categories and, both by word and by drawings, given the reader
                    information which clarifies the classification. In his discussion of the early nineteenth-century
                    houses that were built from the Ohio to the northern part of the state, he has made clear that the
                    colonnades, porches, and other additions by later builders and architects have in most cases damaged
                    rather than enhanced these structures.</p>
            <p>This is not a book which can be read with speed and then forgotten. It is a studious presentation.
                    Wilbur Peat's constant interest in early domestic architecture has brought him forward as
                    an authority on the <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-059-2-075"/> subject. Anyone who loves the grandeur of
                    old houses or reads of the gracious manner of living in the nineteenth century will feel a kinship
                    with it all after a careful reading of this book. Those of us who look with pride at our
                    architectural heritage will read and reread it as we have the wonderful books on the architecture of
                    our early colonies. Perhaps it will help those over the state who are interested in preservation and
                    restoration find a use for the remaining structures.</p>

            <p>The publications of W. L. Morton, former president of the Canadian Historical Association, range from
                    books and articles based upon exhaustive research to fresh, interpretive essays which develop a
                    redefinition of familiar material. The four chapters which comprise <hi rend="i">The Canadian
                        Identity</hi> fall into the latter category. Despite the hazards of historical synthesis,
                    Professor Morton performs the task exceedingly well. His high literary talent provides the reader
                    with historical background to a peculiarly Canadian experience in clear-cut, direct statements.</p>
            <p>Some of the best sections in the volume are presented in a refreshing compression of monographic
                    detail into a brief but vigorous review of Canadian history. In the first essay, for example, the
                    author considers the territorial evolution of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> from the end of the fifteenth century to the 1846 boundary settlement between the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the British Northwest Territory. At this point the author endeavors to state the
                    case early for <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>'s "northern destiny" (p. 4). Actually, the attempt is
                    premature. The idea, however, is a good one, and this major theme emerges at more acceptable times
                    in the succeeding chapters.</p>
            <p>Clearly Professor Morton is not aiming at a re-interpretation of Canadian history. His primary
                    emphasis is on indicating a future course for Canadians of all "crafts and
                    callings" within the framework of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>'s unique experience as a Commonwealth nation, on the limitations of
                    Commonwealth unity, and on the frictions between <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as they have developed since 1941. These are large problems. But the author believes
                    that the key to Commonwealth association can be realized in Burke's ideal of "
                    '"ties light as silk, but strong as links of steel,' mutual respect,
                    mutual tolerance, co-operation where co-operation is possible, understanding where it is
                    not" (p. 57).</p>
            <p>On the question of Canadian-American discord, Professor Morton's restraint far outweighs his
                    criticism. Eschewing emotionalism, he perceives clearly that what <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> fears "is not the old America, but America in its new role of world
                    power" (p. 84). To this reviewer, the irritability of Canadians with American foreign
                    policy has, in this case, exaggerated the fear. But it encourages the author to propose a simple
                    formula: "It is part of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>'s destiny to be an independent nation in America" (p. 83).</p>
            <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-059-2-076"/>
            <p>This book marks a daring departure for the author outside the field of technical historical writing.
                    Nevertheless, these essays–of which the first three were delivered as lectures at the
                    University of Wisconsin and the fourth as a presidential address to the Canadian Historical
                    Association–are as comprehensive in scope as they are perceptive in conclusions. The
                    dimension of the narrative should not frighten the general American reader; for an
                    "insider" in Canadian history, Professor Morton presents his material judiciously.</p>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Then, using the flashback technique, he discusses her formative years, her marriage,
                    and her early religious views. What follows is a detailed account of the role she played in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, an account which covers the years 1634 to 1638 and which builds to a climax when she
                    was excommunicated and banished. A brief reference is made to her removal to <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName> and from thence to Long Island where in 1643 she was tomahawked by the Indians. The
                    last portion of the book contains a sociological study of the background and conduct of the
                    Hutchinsonians. In the concluding chapter the author comments about the impact of the Antinomian
                    controversy upon the Bay Colony.</p>
            <p>Since much has been written already, why did the author attempt to replow the same historical ground?
                    He was striving for a new and imaginative approach to this topic and, by applying the methods used
                    by scholars in the behavioral sciences, he was probing for deeper insights into the complexities of
                    the Antinomian controversy. By a study of the sociological implications and by a quantitative
                    analysis of the population, he proves that the followers of Anne were not riff-raff but persons of
                    good political and socio-economic standing. He believes that her religious views and actions were
                    not the result of normal impulses but were an outgrowth of complex emotional pressures and
                    psychological factors. He does not believe that she was consciously promoting religious freedom but
                    was merely upholding her own independent views. Individualism and nonconformity, however, could not
                    be tolerated by the oligarchical leaders; and, to them, divergent opinions were dangerously
                    heretical and seditious. Controversy might destroy their church and state, their way of life. This
                    was not an age of tolerance; there could be no compromising. Nonconformists must either conform or
                    leave. The orthodox Puritans held fast, and their "Zion in the Wilderness" was
                    preserved momentarily. Nevertheless, the Antinomians, according to the author's conclusion,
                    "had struck a heavy blow–if not for freedom <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-059-2-077"/>
                    of thought, certainly for that heterogeneity which leads to freedom of thought" (p. 289);
                    and, in the end, the <hi rend="i">status quo</hi> could not be maintained in the Puritans'
                    "City of God."</p>
            <p>The book's central theme is one of conflict: heterodoxy <hi rend="i">versus</hi> orthodoxy;
                    liberalism <hi rend="i">versus</hi> conservatism; individual action <hi rend="i">versus</hi>
                    hierarchical control. Here is the search for the meaning of life and salvation. Here are the fine
                    points of the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace argued with an intensity that is almost
                    incomprehensible to the modern reader. Here, too, are the saints, sectaries, and
                    sinners–Winthrop, Cotton, Wheelright, Coddington, Underhill, Vane, Symmes, Wilson, and
                    many others–all of whom are described objectively by the author.</p>
            <p>This reviewer is not convinced that a person who has been dead for three hundred twenty years can be
                    psychoanalyzed. Anne's emotional problems probably started at an early age. She was tired
                    from child-bearing–fifteen in all, worn out from long hours of inquisitional
                    interrogation, and troubled with menopausal symptoms. These and other psychological determinants
                    permit speculation about the nature and character of Mrs. Hutchinson, but they do not explain
                    completely how she acquired her convictions and why she so adamantly defended them. The
                    author's sociological findings, especially those concerning social status, are more
                    convincing than his psychological conclusions. Yet, within the framework of his approach, the author
                    has succeeded in shedding new light upon the subject. The book is well written, well documented,
                    well indexed; the maps are helpful; the bibliography and fifty-five pages of appendixes illustrate
                    exhaustive research; and the craftsmanship displayed in the printing and binding should more than
                    satisfy the discerning eye of the critic.</p>

                    "bales of notes from talks with fur traders, army officers, Indian agents,
                    surveyors" falls upon Philip P. Mason, editor of the third of the above-mentioned printed
                    works and of the one under review. Mr. Mason assures us that there is still a veritable mine of
                    material to be explored.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Literary Voyager</hi>, a short-lived but significant little periodical of its time,
                    is an auspicious choice for the first volume. It was one of the minor products of
                    Schoolcraft's occupational hazards in accepting the office of Indian agent at the Sault. He
                    knew little about the Indians. He suffered severely from an addiction to taking notes. He <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-059-2-078"/> was a curious and sympathetic observer and listener and through
                    his insatiable zest for learning about and disseminating knowledge of the Indians he became an
                    ethnologist.</p>
            <p>Upon his arrival at Sault Ste. Marie, Schoolcraft was invited by John Johnston, chief fur trader of
                    the region, to take quarters in his household. The association with the Johnstons was invaluable.
                    Johnston's wife was no less than the daughter of the distinguished Chippewa chief, Waub
                    Ojeeg. Within a year Schoolcraft married the Johnstons' eldest daughter, Jane, who, with
                    her mother and other members of the family, became his reliable informers in his ethnological
                    pursuits.</p>
            <p>In December of 1826 Schoolcraft started his magazine, the first in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, naming it <hi rend="i">The Literary Voyager or Muzzeniegun.</hi> The twenty-page
                    issues were handwritten in few or single copies which were circulated first in
                    Schoolcraft's own community and then among his friends in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and eastern cities. They remained in manuscript, although Schoolcraft had notions of
                    editing the file for publication in the 1850's. Mr. Mason has been able, with considerable
                    effort, to locate numbers 1-16 except for numbers 6, 10, and a large part of 12. He has also found
                    some of Schoolcraft's notes, but the major part of the editorial research is his own.</p>
            <p>An analysis of content demonstrates immediately that this is not a literary journal but chiefly an

                    literary touch consisted in the inclusion in every issue of one or more poems, usually by
                    Schoolcraft or his wife, both of whom seemed to have a penchant for verse making. These appeared
                    usually over one of the pseudonyms adopted, several for each person, by the Schoolcraft and Johnston
                    families. Twice other contributors were hinted at and thanked, but on the whole the paper remained a
                    family affair. The fourteenth issue was completely devoted to the obituary and eulogies of the
                    Schoolcraft son who died at the age of two years and eight months. With the fifteenth issue (April
                    11, 1827), which contained Pontiac's Appeal to the western tribes and a few trifling items
                    besides the Requiem over the grave of the little son, <hi rend="i">The Literary Voyager</hi> folded.
                    Perhaps the materials may appear in substance in Schoolcraft's other works but not in this

            <p>When Ignatius L. Donnelly was seventeen years old, he received a letter from the popular New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> author, Oliver Wendell Holmes, predicting that "by and by we shall hear of
                    Ignatius L. Donnelly" (p. 1). Holmes was commenting in 1848 on Donnelly's promise
                    as a writer, and while the prophecy was accurate enough as regards the future author of <hi rend="i">Caesar's Column, Atlantis</hi>, and <hi rend="i">The Great Crytogram</hi>, much more
                    was to be heard of Donnelly as a politician and advocate of reform than as a poet or novelist.</p>
            <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-059-2-080"/>
            <p>Born in 1831 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> of Irish Catholic parentage, Ignatius Donnelly was reared in that city and there began
                    the practice of law and his interest in politics.</p>
            <p>It is with Donnelly's political career that Martin Ridge, Associate Professor of history at
                    San Diego State College, is concerned in this excellent biography. Professor Ridge's title
                    is happily chosen for what he has sought to do–present the portrait of a politician.
                    Donnelly entered politics in 1855 as a Democratic candidate for the Pennsylvania legislature, but
                    withdrew from the race the day before the election. In 1856 he campaigned actively for the election
                    of James Buchanan to the presidency and in the same year he moved to Minnesota and settled in
                    Nininger City where he maintained his home for the remaining forty-five years of his life.</p>
            <p>Beginning with Donnelly's election as secretary of the Republican territorial convention and
                    his nomination for the Minnesota senate in 1857, Professor Ridge traces in interesting detail a
                    political career which included Donnelly's activities as a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> Republican lieutenant governor and acting governor of Minnesota during the Civil War;
                    as a Radical Republican congressman in the Reconstruction period; as a leader of the Liberal
                    Republican movement in Minnesota in 1872; as an organizer of the Minnesota Granger Movement; as the
                    leader of the Anti-Monopoly party in the Minnesota senate; as temporary chairman of the Greenback
                    party national convention in 1876 and a Democratic-Greenback nominee for Congress in 1878; as a
                    congressional candidate supporting Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>

                    in the lower house of the state legislature in the mid-1880's; as the gubernatorial nominee
                    of the Farmer Labor party in 1888; as an Alliance Labor Union state senator in the early
                    1890's; as an organizer of the Populist party, member of its national committee, and
                    nominee for governor of Minnesota in 1892; as supporter of William Jennings Bryan in 1896; and as
                    vice-presidential nominee of the Mid-Road People's party in 1900.</p>

                    </placeName> history have long been aware–often only vaguely–that Donnelly was
                    an important figure. Professor Ridge tells us why. Relying mainly on manuscript sources and
                    newspapers, though without neglecting theses and monographs, Ridge paints an accurate historical
                    picture not only of Donnelly but also of the period in which he lived. This biography is well
                    written, the footnotes are at the bottom of the pages where they belong, and there are no noticeable
                    errors of any significance. Professor Ridge's book represents a difficult task well done,
                    and is an important contribution to the history of Minnesota and of the nation.</p>

            <p>Twenty-three essays, each focusing on an incident of public address during the latter stages of the
                    sectional crisis, have been brought <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-059-2-081"/> together in this volume. In
                    their aggregate, the essays comprise a record of public discussion on the issues of antislavery and
                    disunion during the last two and a half years of peace. The essays also fulfill another purpose.
                    They demonstrate the vast importance of rhetoric and public address in the creation of an atmosphere
                    of emotionalism and distortion, the context in which the Union failed in 1860 and 1861. They
                    represent, in the words of the editor, an inquiry "into the conditions which led to the
                    disruption of public discussion and the substitution for it of armed conflict" (p. v).
                    Professors of speech and rhetoric have made frequent and valuable contributions to the understanding
                    and interpretation of historical events. Now once again, historians must acknowledge a debt of
                    gratitude to their colleagues in the neighboring discipline.</p>
            <p>The conclusion to be drawn from this collection is clear and un-mistakeable. Speechmaking played a
                    major role in fixing sectional attitudes beyond the point of compromise and in hastening the final
                    showdown between the North and the South. Much of the speechmaking was irresponsible; the use of
                    emotionally charged symbols and distorted facts had become common. This was the "rhetoric
                    of agitation." Represented in these studies are abolitionists like Abram Pryne and Ford
                    Douglass, who focused his attack on Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Republicans. The 1860 meeting of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, a small
                    incident in itself but representative of the larger issue, is treated in detail. Seward's
                    "irrepressible conflict" speech in 1858, the emotional tirades of newly-elected
                    state governors, whose "voices drowned out the pleas of the compromisers" (p.
                    377), and the defeat of the efforts of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Peace Conference by radical Republicans and Southern fire-eaters helped to hasten the
                    end of "conflict by talk" and the beginning of "conflict by
                    arms" (p. viii). One of the most effective essays deals with Owen Lovejoy's
                    radical, flamboyant speech on the "Barbarism of Slavery," delivered less than
                    three weeks before the meeting of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Convention. Less well represented are the extremists of the South.
                    "Parson" Brownlow's defense of slavery in 1858 and an 1859 Fourth of July
                    oration by Robert Barnwell Rhett present the radical Southern viewpoint. An outstanding essay in the
                    opinion of this reviewer is that on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Convention of the Democratic party, where "speechmaking at its worst"
                    brought into focus the hopelessness of compromise and conciliation. The comment of a North
                    Carolinian, quoted in this essay, seems to provide a theme for the years covered by this volume:
                    "What a season for Demagogues and Charlatans!" (p. 191).</p>
            <p>Not all of the speechmaking, however, was designed to fix public views at the extremes. Jefferson
                    Davis, speaking in 1858 at Faneuil Hall in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to the Mississippi state legislature, is here portrayed as a "sectional
                    diplomat." Stephen A. Douglas' appeals on behalf of the Union during his Southern
                    campaign in 1860 are presented and the volume closes with an excellent, carefully documented study
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "final plea for a course of action befitting
                    'friends'" in his First Inaugural Address (p. 413).</p>
            <p>As is often the case with such cooperative efforts, the quality of these essays is uneven. Some
                    reflect the highest standards of historical research and scholarship and some are frankly quite

               <hi rend="i">Commanders of the Army of the Potomac.</hi> By Warren W. Hassler, Jr. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baton Rouge</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Louisiana State University Press, 1962. Pp. xxi, 281. Illustrations, maps,
                    bibliographical essay, index. $6.00.)</head>
            <p>In this book, Professor Hassler presents an exposition of the command careers of the generals who
                    headed the Army of the Potomac. Taken chronologically, these men were McDowell, McClellan, Burnside,
                    Hooker, and Meade. Chapters are also devoted to Pope, whose shortlived Army of Virginia was merged
                    into the Army of the Potomac after Second Bull Run, and Grant, who was Meade's
                    overshadowing superior during the final Virginia campaign.</p>
            <p>The scheme and organization of the book are good. A well-written account of the conduct of each
                    officer appears. This is followed by a Conclusion in which the men are compared and measured against
                    such criteria as strategy, tactics, administrative skill, and use of naval power.</p>
            <p>In his statements of objective <hi rend="i">fact</hi>, Professor Hassler is a sure teacher. The book
                    is marked by careful basic scholarship. With one notable exception, the author's judgments
                    of the men are the traditional ones, although–subject to the same exception–it
                    sometimes seems that he is extravagant in his condemnations. Thus, in the case of the usual
                    villains–Pope, Burnside, and Hooker–there is hardly a good word said, although
                    at least Pope and Hooker had certain gifts despite their ultimate failings.</p>
            <p>McDowell, Grant, and Meade are accorded "balanced" treatment. This reviewer had the
                    impression that Dr. Hassler has no predilections about these men and therefore presents their
                    stories thoughtfully. It is when McClellan is under discussion that the author seems to labor. He is
                    a staunch defender of McClellan and his brief for him is the point of departure for the book as a
                    whole. The impression is given that Dr. Hassler tends to view the other leaders from the vantage
                    point of one championing McClellan. The analysis of these men seems colored by efforts to bolster
                    McClellan.</p>
            <p>Reasonable men may–or, in any event, <hi rend="i">do</hi>–differ about George
                    B. McClellan. A reviewer has no right to reject an author's thesis simply because it
                    defends McClellan. At the same time, certain things appear in this book which one would seem to have
                    the right to question. Thus, the McClellan view of all of his celebrated controversies is invariably
                    adopted and couched in "good guy-bad guy" terms inconsistent with scholarship. For
                    example, the Radicals appear as unmitigated "bad guys," moving always to harm
                    McClellan; the government was always "meddling" in McClellan's affairs;
                    McClellan was right–or <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-059-2-083"/> almost right–and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> was wrong about the defenses of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1862; McClellan was cautious, but he was not really slow; and his subordinates were
                    at fault when he failed. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Antietam</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the one failure that McClellan's defenders have never been able to explain,
                    is largely blamed on Burnside. McClellan's conduct–<hi rend="i">before,
                    during</hi>, and <hi rend="i">after</hi> this unmatched lost opportunity–is explained on
                    the ground that McClellan had been "informed" that Lee had 120,000 men and
                    McClellan was, after all, "a circumspect man" (p. 85). Nothing at all appears to
                    rationalize the corps-by-corps manner in which McClellan wasted his vastly superior manpower.</p>
            <p>Beyond these basic issues, a number of other defenses of McClellan are offered. Thus, we are told
                    that McClellan's custom of pressing on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> his <hi rend="i">political</hi> views was "customary" among the
                    generals of the period (pp. 28-29). But was it? It was not done by McDowell, Pope, or Burnside. More
                    significant, it was not done by Grant, Meade, Sheridan, or Thomas. Professor Hassler also states
                    that McClellan was "generally deferential and proper in his intercourse with his superiors
                    [unless] he believed an error or injustice was being committed" (p. 39). This qualification
                    successfully begs the question. McClellan was insolent and insubordinate to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Stanton, and Halleck on a number of occasions simply because <hi rend="i">he</hi>
                    believed that they were in error. Professor Hassler is also quick to downgrade even incidental
                    figures who were at odds with McClellan. General Wads-worth–one of the men who believed
                    that McClellan had left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> insecure when he moved to the Penninsula–is called an "elderly
                    political general" in 1862 (p. 41). It might also have been said that this
                    "elderly" man ably led the First Division of the First Corps at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was killed in action in the Wilderness in 1864. General Halleck is referred to as
                    a "moral coward" (p. 54), surely an oversimplification of this complicated man. An
                    inference is left to cloud the reputation of Stanton simply because he did not defend himself
                    against McClellan's well-known hysterical letter which accused the Secretary of War of <hi rend="i">intentionally</hi> trying to sacrifice the army on the Peninsula (p. 50). In his
                    affirmative case, Professor Hassler cites the chestnut that Lee said after the war that McClellan
                    had been his ablest opponent (p. 249)–a "fact" based on multiple
                    hearsay and not generally accepted by scholars. Finally, and most illuminating of Professor
                    Hassler's comprehension of the military character of the war, is his statement that there
                    was "too much 'nursing' of the Union infantry . . . too much lying down
                    and firing at short range, and too little use of the bayonet charge, pressed home" (p.
                    245). It may be candidly said that no serious student of military tactics of the period–a
                    period of <hi rend="i">rifled</hi> arms, earthworks, and effective anti-personnel
                    artillery–shares this view. On the contrary, their criticism of Civil War tactics argues
                    precisely the contrary. But this is the kind of thing that McClellan himself would have <hi rend="i">said</hi>, or, more likely, written in a letter to his wife.</p>
            <p>It is generally conceded that McClellan had certain high qualifications. Even Professor Hassler
                    grants that he also was not perfect. The interesting question is what made the difference between a
                    great <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-059-2-084"/> commander and those who were not great. There is much to
                    suggest that basic elements of character–<hi rend="i">integrity</hi> of personality in
                    the classic sense–were decisive, especially in those days when military organization was
                    not institutionalized and the <hi rend="i">person</hi> of the leader was so meaningful. It is in
                    this respect that writers may appropriately consider McClellan. He had technical skills and
                    understandings, to be sure, but he was also the man who, when defeated, could write to the Secretary
                    of War: "I have seen too many dead and wounded comrades to feel otherwise than that the
                    government has not sustained this army. . . . If I save this army now, I tell you plainly I owe no
                    thanks to you or to any other persons in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. You have done your best to sacrifice this army" (p. 50). Even three weeks
                    later, McClellan would say that this was all "quite true" (p. 50). And when
                    finally removed from command, he could write, "Alas, for my poor country! I know in my
                    inmost heart she never had a truer servant" (p. 93). A final glance at Burnside is
                    worthwhile here. Regarding his own removal, that general wrote, "in view of the glorious
                    results which have since attended the movements of this gallant army [the Army of the Potomac], I am
                    quite willing to believe that my removal was for the best" (p. 125). The pity of it all was
                    that such a man as Burnside lacked the technical skills of McClellan.</p>

            <p>Historians of the American West will find Professor Lewis Atherton's <hi rend="i">The Cattle
                        Kings</hi> a stimulating and rewarding volume. Professor Atherton has applied some of the
                    techniques and assumptions of business history to the cattleman's frontier. In this volume
                    the cattleman and rancher stand in the place of the entrepreneur, the capitalist, and the railroad
                    builder. Since the cattlemen and ranchers were the dominant figures in the cattle kingdom, they
                    contributed more that was enduring and meaningful both to the American West and to American culture.
                    To make these contributions clear, Professor Atherton analyzes the "group
                    characteristics" of the better-known cattlemen and ranchers. Cowboys, to the relief of the
                    reviewer but to the consternation of creators of such monuments as the Cowboy Hall of Fame, are
                    dismissed as "hired hands on horseback who compromised with their environment at relatively
                    low levels" and who "exerted little influence on the course of American
                    history" (p. xi).</p>
            <p>Diverse in origins, the cattlemen lived as they pleased and recognized that others had the same
                    right. Even the wives of ranchers were expected to follow the same precept. Women, if respectable,
                    were honored, and marriage was regarded as a permanent contract whether the spouse came from the
                    Indian reservation or from the husband's social stratum. Formal religion played a less
                    important role on the Great Plains than in the East. Charles Goodnight did not become a <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-059-2-085"/> church member until just before his death. After his wife persuaded him
                    to join a church, a friend asked which church and Goodnight replied: "I don't
                    know, but it's a damned good one" (p. 133).</p>
            <p>Basically, the rancher as a frontiersman sought wealth rather than adventure, protecting his gains by
                    force, if necessary, as in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName> War. Reliance upon one's own resources or those of friends and employees
                    caused the cult of the self-made man and rugged individualism to flourish among the cattlemen and
                    their admirers. Many individuals rose from meager circumstances to affluence as the result of
                    ranching activities. But neither inherited wealth nor even the title of nobility was a bar to
                    success as a cattleman or rancher. With range land available for exploitation, the ranchers in
                    common with other groups of self-made men objected to governmental regulation except where it
                    benefited their industry. Cattlemen, therefore, approved government regulation of railroad rates,
                    meat packing, and stockyards, but deplored enforcement of federal land laws which interfered with
                    ranchers' control of the open range grasslands.</p>
            <p>Those cattlemen prospered who best hedged against the perils of the cattle business. Epidemic
                    diseases among cattle, droughts, and severe winters, such as that of 1886-1887, often destroyed the
                    fortunes of the less resourceful and those who lacked adequate business skill. Cheap land, low labor
                    costs, and the scarcity of capital were prevalent economic conditions through the late
                    1880's. To raise needed capital, ranchers used all forms of business organizations from
                    simple individual ownership to complex corporate structures. Professor Atherton points out that
                    while many gained their wealth from ranching, the cattlemen more often than not acquired their
                    initial investment capital for their foundation herd from activities outside of the cattle business.
                    Once established, the more successful cattleman also invested his funds in banks, mercantile
                    enterprises, and even in land speculation. When the agricultural frontier closed in, many ranchers
                    disposed of their lands to smaller operators and farmers at attractive prices.</p>
            <p>Professor Atherton has surveyed vast amounts of secondary and primary materials to write this
                    readable, analytic synthesis of the cattle kings. His volume was badly needed to clear away the rank
                    growth of antiquarianism and episodic nonsense which typifies so much of the writing about the
                    cattle frontier.</p>

            <p>Edward Bellamy's <hi rend="i">Looking Backward</hi> (1888) still sells enough copies to make
                    it seem an influential book. It taught brotherhood, cooperation, and controlled economics in an
                    outline for utopian society that its adherents called Nationalism. They have preached it for three
                    generations in Bellamy Clubs and Bellamy Societies all over the world. <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-059-2-086"/> This book, an international symposium on the influence of
                    Bellamy's ideas abroad, is dedicated to Professor Bowman's proposition that <hi rend="i">Looking Backward</hi> is "one of the most internationally influential novels
                    ever written by an American" (p. 66).</p>
            <p>That influence is studied here in depth by scholars of international affiliation and repute who cover
                    the spread of Nationalism from every major Western country to such exotic locales as
                            <placeName>
                  <country reg="sa">South Africa</country>, <country reg="io">Indonesia</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>. The book is remarkable for its detail and for the little known facts the authors have
                    uncovered. It proves to anyone's satisfaction that Bellamy's work was widely read
                    and that his ideas found a ready audience among the general public. But the suspicion lingers that
                    it is all overstated and that Bellamy's notions were not practically very influential,
                    however much they intrigued millions of people in a theoretical sense. Professor Bowman claims that
                    Bellamy influenced world socialism, the labor movement, utopianism, and idealistic religion
                    especially between 1890 and 1914. There is, however, a difference between interest and influence.
                    That Bellamy was read widely and favorably does not necessarily mean that he was influential. His
                    species of socialism, if that it be, was mild, and many things attributed to it would have come
                    about had he and fellow utopians never written.</p>
            <p>The book's chief fault is its style and construction. In the welter of detail that floods
                    page after page there is seldom any clear judgment on Bellamy's importance in a given
                    country. The book is repetitious and laden with trivia. It amounts too often to a tedious
                    condensation of what other people said about Bellamy and his work. Whole pages are given over to
                    tangles of book titles, dates, names, and organization initials, complicated by an irritating
                    proliferation of languages ranging from Norwegian to Polish to Boer.</p>
            <p>Professor Bowman is dedicated to reviving Bellamy's reputation, and in presenting this mass
                    of information she has done a service for all of like mind. If she carries out her projected
                    multi-volume study, of which this is a part, it should be the last factual word on the subject. Each
                    reader will have to judge if it was worth the effort.</p>

                        1877-93.</hi> By Stanley P. Hirshson. (<placeName>

            <p>Though they differed in their approach to the problem, presidents Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, and
                    Harrison strove to guarantee the Southern Negro's right to vote. When this advocacy
                    coincided with Republican desires to crack the "Solid South," party spokesmen
                    often baited rebels by harping upon both real and alleged crime and treason of Southern whites. This
                    tactic became known as "waving the bloody shirt." Not every Northern Republican
                    rallied under this banner, for many leaders, motivated by a genuine concern for the Negro's
                    plight, refused to resurrect war issues. A majority faction, however, with vision obscured by
                    "the almighty dollar" and with greater concern "for their pockets than
                    for principle" (p. 2231, readily waved and then buried both the <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-059-2-087"/> bloody shirt and the Negro. In return they realized the profits offered
                    by the industrial revolution.</p>
            <p>Hirshson's study deals primarily with these statesmen of business, the offspring of the
                    marriage between the Protective Tariff and the Bloody Shirt. A growing concern for capital gains
                    overshadowed the issue of the Negro vote. From 1863 to 1893 the Republican attitude shifted from
                    support of emancipation to a listless disregard of the Negro. In an excellent introduction David
                    Donald observes that by 1893 the new Republican policy "was shaped less by humanitarian
                    concern than by selfish political considerations" (p. 10).</p>
            <p>Particularly stimulating is Hirshson's treatment of "Manufacturers, Mugwumps and
                    Merchants" (pp. 123-142) who gladly exchanged honor and humanity for Southern commerce.
                    When the bloody shirt was "hurting trade" (p. 140), interest in Negro
                    enfranchisement declined and Southern whites were offered the flag of "White
                    Protectionism." In thus choosing property over human rights, a group of clannish, arrogant,
                    and selfish Republicans forgot the Negro. Other rock-ribbed Republicans, however, refused to abandon
                    the Negro in the battle for the ballot. They agreed that Northern "opinions are not for
                    sale. Their goods, not their principles, are in the market" (p. 220). In the ensuing clash
                    between business and humanitarian objectives, the fight remained more within the party than without.
                    Sectionalism, for the most part, faded from the picture.</p>
            <p>The failure of Hayes, Garfield, and Arthur to sustain Negro rights had in 1888 convinced the
                    Republican National Committee that the race issue must be ignored completely. They
                    "controlled the campaign" (p. 162), and it is implied that the managers muzzled
                    Harrison, "once a firebrand on the race issue" (pp. 164-167). This conclusion
                    seems to go beyond the available evidence. Unquestionably Harrison made protection to industry the
                    chief campaign issue; yet he used August, September, and October to plead for equal rights, social
                    justice, and a vote for every citizen. Though Hirshson fairly cites Harrison's speech of
                    October 6, 1888, omitted is the candidate's cogent cry: "let no man say that it is
                    none of our business how elections are conducted in other states."</p>
            <p>This point seems crucial in evaluating Harrison's failure to secure passage of a Federal
                    Elections (Force) bill in 1891, when he headed a hard core of old-line Republicans who were
                    sincerely concerned about the Negro's political and civil nakedness. As Leland
                    Sage– in agreement with Vincent de Santis' conclusions (<hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi>, LI, 284-285)–notes on page 245 of his biography of William
                    Boyd Allison, "The bill was part of Harrison's effort to build a Republican party
                    in the South by safeguarding the Negro vote rather than by trying to build a white man's
                    party there." Harrison, indeed, could scarcely be called a convert to the Force bill.
                    Neither were senators Hoar, Spooner, and Chandler, who supported Harrison and "attacked the
                    business men" who abandoned the Negro for private gain (p. 222).</p>
            <p>In brief, this volume, carefully researched and shrewdly organized, makes a good companion study to
                    De Santis' <hi rend="i">Republicans Face the Southern Question</hi> (1959). It is a
                    splendid contribution to the sociology <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-059-2-088"/> of a political party and
                    clearly reveals the strong economic base in late nineteenth-century Republicanism, If little
                    allowance is made for the humanism of leaders deeply interested in Negro rights, an explanation may
                    be found in the author's candid admission that "both the bloody shirt and
                    pro-business groups defy analysis" (p. 222).</p>

            <p>The publication of this excellent monograph in the <hi rend="i">Illinois Studies in the Social
                        Sciences</hi> adds another distinguished title to a distinguished series. In its original form
                    this was a doctoral dissertation prepared by Scott under the direction of the late Fred A. Shannon.
                    Scott does honor to his celebrated mentor, for his work is a triumph of the meticulous scholarship,
                    the rigorous documentation, the tightly organized narrative, the penetrating analysis, and the
                    smooth, lucid, unpretentious writing that marked Shannon's own style and which he demanded
                    of his apprentices.</p>
            <p>The book has a wider relevance than its title implies, for it offers a case study–the
                    Illinois phase–of a larger movement that embraced the whole American rural community in
                    an era of painful and bewildering transition. The transformation of agriculture by technological
                    revolution, the momentous changes in agriculture's relationships and position in the
                    national economy, and the fateful transmutation that divided the older rural America from the newer
                    urban-industrial America had, of course, a shattering impact upon old familiar ways.</p>
            <p>The farmer fought back but was forced in time to come to terms with the twentieth century. That his
                    program was an improvised, pluralistic, and sometimes internally inconsistent one and that
                    disagreements over immediate (and even long-term) goals and tactics handicapped the crusade is
                    hardly surprising. We have now had an additional three-quarters of a century to find solutions to
                    problems that bedeviled the farmer of 1890, and we are not yet conspicuously successful.</p>
            <p>Scott begins his account with a careful chapter on "The Nature of Discontent in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>," followed by chapters on "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> George and the National Famers' Alliance" and "The Agrarian
                    Base of the Illinois Alliance Movement." An inquiry into the "Objectives and
                    Methods of the Alliance Movement" is succeeded by an account of the agonizing over
                    "The Question of Independent Political Action." The next section of the study
                    describes the "Farmers in the State Legislature and the Disaster of 1890."</p>
            <p>The "disaster" was the stubborn effort of the Farmers' Mutual Benefit
                    Association to bypass the caucus choices of both major parties for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senatorship and to persuade one or the other of the parties to nominate the
                    FMBA's choice, A#2 J. Streeter. The <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-059-2-089"/> Democrats,
                    however, were firmly committed to the nomination of John A. Palmer. The Republicans, willing to
                    protect their own prospects and to use the farmers for their own ends, swallowed their pride and
                    swung their support to Streeter. But the maneuver failed to put him in the Senate: divisions within
                    the farmers' groups sluiced off some of the farm support to Palmer; divisions in the
                    Republicans' own ranks prevented them from throwing their full weight to Streeter. This
                    resulted in the election of Palmer.</p>
            <p>Scott correctly concludes that the enduring lesson of this episode was a recognition that the
                    two-party system is one of the most stubborn realities of American politics. Farm organizations were
                    better advised not to participate in politics directly "but to limit their political role
                    to education so that members, while exercising their right of suffrage as individuals, could vote
                    intelligently" (p. 117).</p>
            <p>A final chapter recounts the "Decline and Disappearance of the Agrarian Movement"
                    and the eventual adoption of the labor movement's strategy of rewarding friends and
                    defeating enemies. Scott points out that this policy closely paralleled the lines laid down for many
                    years by <placeName>

            <p>To mark the one hundred twenty-fifth anniversary of the <hi rend="i">Du Buque Visitor</hi>, the State
                    Historical Society of Iowa has published an oversize volume with photographic reproductions of 118
                    pages of Iowa newspapers through the years, chosen to illustrate the newspapers themselves and the
                    state, national, and world history they report. Most of the <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-059-2-090"/>
                    papers are from the society's own collection. Pages are about 80 per cent of full size. The
                    selection is judicious.</p>
            <p>On seven similarly huge pages preceding the reproductions is a less satisfactory
                    "survey" of Iowa journalism. Nearly five-sevenths of the space is given to the
                    period before 1860. Information since that date consists of a few paragraphs each on Mahin; Perkins;
                    the Clark-sons; Cowles and his great editor, Harvey Ingham; and a tabulation of presidents of the
                    Iowa Press Association and of persons the association has named "master
                    editors-publishers." No attempt has been made to put Iowa journalism, either early or late,
                    into context, to indicate how it was similar to or different from journalism in other territories or
                    states. The present importance of the Cowleses' <hi rend="i">Register</hi> and <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> is shown by statistics more than a decade out of date when published.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the history of Iowa journalism, like that of the journalism of Indiana and most other
                    states, still cries out to be written.</p>

            <p>The Teapot Dome scandal holds popular recognition as a symbol of corruption in national politics.
                    This definitive study suggests that it must also be regarded as a major influence in the practical
                    politics of the 1924 presidential election. The initial advantage it seemed to give the Democrats in
                    that election was overcome by adroit Coolidge leadership, and the Republican party retained
                    political control.</p>
            <p>Professor Noggle's careful research also demonstrates the manner in which national issues
                    are developed to capture public attention, their objectives changed and distorted as more
                    politically productive controversies emerge. Such seems to have been the history of the Teapot Dome
                    case.</p>
            <p>Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall as he entered office was watched closely because of his alleged
                    anti-conservation attitudes, and the conservationists were aroused because his department sought to
                    control national oil resources. When forest preserves became his objective, they declared war. The
                    succeeding battles naturally centered about oil, for the magnitude of those manipulations focused
                    national attention on that situation. Although Fall and his associates held their defenses, the
                    attackers increasingly hit their mark. Many charges were unproved, but they did awaken Senator
                    Robert LaFollette whose interest shifted the conservationists' crusade into the hands of
                    politically minded legislative investigators, intent on exposing corruption in government.</p>
            <p>Guided by Senator Thomas Walsh, the investigating committee heard many charges of corruption. In
                    particular, oil men Harry Sinclair and Edward L. Doheny were implicated in illegally obtaining oil
                    land leases from Fall. Fall's resignation from the cabinet at this time, Professor Noggle
                    contends, was probably related to personal political considerations rather than to the probe; but
                    his action increased public suspicion.</p>
            <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-059-2-091"/>
            <p>Harding's death gave Coolidge the task of holding together the Republican party, damaged by
                    the disclosures of dishonesty. He proved equal to the challenge, and astutely appointed a special
                    counsel to protect "the people and the government." The revelation that William
                    McAdoo had served as legal counsel for Doheny further detracted from Democratic attempts to gain a
                    political advantage. The Coolidge calm gradually predominated, for the Walsh committee was unable to
                    prove a case.</p>
            <p>The unfavorable publicity tarnished McAdoo's reputation and probably deprived him of the
                    1924 Democratic presidential nomination, while the successful, colorless nominee, Davis, labeled the
                    party for defeat. Throughout, Coolidge remained untouched and even strengthened his position: he
                    quietly removed from his cabinet the scandal-tinged Denby and Daugherty; he disassociated himself
                    from Fall's policies; and he appointed a Federal Oil Conservation Board, which pleased the
                    business community.</p>
            <p>Although the Walsh committee charged Fall with corruption, the evidence was inconclusive as were the
                    succeeding court cases. Courts returned the oil reserves to the government but Fall, Doheny, and
                    Sinclair were each acquitted. Then, in 1929, Fall was convicted of bribery–both Doheny
                    and Sinclair remained free. These final events exemplify the mass of contradictions which
                    characterized the whole Teapot Dome affair. Noggle's skillful analysis of the case gives
                    strong evidence that out of this confusion emerged a course which influenced some of the major
                    political decisions of both the Republican and Democratic parties.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Image; or, What Happened to the American Dream.</hi> By Donald J. Boorstin. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>: Atheneum, 1962. Pp. ix, 315. Bibliographical essay, index. $5.00.)</head>
            <p>A brilliant and unconventional book, <hi rend="i">The Image</hi> has already disturbed conventional
                    historians. Yet in the flood of writings on shopworn topics of American history, <hi rend="i">The
                        Image</hi> stands out as a shining beacon for its originality, acumen, and boldness. Boorstin
                    has been daring enough to write about the matters central to the interests of the American people as
                    distinct from matters–like civil-service reform, federal land policy, or church
                    history–central to the interests of historians. <hi rend="i">The Image</hi> addresses
                    itself to the mechanisms of publicity, the cults of celebrity-worship, the phenomena of
                    holiday-making–to the machinery daily grinding out sensations and titillation for
                    mid-twentieth-century Americans. He writes about newspaper headlines, movie stars, television
                    programs, advertising copy, automobile designs. Astonishingly, he deals with contemporary American
                    life as the great mass of Americans knows it; his thesis is that they do not comprehend the forces
                    at work to make this life increasingly illusory. "The image" is the public <hi rend="i">persona</hi> of celebrite, corporation, product, politician, news event, all shrewdly
                    manipulated to make the most favorable or sensational impression on a nation of passive consumers.</p>
            <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-059-2-092"/>
            <p>In elaborating this thesis, Boorstin uses examples of image-making familiar to every American, and
                    confirmed afresh each day, but he gives them historical depth with documentation on the origins of
                    the "Graphic Revolution." This audio-visual upheaval, occuring in the late
                    nineteenth century, introduced techniques for mass reproduction of words, pictures, color, and
                    sound. With its contribution to historical method, <hi rend="i">The Image</hi> thus stands in
                    contrast to a journalistic writing like Vance Packard's <hi rend="i">The Hidden
                    Persuaders</hi>, which discusses the application of depth psychology to advertising campaigns in the
                    purely contemporary scene. Boorstin has done a good deal of research, and suggests further
                    explorations by others, on the history of such matters as public opinion polling, trademarks, book
                    abridgment, movies and television, and similar subjects ordinarily considered beneath the dignity of
                    historians. His ample bibliographical essay points the way for wonderfully fresh doctoral
                    dissertations.</p>
            <p>An engaging quality of <hi rend="i">The Image</hi>, which at once invites comparison with Thorstein
                    Veblen's <hi rend="i">The Theory of the Leisure Class</hi>, is its delicious coinage of
                    marvelously appropriate new terms. Unlike the poker-faced ponderosity of Veblen's
                    vocabulary, miming the new jargon of the social sciences, Boorstin's phrase-making echoes
                    the crispness of the mass media. "Pseudo-event" is his master phrase and major
                    concept. The pseudo-event is the planned and staged, pre-released and carefully timed news
                    story–as an interview with a politician, or the escapade of a movie queen. The blurring
                    of the actual event through this kind of manipulation is heightened by other media; television
                    brings a scene closer to us than to those actually present, but we may be seeing a video-tape of
                    yesterday's event. The popular art forms coalesce, until none stands alone; the novel is
                    read in a magazine digest, performed as a play, a musical comedy, a film, a television show, and is
                    written with these ends in mind, even to being purchased by Hollywood before publication.
                    Advertising creates desires we never knew existed and contrives distinctive images for identical
                    products. The tourism of today, replacing the genuine travel experiences of yesterday, offers
                    packaged trips along superhighways or via superplanes to superhotels, where the American finds his
                    home comforts completely reproduced and he himself completely insulated from contacts with any alien
                    or hostile environment.</p>
            <p>In place of the gods of antiquity and the heroes of the Middle Ages, we venerate celebrities, whose
                    only claim to fame is that they are well-known. And why? "They are well-known for their
                    well-knownness." The public relations expert, the press photographer, and the syndicated
                    coloumnist have created the image of Liz Taylor. But the celebrity of today, manufactured overnight,
                    has achieved nothing memorable; he is as commonplace as his admirers, while the hero of yesteryear
                    slowly acquired his honor as word of his deeds percolated through the population. As the celebrity
                    has displaced the hero, so too the image has displaced the ideal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Image</hi> is not intended as a diagnosis of a national malady, although some
                    reviewers have read it that way. It is a sober though <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-059-2-093"/> often
                    hilarious historical analysis of forces shaping contemporary American civilization. It is the
                    cleverest and shrewdest commentary I know on American life in the twentieth century.</p>

            <p>The multiplicity of manuscript repositories in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the wide dispersal of collections among them has made it difficult in the past to
                    ascertain what letters and papers of a given man or on a subject were available and where they were
                    to be found. The need for an aid to location has long been felt, but the magnitude of such an
                    undertaking has postoned its realization.</p>
            <p>The project which has resulted in the publication of the present volume has centered in the Library
                    of Congress. Active planning began in 1951, but it could only be put in motion in 1958 when a grant
                    from the Council on Library Resources, Inc., provided for the primary costs of the work.</p>
            <p>To draw up policies upon which to proceed an advisory committee of scholars representing learned
                    societies and other groups interested in the preservation and control of manuscripts was appointed.</p>
            <p>In order to keep the project within manageable bounds it was decided that the listing would be one of
                    collections rather than of individual manuscripts. For this purpose a collection was defined as
                    "A large group of papers (manuscript or typescript, originals, or copies, of letters,
                    memoranda, diaries, accounts, log books, drafts, etc., including associated printed or near-print
                    materials), usually having a common source and formed by or around an individual, a family, a
                    corporate entity, or devoted to a single theme" (p. v).</p>
            <p>There were no limitations on time, place of origin, or nature of collections, but certain types of
                    materials were excluded. Among these were ostraca, clay tablets, and papyri, which were considered
                    to be of interest to only a limited number of scholars who had adequate means of locating them in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and collections of photocopies or transcripts of material if the originals were in
                    public repositories in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Collections of copies were to be listed if the originals were in foreign repositories
                    or if they were in private collections in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to which research workers were not regularly admitted. Archives were to be excluded if
                    located where one would expect to find them, for example county records in a county courthouse.</p>
            <p>An attempt was made to include the holdings of all public and quasi-public repositories, such as
                    libraries, historical societies, and archives which regularly admit research workers. Information
                    for the catalog was gathered from data sheets prepared by the repositories or from existing records.
                    These were then edited at the Library of Congress and printed on regulation size catalog cards which
                    were made available for purchase.</p>
            <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-059-2-094"/>
            <p>For each collection listed, the information given includes the name and location of the collection;
                    an indication of its size; a brief description of its contents and, when available, references to
                    published and unpublished descriptions; and notes on restrictions to access, literary rights, and
                    provenance.</p>
            <p>In 1959 the first cards were printed. The present volume contains the 3,688 entries issued in the
                    years 1959-1961. According to present plans supplements will reproduce the cards appearing in
                    succeeding years. It is estimated that the total number of collections included will run to some
                    20,000.</p>
            <p>The arrangement of the main body of the catalog is by numbers assigned to each entry as it was
                    printed. There are three indexes: a name index of about 30,000 names of persons, families,
                    associations, institutions, business firms, governmental agencies, etc., associated with the
                    collections listed; a subject index to the principal contents of the collections listed which has
                    more than 3,000 entries; and an index to the more than 400 repositories represented in the volume.</p>
            <p>As a step in bringing the large manuscript resources of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> under bibliographical control this work is of considerable importance. Not only does it
                    give the scholar a means of ascertaining what collections in his field exist in a large number of
                    repositories in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, but it should also prove valuable in establishing much needed standards for cataloging
                    and describing manuscript holdings, which should result in increasing their usability.</p>

            <p>This volume is primarily concerned with a description of records of the Federal government during the
                    decade of the 1860's, but in some instances it appropriately extends its coverage to the
                    resolution of problems which existed during the war or were born of the war. The value of the <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> is increased by noting the location of records not in Federal custody and by
                    excellent short statements of the functions and purposes of the various offices and agencies. The
                    inclusion of the most significant edited works, monographs, and articles, as well as the membership
                    of special committees and heads of offices and agencies, adds to its usefulness as a reference tool.
                    If the companion work (now in preparation) on the archives of the Confederate States is of the same
                    high quality as this one, a long-felt need for a descriptive guide to the extant records of the two
                    governments will have been met.</p>
            <p>The records of Congress, the Judiciary, and the Presidency are first described. The executive
                    departments and their subordinate components are then taken up in turn, and a final chapter is
                    devoted to miscellaneous agencies. The coverage is complete: from the presidential proclamations to
                    the records of the <placeName>

            <p>Historians and Civil War "buffs" will welcome this book, and both groups may be
                    somewhat surprised to find that only about five pages are devoted to the official records of the
                    contending armies and navies!</p>

                    This substantial volume completes the publication of the official papers of the Territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>. It covers the tenure of three territorial governors: Robert R. Reid, 1839-1841;
                    Richard K. Call, 1841-1844; and John Branch, 1844-1845. With volumes XXII-XXV it provides scholars
                    with a wealth of readily available and valuable information concerning Florida in its territorial
                    era from 1821 to 1846. The format is the same as for the preceding volumes and the editing maintains
                    the customary high standard for the series.</p>

                    </placeName>, 1962. Pp. vii, 119. Notes, bibliographical note, index. $3.50.) This book
                    is an outgrowth of a doctoral thesis at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. It traces the evolution of medical ethics from the first code developed by the
                    American Medical Association in 1847 to the adoption in 1912 of the second revision of the original
                    code. Konold's study is based largely on the professional writings of physicians,
                    proceedings of medical organizations, and medical journals. Attention is given to continuing efforts
                    to evolve a code of medical ethics to regulate and control undesirable practices within the
                    profession as well as for the regulation and control of relations between medical personnel and the
                    public.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $9.00.) The first edition of Randall's <hi rend="i">The
                        Civil War and Reconstruction</hi> has had wide and favorable use as a text and basic reference.
                    In this revision by Donald much of the original content has been preserved but portions have been
                    modified or expanded and parts have been <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-059-2-096"/> thoroughly revised.
                    According to Donald, the revision is less pro-Southern than the original edition (Randall was a
                    Northerner; Donald is from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>!) and most of the material suggesting the re-pressibility of the Civil War has been
                    eliminated. The bibliography has been lengthened and made current. This second edition has even more
                    merit than the original one, but careful students of the Civil War era will doubtless find it
                    stimulating to note the differences in content and viewpoint between the two editions.</p>

                    one-party system of various southern states leaves voters without any real choice concerning
                    nominees and issues. Professor Puryear contends that at least in the elections during the period

                    (East Lansing: Michigan State University, 1962. Pp. 133-160. Notes. $0.75.) Born in 1765,
                    James Leander Cathcart, at the age of three, migrated with his family from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>

                    </placeName>. From the late 1770's until the early 1820's he had an unusual career
                    which included fighting for the colonial cause during the American Revolution, spending a decade as
                    a prisoner of Algerian pirates, and serving in various diplomatic and consular posts of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. In the early 1830's his son, Charles Cathcart, settled near La Pork, Indiana,
                    where he was soon joined by brothers Henry, James, and John. The Cathcarts in Indiana were
                    successful farmers on the Door <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>

                    house of the state legislature and in both houses of Congress. This publication includes much
                    information about the family and its economic status and political role from the American Revolution

                    offers in this brief volume his views concerning such important topics as education, citizenship,
                    patriotism, and private and public morality. He is frankly concerned about some existing trends in
                    private as well as public morality and about political and constitutional developments of recent
                    decades. This reviewer regrets that Mr. Lesh does not tell more of his recollections of discussions
                    with Lambdin P. Milligan and especially of his evaluation of what Milligan told him. Mr. Lesh is
                    certainly correct in regarding the <hi rend="i">Ex parte Milligan</hi> case of 1866 as one of the
