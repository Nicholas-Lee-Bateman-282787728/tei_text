                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> book, like those that have gone before it in this series,
                    is intended for popular use, and especially is it meant to attract young people
                    to the early history of our own country. We have not sought, therefore, to
                    confine our story to a personal biography of Pocahontas, for which the materials
                    are not very abundant. The adventures of Smith in the Turkish wars, as related
                    by himself, and the explorations, trials, and battles of the early settlers at
                    Jamestown, serve to make a romantic passage in history. The story has not often
                    been told so fully before, and we sincerely hope that the book will prove of
                    interest even to those already acquainted with its general features, and that it
                    will stimulate many young readers to go farther in the study of the history of
                    their own country.</p>
                <p>While we have sought to be interesting we have tried sincerely to be correct; at
                    most, whatever romancing there is in the story is the fault <pb id="VAA2409-007"
                        n="x"/> of the early writers. It is not easy to come at the truth about
                    Jamestown. We have usually followed Smith's "General History of Virginia,"
                    consulting also the accounts of Newport, Wing-field, Strachey, and Smith's "True
                    Relation," with Stith's "History of Virginia," and Neill's "Letters of the
                    Virginia Company," besides many other works of less importance as authorities.
                    Where we could preserve the very words of the old chroniclers we have done so,
                    believing that it would add to the interest of the reader to see the quaint but
                    vigorous English in use at that time. We have also reproduced some of the cuts
                    which adorned Smith's General History.</p>
                <p>The most important of the disputed questions we have discussed briefly in the
                    Appendix.</p>

                    <p>G<hi rend="sc">OLD</hi> and a route to the East Indies were the dominant
                        ideas in the minds of the early discoverers and explorers of the American
                        continent. Columbus believed to the day of his death that the islands which
                        he had discovered were but the outskirts of eastern Asia. He valued his
                        discovery only as a means of opening a profitable traffic with the East.
                        English commercial ambition long sought an easy route to the East Indies.
                        John Cabot, a Venetian, undertook the first voyage of discovery sent to the
                        New World from England.</p>
                    <p>In 1497, only five years after the first West Indian discovery of Columbus,
                        Cabot reached the shores of America, or the territory of the Grand Cham in
                        Asia, as he supposed, and returned home, the first discoverer of the
                        American continent. In the following year, while the aged Columbus sailed to
                        the mainland of South America, and the daring young Vasco da Gama of <pb
                            id="VAA2409-009" n="12"/> Portugal rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and
                        sailed with streamers flying and trumpets sounding into the harbor of
                        Calcutta, the Venetian discoverer's son, Sebastian Cabot, a young man barely
                        twenty-one years old, explored the coast of North America from Newfoundland
                        as far south as Chesapeake Bay. Nevertheless he considered his voyage a
                        failure, since he had not discovered the shortest route to Cathay and Japan,
                        which he reasoned would be by way of the far north. For many years after
                        this, while Spain was making rich conquests in Mexico and Central America,
                        England had no connection with the New World except through the fisheries of
                        Newfoundland, which were frequented by her vessels.</p>
                    <p>In the sixteenth century the world's work seem to the men of that day almost
                        accomplished. An English navigator, named Martin Frobisher, deemed the
                        discovery of a north-western passage to Asia "the only thing in the world
                        that was yet left undone by which a notable mind might be made famous and
                        fortunate." The making of this discovery was the desire of Frobisher's
                        heart. For fifteen years he solicited help for his project in vain. He was
                        at last aided by Dudley, Earl of Warwick, and in 1576, with a fleet of two
                        small barks and a pinnace, he prepared to cross <pb id="VAA2409-010" n="13"
                        /> the ocean. Queen Elizabeth sent a message of approbation to Frobisher,
                        and waved her hand as the little fleet dropped down the Thames. The pinnace
                        of but ten tons burden was soon lost in a storm, and the frightened sailors
                        in one of the other vessels turned homeward, leaving Frobisher to pursue his
                        course alone. In his small bark he discovered Labrador, and reached an inlet
                        north of Hudson's Bay. He imagined the land on the north to be Asia, that on
                        the south to be America, and that the strait which he had discovered led
                        into the Pacific. Frobisher landed on an arctic island, which he took
                        possession of in the name of Elizabeth, and gathered some stones, with which
                        he returned home. One of these stones was pronounced by the clumsy London
                        refiners of that day to contain gold. Immediately there were men who desired
                        to purchase these northern gold lands from Queen Elizabeth. But Frobisher
                        was provided with a fleet for the purpose of securing the treasure.
                        Volunteers were plenty for this expedition. The queen, who had vouchsafed
                        only royal favor to the voyage of discovery, sent a large ship of her own on
                        the voyage for gold. With "a merrie wind" they sailed from England, but they
                        encountered much danger from icebergs before the shores of America were
                        reached. <pb id="VAA2409-011" n="14"/> This great fleet did not penetrate so
                        far as Frobisher had in his little bark. They contented themselves with an
                        island where there were heaps of earth, which to their eyes plainly
                        contained gold. More than this, the island abounded in spiders, and "spiders
                        were true signs of a great <unclear>--ore</unclear> of gold." Admiral and
                        men toiled like <unclear>--aves</unclear> to lade the vessels with common
                        earth. <unclear>--at</unclear> the faith of gold-dreamers was unshaken. A
                        colony must be planted in this land of frost in order to secure so rich a
                        country to England. Gentlemen's sons volunteered, Elizabeth bore part of the
                        expense, and in 1578 fifteen vessels set sailthree to remain with the
                        settlement and twelve to hasten back with the coveted ore. The fleet became
                        entangled among great icebergs melting in the summer's sun and adorned with
                        waterfalls. One vessel was crushed, though the men were saved. Bewildered
                        among mists and icebergs, Frobisher lost his course and entered Hudson's
                        strait south of the land of gold. Here the Admiral believed he could sail
                        through to the Pacific. But he pushed on in a search of the golden island,
                        "getting in at one gap and out at another," among many dangers from hidden
                        rocks on an unknown coast. When he reached the Countess of Warwick's Sound
                        the enthusiastic colonists <pb id="VAA2409-012" n="15"/> were discouraged,
                        and the sailors were ready to mutiny. One vessel containing much of the
                        provision of the expedition deserted and returned home. The disheartened
                        gold-seekers discovered an island, however, containing enough of the
                        supposed gold ore "to suffice all the gold-gluttons of the world," but no
                        one proposed to colonize it for the benefit of England. The vessels were
                        freighted and returned home. Neither the projectors of the expedition nor
                        the adventurers who embarked upon it tell us how the lading was disposed of.
                        Thus ended the first attempt of the English to colonize America.</p>
                    <p>In 1578 Sir Humphrey Gilbert procured from the queen a charter, which made
                        him proprietary lord of whatever land he might discover and colonize within
                        six years. In 1579 he set sail, accompanied by his half brother, Walter
                        Raleigh. The loss of a vessel and various misfortunes defeated this venture.
                        Sir Humphrey Gilbert's fortune became too much reduced for him to undertake
                        another expedition. He made various grants of land, but none of them
                        resulted in a successful colony.</p>
                    <p>In 1583, before the patent had expired, Gilbert, assisted by Raleigh, fitted
                        another fleet for settlement in America. On the eve of his departure <pb
                            id="VAA2409-013" n="16"/> Sir Humphrey Gilbert received from the queen a
                        token in the form of "a golden anchor guided by a lady"whatever that may
                        mean. Two days after leaving Plymouth, the largest ship of the fleet, which
                        had been furnished by Raleigh, deserted under the excuse of infectious
                        disease. The commander conducted his remaining vessels to the banks of
                        Newfoundland. He took formal possession of the country, summoning the
                        Spanish and Portuguese fishermen to witness the ceremony. The "mineral-man"
                        of the fleet pronounced a certain ore to contain silver. Some of this was
                        carried on board with great secrecy, in order that the Spanish and
                        Portuguese might not suspect its value. A further voyage of discovery along
                        the coast was undertaken, but Gilbert's men were unmanageable. Through the
                        carelessness of the sailors the largest vessel struck, and nearly one
                        hundred persons, were lost, with the "mineral-man" and the ore. It now
                        seemed necessary to return home. Sir Humphrey Gilbert insisted on remaining
                        in the Squirrel, the little bark in which he had sailed, on account of its
                        convenience for exploring the coast. He said he would not desert the little
                        crew with which he had encountered so many dangers. The voyage was rough. "A
                        more outrageous sea" had not been seen by <pb id="VAA2409-014" n="17"/> the
                        oldest sailors. Sir Humphrey was seen from the larger vessel sitting on deck
                        with a book in his hand, and when she would approach within hearing he would
                        call out, "Be of good cheer, my friends; it is as near to heaven by sea as
                        by land." The little vessel labored painfully in the storm, and about
                        midnight her lights suddenly disappeared, never to be seen again.</p>
                    <p>Raleigh was ambitious to be lord over lands in the New World. He now planned
                        a settlement in a pleasanter climate than that of Newfoundland. From the
                        queen he obtained as ample a patent as that of his half-brother. Two vessels
                        were freighted with men and provisions. Under the command of Philip Amidas
                        and Arthur Barlow they followed the circuitous route of the dayby way of the
                        Canaries and West Indies. When they neared the coast of North Carolina it
                        was in all its midsummer beauty. The odor which reached them was "as if they
                        had been in the midst of some delicate garden." The smooth sea, dotted with
                        islands, sparkled in the sun; the land was covered with noble trees
                        festooned with vines. This land seemed a paradise to the colonists, who knew
                        nothing of the terrors of the coast at a more unfavorable season. A
                        settlement was made on the island of Wocokon, and the <pb id="VAA2409-015"
                            n="18"/> time was occupied with excursions of discovery. The result of
                        their observations of the savages were that "the people were most gentle,
                        loving, and faithful, void of all guile and treason, and such as lived after
                        the manner of the golden age;" and yet, strange to say, in their wars they
                        were cruel and bloody, entire tribes being sometimes almost exterminated,
                        and they practised inviting men to a feast and then murdering themas the
                        English knew, for the Indians had offered them much booty to participate in
                        such a stratagem against their enemies. After a short stay in the pleasant
                        summer months, the expedition returned to England, with glowing accounts of
                        the country. Queen Elizabeth named the new land Virginia, in honor of
                        herself, "the Virgin Queen." A fleet of seven vessels with one hundred and
                        eight colonists was next sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1585, under the
                        command of Sir Richard Grenville. The perils of the North Carolina coast
                        were found to be very great. A settlement was made at Roanoke Island. Almost
                        one of the first acts of the colonists was to destroy an Indian town and
                        standing corn in retaliation for the theft of a silver cup.</p>
                    <p>Sir Richard Grenville sailed away and the colonists began to explore the
                        country. Lane, the <pb id="VAA2409-016" n="19"/> governor, wrote: "It is the
                        goodliest soil under the cope of heaven; the most pleasing territory of the
                        world; the continent is of a huge and unknown greatness, and very well
                        peopled, though savagely."</p>
                    <p>The wily Indians soon discovered the white man's twofold passion for gold and
                        a passage to the "South Sea." One of them told the colonists that Roanoke
                        River sprang from a rock so near the Pacific that the waves sometimes dashed
                        into its fountain; that the people who lived there understood refining gold,
                        of which there was an abundance in the country, and that the walls of their
                        city were made of pearls. This fable coincided with the preconceived notions
                        of Europeans in regard to America. Lane and a band of followers undertook
                        the ascent of the Roanoke in search of its wonderful fountain. Meanwhile the
                        Indians, who were jealous of white settlements, prepared to attack the
                        divided colony. The goldseekers toiled up the rapid current of the Roanoke.
                        Their provisions were soon exhausted. Still they persevered, killing and
                        eating their dogs. When this resource failed them they returned home, just
                        in time to frustrate the plans of the Indians. The savages now proposed to
                        plant no corn in order to starve out the English, who <pb id="VAA2409-017"
                            n="20"/> depended upon trade with them for their provisions. An old
                        chief, however, objected to this plan.</p>
                    <p>The English had been in the New World nearly a year. They grew more and more
                        fearful of the Indians. They believed that they were forming an alliance
                        with intent to massacre them. They desired an audience of the most
                        influential chief, Wingina, and when admitted to his presence they fell upon
                        him and his principal warriors and killed them. The colonists were growing
                        restless and homesick, and they had now indeed good reason to fear the
                        Indians. In hopes of a better harbor they explored toward the north and
                        reached Chesapeake Bay, long after it had been discovered by the Spanish and
                        named Santa Maria Bay. One day many sails were seen on the horizon. It was
                        Sir Francis Drake's great fleet of twenty-three vessels returning from a
                        long privateering and exploring cruise. It came to anchor in "the wild road
                        of their bad harbor." Sir Francis Drake readily supplied all the wants of
                        the colonists, giving them vessels, persuading two experienced seamen to
                        remain with them, and furnishing every means for them to make further
                        explorations. A sudden storm nearly wrecked the fleet, which was only saved
                            <pb id="VAA2409-018" n="21"/> by standing off from the dangerous coast.
                        After the storm, nothing was to be seen of the vessels set aside for the
                        colonists' use. Sir Francis Drake again offered, however, to supply their
                        wants, but with one voice they begged to be taken back to England.</p>
                    <p>Through these colonists, who had learned to smoke in the New World, the use
                        of tobacco was first introduced into England. Sir Walter Raleigh made the
                        practice fashionable. It is related that a servant of his coming into the
                        room with a tankard of ale saw Sir Walter intent on study, with clouds of
                        smoke issuing from his mouth. The man immediately threw the ale in his
                        master's face and ran downstairs, crying that Sir Walter was on fire.</p>
                    <p>A few days after the colonists left Roanoke Island vessels with provisions
                        landed at the settlement to find it deserted. Grenville left fifteen men to
                        hold the land for its lord.</p>
                    <p>Sir Walter Raleigh now planned to plant an agricultural colony of men with
                        families, to be established at Chesapeake Bay. In 1587 he fitted out a fleet
                        at his own expense, "Queen Elizabeth, the godmother of Virginia," refusing
                        to contribute "to its education." As might have been expected, nothing
                        remained of the little colony at <pb id="VAA2409-019" n="22"/> Roanoke
                        Island but bones. The settlement was overgrown with weeds. The commander of
                        the vessels refusing to carry them further, the colony was obliged to plant
                        itself on this sad spot. There was naturally trouble with the Indians. The
                        tribe of Manteo, the chief who had visited England, were friendly, and this
                        Indian, according to the commands of Raleigh, was baptized and made a baron,
                        with the title of Lord of Roanoke. It may be doubted whether he fully
                        appreciated the honor. The colony was ill-fated; a vessel was sent to
                        England to ask for provisions. Raleigh freighted two ships for his colony,
                        but in chasing after prizes, one vessel was boarded and rifled after a
                        bloody battle, and both were forced to return.</p>
                    <p>England was in a state of intense excitement over the threatened invasion of
                        Spain, and Raleigh, Grenville, Lane, and all those who had been most
                        interested in colonization, were now entirely occupied with the prospect of
                        war. Not until three years after the planting of the colony did the expected
                        supplies arrive at Roanoke, which was then a desert. An inscription directed
                        to the island of Croatan, the home of Manteo and the friendly Indians. No
                        search was made further than the Island of Roanoke by this expedition, <pb
                            id="VAA2409-020" n="23"/> and the fate of the colony is unknown. Raleigh
                        sent many expeditions to search for his lost people, but nothing was
                        discovered of them. There is one statement, though not perhaps to be
                        trusted, that after twenty-one years of life among the savages they were
                        murdered by Powhatan, at the instigation of his priests or medicine-men.<ref

                    </p>
                    <p>In 1602 a direct voyage across the Atlantic was made by Bartholomew Gosnold
                        in a small bark. He discovered Cape Cod and Buzzard's Bay, which he called
                        Gosnold's Hope. On a beautiful island covered with grand forests, wild
                        fruits, and sweet flowers a settlement was planned. On the island is a pond,
                        in which is a little island. On this romantic spot the colonists built their
                        fort, but the road before them appeared too dangerous; fearing starvation
                        and dreading the Indians they resolved to return with Gosnold. They brought
                        back from the New World a load of sassafras root, which was highly valued in
                        the pharmacy of the day.</p>
                    <p>A second expedition was undertaken by Martin Pring in 1603. He explored much
                        of the coast of North Virginia, as New England was then called, and traded
                        trinkets with the Indians for sassafras.</p>
                    <p>Still another voyage under command of George <pb id="VAA2409-021" n="24"/>
                        Weymouth was made to the shores of North Virginia. All the early voyagers
                        agreed in praising the fertility of the soil and the beauty of the scenery
                        in the new land, and it was to the imagination of people in Europe like a
                        land of romance and dreamsa "new world" indeed, as they called it.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> is now nearly three hundred years ago that the first
                        successful colony set out from Black-wall, a suburb of London, to effect a
                        settlement in the "New-found-land of Virginia," as the whole coast of North
                        America was at that time called. The failure of the colony on Roanoke Island
                        had for many years damped the ardor of English adventurers, but the success
                        of the Spaniards, their great rivals and enemies, piqued the pride of the
                        English, as the wealth won by Spanish gold-seekers excited their cupidity.
                        So that at the beginning of the reign of James I. it was resolved to have an
                        English settlement in America, to win territory, and to freight ships with
                        the precious metals. Sir Walter Raleigh, the founder of the unhappy colony
                        on Roanoke Island, and the life-long advocate of colonization, was at this
                        time shut up in a dreary cell in the Tower of London, engaged in writing his
                        History of the World to while away the hours of a long imprisonment. But
                        Gosnold, <pb id="VAA2409-023" n="26"/> whose voyage to the New England coast
                        is related in the previous chapter, had been very active in promoting the
                        present undertaking. In this he had been joined by John Smith, a soldier of
                        fortune who had voyaged about the world, getting out of one daring adventure
                        into another, and who now, having returned from single combats and
                        captivities among the Saracens, could find nothing to satisfy his appetite
                        for danger and hardship so well as a colony in the wilds of America. A third
                        promoter of the scheme was a London merchant named Wingfield, and <unclear/>
                        fourth was a clergyman, Mr. Hunt. The latter desired to plant Christianity,
                        Wingfield no doubt represented the commercial desire for gain, while Gosnold
                        and Smith were voyagers and adventurers pure and simple, loving a hard task
                        for the very hardness of it and the honor of overcoming difficulties.</p>
                    <p>The traveller of our time feels some trepidation when he sails across the
                        ocean in a staunch steamer of several thousand tons burden. But the little
                        colony that left Blackwall and dropped down the Thames in the rough December
                        of 1606 had for their largest ships the Sarah Constant, of one hundred tons,
                        which ship carried seventy persons, and was commanded by Captain. <pb
                            id="VAA2409-024" n="27"/> Newport. The second ship, the God-Speed, was
                        commanded by the experienced Captain Gosnold, and was of forty tons,
                        carrying fifty-two persons, while the smallest vessel of all, the Discovery,
                        was of but twenty tons, a mere sailboat, carrying twenty people on this long
                        voyage, through little known seas, into unknown lands. The seeds of a great
                        nation were here compressed into small space and entrusted to frail craft.</p>
                    <p>The people of England were very much interested in the little company that
                        left Blackwall on the 19th of December, 1606. There was a clergyman, the
                        Rev. Richard Hakluyt, who when he was a schoolboy had been shown one day
                        some books of travel and a map of the world. He then and there resolved to
                        devote himself to geographical studies, and he became in time better
                        informed on all such matters than any man in England in his day. The great
                        trading companies were accustomed to consult him about their undertakings.
                        He, with other "hearty lovers of colonization," had petitioned for
                        permission to send out this colony, and he was one of the corporators of it.</p>
                    <p>James I. was a pedantic man, priding himself on his learning, which was not
                        so great as his <pb id="VAA2409-025" n="28"/> vanity. It is said that when
                        George Buchannan, his preceptor, was censured for having made the king a
                        pedant, he answered that it was the best he could make out of such a prince
                        as he. King James was of a meddling disposition, full of over-weening
                        self-confidence, and he unfortunately took great interest in the little
                        colony now setting forth, and had something to do with the mischievous
                        regulations and directions by which the enterprise was well-nigh brought to
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>There are still extant poems, sermons, and plays, that show the general
                        interest of all classes of people in the colony on its setting out, and
                        during the early years of its history. Michael Drayton, a famous poet of the
                        time, who wrote abundantly about a great many things, gave utterance to the
                        popular feeling in an ode full of fire. He begins:</p>

                    </lg>
                    <p>He does not think that these voyagers in little ships need be afraid of
                        shoals:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">"Your course securely steer,</l>

                        <l n="6">So absolute the deep."</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>The dominant idea of the time was to find gold, and this finds place also in
                        Drayton's verses:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">"And cheerfully at sea</l>

                        <l n="5">Virginia,</l>
                        <l n="6">Earth's only paradise."</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>He seems to have a premonition that the English race will come to greatness
                        in the New World, for he sings of the heroes that shall be brought forth
                        like "those from whom we came," and lastly he describes "industrious
                        Hakluyt" as waiting to record their voyages.</p>
                    <p>But it was especially the finding of gold mines <pb id="VAA2409-027" n="30"/>
                        that most concerned the English public. In a play, written the year before
                        the colony sailed, while all England was agitated about it, there is a
                        conversation between two characters who bore the significant names of
                        Scapethrift and Seagull. The general expectation of gold from Virginia is
                        shown up in the extravagant speech of the enthusiastic Seagull, who declares
                        that all their dripping-pans are pure gold in Virginia, "and all the chaines
                        with which they chaine up their streets are massie gold; all the prisoners
                        they take are fetered in gold; and for rubies and diamonds they goe forth in
                        holy dayes and gather 'hem by the sea-shore, to hang on their children's
                        coates, and sticke in their children's caps, as commonly as our children
                        wear saffron gilt brooches, and groates with holes in 'hem."</p>
                    <p>Not only in the poetry and the plays of the time, but in the sermons and
                        prayers of the people, Virginia is remembered. One prayer of a few years
                        later ends with the petition that God "may vouchsafe to go with us and we
                        with him into Virginia. Amen and Amen. Be thou the Alpha and Omega of
                        England's plantation in Virginia, O God."</p>
                    <p>The colony was to be governed under a charter, drawn up, no doubt, under the
                        eye of the <pb id="VAA2409-028" n="31"/> fussy and foolish King James. It
                        abounded in all guarantees for loyalty, but neglected many very important
                        matters. There were also explicit directions about the manner of settlement
                        and their mode of dealing with the "naturals"that is, the natives of
                        Virginia. These directions were good enough in their way, but the better
                        policy would have been to have given military authority to some one
                        competent man. This the projectors of the colony failed to do. The authority
                        at sea was vested not in Gosnold, as we would have expected, but in Captain
                        Newport, who was an experienced mariner, and who had had the wisdom the year
                        before to make the king a present of two living young alligators and a wild
                        boar, brought from the West Indies. Such trifles delighted James greatly.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning the little colony was beset with difficulties. Scarcely
                        were they out of the Thames when they were met by rough weather, and were
                        long beaten upon by the rough seas of the Channel. It was six weeks before
                        they lost sight of the English coast. But something worse than bad weather
                        overtook them in the jealousy and discord which immediately broke out among
                        the leading spirits of the colony.</p>
                    <p>One would have supposed that while King <pb id="VAA2409-029" n="32"/> James
                        and the rest were busy over charters and directions, they would have been at
                        some pains to see that the colony should be made up of such as were suitable
                        to the work in hand. But of the hundred or more who were first settled in
                        Virginia, fifty-three ranked as "gentlemen," many of whom were dissipated
                        young men sent off by friends who wished to be rid of them. Smith says they
                        were afterward dissatisfied because they did not find "any of their
                        accustomed dainties, with feather beds and downe pillows, tavernes and
                        alehouses in every breathing place, neither such plentie of gold and silver
                        and dissolute libertie as they expected." We do not wonder that "the country
                        was to them a misery, a ruine, a death, a hell."</p>
                    <p>With all these gentlemen there was a small allowance of four carpenters.
                        Twelve men are set down as laborers, but whether they were farm hands or
                        personal servants we are not told. There was one bricklayer, one mason, one
                        blacksmith, and one sailor. But there were also a barber and a tailor and a
                        drummer, while there were four boys, and some others whose manner of life is
                        not set down.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning, as we have said, this ill-assorted crowd divided into
                        factions. Such skilful <pb id="VAA2409-030" n="33"/> and vigorous spirits as
                        Bartholomew Gosnold and John Smith were no doubt outspoken against the
                        ascendancy of incompetents among the emigrants. Such men the brusque and
                        brave Captain John calls "meerely projecting, verball, and idle
                        contemplators."</p>
                    <p>No doubt Smith was himself more of a soldier than a diplomatist, and that he
                        stirred up a good deal of anger by his blunt speeches. But there was one
                        patient and peace-making man in the ships, and that was Mr. Robert Hunt,
                        "Preacher," as he is set down in the list. This good clergyman was so sick
                        at the beginning of the voyage that his life was despaired of, and though
                        the vessels lay for weeks off the Downs, in sight of his home, yet he never
                        once proposed to give over his enterprise. "With the water of patience, and
                        his godly exhortations (but chiefly by his true devoted examples), he
                        quenched those flames of envy and dissension."</p>
                    <p>The ships loitered at the Canaries and in the West Indies, consuming their
                        provisions, which were scant at the beginning, and losing the opportunity
                        for spring planting. So high a pitch did their dissensions reach that at one
                        of the islands it was even proposed to hang the impetuous and restless
                        Captain Smith, who probably <pb id="VAA2409-031" n="34"/> showed much
                        discontent at this waste of five months in a voyage for which two would have
                        been sufficient. The accounts are conflicting, but there seems no doubt that
                        a mutiny was intended, and that Smith was suspected of a share in it.</p>
                    <p>After the ships had three days passed their reckoning, without finding land,
                        Captain Ratcliffe, of the smallest vessel, seriously proposed that they
                        should turn about and sail back again, probably on the supposition that the
                        continent was lost. While this proposition was under advisement there came
                        up a lucky storm, which drove the ships to the mouth of the James River, and
                        settled in the minds of the navigators any doubts concerning the whereabouts
                        of Virginia. The first cape which they saw was named, for the Prince of
                        Wales, Cape Henry. The northern cape they named Cape Charles, for the King's
                        second son, afterward King Charles I. A landing was made on Cape Charles by
                        thirty men, who were suddenly attacked by five Indians. Two of the white men
                        were dangerously wounded in this first encounter with the "naturals." The
                        country within the capes the voyagers found to be what they regarded as the
                        pleasantest land known. "Here are mountains, hills, <pb id="VAA2409-032"
                            n="35"/> plains, valleys, rivers, and brooks, all running most
                        pleasantly into a fair bay, compassed but for the mouth with fruitful and
                        delightsome land." We are assured that "heaven and earth never agreed better
                        to frame a place for man's habitation, were it fully manned and inhabited by
                        industrious people." And indeed at the season of their arrival the banks of
                        the James River are magnificent with the blossoms of the redbud and dogwood,
                        so that after their tiresome voyage the land must have been indeed
                        delightful to their eyes.</p>
                    <p>After much debate, the place ever since called Jamestown was selected as the
                        sight of the colony. Gosnold strongly opposed this selection, while Smith
                        favored it. The event has proved the wisdom of Gosnold's judgment. It was on
                        low ground, and never wholesome. The inroads of the water have since turned
                        the peninsula into an island, and there is now only a ruined church tower to
                        mark the site of the first permanent colony in the United States.</p>
                    <p>As soon as they had landed they opened the box that contained the names of
                        the members of the council, which up to that time had been kept secret from
                        everybody. Captain Smith, who had been under arrest on suspicion for the
                        last three <pb id="VAA2409-033" n="36"/> months of the voyage, was among
                        those named, but he was formally excluded by the other members, on what
                        pretext we are not told. Wingfield was chosen president by the council, and
                        this tempest-tossed band of unlucky, unsuitable, and quarrelsome adventurers
                        planted the germs of a great nation at Jamestown. The planting would have
                        proved vain, indeed, had it not been for the one despised and excluded
                        councillor, whose ready tact, valor, and indefatigable zeal were to save it
                        from the mishaps and destruction which the folly and selfishness of its
                        leaders so often invited.</p>

                        reached the Indians of Virginia from time to time. In 1573, a Spanish vessel
                        had sailed into the Chesapeake, the mariners had taken soundings, admired
                        the many rivers and good harbors, and sailed away again. The inhabitants,
                        doubtless, heard also of the unsuccessful settlements of the English on
                        Wocokan and Roanoke Islands. At first these strangers, who were not known to
                        be sick, and who had no women with them, were believed to be immortals that
                        had not been born of women; the Indians of the region, indeed, attributed
                        all their ailments to wounds inflicted by the English with invisible
                        bullets. Perhaps Hariot, one of the members of the first colony at Roanoke,
                        had entered some of Powhatan's towns on those journeys in which he was
                        accustomed to show and explain the Bible to the Indians, who would kiss the
                        book and press it to their heads and breasts as an amulet, or "great
                        medicine."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-035" n="38"/>
                    <p>The dress of the Indians in the mild climate of Virginia was rather scanty.
                        The aristocracy wore little else than moccasins and a mantle of skin,
                        embroidered with beads, which was exchanged for one of fur during the
                        winter. Pretty mantles were also made of turkey's feathers, inter-woven with
                        thread in such a manner that only the feathers showed. The women covered
                        themselves with an apron of deerskin. The "common sort" had little but
                        leaves and grass for clothing. In summer, nearly all covering was dispensed
                        with by rich and poor. What the Indians lacked in clothing was made up in
                        paint and ornaments. They colored their heads and shoulders a brilliant red,
                        with a mixture made of powdered puccoon-root and oil. Women tattooed their
                        skin with figures of beasts and serpents. But ear pendants were their most
                        important ornaments. They had usually three large holes in each ear from
                        which they would hang chains, "bracelets," and copper. Indian women were

                        sometimes wear as an ear pendant a small green and yellow snake "crawling
                        and lapping itself about his neck." He was "the most gallant that was the
                        most monstrous to behold." What little beard the <pb id="VAA2409-036" n="39"

                        beau would spend hours plucking his whiskers out by the roots</p>
                    <p>The weapons, tools, and utensils of the aborigines were such as we do not see
                        among the Indians of to day who trade with a civilized people. Tomahawks
                        were made of a deer's horn, or of a long sharpened stone set into a handle
                        somewhat like a pickaxe. Arrows were stone-pointed and winged with turkey
                        feathers, which were fastened with a glue made from deer's horns. Their only
                        armor was a shield made of sticks or bark, woven together with thread. The
                        women made thread either of bark, deer's sinews, or of a kind of grass.
                        Knives were made of stone, and sometimes shells and reeds were sharpened for
                        this purpose. A file was made of the tooth of a beaver set in a stick. The
                        Indians kindled a fire by chafing a dry pointed stick in a hole made in a
                        piece of wood. Mortars were hollowed from stone, and in these corn was
                        pounded into meal. An extensive quarry in which stone vessels and implements
                        were made has recently been discovered in Amelia County, Virginia, and the
                        method of work is shown to have been very ingenious.</p>
                    <p>Corn bread was the staple food among the <pb id="VAA2409-037" n="40"/>
                        Indians. Bread was also made of wild oats and of sunflower seed. Fish, deer,
                        turkeys, and other game were their meats. Grubs, locusts, and snakes were
                        also included in the bill of fare. Potatoes and the tuckahoe root were
                        eaten. Tobacco and corn were planted by the Indians. The manner of planting
                        Indian corn was something new and strange to the English, and is thus
                        described: "The greatest labor they take is in planting their corn, for the
                        country naturally is overgrown with wood. To prepare the ground they bruise
                        the bark of the trees near the root, then do they scorch the roots with
                        fire, that they grow no more. The next year, with a crooked piece of wood,
                        they beat up the weeds by the roots, and in that mould they plant their
                        corn. Their manner is this: They make a hole in the earth with a stick, and
                        into it they put four grains of wheat [Indian corn] and two of beans. These
                        holes they make four foot one from another; their women and children do
                        continually keep it with weeding, and when it is grown middle high, they
                        hill it about like a hop-yard." The corn harvest was celebrated by the
                        festival of the green corn dance. The Indians delighted in roasted ears of
                        corn.</p>
                    <p>They made a drink of dried hickory nuts, <pb id="VAA2409-038" n="41"/>
                        pounded in a mortar and mixed with water. This liquor was called
                        Pawcohicora. From the Indian cookery Americans have borrowed hominy,
                        barbecued meat, and the Southern dish called "pone."</p>
                    <p>The Indians dwelt mostly on the river banks, and always in villages. Their
                        cabins, or wigwams, were framed of saplings tied together and covered very
                        handsomely with reeds, bark, or mats. Across the entrance a mat was
                        sometimes hung for a door. In the centre of the cabins a fire was built,
                        and, says Captain Smith, they were very warm, but also very smoky,
                        notwithstanding the hole in the top to let out smoke.</p>
                    <p>Indian towns were fortified with palisades ten or twelve feet in height.</p>
                    <p>The Virginia Indians worshipped an idol, or Okee, which represented the evil
                        spirit. They had also, like all of their race, some vague idea of a superior
                        spirit or creator. Their priests or medicine-men controlled them through
                        their superstition by means of divinations and conjurations, by which they
                        professed to cure the sick, and thus lived a life of indolence themselves.
                        The savages seldom dared steal from one another, fearing that their priests
                        might reveal the thief through divination. The rude temple in <pb
                            id="VAA2409-039" n="42"/> which they kept their Okee was surrounded with
                        posts on which hideous faces were roughly carved or painted.</p>
                    <p>The Indians divided their year into five seasonsbudding time, roasting ear
                        time, summer, the fall of the leaf, and winter. Their rather unmusical
                        instruments were a reed on which they piped, a rude drum, and rattles made
                        of gourds or pumpkins. "These, mingled with their voices," says Captain
                        Smith, "make such a terrible noise as would rather affright than delight any
                        man."</p>
                    <p>The Indians amused themselves with "sham fights," or war dances, accompanied
                        with the war-whoop, which seemed quite infernal to the English. Captain
                        Smith says that "all their actions, voyces, and gestures, both in charging
                        and retreating, were so strained to the height of their qualitie and nature
                        that the strangenesse thereof made it seem very delightfull."</p>
                    <p>When the Indians had a distinguished visitor "they spread a mat, as the Turks
                        doe a carpet, for him to sit upon. Upon another right opposite they sit
                        themselves. Then doe all with a tunable voice of shouting bid him welcome.
                        After this doe two or more of their chiefest men make an oration, testifying
                        their love."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-040" n="43"/>
                    <p>The English invested savage life with all the dignity of European courts.
                        Powhatan was styled "King," or "Emperor," his principal warriors were lords
                        of the kingdom, his wives were queens, his daughter was a "princess," and
                        his cabins were his various seats of residence. The extent of his conquests,
                        his unlimited power over his subjects, and the pomp which he maintained,
                        invest Powhatan with no little savage dignity. He was a "tall,
                        well-proportioned man, with a sower looke, his head somewhat gray, his beard
                        so thinne that it seemeth none at all, his age neare sixtie, of a very able
                        and hardy body, to endure any labour."</p>
                    <p>In his younger days Powhatan had been a great warrior. Hereditarily, he was
                        the chief or <hi rend="i">werowance</hi> of eight tribes; through conquest
                        his dominions had been extended until they reached from the James River to
                        the Potomac, from the sea to the falls in the principal rivers, and included
                        thirty of the forty tribes in Virginia. It is estimated that his subjects
                        numbered eight thousand. The name of his nation and the Indian appellation
                        of the James River was Powhatan. He himself possessed several names. His
                        proper personal appellation was said to have been Wahunsonacock. His enemies
                        were two neighboring <pb id="VAA2409-041" n="44"/> confederacies, the
                        Mannahoacs, situated between the Rappahannock and York Rivers, and the
                        Monacans, between the York and James Rivers, above the falls.</p>
                    <p>Powhatan lived sometimes at a village of his name, near where Richmond now
                        stands, and sometimes at Werowocomoco, on the York River. He had in each of
                        his hereditary villages, if we may believe the stories of early explorers, a
                        house built like a long arbor for his especial reception. When Powhatan
                        visited one of these villages a feast was already spread in the long house
                        or arbor. He had a hunting town in the wilderness called Orapax. A mile from
                        this place, deep in the woods, he had another arbor. like house, where he
                        kept furs, copper, pearls, and beads, treasures which he was saving against
                        his burial.</p>
                    <p>Powhatan was attended by a body-guard of forty or fifty tall warriors, while,
                        says Captain Smith, "every night upon the foure quarters of his house are
                        foure sentinels, each from other a slight shoot, and at every halfe houre
                        one from the corps on guard doth hollow, shaking his lips with his finger
                        betweene them, unto whom every sentinell doth answer round from his stand;
                        if any faile, they presently send forth an officer that <pb id="VAA2409-042"
                            n="45"/> beateth him extreamely." The war-whoop thus described by
                        Captain Smith is still in use among certain tribes of Indians.</p>
                    <p>Powhatan was proud of his fleet. It consisted of a large number of the canoes
                        called "dugouts," which are common among some tribes of Indians. The making
                        of these boats was a laborious process. Trees were felled by fire, and from
                        the trunks a boat was shaped by means of burning and scraping with shells
                        and tomahawks.</p>
                    <p>Powhatan had twenty sons and eleven daughters living. We know nothing of his
                        sons except Nanteguas, "the most manliest, comliest, boldest spirit" ever
                        seen in "a savage." Pocahontas was Powhatan's favorite daughter. She was
                        born in 1594 or 5. Of her mother nothing is known. Powhatan had many wives;
                        when he tired of them he would present them to those of his subjects, whom
                        he considered the most deserving.</p>
                    <p>Indians are frequently known by several names. It is a disappointment to
                        learn that the name which the romantic story of this Indian princess has
                        made so famous was not her real name. She was called in childhood Metoax, or
                        Metoake. Concealing this from the English, because of a superstitious notion
                        that if these pale-faced <pb id="VAA2409-043" n="46"/> strangers knew her
                        true name they could do her some harm, the Indians gave her name as
                        Pocahontas.</p>
                    <p>Powhatan's authority, like that of all Indian chiefs, was held in check by
                        the severity of custom. "The lawes whereby he ruleth," says Captain Smith,
                        "is custome. Yet when he listeth, his will is a law, and must be obeyed: not
                        only as a king, but as halfe a god they esteeme him." Each village and tribe
                        had its respective chief, or "werowance," as they were called among the
                        Powhatan Indians. The affairs of the tribe were settled in a council of the
                        chiefs and warriors of the several villages. Every town possessed its
                        council-house, just as the villages of New England have a town-hall. Here
                        the chiefs and old men assembled for consultation on any important matter.
                        Powhatan was the great werowance over all, "unto whom," says Captain Smith,
                        "they pay tribute of skinnes, beads, copper, pearle, deere, turkies, wild
                        beasts, and corne. What he commandeth they dare not disobey in the least
                        thing. It is strange to see with what care and adoration all these people do
                        obey this Powhatan. For at his feete they present whatsoever he commandeth,
                        and at the least frowne of his brow, their greatest spirits will <pb
                            id="VAA2409-044" n="47"/> tremble! and no marvell, for he is very
                        terrible and tyrannous in punishing such as offend him."</p>
                    <p>It was a barbarous life in which the little Pocahontas was bred. Her people
                        always washed their young babies in the river on the coldest mornings to
                        harden them. She was accustomed to see her old father sitting at the door of
                        his cabin regarding with grim pleasure a string of his enemy's scalps,
                        suspended from tree to tree, and waving in the breeze. Men in England in her
                        time idealized her into a princess and fine lady; in our time historians
                        have been surprised and indignant at finding that she was not a heroine of
                        romance, but simply an Indian maiden. Such as her life made her she wasin
                        her manners an untrained savage. But she was also the steadfast friend and
                        helper of the feeble colony, and that is why her life is so full of interest
                        to us.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> colonists' hearts were buoyant with hopes of a bright
                        future in this lovely land to which they had come in its loveliest season.
                        All set to work in a holiday spirit. The council planned fortifications, the
                        rest cleared the ground of trees, made nets, and prepared the
                        "clapboards"which in their speech probably meant cask staveswith which the
                        ships were to be laden for their return voyage. Savages frequently visited
                        them with friendly curiosity.</p>
                    <p>Cheerful activity had somewhat stilled the wrangles of the voyages. Captain
                        Smith, through a domineering will and the reputation which he enjoyed for
                        his adventures, excited the jealousy of those who were ambitious of leading.
                        Smith, as an experienced soldier, although not admitted to the council,
                        probably gave advice freely as to the necessity of drilling the colonists
                        and building a strong fort. The president, who was a merchant, did nothing
                        further than to fortify the new <pb id="VAA2409-046" n="49"/> town with
                        "boughs of trees cast together in the form of a half moon." Captain Smith's
                        bold spirit was too useful to be neglected. He and Captain Newport, with
                        twenty others, were sent to discover the source of the James River. They
                        ascended the river as far as the rapids, and planted a cross at the end of
                        their explorations. They visited an Indian chief at the village named
                        Powhatan, which was composed of about twelve cabins pleasantly situated on a
                        hill surrounded by cornfields, and fronted by three fertile islands. Captain
                        Newport presented the chief with a hatchet, with which he was much
                        delighted. The Indians complained at the intrusion of the English into their
                        country. The chief, concealing his own apprehensions, said, "They hurt you
                        not; they take but a little waste land."</p>
                    <p>When, however, the exploring party had returned to within twenty miles of
                        Jamestown, they began to suspect treachery. On reaching the colony they
                        found that their suspicions were well founded. The colonists, while securely
                        at work and unarmed, had been attacked by the Indians, and were for some
                        time in danger of destruction. A cross-bar shot from the vessel struck off
                        the bough of a tree in the midst of the savages, and so frightened them that
                        they fled in <pb id="VAA2409-047" n="50"/> every direction. Had it not been
                        for this timely shot, attributed by some authority to the presence of mind
                        of the president, Wingfield, the colonists would all have been massacred by
                        the savages. As it was, seventeen men were wounded and one boy killed, while
                        Wingfield had a narrow escape, an arrow passing through his beard.</p>
                    <p>Warned by this attack of the savages, the president now had the town
                        fortified with palisades, the guns mounted, and the men armed and drilled.
                        The Indians hung continually around the white settlement, either making
                        covert attacks, or in ambuscade awaiting an opportunity. Stragglers from the
                        fortand there were many suchwere often hurt, while the Indians always
                        escaped "by the nimbleness of their heels."</p>
                    <p>Captain Newport, who had been hired only to transport the colony, remained
                        six weeks. During this time the labor of the colonists was severe. With all
                        the work which the immediate needs of the settlers called for, and the
                        loading of the vessels for their return voyage, the settlers were obliged
                        with their small force to watch at night and to guard the workmen by day.</p>
                    <p>Captain Newport at last prepared to set sail. Captain Smith had been for
                        thirteen weeks under suspicion, awaiting a trial. His natural leadership <pb
                            id="VAA2409-048" n="51"/> had already asserted itself, while his
                        earnestness and straightforward energy had gained him friends and respect.
                        His enemies, probably fearing for the success of their plans, proposed, out
                        of charity, to refer him to the council in England rather than to subject
                        him to a public trial at Jamestown. Captain Smith "scorned" their kindness,
                        and demanded a trial, which resulted very honorably to him. His accusers'
                        witnesses confessed that they had been suborned; Smith was acquitted, and
                        his chief enemy, the president, was condemned to pay Smith two hundred
                        pounds. Captain Smith turned the money into the public store. The good
                        minister came forward and made peace on all sides, and through his influence
                        and that of Captain Newport, Smith was admitted to his seat in the council.
                        The next day all received the communion together; on the day following the
                        Indians presented themselves to desire peace, and Captain Newport set sail
                        for England with good news from Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Left thus to their "fortunes, it fortuned" that within a few days the
                        colonists were nearly all sick. The site of Jamestown had been poorly
                        chosen. The adjacent swamps of the Chickahominy made it very unhealthy. The
                        colonists had not become acclimated, and unusual toil in a summer's <pb
                            id="VAA2409-049" n="52"/> heat, to which they wore not accustomed, with
                        a scarcity of provisions, were the causes of this sickness.</p>
                    <p>The council in London believed that they had plentifully provided the
                        colonists with provisions, supposing that the voyage would be made in two
                        months, and that they would reach Virginia in time to plant for themselves.
                        They had, however, been five months on the way, and had thus missed the
                        chance of raising a corn harvest. While the ships remained, the settlers had
                        traded sassafras, furs, and money for biscuits, which the sailors would
                        pilfer from the ships' store. Now their food consisted of a half pint of
                        wheat and as much barley to each man, boiled in a common kettle. This grain
                        had lain so long in the ship's hold that it was full of worms, and could not
                        have been very appetizing to the sick colonists, who had no drink but water,
                        and no "lodgings" but "castles in the air." Still, as their narrative says,
                        the council in England was not to be blamed, since "the fault of our going
                        was our own."</p>
                    <p>Every day during the month of August fresh graves were dug. One day the
                        cannons boomed in honor of the burial of Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, the
                        explorer, and one of the first movers <pb id="VAA2409-050" n="53"/> of the
                        expedition. To his loss no doubt some of the later misfortunes of the colony
                        were due. At the end of the summer about fifty of the one hundred and five
                        colonists had died.</p>
                    <p>There was naturally much murmuring and discontent in the smitten and hungry
                        colony. "Had we been as free from all sins as gluttony and drunkenness,"
                        says their story, "we might have been canonized for saints." They were
                        evidently, however, not free from other sins. After the death of Captain
                        Gosnold contentions increased. John Kendall was deposed from his seat in the
                        council, and imprisoned for making trouble between the president and the
                        other members of the council. Wingfield himself, accused of engrossing for
                        his private benefit what delicacies there were, was also suspected of a
                        project to flee to England with their little vessel. The "dead spirits" of
                        the sick colonists were "so moved" that the president was deposed and
                        confined upon the pinnace. He denied the charges against him in a statement
                        written to the council in England, and it cannot be certainly known whether,
                        as Captain Smith believed, there was truth in them or not. There is little
                        doubt, however, that Wingfield was ill-fitted to fill the difficult office
                        to which he had been elected. <pb id="VAA2409-051" n="54"/> Captain John
                        Ratcliffe was appointed in his place.</p>
                    <p>Those men who had survived during the summer had lived mostly on sturgeon and
                        sea-crabs. As autumn came on the sturgeon failed them, and their supply of
                        provisions had come to an end. In their weakened condition they expected
                        every day to be attacked by the savages. In this extremity the Indians,
                        however, proved friendly, bringing them plenty of fruit and provisions.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith's natural gift for leadership had asserted itself through the
                        trials and dangers of the colony. From this time the real management of
                        affairs fell into his hands. The new president, and Martin, the remaining
                        member of the council, were content to stay at home. By dint of good words,
                        promises, and his own example, Smith got the men to work to build Jamestown.
                        Some cut, others bound thatch, some built cottages, and others thatched
                        them. Among them all worked Captain Smith, taking always the most difficult
                        task as his share. In a short time they all had homes except Smith himself.</p>
                    <p>The superfluity of the Indian harvests in the neighborhood of Jamestown was
                        being used up. Captain Smith resolved to go on a trading expedition into the
                        Indian country. The colonists had <pb id="VAA2409-052" n="55"/> no knowledge
                        of the Indian language; their force was small, they knew little about
                        managing a boat without sails, and the men needed clothing and other
                        necessaries. All these were difficulties in the way of the expedition, "yet
                        no discouragement" to the bold spirit of Captain Smith; with five or six men
                        in a shallop they started down the river. They stopped at the Indian village
                        of Kecoughtan, where Hampton now stands. The inhabitants scorned them as
                        starving men. They would offer them a handful of corn in exchange for their
                        swords, or a piece of bread for their clothes. These were Indian jokes.
                        Captain Smith, soldier that he was, finding that "courtesy" had no effect,
                        tried force, though contrary to his commission. He suddenly "let fly his
                        muskets," and ran his boat ashore. The Indians immediately fled for the
                        woods while this company of six or seven men marched into their town. Here
                        were great heaps of corn, and Smith had "much ado" to prevent the hungry
                        soldiers from helping themselves. He kept his men in readiness, expecting an
                        attack on the part of the Indians. In a short time there was "a most hideous
                        noise," and sixty or seventy Indians, formed in square order, came dancing
                        and singing out of the woods. They were all <pb id="VAA2409-053" n="56"/>
                        painted either black, red, white, or party-colored, and bore their Okee
                        before them, made of skin, stuffed with moss, painted and decorated with
                        beads and copper. They charged upon the English, armed with clubs, shields,
                        bows and arrows. They were "so kindly received," however, with a volley of
                        musketry, "that down fell their god, and divers lay sprawling on the
                        ground." The rest of the Indians had disappeared again in the woods. They
                        soon sent a priest with offers for peace and the restoration of their idol.
                        Smith made answer that if they would send six unarmed men to load his boat
                        he would not only return the Okee, but give them beads, copper, and
                        hatchets, and be their friend. Accordingly they brought him venison, turkey,
                        wild fowls, and bread, and were so pleased with the trinkets that he gave
                        them in exchange that the last that the English saw of them they were
                        dancing and singing in token of friendship, though they were no doubt glad
                        when the English were gone.<ref id="ref_02" rend="super" target="note_02"

                                Relation no mention is made of any fight with the Indians at this
                                time.</p>
                        </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>The sickly season had passed, and the colonists were all recovered by the
                        time of the return of <pb id="VAA2409-054" n="57"/> the expedition. Captain
                        Smith now fitted up the pinnace for a voyage in search of provisions for the
                        following year. Meanwhile he made several short trips into the country. On
                        one of these journeys he discovered the people of Chickahominy living on the
                        river of that name. The president was a weak man, Martin was in ill-health,
                        and when Captain Smith was absent all was confusion among the colonists.
                        During one of his trips Wingfield and Kendall plotted with some others to
                        sail for England in the pinnace. Captain Smith returned unexpectedly, the
                        plot was revealed to him, and he forced them to "stay or sink" after a
                        skirmish which cost the life of Captain Kendall (unless, indeed, Kendall was
                        executed after a trial, as in some accounts). The president and Captain
                        Archer entertained a similar project for abandoning the country not long
                        after this, but Smith detained them also.</p>
                    <p>It is said of Smith that "the Spaniard never more greedily desired gold than
                        he victual, nor his soldiers more to abandon the country than he to keep
                        it." He had found an abundance of corn on the Chickahominy River. He made an
                        excursion there, and was received by hundreds of Indians with baskets of
                        corn.</p>
                    <p>Times of plenty had now come to the country. <pb id="VAA2409-055" n="58"/> As
                        winter approached, the rivers were covered with swans, ducks, and geese.
                        With these and an abundance of other game, fish, and fruit, the colonists
                        were so feasted that Captain Smith no longer had to threaten the sinking of
                        the little vessel to keep them in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>But their "comedies never endured long without a tragedy." The tragedy was
                        soon to follow.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">EARLY ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH.</head>
                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> come now to consider the adventures and explorations of
                        the chief hero of the Virginia colony, Captain John Smith. In an age when
                        romantic adventures were in vogue he was the rarest of adventurers. From
                        boyhood he led a roving life, wandering through Europe, fighting the Turks,
                        enduring captivities, encountering pirates and shipwreck, and at last
                        distinguishing himself by the ready stratagems and unfailing presence of
                        mind with which he managed the savages in Virginia and delivered the colony
                        from destruction.</p>
                    <p>At the early age of thirteen, like many another boy, he was "set upon brave
                        adventures," as he says. But he did not, like the usual boy of modern
                        story-books, achieve a brave career in an incredibly short time, and without
                        any previous training.</p>
                    <p>This remarkable man had already attained great renown as an adventurer and
                        soldier when he sailed for Virginia, being then under <pb id="VAA2409-057"
                            n="60"/> twenty-eight years of age. He was born at Willoughby, in
                        Lincolnshire, in 1579. Never did a hero of romantic adventure come into
                        possession of a more commonplace name than that of John Smith. His father
                        came, it would seem from an old and well-known family of Smiths, and was a
                        man of some means. John Smith attended the free schools of Alford and Louth.
                        To him, as to all boys of a roving tendency, the sea seemed the only road to
                        "brave adventures." At the age of thirteen he sold his school-books and
                        satchel, and planned to run away to sea. The death of his parents at this
                        time, however, checked his adventurous spirit for the moment. His father
                        left him plenty of means, but his guardians cared more for the boy's estate
                        than for the boy. Smith had liberty enough to do as he pleased, but lacked
                        money. When he was fifteen years old his guardians apprenticed him to a
                        merchant of Lynn. Because this merchant would not send him to sea, as Smith
                        quaintly remarks, he saw no more of his master for eight years. John Smith
                        had found a chance to attend the son of Lord Willoughby, who was going with
                        his tutor to France. His guardians had found Smith a troublesome charge, and
                        they gave him ten shillings, from his own estate, "to be rid of <pb
                            id="VAA2409-058" n="61"/> him." At Orleans the young nobleman met his
                        brother, and having no more use for Smith, he was dismissed. He had probably
                        engaged to attend him for his passage, but the young gentleman gave him
                        money to pay his fare back to his home. John Smith had no notion of
                        returning to England, however. At Paris he became acquainted with a Scotch
                        gentleman named David Hume, who, if we rightly identify him, was a
                        Protestant minister, the author of several famous books in English and
                        Latin. He seems to have taken a great fancy to the adventurous boy, for he
                        gave him money and letters to friends in Scotland, who would refer him to
                        King James VI., at that time reigning in Scotland, afterward James I. of
                        England. Arriving at Rouen on his way to Scotland, and finding his money
                        nearly gone, "he better bethought himself," and "down the river he went to
                        Havre de Grace." Here he became a soldier. When peace was concluded in
                        France, he went over into the Low Countries, where he served for three or
                        four years under Captain Joseph Duxbury. He probably belonged to a corps of
                        English auxiliaries who aided the Netherlands in the struggle in which they
                        gained their independence. He next resolved to deliver his letters. On the
                        voyage, with his <pb id="VAA2409-059" n="62"/> usual hard fortune, he
                        suffered shipwreck and sickness. He at last arrived in Scotland, where he
                        was most kindly treated, but he had not the means to make a courtier, nor
                        indeed was of the kind of men that dwell in kings' houses. John Smith
                        returned to his native town, where he was soon glutted with a society which
                        was not to his taste. This young gentleman of nineteen resolved to become a
                        hermit. He selected "a little woody pasture" surrounded by hundreds of acres
                        of other woods, where he built him a "pavilion of bows." Here he studied
                        Machiavelli's "Art of War" and the writings of Marcus Aurelius, while he
                        exercised himself with a good horse, his lance, and ring, after the manner
                        of that time. Like Shakespeare, he was guilty of breaking the game law, for
                        he slyly remarks that "his food was thought to be more of venison than any
                        thing else." This romantic hermit was much wondered at. An Italian
                        gentleman, Signor Theadora Polaloga, rider to the Earl of Lincoln, visited
                        Smith, and by his fine horsemanship and "good discourse" persuaded him to
                        return to the outside world again. He staid for a time with his Italian
                        friend, but could not long be content with such tame pleasures as this life
                        afforded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-060" n="63"/>
                    <p>He had served his apprenticeship in the wars of France and the Netherlands.
                        He now desired to see more of the world, and "lamenting and repenting to
                        have seen so many Christians slaughter one another," he was ambitious to
                        "try his fortunes" against those about killing whom he would have no
                        compunctionnamely, the infidel Turks. Smith first set out for the Low
                        Countries. Here he met four French adventurers, one of whom gave himself out
                        as a nobleman, Lord Dapreau, while the rest were his attendants. They formed
                        a friendship with the young Englishman, and proposed to Smith to go into
                        France, where they might procure letters from the Duchess of Mercur to the
                        Duke, her husband, who was a general in the Turkish war. They embarked for
                        France, and on a dark night arrived at St. Valery in Picardy. The Frenchmen
                        planned with the captain to put them ashore with their own and Smith's
                        baggage, while he was to wait for the return of the boat. The captain did
                        not return until the next night, saying that the sea was so high that he
                        could not come, and that Lord Dapreau had gone to Amiens, where he would
                        await the arrival of Smith. This young gentleman was now left without
                        clothes except what he wore, and without money except one <pb
                            id="VAA2409-061" n="64"/> small piece. The passengers were indignant at
                        the villany of the captain, and with the lawlessness of the times would have
                        killed him, and seized the ship had they known how to manage it. When Smith
                        came to shore he was obliged to sell his cloak in order to pay for his
                        passage.</p>
                    <p>One of the passengers, a solider named Curzianvere, informed Smith that this
                        great lord who had disappeared with his baggage and money was but the son of
                        a lawyer in Brittany, that his gentlemen were three young citizens, and that
                        they were all "arrant cheats." Curzianvere promised to go with Smith to
                        their home, in order that he might get some redress. They journeyed through
                        Normandy, stopping to visit the "ruinous tomb of William the Conqueror," and
                        arrived in Brittainy, where they found the rascals. Curzianvere, however,
                        could not help him, for he was a banished man, and dared not be seen by any
                        but his friends. Smith was unable to recover his property, but his story
                        became known, and some of the nobility supplied his wants and entertained
                        him kindly.</p>
                    <p>This life did not suit the young man's independent spirit. He wandered on,
                        from seaport to seaport, in search of a man of war. His money was at last
                        all gone, and he lay down in a forest <pb id="VAA2409-062" n="65"/> by a
                        "fair fountain," "near dead with grief and cold." Here he was found by a
                        rich farmer and relieved of his wants.</p>
                    <p>Walking through the woods one day, he met one of the French robbers in a
                        still more miserable condition than himself. Without a word they both drew
                        their swords and fought until the Frenchman fell. He confessed his robbery,
                        in the presence of the inhabitants, of "an old ruinated tower" near by.
                        Smith got his revenge, but that was all.</p>
                    <p>He now travelled to the castle of the Earl of Ployer, under whom he had
                        fought in the French wars. This nobleman refitted him, and showed him the
                        sights of the country. Turning out of his road many times to see places of
                        interest, Smith at last reached Marseilles, where he embarked for Italy.</p>
                    <p>The vessel was crowded with Catholic pilgrims of all nations bound for Rome.
                        They "cursed" Smith for a Huguenot, his nation for pirates, and "railed on"
                        his sovereign, Queen Elizabeth. Smith was always a good churchman, and a
                        loyal subject, and being neither a very meek nor patient man, it is probable
                        that he answered them in the same fashion. Stormy weather forced the vessel
                        to put into the harbor of Toulon, and <pb id="VAA2409-063" n="66"/> again to
                        anchor off the Isle of St. Mary, near Nice, in Savoy. The pilgrims concluded
                        that they would never have fair weather so long as Smith was with them, so,
                        like a second Jonah, he was thrown overboard.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">CAPTAIN SMITH GOES TO FIGHT THE TURKS.</head>
                    <p>S<hi rend="sc">MITH</hi> swam ashore to St. Mary's Isle, which he found
                        inhabited only by a few cattle and goats. But he was not long destined to
                        play Robinson Crusoe. The next morning he espied two other ships which had
                        been forced in by the storm. He was taken on board a vessel, commanded by
                        Captain La Roche, a neighbor of the Earl of Ployer. "For the love" of this
                        nobleman Smith was well entertained. The French vessel sailed to Alexandria,
                        delivered her freight, and coasted the Levant "rather to view what ships
                        were in the road than any thing else." In those days sailors were always on
                        the watch for plunder. They met a Venetian argosy, richly laden. The French
                        vessel attempted to bespeak her, but the captain answered them with a
                        broadside, probably expecting no better treatment from such as he met.
                        Captain La Roche immediately gave chase, giving her his other broadside,
                        then his stern, and then his other broadside, until the Venetian's sails and
                        rigging were so <pb id="VAA2409-065" n="68"/> torn that she was obliged to
                        stand and give battle "shot for shot." Twice in an hour Captain La Roche
                        boarded her, and once the argosy fired him, with much danger to both
                        vessels. The fire was quenched, however, and the battle continued until the
                        Venetian yielded. The rich vessel, loaded with silks, velvets, cloth of
                        gold, and gold and silver money, was rifled of the least bulky part of her
                        cargo. Smith was set ashore in Piedmont with his share of the spoils, five
                        hundred sequins, and "a little box, probably containing jewels, worth twice
                        as much more."</p>
                    <p>Having now both the means and opportunity, he was glad "to better his
                        experience by the view of Italy." At Rome he saw Pope Clement VIII. and his
                        cardinals "creep up the holy stairs." Having "satisfied his eyes with the
                        rarities" of the principal cities of Italy, he started from Venice for the
                        seat of the Turkish war.</p>
                    <p>In 1601, Smith, then but twenty-two years of age, reached Gratz, in Styria.
                        The feeble Rudolph II., Emperor of Germany, was at this time waging war
                        against the Turks, who had invaded Hungary and given the Emperor much
                        trouble. Smith met two of his countrymen, who introduced him to Lord
                        Eberspaught. This officer examined him, and presented him to Baron Kissell,
                            <pb id="VAA2409-066" n="69"/> general of the artillery, who placed him
                        in the regiment of the Earl of Meldritch.</p>
                    <p>The Christians had lost the strong fortress of Canisia, or Kaniska, in
                        Hungary, and the Turks were ravaging the neighboring country. They now laid
                        siege with twenty thousand men to Olympach, which was commanded by Lord
                        Eberspaught. All intelligence and supplies were entirely cut off from the
                        beleaguered garrison. Baron Kissell had come to the assistance of Olympach,
                        and wished to send a communication to the commander. It was impossible for a
                        messenger to pass the Turkish ranks. At this juncture John Smith appeared
                        before the Baron, and told him that he had previously explained a method of
                        telegraphy to Lord Eberspaught, and that if he would take him to some place
                        where a torch might be seen from the town, he would undertake to communicate
                        with him. He explained his plan to the Baron, who allowed him guides to take
                        him on a dark night to the top of a mountain seven miles from Olympach. From
                        this point Smith showed three torches at an equal distance from one another.
                        After waiting a while he saw that Lord Eberspaught had guessed the meaning
                        of this, for three answering lights appeared from the town. Smith's plan was
                        to <pb id="VAA2409-067" n="70"/> show one torch a corresponding number of
                        times to the place in the alphabet of the letter which he wished to
                        designate. By this means he spelled out the words, "On Thursday, at night, I
                        will charge on the east; at the alarm sally you." The answer came from the
                        town, "I will." This mode of telegraphy is ancient, and Smith had probably
                        found it in his reading. Smith also proposed that on the night of the attack
                        several thousand matches should be fastened to strings, stretched suddenly
                        upon a line on the plain, and fired, an instant before the alarm, in order
                        to deceive the enemy as to the place of attack.</p>
                    <p>The night arrived. The Turks hearing the report of the matches, supposed it
                        to be the firing of musketry, and their force was immediately directed to
                        that quarter. So great was the confusion produced by the false alarm, the
                        real attack in another quarter from Baron Kissell, and the sally of Lord
                        Eberspaught, that the Baron put two thousand good soldiers into the town
                        before morning, and the besieged succeeded in procuring an abundance of
                        provisions from the Turkish encampment. The result was that the Turks
                        abandoned the siege. As a reward for these services, Smith was given the
                        command of a body of two hundred and fifty horse.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-068" n="71"/>
                    <p>Duke Mercury, as Smith calls himmore properly, the Duke de Mercur, under whom
                        Smith served, now undertook the siege of Alba Regalis, in Hungary, with a
                        force of thirty thousand men. Smith, with characteristic readiness of
                        resource, had invented a sort of bomb made of earthen pots filled with an
                        explosive mixture, and thrown from slings. These were put in use at the
                        siege of Alba Regalis, doing much execution, and firing the suburbs several
                        times.</p>
                    <p>One suburb of the city was strongly defended by a muddy lake, and thought to
                        be impregnable. Earl Roswarine, however, provided every man on a dark night
                        with a bundle of sedge and reeds, which they threw before them, and thus
                        crossed this lake, so surprising the Turks that they fled into the city. The
                        inhabitants of the other suburb, not understanding the cause of panic,
                        followed suit, so that it was readily taken by the Duke. The city, not being
                        so strong as the suburbs, was battered with the ordnance which had been
                        captured. The inhabitants were put to the sword after the barbarous custom
                        prevailing in warfare between Turks and Christians.</p>
                    <p>The Sultan had raised an army of sixty thousand men under the command of
                        Hassan Pasha to march to the relief of Alba Regalis. Hearing <pb
                            id="VAA2409-069" n="72"/> that the city was lost, he still continued his
                        march, hoping to retake it. He was met by the Christians, twenty thousand
                        strong, on the plains of Girke. A fierce battle was fought, in which the
                        Earl of Meldritch and his men were so surrounded by the semi-circular
                        Turkish regiments that they were thought to be lost, but were relieved by
                        other brave leaders in the Christian army. Captain Smith was severely
                        wounded, and had his horse shot from under him; but he was not long
                        unmounted among so many riderless horses. Night closed the contest, and
                        another action followed, in which the Turks were defeated with a loss of six
                        thousand men.</p>
                    <p>The Duke de Mercur now divided his army into three parts, that under the Earl
                        of Meldritch being sent into Transylvania, whose Prince, Sigismund Bathori,
                        was both contending with the Emperor of Germany, and, like the Emperor, was
                        waging war against Turkey. The Earl of Meldritch was to join the Emperor's
                        army against Sigismund. This service was distasteful to him, since he was
                        himself a Transylvanian, and probably sympathized more with the Prince than
                        with the Emperor. His men were mostly adventurers who had entered the
                        service to fight the Turks, and were anxious to <pb id="VAA2409-070" n="73"
                        /> serve where the most booty might be obtained. Their pay had been poor in
                        the Emperor's service, and they were easily persuaded to follow their
                        leader, who offered himself to Prince Sigismund to fight the Turks, then
                        holding that part of Transylvania where the estates of his family were
                        situated.</p>
                    <p>Earl Meldritch made incursions into the mountain regions infested with Turks,
                        Tartars, robbers, and renegades. These were forced into the city of Regal,
                        which was so surrounded by mountains that it was entered only by difficult
                        passes and seemed impregnable. Meldritch with eight thousand men began the
                        siege of the city, or, as Smith poetically states it, "The earth no sooner
                        put on her green habit than the Earl overspread her with his armed troops."
                        The Turks were so well fortified and garrisoned that they scorned this army.
                        The Christian forces were soon augmented, however, by the arrival of Prince
                        Moyses with nine thousand men. The strong fortress was so well situated that
                        they could neither frighten nor hurt the Turks, who grew insolent while the
                        Christians were preparing to plant their ordnance, saying they were at pawn,
                        and grew fat for want of exercise.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">CAPTAIN SMITH AMUSES THE TURKISH LADIES.</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> challenge was one day received in the Christian camp
                        from Regal: "That to delight the ladies, who did long to see some court-like
                        pastime, the Lord Turbashaw did defie any captain that had the command of a
                        company who durst combat with him for his head." So many were ambitious of
                        fighting the Turkish lord that it was necessary to draw lots. The name of
                        Captain Smith was drawn.</p>
                    <p>The day of the contest came. The ramparts of the town were "all beset with
                        fair dames" and armed men. With the sound of hautboys, the Lord Turbashaw
                        entered the field finely mounted, splendidly armed, and with a great pair of
                        wings fastened upon his shoulders, "compacted of eagles' feathers within a
                        ridge of silver, richly garnished with gold and precious stones." Before him
                        went a janizary bearing his lance, while one went on either side leading his
                        horse. Captain Smith entered the lists with a flourish of trumpets, attended
                        only by a page who bore his lance. He <pb id="VAA2409-072" n="75"/> passed
                        his antagonist with a courteous salute. At the sound of the trumpet the
                        combatants met at full speed, and the Christian's lance pierced the visor of
                        the Turk, who fell dead. Smith alighted and cut off the Lord Turbashaw's
                        head, leaving the body to his friends. The victor was received with
                        triumphant joy in the Christian camp.</p>
                    <p>The death of this champion brought great chagrin into the Turkish fortress.
                        His vowed friend, Grualgo, challenged Smith to single combat, to regain the
                        head of his friend or to lose his own. The challenge was accepted, and the
                        next day appointed. At the sound of trumpets the combatants met, their
                        lances were shivered, and they passed each other unhurt, although the Turk
                        was nearly unhorsed. They next met with pistols. Smith's armor was dinted,
                        but they again passed unharmed. At the third encounter Captain Smith wounded
                        his antagonist in the left arm. Unable both to manage his horse and defend
                        himself, the Turk was thrown to the ground, where he quickly lost his head.
                        According to the terms of the challenge, horse and armor went to the victor,
                        while the body and rich apparel were returned to the town.</p>
                    <p>The works of the besiegers progressed slowly. <pb id="VAA2409-073" n="76"/> A
                        few unimportant skirmishes only took place. Smith now procured leave to send
                        a challenge into the town on his part. The message was to this effect: that
                        he was not so "enamored" of the heads of the ladies' servants that he would
                        not afford any Turkish knight a chance to redeem them and secure his own if
                        he could win it. This challenge was accepted by a Turk named Bouny Mulgro,
                        who, having the choice of weapons, avoided the lance, in the use of which
                        Smith had proved himself so skilful, and chose pistols, battle-axes, and
                        swords. On the following day the champions entered the lists as before, and
                        discharged their pistols at the first encounter without effect. Such heavy
                        blows from the battle-axe followed as to nearly stun both Turk and
                        Christian. Smith was not, however, so skilful with this weapon, and the Turk
                        dealt him a blow that forced him to drop his battle-axe, and he came near
                        following it to the ground. A great shout of triumph arose from the ramparts
                        of Regal. But the battle was not yet won. The Turk followed up his advantage
                        with heavy blows, which Smith, however, avoided by dexterous horsemanship,
                        and, contrary to the expectations of the witnesses, he succeeded in piercing
                        the body of his enemy with his sword.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-074" n="77"/>
                    <p>The head of Bouny Mulgro followed those of his friends.</p>
                    <p>After this Smith was conducted to the pavilion of Prince Moyses with a guard
                        of six thousand men, preceded by the three heads upon lances, and the horses
                        of the conquered Turks. Captain Smith presented his trophies to the Prince,
                        who received him with an embrace and presented him a richly caparisoned
                        horse, and a scimitar and belt worth three hundred ducats, while the Earl of
                        Meldritch made him major of his regiment.</p>
                    <p>The siege of Regal continued, and the place was at last taken after a fierce
                        assault. The garrison was put to the sword in retaliation for the massacre
                        of the Christian garrison from whom the Turks had taken the place.</p>
                    <p>Prince Sigismund, when he came to review his army, was informed of Captain
                        Smith's valor and services, for which he gave him his picture set in gold,
                        and a pension of three hundred ducats. He gave Captain Smith a patent of
                        nobility, with three Turks' heads in his coat of arms. This patent was
                        afterward accepted, and recorded in the Herald's College in England.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">CAPTAIN SMITH'S CAPTIVITY.</head>
                    <p>P<hi rend="sc">RINCE</hi> S<hi rend="sc">IGISMUND</hi> at last gave up his
                        unequal struggle with the Emperor. Transylvania became a German province,
                        and Sigismund retired to the life of a private nobleman in Prague with an
                        ample pension.</p>
                    <p>By this means the allegiance of Sigismund's armies was transferred to the
                        Emperor, a master to whom they were so little attached that it became
                        necessary to occupy them. The opportunity was not long wanting in those
                        troubled times.</p>
                    <p>Wallachia was then in possession of the Turks. The inhabitants revolted
                        against the tyranny of the Waywode, or prince, of this province, and applied
                        for assistance to the Emperor. Lord Ro-doll was appointed Waywode in place
                        of the Turk, whose name was Jeremy. The Earl of Meldritch, with an army of
                        thirty thousand men, was sent to support the new ruler. Jeremy met him with
                        forty thousand Turks, Tartars, and Moldavians. A bloody battle ensued
                        between <pb id="VAA2409-076" n="79"/> the two pretenders to the
                        principality, which resulted in establishing Rodoll as Waywode.</p>
                    <p>Jeremy had, however, gathered together another army in Moldavia, and
                        threatened trouble. The Earl of Meldritch, with thirteen thousand men, was
                        sent against him. They were successful in several skirmishes, in one of
                        which he was assisted by Smith's inventive genius. The latter manufactured
                        fireworks, which were carried upon the tops of lances in a night attack, and
                        so frightened horse and man that the victory was an easy matter.</p>
                    <p>The end was disastrous, however. The Earl of Meldritch was attacked by an
                        army of forty thousand Turks in a mountain pass. He ordered his eleven
                        thousand remaining men as best he could, planted sharpened stakes with their
                        heads toward the enemy, with holes dug among them, as his defence, and
                        bravely encountered the multitudes of the foe. When numbers became too much
                        for them, the Christians retired behind their defence, and Captain Smith
                        says "it was a wonder to see how horse and man came to the ground among the
                        stakes." The Christians could not, however, long prevail. The Earl of
                        Meldritch made one last effort. He formed all his men into a column, and
                        attempted to cut his <pb id="VAA2409-077" n="80"/> way through the enemies'
                        ranks. In this he succeeded for a time, but was at last overwhelmed; night
                        came on, and the Earl escaped with some thirteen hundred horsemen by
                        swimming the river. On this terrible battle field nearly thirty thousand men
                        lay dead or wounded, among them Captain Smith. "Most of the dearest friends
                        of the noble Prince Sigismund" perished in the battle. Smith tenderly
                        recorded in his history the names of some nine of his own countrymen who
                        fell on this forgotten battle field. Searching among the dead, the pillagers
                        discovered Captain Smith, and judging by his rich armor and dress that he
                        was a person of some importance, they saved him, hoping to get a good
                        ransom. His wounds were healed, and he was taken with numbers of other
                        prisoners to Axiopolis to be sold as a slave. Here, "like beasts in a
                        market-place," they were viewed by the merchants, their limbs and their
                        wounds carefully examined, and finally they were made to struggle together
                        to try their strength. Captain Smith was purchased by the Bashaw, or, as we
                        should say, Pasha, Bogall. A number of slaves were chained by the necks in
                        groups of twenty and marched to Constantinople, where they were delivered to
                        their several masters. Smith was presented by <pb id="VAA2409-078" n="81"/>
                        the Bashaw to his fair young mistress, Charatza Tragabigzanda. He wrote her
                        that this slave was a Bohemian nobleman whom he had captured in battle.</p>
                    <p>The young lady immediately became interested in her fine-looking young slave.
                        She understood Italian, and would make opportunities to speak with him. She
                        inquired if he were indeed a Bohemian noble conquered by her lord. Captain
                        Smith protested that he had never seen Bashaw Bogall until they had met in
                        the slave-market. She had him examined by those who could speak English, to
                        whom he told his story. Convinced of the truth of it, she took the more
                        interest in him, and treated him with the greatest kindness. Charatza
                        Tragabigzanda had formed a romantic attachment for her Christian slave. She
                        had, however, no use for him, and fearing lest her mother, who may have
                        suspected her love for him, should cause him to be sold, she resolved to
                        send him to her brother Timour, Bashaw of Nalbritz in Tartary. With him she
                        sent a letter to this lord, requesting him to use her slave well, since she
                        intended him but to sojourn in Nalbritz to learn the language and become a
                        Turk until she became her own mistress.</p>
                    <p>At the end of his journey Captain Smith was <pb id="VAA2409-079" n="82"/>
                        brought before Timour in his "vast stony castle." The proud Bashaw read his
                        sister's letter, and was incensed that she should look with favor on a
                        Christian slave. He immediately ordered that his head should be shaven, a
                        great iron collar riveted upon his neck, and that he should be dressed in a
                        rough haircloth garment. Among hundreds of slaves he was slave to them all,
                        though he said "there was no great choice, for the best was so bad that a
                        dog could hardly have lived to endure."</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith now had a tyrant for a master, who took delight in beating and
                        abusing the Christian slave. In all his hopeless misery Smith noted the
                        manners and customs, religion and government, of the Tartars. Of their
                        disgusting style of living he speaks in the strongest terms, but he praises
                        their skilful horsemanship and endurance of hardship in war.</p>
                    <p>"All the hope he had ever to be delivered from this thraldom," said Smith,
                        "was only the love of Tragabigzanda, who surely was ignorant of his bad
                        usage; for although he had often debated the matter with some Christians
                        that had been there a long time slaves, they could not find how to make an
                        escape by any reason or possibility. But God, beyond man's expectation or
                        imagination, <pb id="VAA2409-080" n="83"/> helpeth his servants when they
                        least think of help as it happened to him." Captain Smith was put to thresh
                        grain at a farm more than a league from the castle of the Bashaw. Timour was
                        accustomed often to visit his various granges. One day he visited Smith at
                        his work, and beat and reviled him so unmercifully that Captain Smith,
                        "forgetting all reason," rose in defence and beat out the Bashaw's brains
                        with the bat which the Tartars used for threshing. There was now no hope for
                        him in remaining where he was; his condition could not be altered for the
                        worse. He quickly hid the Bashaw's body under the straw, dressed himself in
                        his clothes, and filling his knapsack with grain, closed the doors of the
                        barn, and mounting his master's horse, fled into the desert. Here he
                        wandered for several days, not knowing the way, and yet thankful that he met
                        no one of whom he might ask it, since the Bashaw's clothes could not conceal
                        the slave's iron collar, stamped with his master's sign.</p>
                    <p>He at last came upon a great road on whose crossings were sign-posts marked
                        with a crescent for Tartary, a black man with white spots for Persia, a
                        picture of the sun for China, and a cross for Christian lands. Captain Smith
                        followed the grateful sign of the cross for sixteen days in fear <pb
                            id="VAA2409-081" n="84"/> and trembling lest he should meet a Turk. He
                        at last reached Ecopolis, a Russian fortress on the River Don. The governor
                        listened to his story, relieved him of his irons, and treated him so kindly
                        that "he thought himself new risen from death." Here he was a second time
                        befriended by a lady, for he says "the good Lady Callamata largely supplied
                        all his wants."</p>
                    <p>The kindly governor furnished him with letters of recommendation, and he
                        journeyed under the protection of convoys to Hermanstadt, in Transylvania.</p>
                    <p>The countries through which he travelled were so desolate that he says "it is
                        a wonder any should make wars for them." Nevertheless, "in all his life he
                        seldom met with more respect, mirth, content, and entertainment, and not any
                        governor where he came but gave him somewhat as a present, beside his
                        charges, seeing themselves as subject to the like calamity."</p>
                    <p>We do not know how long Captain Smith was in captivity, but it could not have
                        been many months, for he was captured in 1602, and we find him again in
                        Christendom in 1603. When he arrived in Transylvania he was received with
                        joy by his friends as one risen from the grave. He says he was so "glutted
                        with content and near <pb id="VAA2409-082" n="85"/> drowned with joy" that
                        he would never have left his friends here had it not been for his desire "to
                        rejoice himself after all these encounters in his native country." It may be
                        doubted, however, if his roving disposition would have suffered him long to
                        remain content in any quiet life. He next went to Leipsic, where he found
                        the Earl of Meldritch with Prince Sigismund, who gave him a patent of the
                        nobility which he had previously bestowed upon him, and fifteen hundred
                        ducats to repair his losses.</p>
                    <p>Possessed of more money, Smith seems to have forgotten his great desire to
                        return to England, for with this means he set out to see many of the "fair
                        cities" of Germany, France, and Spain.</p>
                    <p>"Being thus satisfied," as he says, "with Europe and Asia," and hearing of
                        wars in Barbary, he set sail in a French man of war for Africa. He went to
                        Morocco, inquired into the causes of the murderous civil wars, and unable to
                        decide which side was the most in the wrong, he refused to join either. He
                        noted the manners and customs of the people, and returned to the vessel in
                        which he had come, resolved to "try some other conclusions at sea."</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith added to his adventures yet one more, for the French vessel
                        sustained a desperate <pb id="VAA2409-083" n="86"/> battle with two Spanish
                        men of war, who boarded her and fired her. They fought thus for two nights
                        and a day, the Spaniards once asking a truce to parley with the captain, but
                        the desperate Frenchman, knowing there was but one way, "would have none but
                        the report of his ordnance." They at last succeeded in beating off the
                        Spanish vessels and making port.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith returned to England about the year 1604. His restless
                        temperament at last found an enterprise worthy of it. Captain Bartholomew
                        Gosnold was endeavoring to awaken an interest in the colonization of
                        Virginia. Captain Smith entered heartily into his projects, and these
                        gentlemen, with Mr. Wingfield and the Rev. Mr. Hunt, by persistent
                        agitation, at last succeeded in interesting men of influence, who formed a
                        company, and obtained a patent from the king.</p>
                    <p>In two years more the energetic Captain Smith was on the way to a country
                        with which he had not as yet satisfied his eyesa land of promise to all bold
                        spirits, a field for the bravest of adventures and the greatest
                    self-denial.</p>

                    <p>L<hi rend="sc">ET</hi> us now return to the colony at Jamestown, where the
                        adventurous Smith was rapidly rising into prominence. But there were
                        murmurings against him. He had not yet discovered the source of the
                        Chickahominy. This river flows from the north-west, and the colonists had
                        received directions from the council in England to explore such a river,
                        since it was supposed that its head might be near the South Sea or Pacific
                        Ocean, and a passage to the East Indies might thus be discovered. So little
                        did the early settlers of America know of the extent of their continent.</p>
                    <p>Even the colony's council reprehended Smith for being "too slow in so worthy
                        an attempt." Accordingly, in early winter Captain Smith and his men began
                        the ascent of the Chickahominy. In a rude barge they penetrated to where
                        fallen trees obstructed the passage. The discoverers only proceeded by dint
                        of chopping away the obstacles. When at last the barge could penetrate no
                        farther, Captain Smith moored her in a <pb id="VAA2409-085" n="88"/> wide
                        bay out of danger, and commanded his men not to go ashore. Taking with him
                        two Englishmen, and as many native guides, he pushed twenty miles higher up
                        the narrow stream in a canoe. The river's head was found in swampy meadows,
                        or "slashes," as they are called in Virginia, but the surges of the Pacific
                        did not roll into it as in the fabled fountain of the Roanoke. Captain Smith
                        was the only man in the colony who did not look for an ocean over the next
                        hill, and a goldmine at every step. On reaching the source of the
                        Chickahominy his first thought was of the present necessity for food instead
                        of a chimerical opening for future commercial wealth. Leaving his two men,
                        Robinson and Emry, with their match-lock guns lighted, in charge of the
                        canoe, he went with an Indian guide in search of game.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the men in the barge made a tour of discovery on shore, and
                        succeeded in discovering some three hundred Indian bowmen, under the command
                        of Opechancanough, chief of the Pamunkey Indians, a tribe of Powhatan's
                        confederacy. The savages attacked them, captured one of their number, George
                        Cassen, and nearly succeeded in cutting off the other men with their barge.
                        They drew the whereabouts of Captain Smith from their prisoner, and
                        afterward executed <pb id="VAA2409-086" n="[]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2409-3"/>
                        <pb id="VAA2409-087" n="[]"/>
                        <pb id="VAA2409-088" n="89"/> him in a most barbarous manner. The Indians
                        then divided themselves into parties and searched the river banks. They
                        crept upon Robinson and Emry, off their guard, or possibly asleep by their
                        fire, and shot them through and through with arrows.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith himself was suddenly beset by the Indians. With a garter he
                        quickly bound his Indian guide to his left arm as a shield, and bent a
                        pistol at his breast to enforce submission. Thus with one of their race
                        between him and their arrows he defended himself with his musket. In the
                        skirmish which ensued he killed three Indians and wounded several others.
                        Their superstitious awe of firearms was increased, and they retired to a
                        safe distance. Captain Smith had received but one wound, though his clothes
                        were full of arrows. With his eyes upon the enemy he started for his canoe.
                        He naturally watched the wily Indians more closely than his own footsteps,
                        and he had not gone far before he sank with his guide to the waist in a
                        treacherous marsh. Still the Indians dared not approach their entrapped
                        enemy until, almost dead with cold, Smith threw away the dreaded weapons and
                        surrendered. According to an agreement between them, they drew him out of
                        the water and led <pb id="VAA2409-089" n="90"/> him to the fire where his
                        men had been shot. While they chafed his benumbed limbs Captain Smith turned
                        over in his mind plans for appeasing his captors. He asked for their
                        captain. They pointed out Opechancanough. With quick presence of mind
                        Captain Smith drew forth the only trinket in his possessiona round ivory
                        double-dialed compassand presented it to the Indian chieftain. The savages
                        all crowded around with eager curiosity. They wondered at the motions of the
                        little instrument, and were still more astonished when they put forth their
                        hands to touch the trembling needle and were checked by the glass. Glad of a
                        chance to astonish them and divert their minds, Captain Smith, aided by
                        gestures and the globe-like toy, proceeded to demonstrate "the roundness of
                        the earth and skies, the sphere of the sun, moon, and stars, and how the sun
                        did chase the night around the world continually, the greatness of the land
                        and sea, the diversity of nations, variety of complexions, and how we were
                        to them antipodes, and many other such like matters." It may be doubted
                        whether much of his lecture was suitable to savage comprehension. Captain
                        Smith's theory of the solar system which was that commonly held in his day
                        was hardly nearer the truth than their own ideas <pb id="VAA2409-090" n="91"
                        /> as to the lights of the day and night. The Indians, however, stood "as
                        amazed with admiration." Nevertheless, within an hour preparations had all
                        been made for his execution. He was tied to a tree, and as many as could
                        stand within range took aim at him. But the chief at this moment held up the
                        ivory compass, and the Indians threw down their bows and arrows.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith was next to figure in the triumphal procession so common among
                        the Indians. The warriors formed in Indian file. In the centre of the line
                        came the chief with the captured swords and firearms borne before him, and
                        followed by the prisoner, held by three great Indians and surrounded by a
                        guard of warriors with arrows drawn. Captain Smith was conducted thus to the
                        Indian village of Orapax. On nearing the town they were met by all the women
                        and children, "staring to behold" the first white man they had ever seen.</p>
                    <p>The Indians immediately made preparations for a dance. Their heads and
                        shoulders were painted a "scarlet-like color," which "made an exceeding
                        handsome show." Every one wore his ornament, a bird's skin dried, with wings
                        spread, pieces of copper, white shells, a long feather, or "a small rattle
                        growing at the tavles <pb id="VAA2409-091" n="92"/> of their snakes," says
                        Captain Smith. Each Indian was armed with quiver, club, and bow. They "cast
                        themselves into a ring" around the guarded prisoner, and their chief
                        "dancing in such several postures," and singing, yelling, and screeching so
                        wildly that Captain Smith must have felt that he was indeed among demons.
                        Three such dances had been performed when the prisoner was taken to the long
                        house for refreshment. He was guarded by thirty or forty Indians, and enough
                        bread and venison was brought him to have supplied twenty men. His captors
                        probably felt the same interest that people in a menagerie have in seeing
                        the animals feed. The English, however, knew little of the practices of the
                        North American Indian, and Smith had a strong suspicion that he was to be
                        fattened for a cannibal meal. In spite of the long fast and tempting food,
                        he says that he thinks "his stomacke at that time was not very good." What
                        he left was put in two baskets, tied up over his head, and served to him
                        again about midnight. In the morning fresh food was brought, while the
                        Indians who had refused to eat with him heretofore ate what had been left
                        from his previous meals.</p>
                    <p>The weather was extremely cold, and an Indian named Maocassater presented
                        Captain Smith <pb id="VAA2409-092" n="93"/> with a mantle in return for some
                        beads and toys which he had given him on the arrival of the colony in
                        Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Two days after this an Indian, whose son was dying with a wound Smith had
                        inflicted in his skirmish with the savages, would have killed the Captain
                        had not the guard defended him. Captain Smith was believed to be a
                        wonder-worker far superior to their priests or medicine-men. He was taken to
                        the bedside of the dying savage to effect a cure. He told the Indians that
                        he would go to Jamestown and get a water which would heal the man, but the
                        savages were not to be thus outwitted.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith trembled to hear the Indians discuss plans for the destruction
                        of Jamestown. Preparations were being made for this purpose, and the Indians
                        consulted Smith about it. If he would assist them he was offered life,
                        liberty, and wives. Captain Smith, however, romanced about the dangers they
                        would meet with in attacking Jamestown, dilating upon the great guns, secret
                        mines, and other engines of death. He asked permission to send messengers to
                        Jamestown, who might confirm his story. His request was complied with, and
                        tearing a leaf from his memorandum book, he wrote a note to <pb
                            id="VAA2409-093" n="94"/> the colonists informing them of the danger of
                        an attack, giving them directions as to how they should terrify the bearers
                        of the note, and instructing them to send him some articles of which he gave
                        a list. He intrusted this note for deliverance to the messengers who were
                        not suspicious that it could betray their own plans, and told them just what
                        the colonists would do, what would happen to them, and what articles they
                        would send. The messengers were much frightened by his description of the
                        engines of death in possession of the whites. Still they undertook the
                        journey in the bitter cold of an unusual winter.</p>
                    <p>In Jamestown Captain Smith was believed to be dead. The men with the barge
                        returning home had told the story of their attack, and of the probable death
                        of Captain Smith and his two companions. This intrepid soldier was mourned
                        as heartily as he had been detested. When the Indian messengers neared
                        Jamestown they saw men sally out to meet them as Smith had told them. This
                        fulfilment of the first item in his prophecy so frightened them that,
                        dreading the explosive nature of the ground in the neighborhood of
                        Jamestown, and fearing the supernatural weapons of the English, they were
                        panic-stricken, <pb id="VAA2409-094" n="95"/> and fled, leaving their note
                        behind them. When night came on, however, they crept cautiously to the spot
                        where Captain Smith had told them they would find an answer. There were the
                        very articles he had promised them. Taking them, they returned home "with no
                        small expedition." At the account of their adventures, and the sight of the
                        promised trinkets, the Indians were all wonderstruck, concluding "that he
                        could either divine or the paper could speak."</p>
                    <p>They now gave up all idea of attacking Jamestown, and led Smith from village
                        to village in a triumphal procession. Having thus traversed the dominions of
                        a number of tribes, he was brought back to the seat of the chief of
                        Pamunkey. Here he was put through a ceremony intended to discover whether he
                        meant them good or evil.</p>
                    <p>Early in the morning a great fire was built in a "long house," probably the
                        council house. Two mats were spread upon the ground, upon one of which the
                        prisoner was seated; his guard retired, and he was left alone. "Presently
                        came skipping in a great grim fellow, all painted over with coal mingled
                        with oil." He was adorned with "many snakes' and weasels' skins stuffed with
                        moss, and <pb id="VAA2409-095" n="96"/> all their tails tied together, so as
                        they met on the crown of his head in a tassel, and round about the tassel
                        was a coronet of feathers, the skins hanging round about his head, back, and
                        shoulders, and in a manner covering his face, with a hellish voice, and a
                        rattle in his hand." This man was a priest. He began a weird invocation,
                        accompanied by "most strange gestures," and concluded by surrounding the
                        fire with a circle of meal. Immediately three more "such like devils,"
                        painted half red, half black, adorned with red strokes to imitate
                        moustaches, and with eyes colored white, rushed in and went through with
                        "the like antic tricks." These grotesque figures had danced "a pretty
                        while," when in came three more "as ugly as the rest, with red eyes, and
                        white strokes over their black faces." Captain Smith saw a strong
                        resemblance in these "fiends" to Satan, and he must have felt any thing but
                        comfortable during their strange ceremony. They at last sat down on the mat
                        opposite to him, three upon either side of the first-comer, who was the
                        chief priest. They sang a song, accompanied by their rattles. When this was
                        done the chief priest made, with the greatest efforts of gesticulation, a
                        short oration, at the close of which the <pb id="VAA2409-096" n="97"/>
                        priests all groaned, and the orator laid down five grains of corn. Then
                        followed another song, another strained oration, and a groan, when five more
                        grains were placed upon the ground. This ceremony was kept up until the fire
                        had been twice encircled with corn; then in the same manner sticks were
                        placed between the divisions of corn. All day long neither priests nor
                        prisoner ate or drank, but at night they "feasted merrily" upon the best of
                        provisions. Three days was this ceremony celebrated. The Indians informed
                        Captain Smith that "the circle of meal signified their country, the circles
                        of corn the bounds of the sea, and the sticks his country. They imagined the
                        world to be flat and round like a trencher, and they in the midst."</p>
                    <p>The Indians one day brought Captain Smith a bag of gunpowder which they had
                        captured and were saving until spring in order that they might plant it, as
                        they wished to know the nature of this seed. Captain Smith did not undeceive
                        them, thinking, doubtless, that this was the best use to which they could
                        put gunpowder.</p>
                    <p>The prisoner was invited to the habitation of the chief's brother,
                        Opitchapan, where he was sumptuously feasted upon bread, fowl, and wild <pb
                            id="VAA2409-097" n="98"/> beasts. As heretofore no Indian would eat with
                        him, although they made no objections to eating after him. His fate was at
                        last to be decided. The Indians started with their prisoner for
                        Werowocomoco, where lived the great chieftain of the chiefs, Powhatan.</p>

                    <p>P<hi rend="sc">OWHATAN</hi> was sensible of the pomp and dignity proper to
                        his position as a great warrior, and he particularly desired to impress the
                        English. On arriving at Werowocomoco, Captain Smith was detained until
                        preparations had been made to receive him in state. While the prisoner
                        waited, more than two hundred "grim courtiers stood wondering at him" as
                        though he were "a monster." When Powhatan and his train had had time to deck
                        themselves in all "their greatest braveries," Captain Smith was admitted to
                        the chief's presence. He was seated upon a sort of divan resembling a
                        bedstead. Before him was a fire, and on either hand sat two young women
                        about eighteen years of age. Powhatan, "well beaten with many cold and
                        stormy winters," wore strings of pearls around his neck, and was covered
                        with a great robe of raccoon skins decorated with the tails. Around the
                        council house was ranged a double row of warriors. Behind these were as many
                        women. The heads and shoulders <pb id="VAA2409-099" n="100"/> of the Indians
                        were painted red, many had their hair decorated with white down, and all
                        wore some savage ornament. On the appearance of the prisoner a great shout
                        arose from these primitive courtiers. An Indian womanperhaps a sister of the
                        chief, whom Smith styles "the queen of Appamatuck"was appointed to bring
                        water for the prisoner to wash his hands in. Another woman brought him
                        feathers to dry them, and Captain Smith was then feasted in the "best
                        barbarous manner," and a council was held to decide his fate. This debate
                        lasted a long time, but the conclusion could hardly have been favorable to
                        Captain Smith, since Powhatan was jealous of a white colony which already
                        encroached upon his seclusion at Werowocomoco. During this solemn debate
                        Captain Smith must have felt any thing but comfortable. He did not know his
                        doom until two stones were brought in and placed before Powhatan, and as
                        many as could lay hands on him dragged him to the feet of the chief and laid
                        his head upon the stones. The executioners raised their clubs to beat out
                        his brains. Such a scene was not uncommon in this forest court. From
                        childhood these savage men and women were accustomed to exult in the most
                        barbarous tortures and executions. It is then the <pb id="VAA2409-100"

                        <pb id="VAA2409-102" n="101"/> more wonderful that the heart of a little
                        Indian maiden should have been touched with pity for the doomed white man.
                        Pocahontas, a child of ten or twelve, and "the king's dearest daughter,"
                        pleaded for the life of the captive. But "no entreaty could prevail" with
                        the stern Powhatan. The warriors were ready to strike the blow, when the
                        child flew to the side of Captain Smith, took "his head in her arms and laid
                        her own upon his to save him from death, whereat," says the quaint narrative
                        "the Emperor was contented he should live to make him hatchets and her beads
                        and copper," thinking he was accustomed to follow all occupations. "For,"
                        says the story, "the king himself will make his own robes, shoes, bows,
                        arrows, and pots," while he would "plant, hunt, or do any thing so well as
                        the rest."<ref id="ref_03" rend="super" target="note_03" targOrder="U">*</ref>

                    </p>
                    <p>Powhatan did not long detain Captain Smith for such trivial uses as making
                        trinkets for Pocahontas. It had become the desire of his heart to possess
                        the powerful weapons and tools of the English. He saw that a friend in
                        Jamestown would be a good thing, and he perhaps hoped from friendly commerce
                        with the colony to acquire ascendancy over other Indian tribes. He took
                        occasion to express his wishes to Captain Smith in a curious <pb
                            id="VAA2409-103" n="102"/> manner. Two days after his rescue from death
                        he had the captive taken to one of his arbor-like buildings in the woods,
                        and left alone upon a mat by the fire. The house was curtained off in the
                        centre with a mat. Soon a most doleful noise came from behind the mat, and
                        Powhatan, disguised in "the most fearfullest manner," and looking "more like
                        a devil than a man," entered, with some two hundred Indians, painted black.
                        The outcome of this impressive ceremony was that Powhatan told Captain Smith
                        that they were now friends, and that he would presently send him home, and
                        that when he arrived at Jamestown he must send him two great guns and a
                        grindstone. In return he said he would give him the country of Capahowosick,
                        and would always consider him his son. Captain Smith was accordingly sent to
                        Jamestown with twelve guides. The Indians delayed on their journey, though
                        the distance was short. They camped in the woods one night, and feasted
                        sumptuously; but Captain Smith was in constant fear of his life still,
                        "expecting every hour to be put to one death or another." He was, however,
                        led in safety to the fort. Here he treated his savage guides with great
                        hospitality, and showed Rawhunt, a trusty servant of Powhatan, two
                        demi-culverins (long <pb id="VAA2409-104" n="103"/> cannons carrying a
                        nine-pound shot), and a mill-stone to carry to his chief. The Indians,
                        however, "found them somewhat too heavy." For their benefit, Captain Smith
                        had the guns loaded with stones, and discharged among the boughs of trees
                        covered with icicles. The crashing fall of the ice-laden limbs so frightened
                        the Indians that they fled, "half dead with fear," and it was some time
                        before they could be induced to return. Presents of various toys were given
                        them for Powhatan and his family, and they went away satisfied.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith found Jamestown "all in a combustion," and the strongest
                        faction again about to desert with the little vessel. He affirms that for
                        the third time he forced them with cannon and musket-shot "to stay or sink."
                        At the same time he was tried under the Levitical law for the death of
                        Robinson and Emry, who had been killed on his Pamunkey expedition. On this
                        trumped-up charge the President and some others sought to put him to death.
                        The matter was ended, however, by the arrival of Captain Newport.</p>
                    <p>Such were the miserable squabbles of the forty surviving colonists. Among
                        these homesick, suffering, and desperate men one cannot pretend <pb
                            id="VAA2409-105" n="104"/> to judge. It is natural that their statements
                        should vary greatly, and one now finds it hard to decide what were the
                        facts. But it is certain that to John Smith must be ascribed the credit of
                        enforcing order with the rough hand of a soldier, while good Mr. Hunt strove
                        to smooth the ruffled waters; and there were those in the colony who deserve
                        a better fame than to be associated with this story of mutinies and
                        disputes.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the despairing spirits of the colonists were revived by Captain
                        Smith's account of the state and bounty of Powhatan, and above all by the
                        "love of Pocahontas." The story of her rescue of Smith may be doubted, but
                        there can be no doubt that she saved the colony from starvation. Every four
                        or five days this Indian child, with her attendants, would cross the river
                        and come to the fort with provisions.</p>

                    <p>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi> S<hi rend="sc">MITH</hi> had endeavored to impress
                        Powhatan with the greatness of Captain Newport. The Indians already regarded
                        Smith as an oracle. The God of the white man they called Captain Smith's
                        God, and their respect for him was increased when Newport arrived at the
                        time he had predicted.</p>
                    <p>After leaving the little colony, Captain Newport had taken the more direct
                        route across the Atlantic, and arrived at home in safety. It was noted with
                        evident disappointment in England that he had brought back neither gold nor
                        silver. Two vessels were, however, immediately fitted out with all necessary
                        provisions, and one hundred and twenty new adventurers. On the 8th of
                        January, 1608, the vessel under the command of Newport arrived in Jamestown.
                        The second vessel, commanded by Captain Nelson, had been lost from sight,
                        and was supposed to have been wrecked.</p>
                    <p>Jamestown forgot its misery and its squabbles, <pb id="VAA2409-107" n="106"/>
                        and all was joy over this supply of men and provisions, with news from home.
                        The colonists were so "overjoyed" that they gave the sailors permission to
                        trade freely with the Indians. Thus the market was glutted, and it soon came
                        about that what could formerly be bought for an ounce of copper could not
                        now be obtained with a pound of that metal. This "cut the throat" of their
                        trade; but it confirmed Powhatan's opinion of the greatness of Captain
                        Newport, who also sent him presents from time to time.</p>
                    <p>The chief became very desirous of meeting Newport, who accordingly resolved
                        to make him a visit. He fitted out the pinnace, and accompanied by Captain
                        Smith and Mr. Scrivener, a gentleman who had newly arrived, and had been
                        admitted to the council, Captain Newport sailed for Werowocomoco. On nearing
                        this place he began to fear treachery on the part of Powhatan. Captain Smith
                        therefore offered first to visit the chief. He landed with twenty men, and
                        marched for the chief's hamlet. They were obliged to cross a creek spanned
                        by a miserable bridge. The English had some suspicion that it was a mere
                        trap, and for this reason Smith prudently sent several savages ahead while
                        he detained <pb id="VAA2409-108" n="107"/> others as hostages until enough
                        men had passed over to guard the rest. They were conducted by several
                        hundred Indians in safety to the town. Here "Powhatan strained himself to
                        the utmost of his greatness to entertain them, with great shouts of joy,
                        orations of protestations, and with the most plenty of victuals he could
                        provide to feast them." He was seated upon his bed of mats with a leathern
                        pillow embroidered in Indian fashion with pearls and beads, dressed in "a
                        faire robe of skins as large as an Irish mantle." A "handsome young woman"
                        sat on either hand, while twenty of his wives, with heads and shoulders
                        painted red, and necks adorned with chains of beads, were ranged on either
                        side of the house. In front of these sat Powhatan's chief men, and on either
                        side of the door stood a file of twenty Indians with platters of bread.
                        Behind them were some five hundred people. Orations were made, and old
                        acquaintance renewed. The day closed with singing, dancing, and feasting.
                        Captain Smith and his companions spent the night at Werowocomoco.</p>
                    <p>The next day Captain Newport came ashore and was received with savage pomp,
                        Smith taking the part of interpreter. Newport presented Powhatan with a boy
                        named Thomas Salvage. <pb id="VAA2409-109" n="108"/> In return the chief
                        presented him with a servant of his named Namontack. Three or four days were
                        spent in "feasting, dancing, and trading." The demeanor of Powhatan was so
                        "proud" yet "discreet" that the Englishmen admired "his natural gifts,
                        considering his education."</p>
                    <p>The chief and the sea-captain endeavored to outdo each other in magnificence.
                        Powhatan pretended that he scorned to trade as his subjects did.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Newport," said he, "it is not agreeable to my greatness, in this
                        peddling manner to trade for trifles, and I esteem you also a great
                        werowance. Therefore lay me down all your commodities together; what I like
                        I will take, and in recompense give you what I think fitting their value."</p>
                    <p>Smith interpreted this flattering speech to Newport, and at the same time
                        expressed an opinion that Powhatan intended to make a sharp bargain. But
                        Captain Newport, with the reckless open-handedness of a sailor, was sure
                        that he could so astonish the chief with an ostentation of generosity that
                        he might get all he desired from him.</p>
                    <p>Copper, beads, toys, and some cloth "very <pb id="VAA2409-110" n="109"/> much
                        moth-eaten," which the London Company had purchased from the East India
                        Company for this purpose, was accordingly displayed, and Powhatan made an
                        ample selection, valuing his corn so high that the English did not get four
                        bushels where they had expected twenty hogsheads. Words followed between the
                        two Captains, Newport desiring to please the "insatiable savage," and "Smith
                        to cause the savage to please him." Captain Smith, however, "smothered his
                        distaste" of these proceedings, and began "glancing" many trinkets "in the
                        eyes of Powhatan." The chief's eye was attracted by some blue beads. But
                        Smith seemed unwilling to part with them. Powhatan became importunate. Still
                        Smith did not wish to sell them, for he said they were "composed of a most
                        rare substance of the color of the skies, and not to be worn but by the
                        greatest kings in the world." Powhatan immediately became "half mad" to own
                        "such strange jewels." It ended in Captain Smith securing two or three
                        hundred bushels of corn for a pound or two of blue beads.</p>
                    <p>They parted with Powhatan on the most friendly terms, and visited the chief
                        of Pamunkey, Opechancanough, before their return. Captain Smith "fitted"
                        this chief with blue beads on <pb id="VAA2409-111" n="110"/> the same terms.
                        Blue beads had now become so highly esteemed that no one but the greatest
                        chiefs and their wives and children dared wear them.</p>
                    <p>The winter of 16078 was remarkably cold, both in Europe and America. In the
                        midst of its severity an accident resulted in a fire which destroyed many of
                        the reed-thatched cottages, the palisades, and much of the provisions of the
                        colonists. Among the greatest sufferers was the good minister, who had
                        nothing left but the clothes he wore, having lost all his books, the
                        consolation of his hours of exile. What greater testimony can there be to
                        this man's brave character than the simple words that "none ever heard him
                        repine at his loss!"</p>
                    <p>The colonists would still have had enough provisions had not the vessel
                        remained so long as to consume much of the store of grain. The sailors
                        assisted in building a storehouse and a church of logs, roofed with sedge
                        and earth. This building was soon almost washed away by rain. The vessel was
                        loaded with iron ore, sassafras, cedar posts, walnut boards, and what was
                        supposed to be gold ore. The colonists had been attacked by a dangerous gold
                        fever. Among those who had come over with Newport were two goldsmiths, <pb
                            id="VAA2409-112" n="111"/> two refiners, and a jeweller. It was
                        absolutely necessary to return with some news of gold, since all England was
                        expecting such an issue. During the months in which Captain Newport had been
                        absent, the colonistsmen who had neither experience nor taste for frontier
                        life and its hardshipshad taxed their indolence too severely in the struggle
                        for life, and had devoted their thoughts too much to the momentous disputes
                        of the small world contained within the palisades of Jamestown to make any
                        considerable explorations, pick in hand, in search of gold. Captain Smith,
                        the only leader who had made any excursions into the neighboring country,
                        was a sceptic about the easy discovery of gold, and desired only something
                        more precious to the little colonynamely, corn.</p>
                    <p>The indolent colonists now became fired with the desire to send precious
                        metal to England. In the sands of a little stream near Jamestown glittering
                        particles were found resembling gold. It is now surmised that these
                        particles were minute pieces of mica, which abound in the soil of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>No man was to be found idle after that. The largest share of work was the
                        most desirable. The whole colony turned out to lade the vessel. <pb
                            id="VAA2409-113" n="112"/> In the words of their chronicler, "there was
                        no talk, no hope, no work, but dig gold, wash gold, refine gold, load gold."
                        There was so much talk of gold that a "mad fellow" requested "to be buried
                        in the sands lest they should, by their art, make gold of his bones."</p>
                    <p>Among all these happy dreamers of riches, Captain Smith must have been a most
                        unwelcome croaker. The process of trying the gold was carried on in some
                        secrecy. Captain Smith, being admitted to the trial, told Captain Martin,
                        the discoverer of the mine, that unless "he could show him a more
                        substantial trial, he was not enamored with their dirty skill." Rude and
                        rough this sturdy Captain undoubtedly was with his obtrusive common-sense.
                        In the narrative contained in his own history, it is said that "never did
                        any thing more torment him than to see all necessary business neglected to
                        fraught such a drunken ship with so much gilded dirt."</p>
                    <p>The vessel stayed fourteen weeks at Jamestown, consuming provisions, and
                        leaving to the colony the legacy of ship rats. On the 10th of April, 1608,
                        Captain Newport sailed from Jamestown, taking with him the troublesome
                        President Wingfield and Captain Archer.</p>

                    <p>M<hi rend="sc">EANTIME</hi> the vessel commanded by Captain Nelson, and
                        containing seventy of the one hundred and twenty colonists sent out from
                        England in "the second supply," as they called it, had come within sight of
                        the headlands of Cape Henry; but a storm had forced her so far to sea that
                        the next land which she sighted was in the West Indies. Here Captain Nelson
                        put in for wood, water, and repairs. He made a long stay, but was able to
                        feed his men well on the natural products of the tropics.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, immediately on the departure of Captain Newport, Mr. Scrivener and
                        Captain Smith had set to work with the colonists to rebuild the burnt
                        Jamestown. The labor was divided between building cottages, repairing
                        palisades, cutting down trees, preparing and planting cornfields, and
                        replacing the church and storehouse. While all were thus busy, Captain
                        Nelson's ship arrived. The unexpected appearance of the lost vessel, the
                        addition of seventy <pb id="VAA2409-115" n="114"/> fresh adventurers with
                        supplies, and the relading of the ship for her return voyage, filled
                        Jamestown with a new bustle of activity.</p>
                    <p>Captain Nelson himself seems to have been a favorite among the colonists,
                        for, says their narrative in Smith's history, "he had not any thing but he
                        freely imparted us, which honest dealing (being a mariner) caused us to
                        admire him."</p>
                    <p>What should be returned to England in this vessel? Nothing seemed good
                        enough. The authorities disagreed. Captain Martin desired that the vessel be
                        loaded with his "phantastical gold," the President wished to "relade" her
                        with "some good tidings" of discovery and common-sense. Captain Smith said
                        that she ought to be freighted with cedar, which was at least sure to be of
                        some value. To carry out his plan the President ordered Captain Smith to
                        discover the commodities of the Monacan Indians, beyond the Falls. Sixty men
                        were selected for this expedition, and Captain Smith began training them.
                        There was, however, more than enough work to be done at Jamestown, and this
                        plan was abandoned for the time. The colonists seem to have begun to feel
                        doubts of their gold mine, and the ship was finally loaded with cedar.
                        Captain Martin, who had never lost faith in the gold of <pb id="VAA2409-116"
                            n="115"/> his own discovery, returned with Captain Nelson to England to
                        enjoy the glory of it. In July, 1608, the vessel, which had long been given
                        up as lost, arrived in England. It was noted with disappointment that she
                        brought no "novelties" or commodities from Virginia except "a sweet wood."</p>
                    <p>Powhatan looked with covetous eyes upon the glittering swords, the ponderous
                        muskets, and the serviceable pistols of the English. So long as the white
                        man used supernatural bullets and sharp-edged swords, and the red man
                        possessed only tomahawks of stone and stone-pointed arrows and javelins, so
                        long were the English safe from Indian attacks. It was now the ambition of
                        Powhatan's life to obtain a goodly store of English weapons, instead of the
                        rude wooden swords used by the Indians. Savage-like, he went about his
                        purpose in the most crafty way with the most innocent air. Just before
                        Newport's departure, Powhatan sent him twenty turkeys "to express his love,"
                        with the request that the Captain would return the compliment with a present
                        of twenty swords. The good-natured sailor immediately complied with this
                        demand. Powhatan then proceeded to try a similar experiment upon Smith, who
                        received a present of <pb id="VAA2409-117" n="116"/> "the like luggage" on
                        condition of the same return. But Smith refused, knowing it would cut the
                        throat of the colony to put such weapons into the hands of the crafty chief.
                        Powhatan was not to be thus outdone. If he could not procure the swords in
                        one way he would in another. "He caused his people with twenty devices to
                        obtain" as many swords. The Indians became "insolent." They surprised the
                        colonists at their work. They would lay in ambuscade at the very gates of
                        Jamestown and procure the weapons of stragglers by force. The council in
                        England had deemed it the only wise policy to keep peace with the savages at
                        all hazards, and a wise policy it was if it were not carried too far. The
                        orders from this body had been very strict; the colonists were in no way to
                        offend the Indians. This accounts in part for the obliging disposition of
                        Captain Newport, and the patience of the colonists under these annoyances.</p>
                    <p>Thus a "charitable humor prevailed" until it happened one day that Captain
                        Smith was the man they "meddled" with. This fiery soldier did not wait for
                        deliberation. He hunted the miscreants, and those whom he captured he
                        "terrified" with whipping and imprisonment. In return, the Indians captured
                        two straggling <pb id="VAA2409-118" n="117"/> Englishmen, and came in force
                        to the very gates of Jamestown, demanding seven Indians, whom, "for their
                        villanies," Smith had detained. The irrepressible Captain immediately headed
                        a sally in which he forced the Indians to surrender the Englishmen
                        unconditionally. He then examined his prisoners, but they were faithful to
                        their chief, and he could get nothing from them. He made six of them
                        believe, by "several volleys of shot," that he had caused one of their
                        number to be killed. They immediately confessed, in separate examinations,
                        to a plot on the part of Powhatan to procure the weapons, and then to cut
                        the throats of the colonists. Captain Smith still detained the Indians,
                        resolving to give them a wholesome fright.</p>
                    <p>Pocahontas presently came to Jamestown, accompanied by Indian messengers. Her
                        father had sent them with presents, and a message excusing "the injuries
                        done by some rash, untoward captains, his subjects, desiring their liberties
                        for this time with the assurance of his love forever."</p>
                    <p>When Captain Smith had punished his seven prisoners as he thought fit, he
                        "used them well" for a few days, and delivered them to Pocahontas,
                        pretending that he saved their lives only for the sake of the little Indian
                        girl.</p>

                    <p>O<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the second day of June, 1608, as Captain Nelson dropped
                        down the James River, he was accompanied by an open barge of less than three
                        tons burden. She possessed but a single mast and sail, and was also
                        propelled by oars. This little boat was bound on a voyage of discovery.</p>
                    <p>The grand bay which the colonists had entered more than a year ago was yet
                        entirely unknown to them. There seemed a possibility that this arm of the
                        sea might stretch into the western ocean so much sought after. The frail
                        little craft, poorly provisioned, manned with but fifteen "gentlemen" and
                        "soldiers," was to be the first vessel to explore the shores of the great
                        Chesapeake Bay, to enter her many rivers, and to anchor off her islands.</p>
                    <p>The discoverers were gay with hope as they left Jamestown. They even feared
                        that their commander, Captain Smith, would make "too much haste" to return.
                        They took leave of the homeward-bound ship at Cape Henry, and <pb
                            id="VAA2409-120" n="119"/> crossed the bay to the eastern shore. They
                        discovered Smith's Islands, and named them for their leader. Upon Cape
                        Charles they saw two "grim, stout" Indians, carrying javelins headed with
                        bone. These savages "boldly demanded" of the discoverers what they were, and
                        what they wanted. After some parley they showed kindly intentions, and
                        invited the voyagers to visit their chief at his village at Accomac. The
                        English landed at this place, and were treated with hospitality. They were
                        struck with the appearance of the chief. He is pronounced the "comliest,
                        proper, civil savage" that they met on the voyage. Captain Smith easily
                        conversed with these Indians, as they spoke the language of Powhatan's
                        people. They gave their visitors some descriptions of the bay, with its
                        islands and rivers. From here the discoverers sailed, coasting for some
                        distance in and out of the smaller bays and inlets of the shore, while they
                        could see many islands out in the great bay. They "bore up for" a group of
                        islands, but before reaching them they were caught in an "extreme gust of
                        wind, rain, thunder, and lightning." Only with great danger to their small
                        boat did they escape the "unmerciful raging of the ocean-like water." The
                        voyagers named these uninhabited islands <pb id="VAA2409-121" n="120"/> for
                        one of their number, Walter Russel, "docter of physicke;" but they are now
                        called Tangier Islands. The discoverers traversed them in search of fresh
                        water, but found none. Still seeking water, they came to the river now known
                        as the Pocomoke. Here the Indians attacked them at first "with great fury;"
                        but they soon became reconciled to the white strangers, whom they received
                        with "songs, dances, and much mirth." The English searched the Indian
                        villages for fresh water, but could only find enough to fill three casks,
                        and this was described in their narrative as "such puddle" that for the
                        first time they knew what it was to want good water. They dug and sought
                        everywhere for it, but could find none. In two days they would have refused
                        two casks of gold for one cask of even the "puddle water" of the Pocomoke
                        River.</p>
                    <p>They continued their voyage past many low islands to a promontory which was
                        named Point Ployer in honor of the nobleman who had relieved Captain Smith
                        "in an extreme extremity." Here they found a pond of hot water. Crossing
                        from the mainland to islands out in the bay, they were again caught in a
                        storm. Their one mast and sail was blown overboard, and the barge was nearly
                        swamped with water, which the <pb id="VAA2409-122" n="121"/> voyagers worked
                        hard to bail out. They landed on one of these islands, which, from the
                        "extremity of gusts, thunder, rain, storms, and ill weather," the
                        discoverers named Limbo. It is one of a group now called Watts' Islands.</p>
                    <p>The plucky voyagers repaired the sail with their shirts, and again set out.
                        Their next discovery was a river on the eastern shore now called Wighcomoco.
                        As they approached the shore, the astonished people ran in troops from place
                        to place. How strange indeed this great floating boat with its flapping sail
                        must have seemed to the Indians, who had never seen any thing larger than a
                        canoe cross the waters of Chesapeake Bay! Their first impulse was always to
                        resist the incursion of this frightful thing with its pale,
                        strangely-dressed inhabitants. At this place the Indians got into the tops
                        of trees and used their arrows without stint. The boat, however, rode safely
                        at anchor out of reach of arrows, while the English constantly made signs of
                        friendship. For a long time the Indians kept up their one-sided warfare. On
                        the following day they tried new tactics, appearing unarmed, and dancing in
                        a ring with baskets in their hands. The English were too wise in Indian
                        warfare to be drawn on shore by baskets. They believed <pb id="VAA2409-123"
                            n="122"/> that "there was nothing in them but villany," and accordingly
                        discharged their muskets at the Indians, who were all instantly seen
                        "tumbling on the ground" without regard to whether they were hurt or not.
                        They crept into the reeds, where they had previously put their warriors in
                        ambuscade. Toward evening the barge approached the shore. The discoverers
                        landed, but could find nothing of the Indians except their baskets. Seeing
                        smoke on the other side of the river, they crossed over and found several
                        cabins with fires in them, but no inhabitants. The whites deposited in each
                        cabin pieces of copper, beads, bells, and looking-glasses. Early in the
                        morning four savages, who had been out in the bay fishing, and knew nothing
                        of the events of the past two days, came to the barge. The Englishmen
                        treated them so kindly that the Indians told them to wait for them and they
                        would soon return. This they did, bringing with them some twenty of their
                        friends; and seeing that the strangers had kindly intentions, hundreds soon
                        surrounded the boat, each Indian with some present. They considered one bead
                        ample return for all they did. The English and Indians soon became such good
                        friends that the savages would contend among themselves as to who <pb
                            id="VAA2409-124" n="123"/> should bring the strangers water, stay with
                        them as hostages, or conduct such of the men as wished to go ashore.</p>
                    <p>These people made mention of a great nation of Indians called the
                        Massawomekes. Finding the eastern shore low and mostly destitute of fresh
                        water, the voyagers crossed "by Limbo" to the western side, which was hilly,
                        thickly wooded, with plenty of fresh water, and abounding in wolves and
                        bears. The first navigable stream they came to they called Bolus, from a
                        peculiar clay which they found in its banks. This stream is known to us as
                        the Patapsco.</p>
                    <p>Fifteen adventurers had now been confined to this open barge on the rough
                        waters of the bay for two weeks. These gentlemen, unused to such severe
                        exercise, had become tired at the oar, and their bread had been so
                        frequently rained upon that it was quite rotten, though the salt air and
                        hard work had given them such "good stomachs" that they could still digest
                        it. The disheartened voyagers began to despair of an end to the great body
                        of water on which they floated. They begged Captain Smith to return.</p>
                    <p>"Gentlemen," said the Captain, "if you remember the memorable history of Sir
                        Ralph Lane, how his company importuned him to proceed <pb id="VAA2409-125"
                            n="124"/> in the discovery of Maratico (the source of the Roanoke),
                        alleging they had as yet a dog that, being boiled with sassafras leaves,
                        would richly feed them in their returns; then what a shame it would be for
                        you, that have been so suspicious of my tenderness, to force me to return,
                        with so much provisions as we have, and scarce able to say where we have
                        been, or yet heard of that we were sent to seek! You cannot say but I have
                        shared with you in the worst which is past, and for what is to come of
                        lodging, diet, or whatsoever, I am contented you allot the worst part to
                        myself. As for your fears that I will lose myself in these unknown large
                        waters or be swallowed up in some stormy gust, abandon these childish fears;
                        for worse than is past is not likely to happen, and there is as much danger
                        to return as to proceed. Regain, therefore, your old spirits, for return I
                        will not, if God please, till I have seen the Massawomekes, found Potomac,
                        or the head of this water you conceit to be endless."</p>
                    <p>Two or three days more of adverse weather so added to the disheartenment of
                        the voyagers that three or four of them fell sick. Their piteous complaints
                        caused Captain Smith to turn about. The adventurers had not gone far on
                        their homeward journey, however, before they <pb id="VAA2409-126" n="125"/>
                        discovered the wide Potomac. The sight of this "seven mile broad river"
                        encouraged the discoverers, the sick speedily recovered, and all were
                        willing "to take some pains" to know its name. They sailed up the river for
                        thirty miles before they saw inhabitants. They were met by two savages, who
                        conducted them up a little creek. On the banks of this creek numbers of
                        Indians were in ambuscade, strangely "painted and grimed," and giving
                        fearful war-whoops. Captain Smith prepared with apparent willingness to
                        encounter them in their attack. The whites shot so that their bullets grazed
                        the water. This and the echoing woods so startled the Indians that they
                        hastily dropped bows and arrows. Hostages were exchanged, and the Indians
                        became very friendly, saying that their attack had been ordered by Powhatan.</p>
                    <p>Ascending the Potomac further, the adventurers received various treatment at
                        the hands of the Indians of different tribes; and what seemed important,
                        they dug the ground in several places, and discovered "yellow spangles."</p>
                    <p>The Indians of Virginia were seen to use a substance in painting themselves
                        black which gave them the appearance of being dusted over with silver.
                        Captain Newport, supposing this to <pb id="VAA2409-127" n="126"/> contain
                        precious metal, had carried some little bags of it to England. The English
                        knew there was a mine where this substance was procured, somewhere in the
                        neighborhood of the Potomac. The adventurers now inquired for this mine
                        among the Indians. Japazaws, the chief of the Potomacs, gave Smith guides to
                        conduct him to this mine, situated on a creek supposed to be Potomac Creek.
                        The Captain ascended this stream as far as the boat could penetrate. Leaving
                        the barge with several of his men, he made hostages of some of the savages,
                        whom he led by a chain, which he promised them for their trouble. They saw
                        no indignity in this, and were "proud to be so richly adorned." The mine was
                        found to be on a rocky mountain, and was a great hole dug by the Indians
                        with shells and hatchets. The savages put this substance into little bags
                        and sold it everywhere, it being a toilet article with the Indians. The
                        English took away as much of the useless stuff as they could carry. Smith
                        afterward found that this precious something was the ore that we know as
                        sulphuret of antimony, which may be pounded to a black powder. In ancient
                        times fine ladies used this same substance to color their eye-lashes.</p>
                    <p>Several times on this voyage the discoverers <pb id="VAA2409-128" n="127"/>
                        entered great schools of fish, so thick that, in default of nets, they
                        attempted to catch them with a frying-pan "but," says their narrative, "we
                        found it a bad instrument to catch fish with. Neither better fish, more
                        plenty, nor more variety for small fish, had any of us ever seen in any
                        place swimming in the water; but they are not to be caught with
                        frying-pans."</p>
                    <p>The adventurers had many "quarrels, treacheries, and encounters" among the
                        Indians. On first meeting a new party of savages, Captain Smithan admirable
                        manager of savagesalways demanded a surrender of their arms and a child or
                        two as hostages to test their friendship. In their own words, the voyagers,
                        in all encounters with the Indians, had "curbed their insolences," and "lost
                        not a man."</p>
                    <p>Having finished the exploration of the Potomac, and the provisions running
                        low, the adventurers sailed toward home. Smith had some intention of
                        stopping to visit his old "imprisonment acquaintances" on the Rappahannock.
                        The barge ran aground at the mouth of this river at low tide. The men on the
                        boat could see many fish near the reedy bottom. To while away the time as
                        they waited for the tide to come in, Captain Smith began "nailing" these
                        fish "to the <pb id="VAA2409-129" n="128"/> ground with his sword."
                        Instantly all hands were at work, and more fish were "speared" in an hour
                        than they could eat in a day. Smith, however, in taking a stingray from his
                        sword, was stung in the wrist. At first nothing could be seen but a little
                        blue spot; but instant torment ensued; his arm and shoulder swelled, and the
                        voyagers "all with much sorrow concluded his funeral." A man seldom
                        superintends the digging of his own grave. Captain Smith, however, had his
                        grave dug according to his own directions on an island near by. Meanwhile
                        Doctor Russel used his probe and an ointment with such good success that the
                        commander recovered, and was able to revenge himself by eating a part of the
                        fish for supper. In memory of this incident the island was named for the
                        fish, and is still called Stingray Island.</p>
                    <p>From this point the discoverers sailed for home. When they reached
                        Kecoughtan, now Hampton, the Indians met them with wonder. Their boat was
                        loaded with bows, arrows, mantles, and furs. Captain Smith's arm was still
                        in bandages, and another man had an injured shin. This was evidence enough
                        to the Indians that the English had been at war, and they were importunate
                        to know "with whom." The whites, humoring <pb id="VAA2409-130" n="129"/>
                        their fancy, and with an eye to the Indians' respect for those who conquer,
                        told the savages that they had gained these spoils from the Massawomeks.</p>
                    <p>As they neared Jamestown, on the twenty-first of July, the voyagers, in gay
                        spirits, trimmed their bark with bright streamers, and so disguised her that
                        they frightened the colonists, who supposed a Spanish boat was coming upon
                        them.</p>

                        discomforts, the explorers had been happier than those who remained at
                        Jamestown. Here all was misery and discontent. Those who had recently
                        arrived in America were sick, while most of the others had some ailment, and
                        none were able to work. The President was accused of appropriating the
                        public store of provisions to his own private ends, and had caused much
                        discontent by building himself a pleasure-house in the woods, in which
                        unwelcome work some of the colonists seem to have got lame and others
                        bruised.</p>
                    <p>The news of their discoveries, and especially the "good hope" which the
                        voyagers derived from the stories of the Indians that their bay "stretched
                        into the South Sea, or somewhat near it," acted as a tonic. Ratcliffe was
                        deposed from the Presidency, and Smith was elected in his place. He,
                        however, substituted Mr. Scrivener, and prepared to finish his explorations.
                            <pb id="VAA2409-132" n="131"/> The heat of the summer was so great that
                        the colonists could not work, and the captain left them "to recover their
                        healths."</p>
                    <p>All his business was effected within three days, and on the twenty-fourth of
                        July Smith set out with twelve men. The wind was contrary, and the barge was
                        forced to stop at Kecoughtan, where she remained for several days. They were
                        feasted here "with much mirth" by the chief, who was sure another expedition
                        against the Massawomeks was on foot. For while the Indians beguiled the
                        whites with stories of an easy road to the Pacific, the whites duped the
                        savages with lies of another kind, so that each party heard that which they
                        most desired. The English terrified the natives in the evening by a display
                        of rockets. The Indians concluded that nothing was impossible with these
                        strange people.</p>
                    <p>The first night out was spent at Stingray Island. Seven of the voyagers upon
                        the present expedition had but recently arrived in Virginia, and not being
                        acclimated, they were all sick. But six men, including the Captain, remained
                        to toil at the oars. They passed the mouth of the great Potomac and sailed
                        directly for the head of Chesapeake Bay. While crossing the bay they <pb
                            id="VAA2409-133" n="132"/> saw seven or eight canoes of the dreaded
                        Massawomeks approaching them. The Indians instantly prepared for an attack.
                        The English dropped their oars and mustered their force of five well men.
                        The Captain, ever quick with expedients, shut the sick under a tarpaulin,
                        made their hats placed upon sticks do duty in place of them. These sticks
                        were ranged on the barge's side. Between every two sticks a man was placed
                        armed with two muskets. Having thus made themselves "seem many," the
                        adventurers sailed down upon the Indians. This display of hats, with the
                        strange nature of the boat, seems to have entirely demoralized the Indians,
                        for they fled to the shore, and there stood staring at the barge's sail
                        until she anchored right against them. It was a long time before the Indians
                        could be coaxed to approach them. At last two of their number ventured out
                        unarmed in a canoe. They were closely followed by the others as a
                        reinforcement in case of hostilities. These two Indians were presented with
                        a bell apiece. Immediately the others came aboard with presents of venison,
                        bear meat, bows, arrows, clubs, shields, and bear-skins. The English could
                        not understand their speech. By signs they managed to communicate to the
                        voyagers <pb id="VAA2409-134" n="133"/> the fact that they had been at war
                        with the Tockwogh Indians. The English understood them to say that they
                        would meet them again in the morning; but no more was seen of them.</p>
                    <p>The discoverers entered the Tockwogh River, now know as the Sassafras. Here
                        they were met and surrounded by Indian canoes. On inquiry, it was found that
                        one of their number could speak the language of the Powhatan Indians.
                        Through his mediation a friendly parley was brought about. They saw the
                        weapons of the Massawomeks, and the English, pretending that they had fought
                        these Indians, were immediately well received. The Indians conducted the
                        white men to their village, which was fortified with palisades. Here they
                        spread mats for the strangers to sit upon, while men and women welcomed them
                        with dances and songs. These people possessed hatchets, knives, and pieces
                        of brass and copper, which they said they had obtained from the
                        Susquesahanocs (Susquehannas), a mighty people who dwelt upon the river of
                        this name, two days' journey above the Falls. These people were also mortal
                        enemies of the Massawomeks. Being desirous of discovering the commodities of
                        different Indian nations, the Englishmen persuaded these Indians to send to
                        the <pb id="VAA2409-135" n="134"/> Susquesahanocs and invite them to come
                        and meet the white strangers. In four days the messengers returned with
                        sixty of these people. They are described in Smith's History as being a
                        "giant-like" race; but this must have been one of those exaggerations for
                        which travellers are famous, and from which Captain Smith is certainly not
                        free.</p>
                    <p>It was customary with Captain Smith, who was as staunch in his loyalty to his
                        religion as in his loyalty to the king, to have prayers and a psalm read
                        every day. The solemnity of this devotion impressed the savages. They
                        watched until the service was over, and then "began in a most passionate
                        manner to hold up their hands to the sun with a most fearful song." They may
                        have thought that the devotion was in some way connected with Captain Smith,
                        for they embraced him, went through more ceremonies, and closed with an
                        oration expressive of friendship. They robed him in a painted bear-skin,
                        placed an immense chain of white beads around his neck, and laid at his feet
                        eighteen mantles made of different skins. The outcome of all this flattery
                        was that they desired him to remain with them and assist them in their wars
                        with the Massawomeks. The voyagers understood the Susquesahanoc Indians <pb
                            id="VAA2409-136" n="135"/> to say that they lived on some great water
                        which, with their ignorance of geography, they took to be either some lake
                        or the St. Lawrence River, where the French had settled. To the sorrow of
                        those Indians the whites insisted on leaving them, but promised to return
                        the following year.</p>
                    <p>In this voyage Captain Smith and his men explored the extreme limits of
                        Chesapeake Bay, all her important rivers and inlets, and named many capes
                        and headlands after the members of the party. At the limit of their
                        explorations up the rivers, the discoverers cut crosses on the trees, and
                        sometimes left crosses of brass.</p>
                    <p>The voyagers found the Rappahannock River inhabited by a people called the
                        Moraughtacunds. Among these they found an old friend of their previous
                        voyage on the Potomac called Mosco. This savage possessed that rare thing
                        among Indians, a full beard. The English accounted for this by supposing him
                        to be the son of some Frenchman. He was very proud of his beard, and called
                        the English his countrymen. Mosco was delighted to see them now, would fetch
                        them wood and water, and with his friends would tow their boat "against wind
                        and tide."</p>
                    <p>Mosco endeavored to dissuade Captain Smith <pb id="VAA2409-137" n="136"/>
                        from visiting the Rappahannocks, enemies of the Moraughtacunds, who had
                        recently stolen three of their chief's women. Mosco represented that they
                        would kill the English on account of their friendship with the
                        Moraughtacunds.</p>
                    <p>Believing that Mosco was anxious to secure all their trade to his friends,
                        Captain Smith ascended the Rappahannock. The discoverers at first found some
                        sixteen Indians standing on the shore, who showed them a good landing, and
                        pointed to several canoes full of commodities. The English, however,
                        demanded an exchange of hostages. After a little consultation, several
                        Indians waded out into the water, left one of their number, and took in
                        exchange an Englishman named Anas Todkill. This man made sharp use of his
                        eyes, being suspicious of ambuscades. He asked to be allowed to go across
                        the plain to get some wood; but the savages would not let him. He managed,
                        however, by degrees, to move back some two stones' throws. He thought he
                        could see several hundred savages behind the trees, and tried to return to
                        the boat. The Indians caught him up, and were going to carry him away, when
                        he called out to his companions in the barge that they were betrayed. That
                        instant their hostage <pb id="VAA2409-138" n="137"/> jumped overboard, but
                        he was followed as quickly by the man who had been set to watch him. They
                        had a struggle in the water, which resulted in the death of the Indian. A
                        volley of musketry enabled Todkill to regain his freedom; but he was so
                        closely pursued with Indian arrows that he fell flat on the ground. The
                        English fought from behind a fortification made like a forecastle upon the
                        forepart of their boat of the Massawomek shields. This had been done at the
                        suggestion of Mosco. Indian arrows rained around the barge for a short time,
                        but the savages soon fled into the woods. Armed with these wicker shields,
                        the whites sallied ashore and rescued Todkill, whose clothes were bloody
                        with the wounds of those who had held him captive. The English captured the
                        canoes, broke all the arrows they could find, except some that they saved
                        for their friend Mosco. They then returned down the river to the village of
                        the Moraughtacunds, where they presented Mosco with the captured canoes and
                        arrows, and he in his turn received them with great rejoicings and a
                        triumphal march.</p>
                    <p>The next day the voyagers spent in securing poles to the barge's side, and
                        hanging wicker shields upon them. They thus encircled the deck of their boat
                        with an impenetrable curtain. <pb id="VAA2409-139" n="138"/> On the
                        following day the voyagers again set sail for the country of the
                        Rappahannocks. They were followed along the shore by Mosco with a wistful
                        face. He at last mustered courage to ask if he might not go with them. He
                        was taken on the barge. She sailed up the river past three Indian villages
                        situated on high cliffs. They were suddenly attacked by thirty or forty
                        savages, who had "so accomodated themselves with branches" that the
                        adventurers took them for bushes, until their arrows began to strike the
                        curtain of shields, dropping into the water. Instantly Mosco fell on his
                        face crying, "the Rappahannocks! the Rappahannocks!" It was some time before
                        the English could make out that what seemed to be bushes were disguised
                        enemies; but the bushes fell among the reeds at the first volley of shot
                        from the barge.</p>
                    <p>Sailing on up the river, the white men were well entertained at several
                        villages of smaller tribes. While on the Rappahannock one of the company,
                        Mr. Featherstone, an "honest, valiant, and industrious" gentleman, died, and
                        was buried with military honors in a little bay which his companions named
                        Featherstone's Bay. The other new arrivals in Virginia, in spite of being
                        huddled together in a small boat with poor diet, had recovered.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> day after the burial of their companion the
                        adventurers sailed as high as their boat could go up the river. They then
                        landed, set up crosses, and cut their names on trees, leaving one man to
                        watch. The sentinel saw an arrow fall near him, gave the alarm, and all
                        grasped their arms. Looking sharply, they could see about a hundred "nimble
                        Indians" slipping from tree to tree. Arrows now fell thick and fast, but the
                        English found that they also could dodge behind trees. Mosco was most active
                        in the service of his friends. He shot away a quiver full of arrows, and ran
                        to the boat for more. He made so much noise, and slipped from one point to
                        another so constantly, that he impressed the enemy with the idea that the
                        whites had quite a company of Indian allies. This dodging warfare continued
                        for about half an hour, when the Indians disappeared as suddenly as they had
                        come. Mosco slipped after them to be sure they were gone. On his return an
                        Indian was discovered <pb id="VAA2409-141" n="140"/> apparently dead. He was
                        turned over, and was found to be shot in the knee and still living.
                        Instantly Mosco wanted to beat out his brains. "Never was dog more furious
                        against a bear" than this savage against his enemy. The wounded man,
                        however, was taken to the boat, where he was treated by a surgeon who had
                        accompanied the expedition to dress Captain Smith's stingray wound. Mosco's
                        disappointment was alleviated by the Englishmen turning out to help him
                        gather up the arrows which had been scattered in the battle. He soon got an
                        armful, over which "he gloried not a little."</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the prisoner's would being dressed, within an hour he began to
                        look "somewhat cheerfully," and could eat and speak. Mosco was persuaded to
                        act as interpreter. The savage said his name was Amorolec, and gave some
                        description of his own and neighboring tribes.</p>
                    <p>"Why did you come in this manner to betray us that came to you in peace and
                        to seek your loves?" demanded the whites through their interpreter.</p>
                    <p>"We heard," answered Amorolec, "that you were a people come from under the
                        world to take our world from us."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-142" n="141"/>
                    <p>"How many worlds do you know?" queried the English.</p>
                    <p>"I know no more," said the savage, "but that which is under the sky that
                        covers us, that is the Powhatans', the Monacans', and the Massawomeks', that
                        are higher up in the mountains."</p>
                    <p>"What is beyond the mountains?" asked the whites.</p>
                    <p>"The sun," answered Amorolec. "Of any thing else I know nothing, because the
                        woods are not burnt."</p>
                    <p>The English presented Amorolec with various toys, and tried to persuade him
                        to go with them. He, however, desired them to await the coming of his
                        people. He would tell them, he said, all about their kind usage of him, and
                        they would then be good friends, for he was a chief's brother. Mosco,
                        however, advised the whites "to begone, for they were all naught." They said
                        they would remain till evening, however. The English occupied the time in
                        preparing for the reception of what Indians might come, while Mosco sat
                        sharpening his arrows. At nightfall they all embarked, for the river was
                        here so narrow, and the banks so high, that the savages might do them much
                        damage if they were caught here in daylight. Meanwhile the Indian chief <pb
                            id="VAA2409-143" n="142"/> had been gathering his men and holding a
                        council of war, when his spies informed him that the boat was gone. The
                        Indians immediately set out to follow her, and presently arrows were heard
                        dropping on every side of the boat in the darkness. The Indians ran along
                        the shore with wild war-whoops. The English could not make their voices
                        heard through the din; but now and then a musket was fired, aimed where the
                        greatest noise was heard. The savages followed the boat more than twelve
                        miles, keeping up this running warfare. Daylight appeared, and the voyagers
                        found themselves in a wide bay out of danger. Here they anchored and "fell
                        to breakfast." They took no notice of the Indians until the sun had risen,
                        when they cleared away their covering of shields, and appeared, each man
                        with shield and sword.</p>
                    <p>Amorolec made a long speech to his countrymen, telling them how kindly he had
                        been used by the whites; that they had a Potomac Indian with them who loved
                        them "as his life," and who would have killed him had not the whites
                        protected him; that he might have his liberty if they would but be friendly,
                        and as for hurting the whites, "it was impossible." When the Indians heard
                        this speech they hung their bows <pb id="VAA2409-144" n="143"/> and arrows
                        upon the trees. Two Indians swam out to the boat, one with a bow, and the
                        other with a quiver of arrows tied upon his head. These they presented to
                        Captain Smith, who received them kindly and told them that if the three
                        other chiefs among them would also give up their bows and arrows in token of
                        friendship, that the great king of his world, whose men he and his
                        companions were, would be their friend. This was immediately agreed to. The
                        English landed on a low point of land. The four chiefs received Amorolec,
                        and were ready to give the white men whatever they had. They were much
                        astonished at the commodities of the English, and supposed their pistols to
                        be pipes. They desired some of these, but the voyagers contented them with
                        more harmless toys. These Indians, who were Mannahoacs, parted with the
                        English on the most friendly terms.</p>
                    <p>In their return down the river they revisited the villages of the various
                        minor tribes. They were all pleased to hear of the victory over the
                        Mannahoacs, and desired the English to make peace with the Rappahannocks.</p>
                    <p>"They have twice," answered the Captain, "assaulted me that came only in love
                        to do them good; and therefore I will now burn all their <pb
                            id="VAA2409-145" n="144"/> houses, destroy their corn, and forever hold
                        them enemies till they make me satisfaction."</p>
                    <p>The Indians desired to know what satisfaction he would require.</p>
                    <p>"They shall present me," said Captain Smith, "the king's bows and arrows, and
                        not offer to come armed where I am; they shall be friends with the
                        Moraughtacunds, my friends, and give me their king's son in pledge to
                        perform it, and then all King James's men shall be their friends."</p>
                    <p>These Indians sent to the Rappahannocks to meet the English. This tribe was
                        now ready to agree to all the conditions, but the chief did not want to give
                        up his son; for, "having no more but him, he could not live without him." In
                        place of his son he said Smith might have the three women the Moraughtacund
                        Indians had stolen from him. The Captain, wishing to make peace, accepted
                        this questionable favor in this wise: He sent for the women. Then he made
                        the chief of Moraughtacund, the chief of Rappahannock, and Mosco stand up
                        before him. He told the Rappahannock chieftain to choose the woman of the
                        three that he loved best. To the Moraughtacund chief he gave the second
                        choice, and the third woman was allotted to Mosco. This manner of dealing
                        out justice so struck the Indians <pb id="VAA2409-146" n="[]"/>
                        <pb id="VAA2409-147" n="[]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2409-149" n="145"/> that their canoes were instantly speeding
                        across the water, and those who had no canoes swam across. They all returned
                        in a short time with presents of venison and provisions. A friendly
                        intercourse was carried on until, in the words of the quaint narrative, "the
                        dark commanded us to rest."</p>
                    <p>The occasion was celebrated on the following day by hundreds of Indians, who
                        danced and sang, while neither bow nor arrows could be seen among them.
                        After the manner of the Indians, Mosco showed his friendship by changing his
                        name to Uttasautasough, the name by which the Indians called the whites. At
                        parting, the Indians promised ever to be friendly, and to plant corn
                        especially for the strangers, who on their part promised to provide
                        hatchets, beads, and copper for the Indians. The boat pushed off with a
                        volley of shot, while the Indians gave a great shout.</p>
                    <p>They next sailed up the Pianketank River as far as it was navigable. The
                        inhabitants were nearly all absent on a hunting expedition. The voyagers saw
                        only a few old men, women, and children tending corn. Like all other Indians
                        whom they had met on their voyages, these people promised them corn when
                        they should choose to come for it.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-150" n="146"/>
                    <p>The barge was caught in a dead calm. The voyagers were obliged to make their
                        way by rowing toward Point Comfort. They anchored for the night in Gosnold's
                        Bay. Suddenly, in the night, they were struck by a thunder-storm. Their
                        cable broke, and they drove before the wind. Only by "the flashes of fire
                        from heaven" could they keep off of the "splitting shore." They "never
                        thought more to have seen Jamestown." But by the assistance of the lightning
                        they succeeded in finding Point Comfort in safety.</p>
                    <p>After "refreshing" themselves, the voyagers resolved to complete their
                        discoveries by seeking their nearer neighbors, the Chesapeake and Nansemond
                        Indians. They sailed up the Chesapeake, now Elizabeth, River, a tributary of
                        the James River. After proceeding six or seven miles they saw some
                        cornfields and cabins, but no inhabitants. The river was very narrow, and
                        the discoverers returned to the James River, hoping to find some of the
                        natives. They coasted the shore until they came to the Nansemond River. At
                        the mouth of this stream six or seven savages were busy making weirs for
                        fishing. They fled when they saw the barge. The voyagers landed, and laid
                        some toys where the Indians had been at <pb id="VAA2409-151" n="147"/> work.
                        They pushed off again; but they had not gone far before the Indians
                        returned, and seeing the toys, began to dance and sing, endeavoring to
                        recall the whites. Thus friendly intercourse began. One Indian desired that
                        the Englishmen should visit his cabin up the Nansemond River. He voluntarily
                        boarded the barge to direct them, while the others ran along the shore.
                        After sailing seven or eight miles they came to an island on which was the
                        Indian's cabin, surrounded by cornfields. The savage said that the people
                        were all gone hunting. The English gave him and his family various presents,
                        with which they seemed much delighted. The other Indians now asked the
                        whites to go a little further up the river and see their homes. To this they
                        consented, the first Indian leaving them here, and the others accompanying
                        the barge in a canoe. They passed on up the river by the island, and to
                        where the stream was very narrow. The English now became a little
                        suspicious. They asked the Indians to come on board the barge. They answered
                        that they would when they had got their bows and arrows. They got ashore,
                        and arming themselves, tried to persuade the whites to proceed up the river.
                        The whites, on the other hand, tried to persuade the Indians <pb
                            id="VAA2409-152" n="148"/> either to enter their own canoe or to come on
                        to the barge. They refused, and the adventurers begin "to prepare for the
                        worst." They started on up the river, and had not gone far when they found
                        themselves followed by seven or eight canoes. Presently from each bank of
                        the narrow stream came arrows thick and fast. The English immediately turned
                        about to sail for a wider part of the stream. The Indians in the canoes had
                        also been shooting their arrows, but the white men "bestowed so many shot
                        amongst them" that the Indians all leaped overboard and swam ashore, with
                        the exception of two or three, who escaped by swift rowing. The English soon
                        reached a more open spot, and the Indians found that shot could reach
                        farther than arrows. They speedily disappeared in the woods. Having thus
                        escaped an Indian "trap," laid and baited with Indian treachery, the English
                        seized the deserted canoes for booty, and examined their own injuries. They
                        were not serious, Anthony Bagnall having been wounded in the hat, and
                        another man in the sleeve. There were evidently many Indians concerned in
                        this attack, and it was rightly concluded that the Chesapeakes and
                        Nansemonds were banded together. A council of war was held on board the
                        barge "to bethink" whether it <pb id="VAA2409-153" n="149"/> were better to
                        burn the cornfields on the island, or to try to make some peace with the
                        Indians. The conclusion was to set fire to the island when night came.
                        Meanwhile the English began to cut the canoes in pieces, and the Indians
                        speedily began to lay down their bows and arrows. The savages made signs of
                        peace. The English told them that they would make peace if they would
                        deliver up the chief's bow and arrows, present them with a string of pearls,
                        and give them four hundred baskets of corn when they came again. The Indians
                        expressed their willingness to comply if they had but a canoe. One was set
                        adrift. Savages swam to get it, and the whites said they would keep on
                        cutting up the other boats until the Indians performed their promise. The
                        Indians cried to them not to do this, for they would keep their promise,
                        which they did. Basket after basket was brought, until the barge was well
                        loaded for the good of the colony. On the seventh of September the
                        discoverers arrived safely at Jamestown. They estimated that in these two
                        expeditions they had travelled about three thousand miles, though it is
                        quite likely that the weary men naturally overestimated the distance they
                        had traversed. From what he learned on this voyage, Captain Smith prepared a
                            <pb id="VAA2409-154" n="150"/> wonderfully good map of Chesapeake Bay
                        and the tributary rivers. The narratives of these two voyages given in
                        Smith's history are signed by men who were members of the expedition.</p>
                    <p>One cannot refrain from admiring in these brave men and their captain the
                        fortitude and persistence that they showed, and the wonderful tact with
                        which they managed the natives.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> discoverers found on their return that many of the
                        colonists had died, some had recovered, and others were still sick. The late
                        president, Captain Ratcliffe, had been imprisoned for "mutiny," while Mr.
                        Scrivener had fulfilled his trust faithfully. Under his direction the corn
                        harvest had been gathered, though much of the colony's provision was spoiled
                        by the leakage of their poor storehouse. On the tenth of September Captain
                        Smith was installed as president. He governed the colony wisely. His
                        measures were doubtless severe, but severity was necessary among these men,
                        totally unqualified for a frontier life, with an unwise management in
                        England, and endless discontent and jealousy at Jamestown. Into the merits
                        of the childish squabbles of the colonists, which have perpetuated
                        themselves in their writings, and broken out afresh among historians in our
                        time, we cannot enter. Doubtless there was some wrong on all <pb
                            id="VAA2409-156" n="152"/> sides. Men shut up together in hard
                        circumstances are sure to fall out.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith went energetically to work to better the condition of the
                        colony. Jamestown was once more the scene of busy activity. Church and
                        storehouse were repaired, new houses built for more supplies, and the fort
                        altered in form. The soldiers were drilled every day upon a plain called
                        Smithfield. Here crowds of Indians would gather to watch with wonder the
                        Englishmen shoot at a mark.</p>
                    <p>It was now the season to trade for corn with the Indians. The boats were
                        prepared, and George Percy was sent on a trading expedition. They had not
                        gone far, however, before they met Captain Newport with the second supply
                        from England. He brought Percy's company back to Jamestown with him, as he
                        had planned a voyage of discovery.</p>
                    <p>Captain Newport had undertaken to return to England with either a lump of
                        gold, the discovery of a passage to the South Sea, or one of the lost colony
                        of Roanoke. The folly of the council in their management of a far distant
                        colony was made very manifest in this second supply. A crown was sent over
                        with which Powhatan was to be crowned, and a basin and ewer, bed, bed <pb
                            id="VAA2409-157" n="153"/> stead, and suit of scarlet clothes, as
                        presents to the American king. Captain Newport also brought a great
                        cumbersome boat, which the colonists were to carry across the Blue Ridge and
                        launch in the South Sea. As heretofore, most of the newly arrived
                        adventurers were white-handed gentlemen. The first women of the colony, Mrs.
                        Forrest and her maid Anne Burras, came in this vessel. Among the seventy
                        adventurers of this supply were eight Poles and Germans, sent out to make
                        tar, glass, and soap ashes. For the members of the London Company were
                        determined to have some kind of immediate return from the struggling infant
                        colony for the money which had been laid out upon it. As most of the
                        colonists who had gone to Virginia were in expectation of immediaely
                        stumbling on wealth, so most of those who had joined the London Company
                        expected an immediate return for their investment. Newport brought a severe
                        letter from the disappointed council to those who might be in power in
                        Virginia.</p>
                    <p>The president probably wished this supply, with the great boat, basin, ewer,
                        bed, bedstead, scarlet clothes, and crown, safely home again. He spoke his
                        mind freely in the colony's council, which had now two new members, Captain
                        Peter <pb id="VAA2409-158" n="154"/> Wynn and Captain Richard Waldo,
                        "ancient soldiers and valiant gentlemen." He considered it folly to make
                        these presents to an Indian who would be as well pleased with a few beads
                        and some copper. In his opinion, it was unwise to undertake the discovery of
                        the South Sea when it was the proper time to procure food for the winter.
                        Captain Newport, however, promised to procure corn of the Indians for them,
                        and thought that Smith was only trying to hinder his journey of discovery.
                        The council overruled the president; supplies for the winter were neglected,
                        and a hundred and twenty picked men were allotted to Newport for his
                        discovery. The latter was apprehensive that the Indians might take revenge
                        on him for what he considered the cruelty of Captain Smith in his previous
                        dealings with the Indians. The president, to quiet all fears, and to show
                        his willingness to assist in the business on hand, as well as to hasten an
                        affair which would consume so much valuable time, undertook with four

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> the Englishmen reached the home of Powhatan, they
                        found that he was some thirty miles away. They were received by the
                        steadfast friend of all white men, Pocahontas. She sent messengers for her
                        father, and undertook to entertain her friends while they waited.</p>
                    <p>The Englishmen were left in an open space, seated on a mat by the fire.
                        Suddenly they heard a "hideous noise" in the woods. Supposing that Powhatan
                        and his warriors were upon them, they sprang to their feet, grasped their
                        arms, and seized two or three old Indians who were near them. Pocahontas
                        came to them, however, with her apology, saying that they might kill her "if
                        any hurt were intended." All who stood near, men, women, and children,
                        assured the white men that all was right. Presently thirty young women came
                        rushing out of the woods. Their only covering was a cincture or apron of
                        green leaves; they were gayly painted, some one color and some another.
                        Every girl <pb id="VAA2409-160" n="156"/> wore a pair of deer's horns on her
                        head, while from her girdle and upon one arm hung an otter's skin. The
                        leader wore a quiver of arrows, and carried a bow and arrow in her hands.
                        The others followed with swords, clubs, and pot-sticks.</p>
                    <p>"These fiends, with most hellish shouts and cries," says the ungallant
                        narrator, "cast themselves in a ring about the fire, singing and dancing
                        with most excellent ill variety." This masquerade lasted about half an hour,
                        when the Indian girls disappeared as they had come.</p>
                    <p>They again reappeared in their ordinary costume. Pocahontas invited Captain
                        Smith to a dinner which had been spread for him with "all the savage
                        dainties" which they could procure. They tormented the Captain by pressing
                        around him, saying, "Love you not me? love you not me?" While he feasted
                        they danced, and ended by conducting him to his lodging with firebrands for
                        torches.</p>
                    <p>Powhatan arrived the next day, and Captain Smith delivered his message.</p>
                    <p>"If your king has sent me presents," said Powhatan, "I also am a king, and
                        this is my land; eight days I will stay to receive them. Your Father
                        (Captain Newport) is to come to <pb id="VAA2409-161" n="157"/> me, not I to
                        him, nor yet to your fort, neither will I bite at such a bait." He drew rude
                        maps on the ground and described the countries through which Captain Newport
                        intended to pass. "But for any salt water beyond the mountains," said
                        Powhatan, "the stories you have had from my people are false."</p>
                    <p>Some complimentary courtesy passed between the chief and the president; but
                        Captain Smith was obliged to carry this dignified answer to Jamestown.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> presents were accordingly sent around by water in the
                        boats to the haughty chief. Captains Newport and Smith with fifty men
                        crossed over by land, and met them at Werowocomoco. The day following their
                        arrival was appointed for the ceremony of Powhatan's coronation. The basin
                        and ewer were presented to him, his bedstead was set up, and the English
                        endeavored to persuade him to put on the scarlet suit and cloak. The chief,
                        however, looked upon them with suspicion, and would not consent to wear them
                        until Namontack, the boy whom he had given to Captain Newport, and who had
                        been in England, assured him that they would not hurt him. The coronation,
                        however, caused more ado. Powhatan had no appreciation of the honor these
                        people intended to do him, and he could on no account be persuaded to kneel.
                        Long the English coaxed him, instructing him by word and action how he
                        should bow. We can imagine <pb id="VAA2409-163" n="[]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2409-166" n="159"/> agine these English gentlemen dropping on
                        their knees by way of example before the stubborn savage. It was all of no
                        avail. Powhatan would not even bend the knee. His instructors were at last
                        tired out. They contented themselves with bearing very hard upon his
                        shoulders until he stooped a little. The crown was then hastily placed upon
                        his head by three men, a signal was given, a volley of shot was fired from
                        the boats, and Powhatan sprang up in consternation. This part of the
                        ceremony was explained to him, and he became quiet. He now thought it
                        fitting that he should make a suitable return for all these honors. This he
                        did by graciously presenting Captain Newport with his old moccasins and
                        mantle.</p>
                    <p>It had been calculated that all this display would induce the great chief to
                        aid Captain Newport in his imposing expedition in search of the South Sea.
                        The making of these ostentatious presents to a mere savage chief may be
                        attributed to the ever meddling folly of King James, with his belief in the
                        divine rights of royalty. The wisdom of the policy is shown by the fact that
                        Powhatan now refused to give Newport either men or guides for his journey,
                        and tried to divert him from his purpose. His return for the <pb
                            id="VAA2409-167" n="160"/> costly gifts was but some seven or eight
                        bushels of corn. The narrative of these events in Smith's History says that
                        the presents "had been much better spared than so ill spent, for we had
                        Powhatan's favor much better only for a plain piece of copper, till this
                        stately kind of soliciting made him so much overvalue himself that he
                        respected us as much as nothing at all."</p>
                    <p>Newport now set out on his voyage to the Pacific Ocean with one hundred and
                        twenty men led by Captain Waldo, Lieutenant Percy, Captain Wynn, Mr. West, a
                        brother of Lord Delaware, and Mr. Scrivener. They arrived at the falls of
                        the James River, where Richmond now stands, and started by land with their
                        boat. They marched some forty miles in two days and a half, discovered two
                        Indian villages, where we are not surprised to hear that the Indians
                        remained entirely neutral, seized a chief or "king" as they styled him, and
                        led him bound as a guide. They returned on their own path, searching in many
                        places where they thought they had discovered mines. They "spent some time
                        in refining," having "a refiner fitted for that purpose," and returned to
                        the falls, where the Indians, who were anxious to get well rid of their
                        visitors, told them that ships were coming into <pb id="VAA2409-168" n="161"
                        /> the bay to attack Jamestown. The Indians refused to trade, and thus ended
                        the great expedition for the discovery of a passage to the South Sea.</p>
                    <p>Let us not smile too much at the ignorance of the London Company. The
                        Spaniards had found the Pacific Ocean near to the Atlantic at the Isthmus,
                        and the London geographers had no means of guessing at the width of the
                        continent.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">MMEDIATELY</hi> on the return of the explorers, Smith set
                        every well man to work to hasten the relading of the vessel. Parties were
                        sent out to make glass, tar, pitch, and soap ashes, while the president went
                        with thirty gentlemen some five miles into the woods to fell trees and make
                        clapboards. The work was undertaken with a cheerful spirit. Sleeping in the
                        woods was a pleasant novelty, and these gentlemen "made it their delight to
                        hear the trees thunder as they fell. The president lodged, ate, drank,
                        worked, and played with the rest. These amateur woodmen had one trouble.
                        Axes would blister their tender hands, and it often happened that "every
                        third blow had an oath to drown the echo." Captain Smith undertook to cure
                        this "sin." He had every man's oaths counted and recorded. At night a can of
                        water was poured down the sinner's sleeve for every oath which had escaped
                        him during the day. It is recorded that in consequence of this rather sharp
                        method, <pb id="VAA2409-170" n="163"/> profanity became rare among the
                        wood-choppers.</p>
                    <p>These gentlemen were anxious not to be considered "common wood-haggers," and
                        wished to have it understood that after they became inured to it they
                        considered it but "pleasure and recreation." It was said that thirty or
                        forty voluntary gentlemen laborers could do more than one hundred of the
                        indolent gentlemen of Jamestown would do when forced to it; but still twenty
                        good workmen would have "been better than them all."</p>
                    <p>When Captain Smith had returned from his wood-choppers' camp, he resolved to
                        make an expedition in search of corn. Taking with him two barges, he went to
                        the country of the Chickahominy Indians. This "dogged nation," however,
                        knowing all too well the wants of the colony, answered all overtures for
                        friendly trade with scorn and insolence. Captain Smith saw that it was the
                        policy of the much-honored Powhatan to starve the English. He told the
                        Indians that their corn had not been so much the object of his journey, but
                        that he had come to revenge his imprisonment and the death of his men. He
                        landed, and prepared for a charge; but the Indians fled. They soon sent
                        ambassadors with <pb id="VAA2409-171" n="164"/> presents of corn, fish, and
                        game, and a desire to make peace. The result was that the boats were laden
                        with corn, and they parted good friends.</p>
                    <p>It is alleged that the sailors while at Jamestown made use of many indirect
                        means for trading with the colonists, getting in this way valuable furs to
                        sell in England. Captain Newport's vessel is called "our old taverne" in the
                        account given in Smith's History.</p>
                    <p>Meantime Mr. Scrivener went on a trading expedition to Werowocomoco. The
                        savages were at first disposed to fight; but Mr. Scrivener managed them so
                        wisely that he procured three or four hogsheads of corn.</p>
                    <p>Captain Newport was now ready to sail with samples of the various commodities
                        which the colonists had undertaken to make, and the president, Smith, wrote
                        a very plain letter in answer to the London Company's letter. This was
                        America's first impudence to the mother country, a defiance that began in
                        her very babyhood.</p>
                    <p>"I received your letter," wrote Captain Smith, "wherein you write that our
                        minds are so set upon faction and idle conceits in dividing the country
                        without your consents, and that we feed you with ifs and ands, hopes and
                        some few proofs, as if we could keep the mystery of the <pb id="VAA2409-172"
                            n="165"/> business to ourselves; and that we must expressly follow your
                        instructions sent by Captain Newport, the charge of whose voyage amounts to
                        near two thousand pounds, the which if we cannot defray by the ship's return
                        we are alike to remain as banished men. To these particulars I humbly
                        entreat your pardons if I offend you with my rude answer.</p>
                    <p>"For our factions, unless you would have me run away and leave the country, I
                        cannot prevent them, because I do make many stay that would else fly any
                        whither. For the idle letter sent to my Lord of Salisbury by the president
                        and his confederates for dividing the country, etc. What it was I know not,
                        for you saw no hand of mind to it nor ever dreamt I of any such matter. That
                        we feed you with hopes, etc. Though I be no scholar, I am past a school boy,
                        and I desire but to know what either you and these here do know, but I have
                        learned to tell you by the continual hazard of my life. I have not concealed
                        from you anything I know, but I fear some cause you to believe much more
                        than is true.</p>
                    <p>"Expressly to follow your directions by Captain Newport. Though they be
                        performed, I was directly against it; but, according to your <pb
                            id="VAA2409-173" n="166"/> commission, I was content to be overruled by
                        the major part of the council, I fear greatly to the hazard of us all, which
                        is now generally confessed when it is too late. Only Captain Wynn and
                        Captain Waldo I have sworn of the council, and crowned Powhatan according to
                        your instructions.</p>
                    <p>"For the charge of this voyage of two or three thousand pounds, we have not
                        received the value of an hundred pounds. And for the quartered boat to be
                        borne by the soldiers over the falls, Newport had one hundred and twenty of
                        the best men he could choose. If he had burnt her to ashes one might have
                        carried her in a bag, but as she is, five hundred cannot, to a navigable
                        place above the falls. And for him at that time to find the South Sea, a
                        mine of gold, or any of them sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh; at our
                        consultation I told them was as likely as the rest. But during this great
                        discovery of thirty miles (which might as well have been done by one man and
                        much more for the value of a pound of copper at a seasonable time) they had
                        the pinnace and all the boats with them but one that remained with me to
                        serve the fort. In their absence I followed the new begun works of pitch and
                        tar, glass, soap ashes, clapboard, <pb id="VAA2409-174" n="167"/> whereof
                        some small quantities we have sent you. But if you rightly consider what an
                        infinite toil it is in Russia and Swethland, where the woods are proper for
                        naught alse, and though there be the help both of man and beasts in these
                        ancient commonwealths which many an hundred years have used it, yet
                        thousands of those poor people can scarce get necessaries to live but from
                        hand to mouth. And though your factors there can buy as much in a week as
                        will fraught you a ship or as much as you please, you must not expect from
                        us any such matter, which are but as many of ignorant, miserable souls that
                        are scarce able to get wherewith to live and defend ourselves against the
                        inconstant savages, finding but here and there a tree fit for the purpose,
                        and want all things else the Russians have.</p>
                    <p>"For the coronation of Powhatan, by whose advice you sent him such presents,
                        I know not; but this give me leave to tell you, I fear they will be the
                        confusion of us all ere we hear from you again. At your ships' arrival, the
                        savages' harvest was newly gathered, and we going to buy it, our own not
                        being sufficient for so great a number. As for the two ships' loading of
                        corn Captain Newport promised to provide us from Powhatan, he brought us but
                        fourteen bushels, <pb id="VAA2409-175" n="168"/> and from the Monacans
                        nothing but the most of the men sick and near famished. From your ship we
                        had not provision in victuals worth twenty pounds, and we are more than two
                        hundred to live upon this, the one half sick and the other little better.
                        For the sailors, I confess they daily made good cheer; but our diet is a
                        little meal and water, and not sufficient of that. Though there be fish in
                        the sea, fowls in the air, and beasts in the woods, their bounds are so
                        large, they so wild, and we so weak and ignorant, we cannot much trouble
                        them.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Newport we much suspect to be the author of those inventions. Now,
                        that you should know I have made you as great a discovery as he for less
                        charge than he spendeth you every meal, I have sent you this map of the bays
                        and rivers, with an annexed relation of the countries and nations that
                        inhabit them, as you may see at large. Also two barrels of stones and such
                        as I take to be good iron ore at the least, so divided as by their notes you
                        may see in what places I found them. The soldiers say many of your officers
                        maintain their families out of what you sent us, and that Captain Newport
                        hath an hundred pounds a year for carrying news. For every master you have
                        yet sent can find the way <pb id="VAA2409-176" n="169"/> as well as he, so
                        that an hundred pounds might be spared, which is more than we have all that
                        helps to pay him wages.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Ratcliffe is now called Sicklemore, a poor counterfeited imposture.
                        I have sent him home lest the company should cut his throat. What he is, now
                        every one can tell you: if he and Archer return again, they are sufficient
                        to keep us always in factions. When you send again, I entreat you rather
                        send but thirty carpenters, husbandmen, gardeners, fishermen, blacksmiths,
                        masons, and diggers up of trees' roots, well provided, than a thousand of
                        such as we have, for except we be able to both lodge and feed them, the most
                        will consume with want of necessaries before they can be made good for
                        anything.</p>
                    <p>"Thus, if you please to consider this account and the unnecessary wages to
                        Captain Newport or his ships so long lingering and staying here (for
                        notwithstanding his boasting to leave us victuals for twelve months, though
                        we, eighty-nine, by this discovery lame and sick, and but a pint of corn a
                        day for a man, we were constrained to give him three hogsheads of that to
                        victual him homeward), or yet to send into Germany or Poland for glassmen,
                        and the rest till we are able to <pb id="VAA2409-177" n="170"/> sustain
                        ourselves and relieve them when they come. It were better to give five
                        hundred pound a ton for those gross commodities in Denmark than send for
                        them hither till more necessary things be provided. For in over-toiling our
                        weak and unskilful bodies to satisfy this desire of present profit, we can
                        scarce ever recover ourselves from one supply to another. And I humbly
                        entreat you hereafter let us know what we should receive and not stand to
                        the sailors' courtesy to leave us what they please, else you may charge us
                        what you will, but we not you with anything. These are the causes that have
                        kept us in Virginia from laying such a foundation that ere this might have
                        given much better content and satisfaction; but as yet you must not look for
                        any profitable returns: so I humbly rest."</p>
                    <p>Marvellous good common sense is this! It is the fashion of late years to
                        revile Smith for a boaster. But where can we find prudence and sound sense
                        in all this miserable management but from him? No wonder that he esteemed
                        his service highly; common sense was so scarce in Jamestown and in
                    London</p>

                    <p>C<hi rend="sc">OLD</hi> weather had come, and famine began to stare the
                        colonists in the face. Taking with him Captain Wynn and Mr. Scrivener with
                        three boats, the president set out for the country of the Nansemond Indians.
                        These people refused not only to provide the four hundred bushels of corn
                        which they had promised in their treaty with the colonists on their previous
                        visit, but they refused to trade at all. Their excuse was that they had used
                        up the most that they had, and that they were under commands from Powhatan
                        neither to trade with the English nor to allow them to enter their river.
                        The English had recourse to force, and the Indians fled at the first volley
                        of musketry without shooting a single arrow. The first cabin the white men
                        discovered they set on fire. The Indians immediately desired peace, and
                        promised the English half that they had. Before night all the boats were
                        loaded with corn, and the English sailed some four miles down the river.
                        Here they camped out for the night in the open woods on frozen ground
                        covered with snow. The manner in which these adventurers <pb
                            id="VAA2409-179" n="172"/> of nearly three hundred years ago made
                        themselves comfortable is interesting. They would dig away the snow and
                        build a great fire, which would serve to dry and warm the ground. They would
                        then scrape away the fire, spread a mat on the place where it had been, and
                        here they would sleep with another mat hung up as a shield against the wind.
                        In the night, as the wind shifted, they would change their hanging mat, and
                        when the ground grew cold they would again remove their fire and take its
                        place. Their story says that many "a cold winter night" did the adventurers
                        sleep thus; and yet those who went on these expeditions "were always in
                        health, lusty, and fat."</p>
                    <p>About this time the first marriage in Virginia took place. The one single
                        woman in Jamestown would naturally not remain long unmarried. Anne Burras
                        was married to John Laydon, a laborer, and one of the earliest colonists.</p>
                    <p>Almost immediately after his return, Captain Smith started on another
                        expedition in search of corn. As they sailed the Indians fled from them
                        until they discovered the Appomattox, a tributary of James River. The
                        natives had not much corn, but they divided what they had, for which they
                        were amply requited with copper and trinkets.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">SMITH TRIES TO CAPTURE POWHATAN.</head>
                    <p>F<hi rend="sc">INDING</hi> that the old Indian chief had determined to starve
                        the colony out of existence by a refusal to trade with the white men,
                        Captain Smith, appreciating the desperate extremity, resolved to take, as
                        usual, the boldest plan out of the difficulty. He meditated a plan for
                        surprising and entrapping Powhatan into his power. Smith saw no other chance
                        to procure food, and starving men do not stop to debate whether a course is
                        right or wrong.</p>
                    <p>About this time Powhatan sent a message to Smith inviting him to visit him,
                        and saying that if he would but build him a house, give him a grindstone,
                        fifty swords, some firearms, a hen and rooster, and much beads and copper,
                        he would fill the ship with corn. Captain Smith made haste to accept this
                        offer. He sent some of the Dutchmen and some Englishmen ahead to begin the
                        building of Powhatan's house.</p>
                    <p>The barge and pinnace were fitted up for this expedition. The president with
                        twelve men <pb id="VAA2409-181" n="174"/> sailed in the barge, while fifteen
                        men, among whom were Lieutenant Percy and Mr. West, brother of Lord
                        Delaware, sailed in the pinnace. This party started from Jamestown in
                        December, 1608. They stopped for the first night at the village of
                        Warrasqueake. They were treated very kindly by the chief of this town, who
                        advised them not to visit Powhatan. Smith, however, was determined to go.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Smith," said the chief, "you shall find Powhatan to use you kindly;
                        but trust him not, and be sure he have no opportunity to seize on your arms,
                        for he hath sent for you only to cut your throats."</p>
                    <p>The captain thanked him for his advice, and resolved to follow it. He asked
                        this chief for guides to the Chawonoc Indians. The chief immediately
                        complied with his request, and Captain Smith sent Mr. Michael Sicklemore, a
                        "valiant soldier, with the guides to this place in search of Sir Walter
                        Raleigh's lost company, and silk grass or peminaw." What is said of the
                        people of the lost colony by different writers is quite hard to understand.
                        Sometimes they seem to have been all exterminated, again we hear rumors that
                        some of them are alive.</p>
                    <p>When Captain Smith parted with the friendly <pb id="VAA2409-182" n="175"/>
                        chief, he left him his page to learn the language. The next night the
                        English lodged at Kecoughtan. Here they were storm-bound for about a week.
                        They were thus obliged to keep Christmas at this Indian village, and a merry
                        time they had of it. They feasted upon fish, venison, wild fowl, with the
                        sweet corn-bread of the country, and enjoyed themselves around great fires
                        in the warm, smoky cabins of the Indians.</p>
                    <p>Travelling on from here the English were forced, when they could find no
                        cabins, to sleep in the woods as we have described. During the journey
                        Captain Smith, Anthony Bagnall, and Sergeant Pising shot a hundred and
                        forty-eight wild fowl at one time.</p>
                    <p>At the Indian village of Kiskiack, now corrupted to Chescake, and pronounced
                        Cheesecake, the English were again forced by the cold and contrary winds to
                        spend several days in Indian cabins. These Indians were not friendly, and
                        the whites were obliged to guard their barge with care. On the twelfth of
                        January the English neared Werowocomoco. The ice extended nearly half a mile
                        from shore in the York River. Captain Smith pushed as near the shore as he
                        could in the barge, by breaking the ice. Impatient of remaining in an open
                            <pb id="VAA2409-183" n="176"/> boat in the freezing cold, he jumped into
                        the half-frozen marsh, and waded ashore. His example was followed by
                        eighteen of his men, among whom was a Mr. Russell, who could not be
                        persuaded to stay behind, although he was a very heavy man, and "somewhat
                        ill." This gentleman "so overtoiled himself" that it was with difficulty
                        that his comrades got him ashore and restored warmth to his benumbed body.
                        The English quartered at the first cabins they reached, and announced their
                        arrival in a message to Powhatan, requesting provision. The chief sent them
                        plenty of bread, venison, and turkeys, and feasted them according to his
                        custom. The following day, however, he desired to know when they "would be
                        gone," pretending that he had not sent for the English. He made the
                        astonishing statement that he himself had no corn, and his people had much
                        less; but that he would furnish them forty baskets of this grain for as many
                        swords. Captain Smith quickly confronted him with the men who had brought
                        Powhatan's message to Jamestown, and asked the chief "how it chanced he
                        became so forgetful." Powhatan answered with "a merry laughter," and invited
                        the English to show their commodities. But the crafty chief was not suited
                        with <pb id="VAA2409-184" n="177"/> any thing, unless it were guns or
                        swords. He would value a basket of corn higher than a basket of copper.</p>
                    <p>"Powhatan," said Captain Smith, "though I had many courses to have made my
                        provision, yet believing your promises to supply my wants, I neglected all
                        to satisfy your desire, and to testify my love I sent you my men for your
                        building, neglecting mine own. What your people had you have engrossed,
                        forbidding them our trade, and now you think by consuming the time we shall
                        consume for want, not having to fulfil your strange demands. As for swords
                        and guns, I told you long ago I had none to spare, and you must know those I
                        have can keep me from want. Yet steal or wrong you I will not, nor dissolve
                        that friendship we have mutually promised, except you constrain me by your
                        bad usage."</p>
                    <p>Powhatan listened attentively to this speech, and promised that he would
                        spare them what he could, which he would deliver to them in two days.</p>
                    <p>"Yet, Captain Smith," said the chief, "I have some doubt of your coming
                        hither that makes me not so kindly seek to relieve you as I would, for many
                        do inform me your coming hither is not <pb id="VAA2409-185" n="178"/> for
                        trade, but to invade my people and possess my country, who dare not bring
                        you corn, seeing you thus armed with your men. To free us of this fear,
                        leave aboard your weapons, for here they are needless, we being all
                        friends."</p>
                    <p>But Captain Smith was not to be cajoled into a council without weapons. That
                        night was spent at Werowocomoco, and the following day the building of
                        Powhatan's house ment forward. The Dutchmen seeing the plenty of Powhatan
                        and his power, and thinking the colony could not long withstand the wily
                        chief, had betrayed the English; though this was not discovered until some
                        six months afterward.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the English managed "to wrangle" some ten bushels of corn out of
                        the chief for a copper kettle. Powhatan then made a speech setting forth the
                        advantages of remaining at peace with the colony.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Smith," said he, "you may understand that I, having seen the death
                        of my people thrice, and not any one living of those three generations but
                        myself, I know the difference of peace and war better than any in my
                        country. But now I am old, and ere long must die; my brethren, namely
                        Opitchapan, Opechancanough, and Kekataugh, my two sisters and their two
                        daughters, <pb id="VAA2409-186" n="[]"/>
                        <pb id="VAA2409-187" n="[]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2409-189" n="179"/> are each others' successors. I wish their
                        experience no less than mine, and your love to them no less than mine to
                        you. But this bruit from Nansemond, that you are come to destroy my country,
                        affrighted all my people as they dare not visit you. What will it avail you
                        to take that by force you may quickly have by love, or to destroy them that
                        provide you food? What can you get by war when we can hide our provisions
                        and fly to the woods, whereby you must famish by wronging us, your friends?
                        And why are you thus jealous of our loves, seeing us unarmed and both do and
                        are willing still to feed you with that you cannot get but by our labors?
                        Think you I am so simple not to know it is better to eat good meat, lie
                        well, and sleep quietly with my women and children, laugh and be merry with
                        you, have copper, hatchets, or what I want being your friend, than be forced
                        to fly from all, to lie cold in the woods, feed upon acorns, roots, and such
                        trash, and be so hunted by you that I can neither rest, eat, nor sleep, but
                        my tired men must watch, and if a twig but break every one crieth, There
                        cometh Captain Smith! Then must I fly I know not whither, and thus with
                        miserable fear end my miserable life, leaving my pleasures to such youths as
                        you, which through your rash <pb id="VAA2409-190" n="180"/> unadvisedness
                        may quickly as miserably end for want of that you never know where to find.
                        Let this therefore assure you of our loves, and every year our friendly
                        trade shall furnish you with corn, and now also, if you would come in a
                        friendly manner to see us, and not thus with your guns and swords as to
                        invade your foes."</p>
                    <p>"Seeing you will not rightly conceive of our words," answered Captain Smith,
                        "we strive to make you know our thoughts by our deeds. The vow I made you of
                        my love both myself and my men have kept. As for your promise, I find it
                        every day violated by some of your subjects, yet we, finding your love and
                        kindness, our custom is so far from being ungrateful that for your sake only
                        we have curbed our thirsting desire of revenge, else had they known as well
                        the cruelty we use to our enemies as our true love and courtesy to our
                        friends. And I think your judgment sufficient to conceive, as well by the
                        adventures we have undertaken as by the advantage we have by our arms of
                        yours, that had we intended you any hurt, long ere this we would have
                        effected it. Your people coming to Jamestown are entertained with their bows
                        and arrows without any exceptions, we esteeming it with you, as it is with
                        us, to wear our arms as our apparel. As for the danger <pb id="VAA2409-191"
                            n="181"/> of our enemies, in such wars consist our chiefest pleasure;
                        for your riches we have no use; as for the hiding your provision, or by your
                        flying to the woods, we shall not so unadvisedly starve as you conclude;
                        your friendly care in that behalf is needless, for we have a rule to find
                        beyond your knowledge."</p>
                    <p>Certainly the word-fencers were a match in subtle insinuation, and neither
                        one was to be caught off his guard. Some trading was again begun. The chief
                        was dissatisfied that he could not have his way.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Smith," said Powhatan with a sigh, "I never used any werowance so
                        kindly as yourself, yet from you I receive the least kindness of any.
                        Captain Newport gave me swords, copper, clothes, a bed, towels, or what I
                        desired, ever taking what I offered him, and would send away his guns when I
                        entreated him; none doth deny to lie at my feet or refuse to do what I
                        desire but only you, of whom I can have nothing but what you regard not, and
                        yet you will have whatsoever you demand. Captain Newport you call father,
                        and so you call me, but I see for all us both you will do what you list, and
                        we must both seek to content you. But if you intend so friendly as you say,
                        send hence your arms, that I <pb id="VAA2409-192" n="182"/> may believe you,
                        for you see the love I bear you doth cause me thus nakedly to forget
                        myself."</p>
                    <p>The wily old chief was right. Captain Smith was determined to have his own
                        way. He saw that nothing could be gained thus. Powhatan was watching with
                        lynx eyes for a chance to get the white men into his power while he
                        delivered those eloquent and persuasive speeches which are so characteristic
                        of Indians. Captain Smith asked the savages to break the ice for him that
                        his boat might reach the shore, to take him and the corn. He intended, when
                        the boat came, to land more men and surprise the chief. Meanwhile, to
                        entertain Powhatan and keep him from suspecting anything, he made the
                        following reply to his last speech:</p>
                    <p>"Powhatan, you must know as I have but one God I honor but one king, and I
                        live not here as your subject, but as your friend, to pleasure you with what
                        I can. By the gifts you bestow on me you gain more than by trade, yet would
                        you visit me as I do you, you should know it is not our custom to sell our
                        courtesies as a vendable commodity. Bring all your country with you for your
                        guard, I will not dislike it as being over-jealous. But to content you,
                        to-morrow I will leave my arms and trust to your promise. I call <pb
                            id="VAA2409-193" n="183"/> you father, indeed and as a father you shall
                        see I will love you; but the small care you have for such a child caused my
                        men to persuade me to look to myself."</p>
                    <p>But Powhatan was not to be fooled. His mind was on the fast disappearing ice.
                        He managed to disengage himself from the Captain's conversation, and
                        secretly fled with his women, children, and luggage. To avoid any suspicion,
                        two or three women were left to engage Captain Smith in talk while the
                        Powhatan warriors beset the house where they were. When Captain Smith
                        discovered what they were doing, he and John Russell went about making their
                        way out with the help of their pistols, swords, and Indian shields. At the
                        first shot, the savages tumbled "one over another" and quickly fled in every
                        direction, and the two men reached their companions in safety.</p>

                    <p>P<hi rend="sc">OWHATAN</hi> saw that his stratagem had failed. He immediately
                        tried to remove the unfavorable impression which this event and the sudden
                        appearance of so many warriors might make on the minds of the English. He
                        sent an "ancient orator" to Captain Smith with presents of a great bracelet
                        and chain of pearls.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Smith," said the Indian, "our werowance has fled, fearing your guns,
                        and knowing when the ice was broken there would come more men; he sent these
                        numbers but to guard his corn from stealing, that might happen without your
                        knowledge. Now, though some be hurt by your misprison, yet Powhatan is your
                        friend and so will forever continue. Now since the ice is open, he would
                        have you send away your corn, and if you would have his company, send away
                        also your guns, which so affrighteth his people that they dare not come to
                        you as he promised they should."</p>
                    <p>The Indians provided baskets that the English <pb id="VAA2409-195" n="185"/>
                        might carry their corn to the boat. They were very officious in tendering
                        their services to guard the colonists' arms while they were thus occupied,
                        lest any one should steal them. There were crowds of these grim, sturdy
                        savages about; but the sight of the white men cocking their matchlock guns
                        rendered them exceedingly meek They were easily persuaded by this sight to
                        leave their bows and arrows in charge of the Englishmen, while they
                        themselves carried the corn down to the boats on their own backs. This they
                        did with wonderful dispatch.</p>
                    <p>Ebb tide left the boat stuck in the marsh, and the adventurers were obliged
                        to remain at Werowocomoco until high water. They returned to the cabins
                        where they were at first quartered. The savages entertained them until night
                        with "merry sports," and then left them. Powhatan was gathering his forces
                        and planning the certain destruction of his visitors. The English were alone
                        in the Indian cabins. Suddenly Pocahontas, Powhatan's "dearest jewel and
                        daughter," as she is styled in the quaint narrative, appeared before Captain
                        Smith. She had come this dark night through the "irksome woods" alone from
                        her father's cabin.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Smith," said she, "great cheer will <pb id="VAA2409-196" n="186"/>
                        be sent you by and by; but Powhatan and all the power he can make will after
                        come and kill you all, if they that bring you the cheer do not kill you with
                        your own weapons when you are at supper. Therefore, if you would live, I
                        wish you presently to begone."</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith wished to give Pocahontas presents of those trifles dear to the
                        heart of an Indian, and such as Pocahontas most delighted in.</p>
                    <p>"I dare not," said the girl, with tears running down her cheeks, "be seen to
                        have any, for if Powhatan should know it, I am but dead."</p>
                    <p>She then ran away into the woods as she had come. Within less than an hour,
                        eight or ten "lusty" savages came, bringing great platters of venison and
                        other food. They begged the Englishmen to put out the matches to their guns,
                        for the "smoke made them sick," and to sit down to eat. But the Captain was
                        vigilant. He made the Indians first taste of every dish, and he then sent
                        them back to Powhatan, asking him "to make haste," for he was awaiting his
                        arrival. Soon after more messengers came, "to see what news," in the words
                        of the story, and they were followed in a short time by still more. Thus the
                        night was spent by both parties with the utmost vigilance, though to all
                        appearances they were <pb id="VAA2409-197" n="187"/> on very friendly terms.
                        When high water came the English prepared to depart. At Powhatan's request
                        they left a man named Edward Brynton to hunt for him, while the Dutchmen
                        remained to finish his house.</p>
                    <p>On an eminence near where Werowocomoco must have been, still stands a stone
                        chimney which is known to this day as "Powhatan's Chimney," and according to
                        tradition is the chimney of the house which the colonists erected for this
                        chief.</p>
                    <p>The English pushed on to Pamunkey in search of corn, hoping that upon their
                        return the frost would be gone, and if Powhatan still gave occasion, a
                        better opportunity might then be found to subdue his pride.</p>
                    <p>If the actions of Smith seem sometimes lacking in good faith, we must
                        remember the desperate position of the little colony entrusted to his care,
                        and the extreme difficulty of dealing with Indians in such
                    circumstances.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> two or three days the barge and pinnace arrived at
                        Pamunkey. The chief entertained them with "feasting and much mirth." The day
                        appointed for trade came. Captain Smith, accompanied by fifteen men, among
                        whom were Lieutenant Percy, Mr. West, and Mr. Russell, marched a quarter of
                        a mile to the cabin of Opechanca-nough. There was no one to be seen but a
                        lame Indian and a boy. The English waited, and the chief soon came, followed
                        by a guard of his people fairly laden with bows and arrows, but with
                        "pinching commodities," upon which they put an enormous price.</p>
                    <p>"Opechancanough," said Captain Smith, "the great love you profess with your
                        tongue seems mere deceit by your actions. Last year you kindly freighted our
                        ship, but now you have invited me to starve with hunger; you know my want
                        and I your plenty, of which by some means I must have part; remember it is
                        fit for kings to keep their promise. Here are my <pb id="VAA2409-199"
                            n="189"/> commodities, whereof take your choice; the rest I will
                        proportion fit bargains for your people."</p>
                    <p>The chief accepted this offer with seeming kindness, and sold what his people
                        had brought at a fair price. He promised to meet the English the next day
                        with a larger company better provided with commodities.</p>
                    <p>On the following day the captain and his fifteen comrades again started for
                        the chief's cabin, leaving the boats in charge of Mr. Phittiplace, captain
                        of the pinnace. Arrived at the place of meeting, they found four or five
                        Indians who had just come. Soon after the chief entered with "strained
                        cheerfulness." He began a longwinded conversation on how much trouble he had
                        taken to keep his promise, with which he took up the time until Mr. Russell
                        stepped up to Captain Smith and said:</p>
                    <p>"We are all betrayed, for at least seven hundred savages, well armed, have
                        environed the house and beset the fields."</p>
                    <p>Opechancanough guessed what Mr. Russell said from the expression of his face.
                        Captain Smith turned to his comrades and discussed the difficulties of the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>"Worthy countrymen," said he, "were the mischiefs of my seeming friends no
                        more than the <pb id="VAA2409-200" n="190"/> danger of these enemies, I
                        little cared, were they as many more, if you dare do but as I. But this is
                        my torment, that if I escape them our malicious council, with their
                        open-mouthed minions, will make me such a peace-breaker in their opinions in
                        England as will break my neck. I could wish those here that make these (the
                        Indians) seem saints and me an oppressor. But this is the worst of all
                        wherein I pray you aid me with your opinions. Should we begin with them and
                        surprise the king, we cannot keep him and defend well ourselves. If we
                        should each kill our man, and so proceed with all in the house, the rest
                        will all fly, then shall we get no more than the bodies that are slain and
                        so starve for victual. As for their fury, it is the least danger, for well
                        you know being alone assaulted with two or three hundred of them, I made
                        them by the help of God compound to save my life. And we are sixteen and
                        they but seven hundred at the most, and assure yourselves God will so assist
                        us that if you dare stand but to discharge your pieces, the very smoke will
                        be sufficient to affright them. Yet, howsoever, let us fight like men and
                        not die like sheep, for by that means you know God hath oft delivered me,
                        and so I trust will now. But first I will deal with them to bring it to pass
                        we may <pb id="VAA2409-201" n="191"/> fight for something, and draw them to
                        it by conditions. If you like this motion, promise me you will be valiant."</p>
                    <p>There was no time for argument; these men, who were the very pick of the
                        colonists, vowed to "execute whatsoever he attempted or die." The Captain
                        turned to the chief and challenged him thus:</p>
                    <p>"I see, Opechancanough, your plot to murder me, but I fear it not. As yet
                        your men and mine have done no harm but by our direction. Take therefore
                        your arms, you see mine, my body shall be as naked as yours, the isle in
                        your river is a fit place, if you be contented, and the conqueror of us two
                        shall be lord and master over all our men. If you have not enough, take time
                        to fetch more, and bring what number you will, so every one bring a basket
                        of corn, against all which I will stake the value in copper; you see I have
                        but fifteen, and our game shall be this: "the conqueror take all."</p>
                    <p>The chief, who was surrounded by some forty or fifty warriors as a guard,
                        tried to quiet Captain Smith's suspicions. He told the Captain that a great
                        present awaited him at the door, and he entreated him to go and receive it.
                        This was but a bait to draw the Captain outside, where the <pb
                            id="VAA2409-202" n="192"/> present was backed up by some two hundred
                        warriors, while thirty more were in ambush under a great tree with bows
                        ready drawn. The president commanded one of his men to "go and see what kind
                        of deceit" this might be. The man refused, and Captain Smith was so vexed at
                        his cowardice, that though all the other gentlemen of the party desired
                        importunately to go in his place, the Captain would not let them. Captain
                        Smith ordered Lieutenant Percy, Mr. West, and the others to guard the
                        entrances to the cabin, and suddenly turning he grasped the chief's long
                        lock of hair and put his pistol to his breast. In this manner he led
                        Opechancanough, trembling and "near dead with fear," out among his people.
                        The chief delivered his bow and arrows to Captain Smith.</p>
                    <p>"I see, you Pamunkeys," said the Captain, still holding the chief by the
                        hair, "the great desire you have to kill me, and my long suffering your
                        injuries hath emboldened you to this presumption. The cause I have forborne
                        your insolences is the promise I made you before the God I serve to be your
                        friend till you give me just cause to be your enemy. If I keep this vow, my
                        God will keep me; you cannot hurt me, but if I break it, he will destroy me.
                        But if you <pb id="VAA2409-203" n="193"/> shoot but one arrow to shed one
                        drop of blood of any of my men, or steal the least of these beads or copper
                        I spurn here before you with my foot, you shall see I will not cease
                        revenge, if I once begin, so long as I can hear to find one of your nation
                        that will not deny the name of Pamunk. I am not now at Rassaweak, half
                        drowned with mire, where you took me prisoner; yet then for keeping your
                        promise and your good usage and saving my life, I so affect you, that your
                        denials of your treachery do half persuade me to mistake myself. But if I be
                        the mark you aim at, here I stand, shoot he that dare! You promised to
                        freight my ship ere I departed, and so you shall, or I mean to load her with
                        your dead carcasses; yet if as friends you will come and trade, I once more
                        promise not to trouble you except you give me the first occasion, and your
                        king shall be free and be my friend, for I am not come to hurt him or any of
                        you."</p>
                    <p>At the close of this boastful speech, away went bows and arrows, the chief
                        was released, and trade began in good earnest. Men, women, and children
                        thronged around the Captain with their commodities. After two or three hours
                        of this business the president became weary. He left two gentlemen, Mr.
                        Behethland and Mr. Powell, <pb id="VAA2409-204" n="194"/> to trade, and went
                        into the council house, where he fell fast asleep. His friends were off
                        their guard, and here was a chance for the treacherous Indians. Forty or
                        fifty warriors, armed with clubs and English swords, crowded into the
                        building. Their haste shook the cabin and aroused the Captain, who, half
                        awake as he was, took to his sword and shield, followed by Mr. Raleigh
                        Crashaw and some others who were present. They charged toward the crowded
                        doorway. But the Indians moved back more hastily than they had pressed
                        forward. Opechancanough with some old men made a long oration, excusing this
                        intrusion.</p>
                    <p>The remainder of the day passed off in friendly trading, the Indians being
                        well satisfied with the payment they got for their commodities, and the
                        English sailed away from Pamunkey with their corn.</p>

                    <p>M<hi rend="sc">EANTIME</hi> two of the "Dutchmen," as they are called,
                        returned to Jamestown, and told Captain Wynn, who was in command of the
                        fort, that they had come for some tools which they needed, and a change of
                        clothes. They procured new arms on the pretence that Captain Smith, having
                        need of their arms, had taken them. They also plotted with some men in the
                        fort, and secured various arms, ammunition, and tools, which they conveyed
                        to Indians outside the fort, who carried them away. By aid of these
                        confederates within Jamestown, to whom it was represented that they would be
                        favorites of Powhatan and safe from the miseries of the colony, there was a
                        constant leakage of weapons for months. Meanwhile, the Englishmen who had
                        been left with Powhatan were in constant fear of their lives.</p>
                    <p>While Captain Smith was still away, a sad accident happened at Jamestown. Mr.
                        Scrivener for some reason desired to visit an island in the river where the
                        colonists kept their hogs, and <pb id="VAA2409-206" n="196"/> which to this
                        day retains its name of Hog Island. The name in Smith's History is sometimes
                        given a more poetical sound by calling it the "Isle of Hogs." Mr. Scrivener
                        entered the skiff accompanied by Captain Waldo, Mr. Anthony Gosnold, and
                        eight more. It was an "extreme frozen time;" there was a violent wind, and
                        the boat was overloaded. She was upset in the tempest, and the Indians were
                        the first to find the bodies. The loss was a great one to the little colony,
                        and the Powhatan Indians were the more encouraged by it. No one could be
                        found to go and tell the sad news to the president until Mr. Richard Wyffin
                        undertook this dangerous mission. When he arrived at Werowocomoco the
                        English were not there, and he could see preparations for war on every side.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wyffin's life was in danger; but Pocahontas came to his assistance. She
                        hid him while he was at Werowocomoco. When he had gone, the Indians prepared
                        to pursue him; but Pocohontas sent them in the direction opposite to the one
                        in which he had gone. After three days' journey, and by the use of ample
                        bribes among the savages, Mr. Wyffin reached the adventurers. Captain Smith
                        made him swear to keep his sad news a secret for the present, fearing lest
                        his men <pb id="VAA2409-207" n="197"/> should become demoralized for the
                        dangers through which they must yet pass.</p>
                    <p>Powhatan seems to have had trouble to persuade his people into any
                        skirmishing with the whites. In the words of the narrative, the Indians
                        hated a fight with them "almost as ill as hanging, such fear had they of bad
                        success." On the morning following the arrival of Mr. Wyffin, the English
                        stopped at an Indian village. At sunrise the fields were covered with
                        Indians and their baskets of commodities. They would not trade unless
                        Captain Smith would come ashore, and they would not on any account endure
                        the sight of a gun. The Captain complied with their request; but he managed
                        to arrange some of his men in ambush so that he might be assured of a
                        defence without affecting savage nerves with the sight of firearms. All went
                        on well until the Indians had beset the Captain and his companions with
                        numbers. The Indians drew their arrows even now with trembling hands, and
                        when the ambuscade was suddenly discovered, they fled precipitately,
                        "esteeming" in the words of the history, "their heels for their best
                        advantage."</p>
                    <p>During the night Mr. Crashaw and Mr. Ford were sent to Jamestown with the
                        barge. This boat, passing down the river in the darkness added <pb
                            id="VAA2409-208" n="198"/> to the Indians' fright, for they thought
                        Captain Smith was sending for more men. The chief sent a string of pearls as
                        a conciliatory present, and promised to freight the ship with food. For
                        several days they flocked in from all parts of the country, bearing corn
                        upon their naked backs.</p>
                    <p>A young warrior named Wecuttanow, a son of one of the principal chiefs,
                        brought the English some food which was poisoned. This would have cost the
                        life of Captain Smith and several others, had not the dish been overdosed
                        with poison. The young Indian was suspected of a knowledge of this affair.
                        Seeing him stand on the defensive, Captain Smith caused a good whipping to
                        be administered to him, and then spurned him as though he thought him too
                        mean for further punishment.</p>
                    <p>When the English again reached Werowocomoco, they found that Powhatan had
                        deserted the place. He did not relish his proximity to the colony. They
                        sailed with all speed for Jamestown, well supplied with corn and deer suet.
                        Those who had been left at the fort had lived upon what provision there was,
                        which was spoiled by rain and eaten by rats and worms, so that it could not
                        have been pleasant diet. The colonists <pb id="VAA2409-209" n="199"/> now
                        found that they had good food enough to last until the next corn harvest.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith appointed six hours a day to be spent at work and the remainder
                        of the day in "pastime and merry exercises." He made his unruly colonists a
                        speech.</p>
                    <p>"Countrymen," said the Captain, "the long experience of our late miseries I
                        hope is sufficient to persuade every one to a present correction of himself.
                        And think not that either my pains nor the adventurers'<ref id="ref_04"

                        </note> purses will ever maintain you in idleness and sloth. I speak not
                        this to you all, for divers of you I know deserve both honor and reward
                        better than is yet here to be had; but the greater part must be more
                        industrious or starve, however you have been heretofore tolerated by the
                        authority of the council from that I have often commanded you. You see now
                        that power resteth wholly in myself. You must obey this now for a law, that
                        he that will not work shall not eat, except by sickness he is disabled, for
                        the labors of thirty or forty honest and industrious men shall not be
                        consumed to maintain an hundred and fifty idle loiterers. And though you
                        presume the authority here is <pb id="VAA2409-210" n="200"/> but a shadow,
                        and that I dare not touch the lives of any but my own must answer it, the
                        letters patent shall each week be read to you, whose contents will tell you
                        the contrary. I wish you therefore without contempt to seek to observe these
                        orders set down, for there are now no more councillors to protect you nor
                        curb my endeavors. Therefore, he that offendeth let him assuredly expect his
                        due punishment."</p>
                    <p>The Captain furthermore made a public record of every man's behavior, hoping
                        thus both by encouragement and shame to better the conduct of the colonists.
                        Meanwhile there was a constant leakage in arms, ammunition, and tools, by
                        means of the Dutchmen's confederates within Jamestown, who, though the loss
                        was known, were not caught until it was too late.</p>
                    <p>The Dutchmen remained with Powhatan, instructing him in the use of English
                        arms. Their rendezvous was at a glass-house half a mile distant from
                        Jamestown. One of the men came here one day disguised as a savage. Captain
                        Smith, hearing of his arrival, went to the glass-house with twenty men,
                        hoping to capture him. He was already gone, however, and sending his men in
                        pursuit, Smith undertook to return alone to Jamestown, armed only with a
                        sword. On <pb id="VAA2409-211" n="201"/> his way he met the chief of
                        Paspahegh, who immediately prepared to shoot the Captain, who, however,
                        sprang forward and grappled with him. The chief was very strong and stout,
                        and he picked up the Captain and carried him to the river. Into the river he
                        jumped with his enemy and attempted to drown him. They struggled together in
                        the water until Smith managed to get a good grip of the chief's throat. He
                        drew his sword, and would have cut off his head, but the Indian begged
                        piteously for his life, and Smith led him prisoner to Jamestown, where he
                        had him put into chains.</p>
                    <p>The Dutchman was also brought in prisoner; but he told Captain Wynn a story
                        about how Powhatan had detained him by force, that he had escaped at the
                        hazard of his life, and meant to have returned immediately to Jamestown, but
                        was only walking in the woods in search of walnuts. He was inadvertently
                        allowed to go with this excuse, though the imprisoned chief confessed to a
                        very different story. Captain Smith told him that if he could procure the
                        return of the Dutchmen he would save his life. The poor Indian did his best
                        to accomplish this, sending messengers daily to Powhatan. The answer came
                        back that Powhatan did not detain the Dutchmen, but <pb id="VAA2409-212"
                            n="202"/> that they would remain, and he could not send them fifty miles
                        on men's backs. Every day the wives, children, and people of the prisoner
                        would come to Jamestown to visit him, bringing with them presents to appease
                        the anger of the English. His liberty was promised him; but finding his
                        guard negligent one day, he made sure of it. The runaway chief was pursued,
                        and two Indians named Kemps and Tussore were captured in the pursuit. These
                        Indians were said to be the "two most exact villains in all the country."
                        With these for guides, Smith sent Captain Wynn to recapture the escaped
                        chief, in which, however, Wynn failed, though he burnt the chief's house.
                        Captain Smith now set out himself, and attacked the Paspahegh Indians, who,
                        recognizing him, threw down their arms and sent their orator, a young man
                        named Okaning, to him</p>
                    <p>"Captain Smith," said Okaning, "my master is here present in the company,
                        thinking it Captain Wynn and not you; of him he intended to be revenged,
                        having never offended him. If he hath offended you in escaping your
                        imprisonment, the fishes swim, the fowls fly, and the very beasts strive to
                        escape the snare and live. Then blame him not, being a man. He would entreat
                        you remember, you being a prisoner, what pains he <pb id="VAA2409-213"
                            n="203"/> took to save your life. If since he has injured you, he was
                        compelled to do it; but howsoever you have revenged it with our too great
                        loss. We perceive and well know you intend to destroy us that are here to
                        entreat and desire your friendship and to enjoy our houses and plant our
                        fields, of whose fruit you shall participate, otherwise you will have the
                        worse by our absence, for we can plant anywhere, though with more labor, and
                        we know you cannot live if you want our harvest, and that relief we bring
                        you. If you promise us peace, we will believe you; if you proceed to
                        revenge, we will abandon the country."</p>
                    <p>Peace was accordingly made. When Captain Smith returned to Jamestown, he
                        found that the Chickahominy Indians had been discovered in various thefts.
                        Among other things a pistol had been stolen. The thief had escaped; but two
                        young Indian brothers, who were known to be his confederates, were captured.
                        One of the brothers was imprisoned, and the other was told to go and get the
                        pistol, and if he did not return with it in twelve hours his brother would
                        be hung. The savage sped away on his errand. Meantime Captain Smith took
                        pity on the poor naked Indian, in his cold dungeon, and sent him food and
                        charcoal for a fire. About midnight the <pb id="VAA2409-214" n="204"/>
                        brother returned with the stolen pistol. On entering the dungeon it was
                        found that the prisoner had been smothered with the carbonic acid gas
                        generated by the charcoal fire, and had fallen senseless among the coals,
                        where he was sadly burnt. The poor brother was heart-broken. He lamented his
                        death with such bitterness that the bystanders were touched. Captain Smith,
                        though he had little hope that the Indian could be brought to, quieted the
                        brother with the assurance that if they would steal no more he would make
                        him alive again. The Englishmen went to work with brandy and vinegar, and
                        the Indian presently came to his senses. His brother, however, was still
                        more distressed to see him quite out of his mind from the effects of the
                        smothering and fright, to say nothing of the brandy. Captain Smith promised
                        to cure him if they would both behave well hereafter. He had the man put by
                        a fire to sleep. He awoke in the morning in his right mind, his wounds were
                        dressed, and the brothers were sent away well pleased with presents of
                        copper. The story was told among the Indians as a miracle, and they believed
                        that Captain Smith could bring back a man that was dead.</p>
                    <p>Another Indian got possession of a great bag <pb id="VAA2409-215" n="[]"/>

                        armor. With a great display of superior knowledge he proceeded to dry the
                        powder over the fire in the piece of armor as he had seen English soldiers
                        do. The Indians crowded around him, peeping over his shoulder, to see this
                        wonderful process. The result was that the powder blew up, killing the
                        Indian and several others, and scorching all so badly that they had no
                        desire to meddle with powder again.</p>
                    <p>These and "many other such pretty accidents," as the writers wittily call
                        them, gave the superstitious minds of Powhatan and his people a good fright.
                        The Indians came in from all parts desiring peace, bringing presents and
                        returning many stolen things of which the English had had no suspicion. Any
                        of their people caught in theft after this were sent by Powhatan back to
                        Jamestown for punishment, and a savage dared not "wrong an Englishman of a
                        pin."</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> peaceful state of affairs enabled the colonists to
                        follow their business quietly and successfully. Tar, pitch, and soap ashes
                        were manufactured, a specimen of glass was made, a well of sweet water, a
                        thing much needed heretofore, was dug within the fort, some twenty cottages
                        were built, the church was covered, and fishing nets were prepared. A block
                        house was built on the neck of the peninsula and garrisoned as a place for
                        trade with the savages, and to prevent the constant thieving and
                        disturbances. As spring came, land was tilled and corn planted. The
                        colonists had started with some three hogs and a few chickens. They had now
                        'sixty and odd pigs,' and it was stated as a great wonder that 'five hundred
                        chickings' had 'brought up themselves' without feeding. Upon Hog Island,
                        which served as a natural pig pen, another block house was built as a point
                        from which notice of shipping might be given. The colonists cut down trees
                        and made clapboards and wainscoting <pb id="VAA2409-220" n="207"/> for
                        exercise. They began the building of a fort as a place of retreat in case of
                        extremity. This place was said to be situated near a river, upon a high
                        hill. There stands in Virginia a building called "the Old Stone House,"
                        situated twenty-two miles from Jamestown, upon a high, steep bluff
                        overlooking Ware Creek, a tributary of York River, which is in all
                        probability the place of retreat which the colonists built. It is
                        constructed of sandstone from the creek's bank and without mortar. It is a
                        very small structure, being eight and a half feet wide by fifteen in length,
                        and has a basement and one story. The walls and chimney are standing, there
                        is a doorway six feet in width, and it is everywhere pierced with loopholes.
                        This little fort is in a solitary, romantic spot reached only along a narrow
                        ridge, deep in a gloomy woods full of ivy-grown ravines. Tradition has
                        connected this building with legends of Captain Smith, Pocahontas, and the
                        hidden treasures of the pirate Blackbeard.</p>
                    <p>The fortress was never finished. In examining the store of corn one day, it
                        was found to be almost consumed with the rats whose ancestors had been left
                        by the ships, and who had multiplied enormously, while what they had spared
                        was rotten. The colonists were driven to their wits' <pb id="VAA2409-221"
                            n="208"/> ends. The Indians, who laid by no store, and were always
                        improvident, had now no corn left. The colonists must either make out to
                        live upon the wild fruits of the country or starve. All other work was
                        abandoned in the search after food. The two Indians, Kemps and Tussore, who
                        were considered such villains, had been retained as prisoners among the
                        English. They had been used to teach the colonists how to plant Indian corn.
                        Having already too many mouths to feed, the English set these Indians at
                        liberty. They had grown so fond of the colonists, however, that they were
                        quite unwilling to go. The natives showed the utmost friendliness in this
                        extremity, bringing in quantities of game and venison. Every exertion was
                        made to supply food. At one time sixty or eighty men were sent down the
                        river with Ensign Saxon to live upon oysters; twenty men to Point Comfort
                        with Lieutenant Percy to fish; and twenty more up the river, but this party
                        could find nothing but acorns to live upon. As usual there were some thirty
                        or forty who provided food for the colony by their own industry, while the
                        others had to be forced to save themselves from starvation. There were then,
                        as now, quantities of sturgeon to be had in the James River. Some of the
                        more <pb id="VAA2409-222" n="209"/> industrious colonists dried the meat of
                        this fish and pounded it, mixing it with herbs, so as to make a sort of
                        bread out of it, after the manner of the Indians, while others would gather
                        roots for food. The idlers wished Captain Smith to sell tools, arms, even
                        the very ordnance and houses of Jamestown, to the savages for food. They
                        were very desirous of deserting the country.</p>
                    <p>The government was now entirely in Captain Smith's own hands, he being both
                        council and councillors. The last member of the council, Captain Wynn, had
                        died before the times of plenty were over. Although the council had often
                        hampered him in his management of treacherous Indians abroad and unruly
                        Englishmen at home, he had a most affectionate feeling for all its later
                        members.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith at last made the following speech to the colonists: "Fellow
                        soldiers: I did little think any so false to report or so many to be so
                        simple to be persuaded that I either intended to starve you or that Powhatan
                        at this present time hath corn for himself, much less for you, or that I
                        would not have it if I knew where it were to be had. Neither did I think any
                        so malicious as now I see a great many, yet it shall not so passionate me
                        but I will do my best for my most <pb id="VAA2409-223" n="210"/> maligner.
                        But dream no longer of this vain hope from Powhatan, nor that I will longer
                        forbear to force you from your idleness and punish you if you rail. But if I
                        find any more runners for Newfoundland with the pinnace, let him assuredly
                        look to arrive at the gallows. You cannot deny but that by the hazard of my
                        life many a time I have saved yours, when, might your own wills have
                        prevailed, you would have starved, and will do still, whether I will or no.
                        But I protest by that God that made me, since necessity hath not power to
                        force you to gather for yourselves those fruits the earth doth yield, you
                        shall not only gather for yourselves, but those that are sick. And this
                        savage trash you so scornfully repine at, being put in your mouths your
                        stomachs can digest; if you would have better, you should have brought it;
                        and therefore I will take a course you shall provide what is to be had. The
                        sick shall not starve, but equally share of all our labors, and he that
                        gathered not every day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the
                        river and be banished from the fort as a drone, till he amend his conditions
                        or starve."</p>
                    <p>Every effort was made to carry the colonists through this period of want. For
                        this purpose some of their number were boarded, so to speak, <pb
                            id="VAA2409-224" n="211"/> among the Indians, where they were treated
                        with the utmost kindness. So comfortable were they, that several of the
                        colony ran away. They sought out the old prisoners, Kemps and Tussore,
                        thinking they would be sure of friendly treatment and an idle life with
                        them. These Indians, however, had no desire to entertain truants. Kemps
                        proceeded to make sport of them for the benefit of the Indians. He dealt
                        with them as the white men had dealt with him when a prisoner. He made fun
                        for the Indians by feeding "the runaway Englishmen with this law; who would
                        not work must not eat." The indolent truants were nearly starved, and
                        constantly threatened with beatings. Nor would this jocular Indian allow
                        them to escape. He at last returned them as prisoners to the authorities at
                        Jamestown.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sicklemore returned about this time from Chawonoke, with accounts of
                        where the silk grass might be found, having discovered nothing of Sir Walter
                        Raleigh's lost colony. Nathaniel Powell and Anas Todkill were also sent in
                        search of the lost colony among the Mangoag Indians, where they could learn
                        nothing but that they were all dead.<ref id="ref_05" rend="super"

                        in the old narrative with numerous adjectives, being an "honest, proper,

                        he admitted that the God of the English "as much exceeded his as our guns
                        did his bow and arrows." He would sometimes send presents to Captain Smith,
                        requesting him "to pray to his God for rain, or his corn would perish, for
                        his gods were angry."</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">ARRIVAL OF NEW COLONISTS AND SMITH'S DEPARTURE.</head>
                    <p>O<hi rend="sc">NE</hi> day a vessel arrived in command of Captain Samuel
                        Argall, a relative of Sir Thomas Smith, the treasurer of the London Company.
                        Captain Argall had come with a load of wine and provisions to trade with the
                        colonists, contrary to the company's regulations. The necessities of the
                        colonists were so pressing that they seized upon Argall's provisions, which
                        they returned to him when they received their supply from England. Captain
                        Argall brought with him news of a change in the London Company, of
                        preparations for a large supply of colonists, and of the appointment of Lord
                        Delaware (La Warre, or De La Warre) to the office of Governor-General to the
                        colony.</p>
                    <p>A new patent had been granted by King James to the company, which now
                        included many noblemen whose influence and wealth had enriched it to such an
                        extent that the third supply sent to Virginia was undertaken on a large <pb
                            id="VAA2409-227" n="214"/> scale. Like all commercial bodies, the
                        company was selfish. It lacked far-sightedness, and looked only for
                        immediate enrichment at the hands of an infant colony, caring little whether
                        the colony succeeded in maintaining a foothold or not, if only the
                        projectors might receive some commercial benefit from these men who were
                        sent into the wilderness totally unqualified for the struggle of frontier
                        life. Hopes were still held out from time to time of the discovery of mines
                        of precious metal or the attainment of sudden riches after the manner of the
                        Spanish. To be sure gold had not been found lying in profusion on the very
                        surface of the earth, and people now saw that it was unreasonable to expect
                        that it should be. Still it was argued that gold certainly must be there.
                        Every thing was done in England to encourage the public faith in Virginia's
                        resources. Among other things, Hakluyt published a translation from the
                        Portuguese, entitled "Virginia richly valued by the description of Florida,
                        her next neighbor." In this book the Spaniard's testimony as to the
                        existence of mines of gold and other metals in Florida was taken to prove
                        that Virginia must also contain precious metal.</p>
                    <p>While the aim of the company at home was <pb id="VAA2409-228" n="215"/>
                        commercial wealth, Captain Smith's mind was set upon such commonplace
                        objects as corn and deer suet for hungry mouths, looking only to the firm
                        planting of a new England in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith's letter, plain-spoken almost to rudeness, was not calculated
                        to conciliate the London Company. He received letters by Captain Argall
                        rebuking him for his treatment of the savages; and it seemed to be the
                        company's desire to take the government from his hands as quickly as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>Nine vessels were fitted out for a voyage to Virginiathe Sea Adventure, the
                        Diamond, the Falcon, the Blessing, the Unity, the Lion, the Swallow, and two
                        smaller boats. Five hundred colonists sailed in these vessels, some of whom
                        were veteran soldiers, though many were dissolute gentlemen, "packed thither
                        by their friends to escape ill destinies." Eight horses were also sent over
                        in this fleet. Sir Thomas Gates was appointed Lieutenant-General; Sir George
                        Somers, Admiral of Virginia; and Captain Newport, Vice-Admiral. Gates and
                        Somers were to govern the colony in the place of Lord Delaware, and each of
                        these three gentlemen was furnished with a commission to take the government
                        out of Captain Smith's hands immediately on <pb id="VAA2409-229" n="216"/>
                        his arrival. But it chanced that they all sailed in the same vessel, the Sea
                        Adventure. Among the captains of this fleet were the old colonist Martin,
                        and the evil spirits Ratcliffe and Archer. The ships sailed from Plymouth on
                        the first day of June, 1609. They had a pleasant voyage until the
                        twenty-third of July, when they were caught in a hurricane. The vessels were
                        dispersed, and one of the smaller boats lost. In the early part of August
                        the Blessing sailed up the James River. She was soon followed by the Falcon,
                        the Unity, and the Lion. Shortly after the Diamond appeared with her
                        mainmast gone, followed in two or three days by the Swallow, in a similar
                        state. But no Sea Adventurer appeared. No one had the authority to take the
                        government out of Captain Smith's hands; and yet it was not likely that the
                        new colonists, under a fresh charter, which did not look to the rights of
                        the older settlers, and led by Ratcliffe, Martin, and Archer, who certainly
                        had no more friendly feeling for Captain Smith than he had for them, would
                        be likely to submit to his rule. All was confusion; the colony was divided
                        into factions: "to-day the old commission must rule, to-morrow the new, the
                        next day neither." It is stated that Captain Smith would willingly have <pb
                            id="VAA2409-230" n="217"/> returned to England; but there seemed now no
                        hope that the new rulers would arrive, and the colony was in a deplorable
                        condition with no lawful rulers, the old commission withdrawn, none to take
                        its place, and the majority of the colonists newly-arrived, headstrong,
                        ambitious, and entirely inexperienced, more determined upon finding gold
                        than anything else.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith resumed the government. He planned a new settlement to be made
                        under Mr. West at the falls in the James River, and another under Captain
                        Martin at Nansemond. His year had about expired, however. He made Captain
                        Martin president in his place; but this gentleman, knowing his own
                        inefficiency, resigned within three hours in favor of Captain Smith, and
                        proceeded to Nansemond. Here he had ill success, getting into a skirmish
                        with the Indians, in which some of his men were killed and his provision
                        stolen.</p>
                    <p>Mr. West's company was planted in an unhealthy and inconvenient spot. Captain
                        Smith purchased from Powhatan the site of his hamlet of Powhatan for the use
                        of Mr. West's company. These men, however, being mostly of the new supply,
                        refused to occupy this new situation. The strong-willed Captain went up the
                        river <pb id="VAA2409-231" n="218"/> with five men and endeavored to force
                        them to obey. They resisted, and Captain Smith was forced to protect himself
                        by a retreat to his boat. He spent nine days attempting to bring the unruly
                        company into submission and trying to disabuse them of their ideas of gold
                        mines and a South Sea beyond the falls. He at last set sail for Jamestown.
                        Immediately the Indians, who did not relish their proximity and the harsh
                        treatment they had received at their hands, made an attack upon the
                        settlement. Meantime Captain Smith's boat had run aground, and the settlers,
                        frightened by the hostile Indians, came to him and gave in their submission.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith imprisoned some of the ring-leaders of the mutiny, and settled
                        the others at Powhatan, which was fortified in Indian manner with boughs of
                        trees, possessed many dry cabins, was in a commanding situation, and
                        surrounded by pleasant cornfields. The delighted colonists, considering it
                        the pleasantest place in Virginia, gave this village the name of Non-Such.
                        But when West, who had been to Jamestown, returned he, 'having bestowed cost
                        to begin a town in another place, misliked it,' and the settlement was
                        removed to its former situation.</p>
                    <p>Returning down the river to Jamestown, an <pb id="VAA2409-232" n="219"/>
                        accident happened to Smith. While lying asleep in the boat his powder bag
                        exploded and wounded him severely. The Captain instantly leapt into the
                        water to quench the fire, and was only rescued with difficulty from
                        drowning.</p>
                    <p>It is stated in Smith's History that Captain Smith's return to England soon
                        after was to obtain surgical aid, while Captain Ratcliffe wrote in a letter
                        at the time that Smith was sent home to answer some misdemeanors. This may
                        also have been the case, since the colony was involved in constant squabbles
                        upon which it is impossible to pass judgment. Captains Ratcliffe and Archer
                        were imprisoned by Smith for insubordination; their trial was about to take
                        place at the time of Smith's accident, and they in their turn would probably
                        send him to England if they could get the power. However that may be,
                        Captain Smith left Virginia in the Fall of 1809, never to return. He had
                        been in the colony a little over two years. At the time of his departure he
                        says that there were about four hundred and ninety persons in the colony,
                        the corn newly harvested, a good supply of arms, ammunition, and tools, with
                        many domestic animals. Whatever were his faults, he had saved the colony
                        from the Indians and from starvation, and had carried it <pb
                            id="VAA2409-233" n="220"/> through some of its worst perils. More than
                        any other man he deserves the title of founder of Virginia. Of all its evil
                        accidents, the colony suffered none that so much threatened its existence as
                        Smith's departure.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> admiral's ship was beaten upon by a fearful storm,
                        which is most graphically described by William Strachey, who was on board
                        the doomed vessel. The people began to "look one upon the other with
                        troubled hearts and panting bosoms;" but their cries were "drowned in the
                        winds and the winds in thunder." Nothing was "heard that could give comfort,
                        nothing seen that might encourage hope. Such was the tumult of the elements
                        that the sea swelled above the clouds and gave battle unto heaven. It could
                        not be said to rain: the waters like whole rivers did flood in the air,"
                        while "winds and seas were as mad as fury could make them." The ship "spued
                        out her oakum" and sprung leaks in almost every joint. This news, "imparting
                        no less terror than danger, ran through the whole ship with much fright and
                        amazement." It was "as a wound given to men that were before dead." There
                        was now a dire fight for life, <pb id="VAA2409-235" n="222"/> Sailors and
                        passengers stood up to their waists in water, bailing with buckets, kettles,
                        anything. "The common sort stripped naked, as men in galleys, the easier
                        both to hold out and to shrink from under the salt water which continually
                        leapt in among them, kept their eyes waking, and their thoughts and hands
                        working with tired bodies and wasted spirits, three days and four nights
                        destitute of outward comfort, and desperate of any deliverance, testifying
                        how mutually willing they were, yet by labor to keep each other from
                        drowning, albeit each one drowned while he labored." Hope was almost gone
                        with the exhausted passengers. Some even drank a farewell to one another,
                        until a speedy meeting in the other world. The aged admiral, Sir George
                        Somers, sat upon the poop directing the vessel's course almost without food
                        or sleep. On the last night of their dreary vigil, he called his men to see
                        the electrical phenomenon known as St. Elmo's light, "an apparition of a
                        little round light, like a faint star, trembling and streaming along with a
                        sparkling blaze, half the height upon the mainmast, and shooting from shroud
                        to shroud, tempting to settle as it were upon any of the four shrouds. . . .
                        Half the night it kept with us, . . . but upon a sudden, towards <pb
                            id="VAA2409-236" n="223"/> the morning watch, they lost it, and knew not
                        which way it made."</p>
                    <p>Sir George Somers from his post called out that land was in sight. "This
                        unlooked-for welcome news," says Smith's History, "as if it had been a voice
                        from heaven, hurrieth all above hatches to look for that they durst scarce
                        believe, so that improvidently forsaking their task (the bailing of water),
                        which imported no less than their lives, they gave so dangerous advantage to
                        their greedy enemy, the salt water which still entered at the large breaches
                        of their poor wooden castle, as that in gaping after life they had well nigh
                        swallowed their death." It was not necessary now, however, to urge every man
                        "to do his best." The coast before them was one usually avoided by sailors,
                        but these stormtossed adventurers spread all sail to reach it. The Sea
                        Adventurer struck first upon a rock, from which the surge of the sea cast
                        her away again, and then upon another. The much-battered vessel at last
                        found safe harbor wedged in an upright position between two rocks on the
                        coast of the Bermuda Islands, as though in a dry dock at home. The
                        adventures of this vessel probably suggested the subject of one of the <pb
                            id="VAA2409-237" n="224"/> greatest plays in the English language, the
                        "Tempest" of Shakespeare.</p>
                    <p>The one hundred and fifty colonists upon the Sea Adventure were thus safely
                        landed upon the Bermudas. These islands had long had a reputation among
                        sailors for being enchanted, a "den of furies and devils, the most
                        dangerous, unfortunate and forlorn place in the world." The delighted
                        adventurers, roaming over their island, found it to be "the richest,
                        healthfullest, and pleasantest they ever saw." All went busily to work, some
                        taking what could be gotten from the wrecked vessel, some in search of food
                        and water, and others building cabins of palmetto, while old Sir George did
                        not search long before he found "such a fishing" that in the course of half
                        an hour he caught enough fish with a hook and line to feed the whole
                        company. The island was found to abound in wild hogs. In fact the colonists
                        lived in such plenty and so easily upon the game and fruit of the island,
                        that many of them desired never to leave it.</p>
                    <p>For about nine months the adventurers dwelt upon the Bermudas, which were
                        then named the Somers Isles, in honor of the admiral: the name was
                        afterwards corrupted to "Summer Islands." In spite of the plenteous
                        fruitfulness of the land, <pb id="VAA2409-238" n="225"/> this little colony
                        was not without its jealousies and dissensions. On the whole, however, the
                        winter passed pleasantly in the occupation of building two pinnaces out of
                        cedar and the remains of the old Sea Adventure. Two children were born upon
                        the island. The boy was christened Bermudas, and the girl, daughter to a Mr.
                        John Rolfe, was named Bermuda. They had also 'a merry English marriage.' Sir
                        George Somers' cook wedded the maid of Mrs. Mary Horton, named Elizabeth
                        Persons.</p>
                    <p>A long boat was sent to Virginia in the spring, but never was heard of. The
                        adventurers were at last ready to embark for Jamestown. The two vessels, the
                        Deliverance and the Patience, were furnished with what provision had been
                        saved from the wreck, and the colonists embarked in May, 1610, for Virginia.
                        A forlorn welcome awaited them.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> winter of 1609-10 at Jamestown was known as 'the
                        starving time.' George Percy, who was in poor health, had been elected
                        president; but the unruly colonists had no leader, no indomitable will to
                        force them to something like thrift and forethought. Pigs were eaten, the
                        horses were devoured, not a chicken was left in the colony. Weapons and
                        tools went for food. Trips into the Indian country in search of provision
                        were managed poorly, and resulted disastrously. One supply party of thirty
                        men was cut off by Powhatan; one man only escaped, and a boy named Henry
                        Spellman was saved by the never failing kindness of Pocahontas. He lived for
                        some years afterwards among the Potomac Indians. A company of men deserted
                        in the colony's largest vessel; some of them became pirates, others returned
                        to England with an exaggerated tale of horrors as an excuse for their own
                        conduct. A miserable winter of hunger and <pb id="VAA2409-240" n="227"/>
                        crime was followed by a hopeless spring. Things became desperate. In ten
                        days more the last of the colonists would have been dead.</p>
                    <p>But, says Smith's History, God "was not willing that this country should be
                        unplanted." The hopeful little colony from the Summer Islands landed to find
                        left but sixty wretched men out of the four hundred and ninety. Sir Thomas
                        Gates entered the dilapidated and deserted church. The bell was solemnly
                        rung, summoning the survivors. Service was held and a "zealous and sorrowful
                        prayer" was made on the part of Chaplain Buck, who had come with the Bermuda
                        colonists. Mr. Percy then delivered up the colony's first patent, and the
                        papers of the colony, and Sir Thomas Gates entered upon his new office. He
                        looked about him. Jamestown was indeed in a ruined condition. The gates were
                        off their hinges, many of the palisades were gone, and dead men's cottages
                        had been torn down for firewood by weak and indolent survivors.</p>
                    <p>Gates could see no hope for the colony which had been planted at so much
                        expense of money and life. His stock of provisions would last but a few
                        weeks, and the Indians were determined in their hostility. Powhatan was at
                        last sure of being <pb id="VAA2409-241" n="228"/> rid of his troublesome
                        neighbors. His policy was to starve the English out at least until the
                        taking of Jamestown should be an easy matter.</p>
                    <p>There was but one thing to be done. The provisions would barely last to get
                        the colony to Newfoundland, where there were chances of meeting with English
                        fishing vessels.</p>
                    <p>Two weeks after the arrival of the Bermuda colonists, four pinnaces, the
                        Discovery and the Virginia, the Deliverance and the Patience, lay in the
                        James River ready to sail for Newfoundland. Each man was assigned to his
                        vessel, and the colonists were leaving Jamestown. They hated the poor
                        dismantled village which most of them had hallowed neither by bravery nor
                        selfdenial. Some of the more reckless were determined to set fire to the
                        houses, and celebrate the occasion with a conflagration. To prevent this Sir
                        Thomas Gates was the last one to leave Jamestown. As they sailed away, "none
                        dropped a tear, for none had enjoyed one day of happiness." That day they
                        dropped down the stream to Hog Island. As they neared the mouth of James
                        River on the following morning, they met the long boat of Lord Delaware's
                        approaching fleet, sent out to intercept them. Lord Delaware had started
                        from London on the first of April <pb id="VAA2409-242" n="229"/> with one
                        hundred and fifty colonists, most of whom were working men. One of the
                        vessels, the Hercules, they had lost sight of in a storm; the other two
                        ships sighted the headlands of Chesapeake Bay on the fifth of June. They
                        anchored for the night off Cape Henry, and the men went ashore to refresh
                        themselves, fish, and set up a cross, that the Hercules might know of their
                        arrival if she ever reached Chesapeake Bay. While they fished, some Indians
                        came down to them, held intercourse on friendly terms, and were given a
                        share of the fish by Lord Delaware. On returning to the ships, the
                        navigators descried a sail. Lord Delaware gave chase to the strange vessel.
                        To their great joy they found her to be the Hercules. The fleet anchored off
                        Point Comfort, where the captain of the fort at this point, Colonel Davis,
                        told them a tale, "mixed both with joy and sorrow,"joy because of the news
                        that the passengers of the Sea Adventure had not been lost, as had long been
                        believed; sorrow because of the misfortunes of the colony. Learning that the
                        pinnaces were even now in the river waiting the turn of the tide to sail for
                        Newfoundland, while they had yet provision left Lord Delaware sent out his
                        long boat to turn them back.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-243" n="230"/>
                    <p>The colonists again landed at their deserted town, and on Sunday morning, the
                        tenth of June, Lord Delaware disembarked. A sermon was preached in the
                        church by Mr. Buck, and Sir Thomas Dale delivered up his papers. Lord
                        Delaware then rose and delivered a short speech, "laying some blames on
                        them," as he afterwards said in a letter to England, "for many vanities and
                        their idleness, earnestly wishing that I might no more find it so, lest I
                        should be compelled to draw the sword of justice to cut off such
                        delinquents, which I had much rather draw in their defence to protect from
                        enemies," and concluding by "heartening them with the knowledge of what
                        store of provisions I had brought for them."</p>
                    <p>The settlement in Virginia had indeed come near to extinction. Had Lord
                        Delaware been a day or two later, the colonists would have been gone past
                        recall. On the other hand, had they delayed their return for a little
                        longer, the Indians would have sacked and destroyed the fort of Jamestown,
                        which was the only thing that could keep them in abeyance, and indeed the
                        colonists had nearly destroyed this themselves.</p>
                    <p>Lord Delaware set all things to work to retrieve the fortunes of England's
                        little colony. <pb id="VAA2409-244" n="231"/> He must soon have discovered
                        the nature of the men that he had to govern, for he wrote back home that 'an
                        hundred or two of debauched' men 'dropt forth year after year,... ill
                        provided for before they came, and worse governed after they are here," men
                        "whom no examples daily before their eyes, either of goodness or punishment,
                        can deter from their habitual impieties or terrify from a shameful death,"
                        were not the men to be the "workers in this so glorious a building."</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HOUGH</hi> Lord Delaware had a year's proviions, he did not
                        let the colony depend on these. Captain Argall was sent to fish for cod and
                        halibut, and in the month of August he dropped anchor in "a very great bay,"
                        which he called the Delaware. Sir George Somers was sent back to the
                        Bermudas to secure some wild hogs with which to restock the colony. "The
                        good old gentleman, out of his love and zeal," went "most cheerfully and
                        resolutely." He encountered contrary winds, and was forced to the more
                        northern coast of Virginia; but he persevered, and reached the Bermudas at
                        last in safety. Here Sir George Somers labored hard to accomplish his
                        purpose; but he was destined never to leave the islands which bear his name.
                        Finding himself about to die, he exhorted his men to be constant to the
                        Virginia Plantation. Lacking the courage of their leader, his men, however,
                        embalmed his body and set sail with it for England <pb id="VAA2409-246"
                            n="233"/> in their bark of thirty tons burden. Three of their number,
                        Carter, Waters, and Chard, had volunteered to remain on the island, their
                        comrades promising to return for them. Here they lived, lords of an island
                        abounding in food. When the ship was fairly out of sight, they worked
                        diligently, planting corn and seeds and building themselves a house. They
                        thus lived happily together until good luck befell them. In searching in the
                        crevices of the rocks one day they came upon a very large block of
                        ambergrisa substance secreted in the intestines of whales, of bright gray
                        color, and very valuable as a perfume.</p>
                    <p>Having now become rich, these three men immediately became unhappy. They grew
                        proud, ambitious, and contemptuous. Though, in the words of the old
                        narrative, they were "but three forlorn men, more than three thousand miles
                        from their own country, and but small hope ever to see it again," they now
                        "fell out for superiority." They had words over the merest trifles, and they
                        sometimes went from words to blows. One day, when they were fighting, the
                        dog of one of the men bit his master in disgust, "as if," says the story,
                        "the dumb beast would reprove them of their folly." Matters went from bad to
                            <pb id="VAA2409-247" n="234"/> worse, until Chard and Waters, the two
                        prouder spirits of the three, resolved on a duel. Carter became frightened;
                        he preferred even quarrelsome neighbors to solitude, so he hid the
                        duellists' weapons. For two long years these unhappy men lived on their
                        island, until their clothes were almost entirely worn from their backs. All
                        this time they kept up a triple war. At last, however, "they began to
                        recover their wits." They "concluded a tripartite peace," and made up their
                        minds to build a boat and "make a desperate attempt for Virginia." They had
                        no sooner made this resolution than they descried a sail on the horizon. The
                        vessel stood in for shore, and the three exiles were overjoyed, though "they
                        neither knew what she was or what she would." They ran with "all possible
                        speed" to meet her. "According to their heart's desire, she proved an
                        Englishman."</p>
                    <p>Those who had returned with Sir George Somers' body attempted to awaken an
                        interest in the Summer Islands, but their stories were considered
                        "travellers' tales." It at last came into the mind of some of the Virginia
                        Company that this might be a good land for a new plantation. A company was
                        formed for the planting of the Bermudas, a patent was granted it, and this
                            <pb id="VAA2409-248" n="235"/> vessel which the three lonely men had
                        descried was the first ship sent out to make a trial. The captain found that
                        the three men had been industrious. There was an acre of corn ready to be
                        harvested, with quantities of pumpkins and beans, and a plentiful store of
                        salt pork and cured bacon.</p>
                    <p>The three islanders never became rich from their block of ambergris. The
                        governor of the new colony got an inkling of it. The result was that the
                        colony was thrown almost into a civil war over this treasure. The governor
                        using it as a loadstone to draw fresh supplies to his colony, sent back to
                        the Company only a third at a time of the treasure. Many pieces of it were
                        stolen, and the original finders got no benefit whatever, while it served to
                        produce dissension both in the colony and in England. It often happens that
                        riches prove only something to quarrel about.</p>

                        in the colony. Hours for labor were from six to ten o'clock in the morning,
                        and from two to four in the afternoon. Two forts were built, and named Henry
                        and Charles for the king's sons. The church was rebuilt, twenty-four feet in
                        breadth and sixty in length, with a chancel of cedar, cedar pews, a
                        black-wal-nut communion table, and handsome wide windows, with shutters to
                        close them in bad weather. The church was kept trimmed with sweet wild
                        flowers. Prayers were held here twice a day; two sermons were preached on
                        Sunday and one on Monday. When Lord Delaware attended church on Sunday, he
                        was accompanied by the officers of the church with high-sounding names, and
                        followed by fifty attendants armed with halberds <ref id="ref_06"

                        green velvet, and a red velvet kneeling cushion was before him. Such courtly
                        pomp belonged to the age; but it was ridiculous enough in poor little
                        Jamestown.</p>
                    <p>During Lord Delaware's administration, Captain Argall was sent to the Potomac
                        to get corn from the natives, and Captain Percy was dispatched against the
                        Pashiphey Indians to punish them for some misdemeanors. The English very
                        cruelly burnt their cabins, and slew some women and children. Sir Thomas
                        Gates was sent back to England to procure a new supply for the colony.</p>
                    <p>During Lord Delaware's stay in America he was attacked by four or five
                        different diseases. At last to save his life he was obliged to return home.
                        His return threw "a damp of coldness" in England upon the enterprise, so
                        that the adventurers wished to withdraw their payments. Lord Delaware was
                        much distressed by this result. He made a public explanation of the cause of
                        his desertion of the colony, how he had been welcomed to Jamestown with
                        ague, and how this was followed successively by dysentery, cramps, gout, and
                        scurvy. Such were the malarial influences with which the colonists had to
                        contend.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-251" n="238"/>
                    <p>Fortunately, Sir Thomas Dale had already been dispatched with three vessels
                        loaded with men and cattle. He arrived in Virginia in May, 1611, and took
                        the government out of George Percy's hands. In August, Sir Thomas Gates also
                        arrived in Virginia with a fleet of six vessels, three hundred men, a
                        hundred cattle, two hundred hogs, and a good supply of provisions. He
                        brought from England his wife and daughters, but Lady Gates died on the
                        voyage.</p>
                    <p>When Dale had arrived in the spring the colony had already relapsed into old
                        habits. The colonists were found busily occupied playing bowls in the
                        streets of Jamestown. A more permanent reform was begun under the successive
                        administrations of Dale and Gates. During this summer the wisest measure yet
                        tried was adopteda measure so simple that it seems strange that it was so
                        long missed. Every man was given a little tract of land from which to raise
                        his own support, and the colonists were no longer dependent on a public
                        store and no longer worked for the interests of others. The limits of the
                        colony were fast extended. A new town was built above the falls in the James
                        River, and named Henrico in honor of the heir-apparent to the throne of
                        England, who was a great favorite. Here the Rev. Alexander <pb
                            id="VAA2409-252" n="239"/> Whitaker, "the apostle of Virginia,"
                        established himself, "bearing the name of God" to the natives. Morning and
                        evening the colonists prayed: "Lord, bless England, our sweet native
                        country."</p>
                    <p>The colony was now governed with a terribly severe code of laws taken from
                        the martial laws of the old countries. Every thing was done according to
                        rule. It seems incredible what trivial offences were punished with death.
                        For the second time that a man committed the offence of profanity a bodkin
                        was thrust through his tongue, and for the third time the penalty was death.
                        The first time a man stayed away from church he forfeited a week's
                        allowance, the second time he was whipped, and the third offence was
                        punished with death. Desertion of the colony, theft, wilfully pulling up a
                        flower, gathering of grapes, or plucking ears of corn belonging to others,
                        the killing of domestic animals, were all punished with the same rigor. He
                        who treated a minister with disrespect was publicly whipped three times and
                        forced to ask forgiveness of the congregation three Sundays in succession.
                        For one offence a man lost his ears and was branded on his hand, for another
                        he was compelled to lay "head and heels together" all night. If a man
                        refused to <pb id="VAA2409-253" n="240"/> give a clergyman a statement of
                        his faith or declined to take his advice on religious matters, he was
                        whipped daily until he repented. Jamestown must now have seen a strict and
                        circumspect body of colonists within her streets.</p>
                    <p>Grants of land were extended. After a time the London Council began giving
                        individuals patents to large tracts. In time plantations came to be
                        scattered along the shores of the James River and its tributaries. The
                        increased use of tobacco made this plant a valuable article of export. The
                        little colony was really beginning to reach forth into something like
                        prosperity.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">POCAHONTAS A PRISONER.</head>
                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">LL</hi> this time Powhatan was hostile to the colonists. In
                        one way and another he had possessed himself of many English arms, and had
                        detained a number of Englishmen as prisoners. Pocahontas happened to be
                        among the Potomacs on the river of that name. One account says that she had
                        gone thither, feasting among her friends, but Hamor says that she had been
                        sent to the Potomacs to trade with them. Perhaps also Powhatan distrusted
                        her friendship for the whites. Whatever may have been the cause, Pocahontas
                        was certainly making a stay on the Potomac River. Captain Argall had gone to
                        trade with the Indians on the Potomac. Some friendly Indians informed him
                        that Pocahontas was in the region. A plan for bringing Powhatan to terms
                        immediately suggested itself to the unscrupulous captain. He sent for one of
                        the Indian chiefs, and told him that if he did not give Pocahontas into his
                        hands they would no <pb id="VAA2409-255" n="242"/> longer be "brothers nor
                        friends." The Potomac Indians were at first unwilling to do this, fearing
                        that it might involve them in a war with Powhatan. Captain Argall assured
                        them that he would take their part in such a war, and they consented to his
                        plan.</p>
                    <p>The following story is told of the manner in which Pocahontas was betrayed.
                        The Indian girl manifested no desire to go aboard Captain Argall's vessels,
                        having many a time been on English vessels in her friendly intercourse with
                        the whites. Captain Argall offered an old Indian named Japazaws their
                        resistible bribe of a copper kettle if he would betray Pocahontas into his
                        power. Japazaws undertook to do this with the assistance of his wife, whose
                        "sex," remarks the old writer, "have ever been most powerful in beguiling
                        enticements." The old woman became immediately possessed with an intense
                        desire to visit the English ship, which she said had been there three or
                        four times and she had never been aboard it. She begged her husband to allow
                        her to go aboard, but Japazaws sternly refused, saying she could not go
                        unless she had some woman to accompany her. He at last threatened to beat
                        her for her persistence. The tender heart of Pocahontas was moved with pity;
                        she offered to <pb id="VAA2409-256" n="243"/> accompany the woman on board
                        the English vessel. Japazaws and his wife with the chief's daughter were
                        taken on to the ship, where they were well entertained and invited to
                        supper. The old man and his wife were so well pleased with the success of
                        their stratagem that during the whole meal they kept treading on Captain
                        Argall's toes. After supper the captain sent Pocahontas to the gun-room
                        while he pretended to have a private conversation with Japazaws. He
                        presently recalled her, and told her that she must remain with him, and that
                        she should not again see Powhatan until she had served to bring about a
                        peace between her father and the English. Immediately Japazaws and his wife
                        set up "a howl and cry," and Pocahontas began to be "exceeding pensive and
                        discontented." The old people were rowed to shore, happy in the possession
                        of their copper kettle and some trinkets.</p>
                    <p>Captain Argall sent an Indian messenger to Powhatan, informing him that "his
                        delight and darling, his daughter Pocahontas," was a prisoner, and informing
                        him that "if he would send home the Englishmen whom he had detained in
                        slavery, with such arms and tools as the Indians had gotten and stolen, and
                        also a great quantity of corn, that then he should have his daughter
                        restored, otherwise <pb id="VAA2409-257" n="244"/> not." Powhatan was "very
                        much grieved," having a strong affection both for his daughter and for the
                        English weapons which he possessed. It was a hard alternative. He sent,
                        however, a message desiring the English to use Pocahontas well, and
                        promising to perform the conditions for her rescue.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE MARRIAGE OF POCAHONTAS.</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was a long time before any thing more was heard from
                        Powhatan. After three months he sent to the governor by way of ransom seven
                        Englishmen, overjoyed to be free from slavery and the constant fear of a
                        cruel death, three muskets, a broadaxe, a whip-saw, and a canoe full of
                        corn. These were accompanied with a message to the effect that he would
                        further satisfy injuries, give the English a large quantity of corn, and be
                        forever their friend when his daughter was delivered up. The English
                        received these things "in part payment," and returned such an answer as this
                        to Powhatan:</p>
                    <p>"Your daughter shall be well used, but we cannot believe the rest of our arms
                        are either lost or stolen from you, and therefore till you send them we will
                        keep your daughter."</p>
                    <p>The wily old chief was much grieved at this message, and it was again a long
                        time before any thing was heard from him. At last Sir Thomas <pb
                            id="VAA2409-259" n="246"/> Dale, taking with him Pocahontas and a
                        hundred and fifty men, embarked in the colony's vessels for a visit to
                        Powhatan. The party sailed up the York River. Powhatan was not to be seen.
                        The English told the Indians that they had come to deliver up the daughter
                        of Powhatan and to receive the promised return of men and arms. These
                        overtures were received with scornful threats and bravadoes, and open
                        hostility. Skirmishing ensued, in which some of the Indian houses were
                        burned and property spoiled.</p>
                    <p>The Indians asked why this had been done. The English answered by asking why
                        they had shot at them. The Indians excused themselves, laying the blame on
                        some straggling savages. They protested they intended no harm, but were the
                        white man's friends. The English rejoined that they did not come to hurt
                        them, but came as friends. A peace "was patched up" and messengers were sent
                        to Powhatan. The Indians told the English that their imprisoned men "were
                        run off" for fear the English would hang them, but that Powhatan's men "were
                        run after to bring them back." They promised to return them with the stolen
                        swords and muskets on the following day. The English perceived that this
                        story was told only to gain time. Meantime two <pb id="VAA2409-260" n="247"
                        /> brothers of Pocahontas came aboard the ship to visit her. They had heard
                        that she was not well, and were overjoyed to find her in good health and
                        contented. While they were visiting with their sister, Mr. John Rolfe and
                        Mr. Sparks were sent to negotiate with Powhatan. They were received kindly
                        and hospitably entertained, but they were not admitted to the presence of
                        the offended chief. His brother Opechancanough saw them and promised to do
                        the best he could with Powhatan, saying that "all might be well." With such
                        slight satisfaction the English were obliged to return to Jamestown, for it
                        was now April and time to sow corn.</p>
                    <p>Pocahontas had been about a year a prisoner at Jamestown. There can be no
                        doubt that she was treated with the greatest friendliness by the colonists.
                        Her feelings had always been warm for the white strangers. Now that she was
                        an innocent and interesting young prisoner among them, what more natural
                        than that she should be honored and petted? Pocahontas was now a woman,
                        being about eighteen to nineteen years of age. To judge from her portrait
                        she could not have possessed the beauty with which tradition has invested
                        her, but she had at least a pleasant and interesting face, and there must
                        have been <pb id="VAA2409-261" n="248"/> some charm in her large black eyes
                        and straight black hair.</p>
                    <p>There was one colonist at least who took a great interest in the young
                        prisoner. Mr. John Rolfe is styled in the different records "an honest
                        gentleman of good behavior," "an honest and discreet English gentleman," "a
                        gentleman of approved behavior and honest carriage." His wife, whose little
                        daughter was born at the Summer Islands and christened Bermuda, must have
                        fallen a victim to the malarial influences which did such deadly work among
                        newly-arrived colonists in Jamestown.</p>
                    <p>The subject of the conversion of Pocahontas had weighed heavily upon the mind
                        of Mr. Rolfe. He accordingly attempted to convert her to Christianity, and
                        in doing so fell in love with her. Pocahontas became a Christian, and what
                        more natural than that the constant friend of the white men should love an
                        Englishman?</p>
                    <p>Long before the trip up the York River Mr. Rolfe had loved the Indian maiden.
                        He wrote a long letter to Sir Thomas Dale asking his advice. Sir Thomas
                        readily consented to the marriage. Pocahontas, on her part, told her brother
                        of her attachment to Mr. Rolfe. He informed Powhatan, who seems to have been
                        well pleased with <pb id="VAA2409-262" n="249"/> the proposition, for within
                        ten days an old uncle of Pocahontas and two of her brothers arrived at
                        Jamestown. Powhatan had sent them as deputies to witness the marriage of his
                        daughter, and to do his part toward the confirmation of it.</p>
                    <p>Pocahontas was first baptized. It was deemed necessary to give her a
                        Christian name at her baptism. She was christened Rebecca, and as a king's
                        daughter she was known after this as the Lady Rebecca, and sometimes as the
                        Lady Pocahontas.</p>
                    <p>In April, 1614, the odd bridal procession moved up the little church with its
                        wide-open windows and its cedar pews. The bridegroom was a young Englishman,
                        the bride an Indian chief's daughter, accompanied by two red-skinned
                        warriors, her brothers, and given away by an old uncle. Perhaps more than
                        one of the colony's ministers officiated. Before the altar with its
                        canoe-like font Pocahontas repeated in imperfect English her marriage vows,
                        and donned her wedding wing. The wedding is briefly mentioned by the old
                        recorders only as something bearing upon the welfare of the colony. It was
                        the first union between the people who were to possess the land and the
                        natives. The colonists doubtless regarded it as a most auspicious event,
                        binding <pb id="VAA2409-263" n="250"/> as it did the most powerful chief in
                        Virginia to their interests. Pocahontas's wedding day must have been a
                        festive day in this balmiest of the months of the Virginia climate.</p>
                    <p>From this day friendly intercourse and trade were again established with
                        Powhatan and his people. To the day of his death the old chief never
                        violated the peace which was thus brought about.</p>
                    <p>In still another way the marriage of Pocahontas benefited the colony. The
                        nearest neighbors of the English were the Chickahominys, a powerful tribe of
                        Indians who were just now free from the yoke of Powhatan, whom they regarded
                        as a tyrant. They had taken advantage of the recent differences between this
                        chief and the colonists to hold themselves exceedingly independent of both.
                        But now that Powhatan and the English were united, the Chickahominys began
                        to fear for their own liberty. They sent a deputation to Sir Thomas Dale
                        desiring peace. Dale visited them, entered their council, and concluded a
                        treaty stipulating that the Chickahominy Indians should call themselves
                        Tassantessus, or Englishmen, as a sign of friendship, furnish three hundred
                        men in case of a Spanish attack on the colony, bring a tribute of corn at
                        harvest-time, for which they should receive <pb id="VAA2409-264" n="251"/>
                        payment in hatchets; and, lastly, that each of the eight of their chief men
                        who were to see to the performance of this treaty should have a red coat and
                        a copper chain with the picture of King James hung upon it, and "be
                        accounted his noble men."</p>
                    <p>The treaty was confirmed with a great shout, followed by an Indian oration,
                        directed first at the old men, then at the young, and lastly at the women
                        and children.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF SIR THOMAS DALE.</head>
                    <p>E<hi rend="sc">ARLY</hi> in 1614 Sir Thomas Gates had returned to England and
                        left the government of the colony to Sir Thomas Dale. An old soldier of the
                        Netherlands, Dale was harsh in the enforcement of law, but his strict rule,
                        tempered by a hard-earned wisdom on the part of the Virginia Company, was
                        beneficial, and under his government the little commonwealth gained a sure
                        foothold in America.</p>
                    <p>Commercial jealousy was bitter and relentless in those days. A little French
                        colony of Jesuit missionaries had been planted on the coast of Maine, within
                        the limits of the charter granted by King James. The English now made
                        frequent fishing voyages far north along the coast. Captain Argall set out
                        on a voyage, however, according to one authority, for the express purpose of
                        destroying the Jesuit colony. The Indians at Pemaquid, supposing the captain
                        would be pleased to meet brother white men, informed him <pb
                            id="VAA2409-266" n="253"/> that there was a settlement of Frenchmen at
                        Mount Desert. The faces of Argall and his men instantly depicted an
                        excitement which the Indians took for delight, and they offered a pilot to
                        the harbor of the little colony. The French were scattered about in the
                        woods when they saw an English vessel decked with red, and with the sound of
                        trumpet and drums, bearing down upon their own ship securely anchored in
                        harbor, her sails converted into awnings, and but ten men aboard her.
                        Without a preliminary word Argall opened fire. Du Thet on board the French
                        vessel made one wild shot from the ship's guns, but was mortally wounded
                        with a musket ball. The helpless vessel surrendered. Landing and searching
                        the colony's tents, Argall discovered the desk of the commander, La
                        Saussaye, opened it, pocketed his royal commission and relocked the desk.
                        Captain Argall demanded his papers when La Saussaye returned from the woods,
                        and when they were found missing, declared that he had neither title nor
                        right to the land on which he was settled. Argall permitted his men to
                        plunder the colony. The Jesuits remonstrated with him. "Well, it is a pity
                        you have lost your papers," remarked Argall.</p>
                    <p>La Saussaye and a dozen men returned to <pb id="VAA2409-267" n="254"/> France
                        in a fishing vessel. The others were carried to the Chesapeake, where Argall
                        represented that they had been without a commission. Dale imprisoned them,
                        and they were threatened with hanging. The unscrupulous Argall became
                        frightened at the result of his deception and confessed the truth, whereupon
                        the prisoners were released.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ralph Hamor, who had been in Virginia for several years, was upon the eve
                        of returning home, and wished to see Powhatan. He was sent with an
                        interpreter on a commission by Sir Thomas Dale. Powhatan sent the governor
                        word by Hamor that he need have no more fears in regard to his intention. He
                        said: "There hath been enough of blood and war. Too many have been slain
                        already on both sides, and, by me, occasion there shall never be more. I,
                        who have power to perform it, have said it. I am now grown old and would
                        gladly end my days in peace and quietness, and although I should have just
                        cause of resentment, yet my country is large enough and I can go from you.
                        And this answer I hope will satisfy my brother."</p>
                    <p>While Hamor was among the Indians he found an Englishman who had been made a
                        prisoner some three years before. He looked so like an <pb id="VAA2409-268"
                            n="255"/> Indian both in complexion and dress that he was recognized
                        only by his speech. He begged Hamor to procure his release. When Hamor made
                        this request Powhatan showed much discontent. "You have one of my
                        daughters," said the chief, "and I am content; but you cannot see one of
                        your men with me but you must have him away or break friendship. If you must
                        needs have him you shall go home without guides, and if any evil befall you
                        thank yourselves."</p>
                    <p>"I will," said Hamor, "but if I return not well, you may expect a revenge,
                        and your brother Dale might have just cause to suspect you."</p>
                    <p>Powhatan left his guest in a passion. He entertained him, however, at supper
                        with a "cheerful countenance." About midnight he awoke Hamor and said he
                        would send him and the other man home on the morrow. Powhatan, like all
                        Indians, was a consummate beggar. He always had a list of presents which he
                        desired at the hands of the English. He now told Hamor to remind "his
                        brother Dale" to send him ten great pieces of copper, a razor, a frow for
                        riving shingles, a grindstone, and some fish hooks and nets. Lest Hamor
                        should forget any of these things he made him write them down in a
                        memorandum-book <pb id="VAA2409-269" n="256"/> which the old chief had got
                        into his possession. He probably had seen Englishmen do this when they
                        wished to remember any thing. Hamor wrote the list of things, and the old
                        chief took back the book. Hamor asked him for the book, but Powhatan would
                        not give it up, saying that "it did him much good to show it to strangers."</p>
                    <p>Sir Thomas Dale did not live at Jamestown, but at a more recent plantation on
                        the James River called Bermuda Hundred. Mr. Whitaker was the minister at
                        this place, and here lived Rolfe and his wife. Dale, Whitaker, and Rolfe
                        devoted themselves assiduously to the task of instructing Pocahontas. She
                        was taught the English language and especially educated in the Christian
                        religion. Pocahontas, on her part, was eager to learn. Her husband and Sir
                        Thomas Dale were probably planning to take her to England. One can imagine
                        the training that this Indian woman went through to learn the formalities
                        and refinements of civilized life. But Pocahontas' inclination had always
                        been towards the English. She became so well educated that she had no desire
                        to return to her father, "nor could well endure the society of her own
                        nation." It is said that "the true affection she constantly bare her husband
                            <pb id="VAA2409-270" n="257"/> was much," and if we may believe the
                        quaint words of the old history "he, on the other hand, underwent great
                        torment and pain out of his violent passion and tender solicitude for her."</p>
                    <p>In 1615 a great lottery was drawn in England for the benefit of Virginia.
                        This pernicious resource for money was soon after put a stop to. In this
                        same year a Spanish vessel, the constant dread of the colony, "was seen to
                        beat to and fro off Point Comfort." A boat was at last sent ashore for a
                        pilot. The pilot went out to them and the vessel sailed away with him.
                        Arrived at Spain they endeavored to persuade him to betray the company. He
                        refused, and was imprisoned for four years, at the end of which time he was
                        returned to England.</p>

                        been five years in Virginia when in 1616 he settled the affairs of the
                        colony, left Yeardley as deputy-governor, and embarked for England. He took
                        with him Mr. Rolfe, Pocahontas, Tomocomo, or Uttamattomakin, one of
                        Powhatan's chief men, married to his daughter Matachanna, and other Indians
                        of both sexes. Tomocomo, who was considered among the Indians "an
                        understanding fellow," had been charged by Powhatan to count the people in
                        England and give him an exact idea of their strength. It is said that
                        Opechancanough, who was rising into power among the Indians, also charged
                        Tomocomo to observe whether the English had any trees or grain in their
                        country. The Indian boy Namontack, whom Captain Newport had taken over, had
                        seen hardly any thing except London, and had reported great numbers of men
                        and houses, but he made no mention of trees or cornfields. Opechancanough
                        had a strong suspicion, from the colonists' constant desire for <pb
                            id="VAA2409-272" n="259"/> corn and the shiploads of lumber which left
                        the James River, that England was destitute of these commodities.</p>
                    <p>The vessel reached Plymouth on the 12th of June, 1616. On leaving the vessel
                        Tomocomo was prepared with a long stick and a knife ready to make a notch
                        for every man he saw. He kept this up till "his arithmetic failed him." In
                        travelling by coach from Plymouth up to London, Tomocomo discovered that
                        England did not lack in trees and grain-fields. We can imagine the
                        excitement that followed these travellers everywhere. They were all wonders,
                        but especially was the "Princess" Pocahontas. The popular interest in her
                        must have exceeded the usual desire to catch a sight of the King of England
                        and his family. It was even debated, doubtless at the suggestion of the
                        ever-jealous royal dunce, King James, whether Rolfe had not committed high
                        treason in marrying the daughter of a foreign prince without permission of
                        his sovereign.</p>
                    <p>Pocahontas was now mother to a little son, Thomas Rolfe, whom she "loved most
                        dearly." Immediately on her arrival the Virginia Company took measures for
                        the maintenance of her and her child. Persons of "great rank and quality"
                        took much notice of Pocahontas. She did not like the <pb id="VAA2409-273"
                            n="260"/> smoke of London, and was removed to Brentford.</p>
                    <p>In this year Sir Walter Raleigh had been liberated after thirteen years'
                        imprisonment, and went around London renewing acquaintance with familiar
                        objects and noting the changes that had been made. It is very probable that
                        Sir Walter, "the father of Virginia," took pains to see Pocahontas.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith was at this time between two voyages and his stay in London was
                        limited. He met Tomocomo, and they renewed old acquaintance.</p>
                    <p>"Captain Smith," said the Indian, "Powhatan did bid me find you out, to show
                        me your God, and the king and queen and prince you so much had told us of."</p>
                    <p>"Concerning God," says Smith, "I told him the best I could, the king I heard
                        he had seen, and the rest he should see when he would." Tomocomo, however,
                        denied having seen King James till Smith satisfied him that he had by the
                        circumstances. Tomocomo immediately looked very melancholy and said:</p>
                    <p>"You gave Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king
                        gave me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-274" n="261"/>
                    <p>There was much curiosity "to hear and see the behavior" of Tomocomo, he being
                        a real savage and untutored Indian. Purchas says of him: "With this savage I
                        have often conversed at my good friend's, Master Doctor Gulstone, where he
                        was a frequent guest, and where I have seen him sing and dance his
                        diabolical measures."</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith, as he says, desiring to return the courtesy of Pocahontas, had
                        written the following letter to the queen immediately upon hearing of the
                        arrival of Pocahontas. <text>

                                        emboldened me in the worst of extreme dangers, that now
                                        honesty doth constrain me to presume thus far beyond myself
                                        to present your majesty this short discourse. If ingratitude
                                        be a deadly poison to all honest virtues, I must be guilty
                                        of that crime if I should omit any means to be thankful. So
                                        it is that some ten years ago, being in Virginia, and taken
                                        prisoner by the power of Powhatan, their chief king, I
                                        received from this great savage exceeding great courtesy,
                                        especially from his son Nantequas, the most manliest, <pb
                                            id="VAA2409-275" n="262"/> comeliest, boldest spirit I
                                        ever saw in a savage, and his sister Pocahontas, the king's
                                        most dear and well-beloved daughter, being but a child of
                                        twelve or thirteen years of age, whose compassionate,
                                        pitiful heart, of desperate estate, gave me much cause to
                                        respect her. I being the first Christian this proud king and
                                        his grim attendants ever saw, and thus enthralled in their
                                        barbarous power, I cannot say that I felt the least occasion
                                        of want that was in the power of those mortal foes to
                                        prevent, notwithstanding all their threats.</p>
                                    <p>"After some six weeks fatting among these savage courtiers,
                                        at the minute of my execution she hazarded the beating out
                                        of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so
                                        prevailed with her father that I was safely conducted to
                                        Jamestown, where I found about eight-and-thirty miserable,
                                        poor, and sick creatures to keep possession of all those
                                        large territories of Virginia. Such was the weakness of this
                                        poor commonwealth as, had the savages not fed us, we
                                        directly had starved.</p>
                                    <p>"And this relief, most gracious queen, was commonly brought
                                        us by this lady, Pocahontas. Notwithstanding all these
                                        passages when inconstant fortune turned our peace to war,
                                        this tender virgin would still not spare to dare to visit
                                        us; <pb id="VAA2409-276" n="263"/> and by her our jars have
                                        oft been appeased and our wants still supplied. Were it the
                                        policy of her father thus to employ her, or the ordinance of
                                        God thus to make her his instrument, or her extraordinary
                                        affection to our nation, I know not. But of this I am sure,
                                        when her father, with the utmost of his policy and power
                                        sought to surprise me, the dark night could not affright her
                                        from coming through the irksome woods, and with watered eyes
                                        gave me intelligence, with her best advice to escape his
                                        fury; which had he known he had surely slain her. Jamestown,
                                        with her wild train, she as freely frequented as her
                                        father's habitation; and, during the time of two or three
                                        years, she, next under God, was still the instrument to
                                        preserve this colony from death, famine, and utter
                                        confusion, which if in those times had once been dissolved,
                                        Virginia might have lain as it was at our first arrival to
                                        this day.</p>
                                    <p>"Since then this business having been turned and varied by
                                        many accidents from that I left it at. It is most certain
                                        after a long and troublesome war after my departure betwixt
                                        her father and our colony, all which time she was not heard
                                        of, about two years after she herself was taken prisoner.
                                        Being so detained near two years longer, the colony by that
                                        means was relieved, <pb id="VAA2409-277" n="264"/> peace
                                        concluded, and at last, rejecting her barbarous condition,
                                        she was married to an English gentleman, with whom at
                                        present she is in England; the first Christian ever of that
                                        nation, the first Virginian ever spoke English, or had a
                                        child in marriage by an Englishman: a matter surely, if my
                                        meaning be truly considered and well understood, worthy a
                                        prince's understanding.</p>
                                    <p>"Thus, most gracious lady, I have related to your majesty
                                        what at your best leisure our approved histories will
                                        account you at large, and done in the time of your majesty's
                                        life. And, however, this might be presented to you from a
                                        more worthy pen, it cannot come from a more honest heart, as
                                        yet I never begged any thing of the State or any; and it is
                                        my want of ability and her exceeding desert, your birth,
                                        means, and authority, her birth, virtue, want, and
                                        simplicity, doth make me thus bold humbly to beseech your
                                        majesty to take this knowledge of her, though it be from one
                                        so unworthy to be the reporter as myself, her husband's
                                        estate not being able to make her fit to attend your
                                        majesty. The most and least I can do is to tell you this,
                                        because none hath so oft tried it as myself; and the rather
                                        being of so great a spirit, however her stature. If she
                                        should not be well received, seeing this <pb

                                        kingdom by her means, her present love to us and
                                        Christianity might turn to such scorn and fury as to divert
                                        all this good to the worst of evil; where, finding so great
                                        a queen should do her some honor more than she can imagine,
                                        for being so kind to your servants and subjects, would so
                                        ravish her with content, as endear her dearest blood to
                                        effect that your majesty and all the king's honest subjects
                                        most earnestly desire. And so I humbly kiss your gracious

                    <head type="subtitle">POCAHONTAS AT COURT.HER DEATH.</head>
                    <p>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi> S<hi rend="sc">MITH</hi> went to Brentford with
                        several others to see Pocahontas. She saluted him modestly, and without a
                        word turned around and "obscured her face as not seeming well contented."
                        Smith, with her husband and the other gentlemen, left her "in that humor"
                        for several hours. The captain was disappointed, and repented having written
                        the queen that she could speak English. But when the gentlemen returned
                        Pocahontas began to talk, and said that she remembered Captain Smith well,
                        "and the courtesies she had done."</p>
                    <p>"You did promise Powhatan," said Pocahontas, "what was yours should be his,
                        and he the like to you. You called him father, being in his land a stranger,
                        and by the same reason so must I do to you."</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith tried to excuse himself from this honor. Knowing the jealousy
                        of the court he "durst not allow that title because she was a king's
                        daughter."</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-280" n="267"/>
                    <p>"Were you not afraid," said Pocahontas, with a look of determination, "were
                        you not afraid to come into my father's country, and caused fear in him and
                        all his people but me, and fear you here I should call you father? I tell
                        you then I will, and you shall call me child, and so I will be forever and
                        ever your countryman. They did tell us always you were dead, and I knew no
                        other till I came to Plymouth; yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakin to
                        seek you and know the truth, because your countrymen will lie much."</p>
                    <p>This deception played, it seems, upon the Indians, and to which Rolfe must
                        have been a party, is very strange. It has been conjectured by romancers
                        that Pocahontas had really loved Smith, but there seems to be no reason to
                        think any thing more than that she felt a warm affection for him as a friend
                        of her childhood.</p>
                    <p>Pocahontas, it is said, had been so well instructed that she "was become very
                        formal and civil after our English manner." During his brief stay in London
                        Captain Smith made frequent visits to Pocahontas, accompanied by courtiers
                        and other friends who wished to see the Indian lady. The gentlemen, said
                        Smith, "generally concluded they did think God had a great hand in her
                        conversion," and said that they had <pb id="VAA2409-281" n="268"/> "seen
                        many English ladies worse favored, proportioned, and behaviored."</p>
                    <p>Pocahontas was presented at court, accompanied by Lady Delaware, both to the
                        king and queen. Ben Jonson's Christmas Mask was played at court on the 6th
                        of January, 1617. Pocahontas and Tomocomo were present. The following notice
                        of it is found in a letter of the day: "On twelfth night there was a mask,
                        when the new-made Earl (Buckingham) and the Earl of Montgomery danced with
                        the queen.. . . The Virginian woman, Pocahontas, and her father's counsellor
                        have been with the king and graciously used, and both she and her assistant
                        were pleased at the mask. She is upon her return, though sore against her
                        will, if the wind would about to send her away."</p>
                    <p>Captain Samuel Argall was about to sail for Virginia as governor of the
                        colony. Rolfe and his wife must return to their home, Tomocomo must go back
                        to tell Powhatan of his observations, but the other Indians were left in
                        England to be educated.</p>
                    <p>While Pocahontas was in England her portrait was drawn and engraved. She is
                        represented in the fashionable costume of the day. Beneath the picture were
                        these words: "Matoaks als Rebecka, <pb id="VAA2409-282" n="269"/> daughter
                        to the mighty Prince Powhatan, Emperor of Attanough-kornouck als Virginia,
                        converted and baptized in the Christian faith, and wife to the worshipful
                        Mr. John Rolfe. Aged 21. Anno Domini 1616."</p>
                    <p>Pocahontas, it is said, was unwilling to leave England. She was destined
                        never to return to Virginia. She died at Gravesend on the eve of her
                        departure for America, being about twenty-two years of age. The few words
                        devoted in Smith's History to her death are quite characteristic of the
                        times: "It pleased God at Graves-end to take this young lady to His mercy,
                        where she made not more sorrow for her unexpected death than joy to the
                        beholders to hear and see her make so religious and godly an end."</p>
                    <p>In the parish register at Gravesend is the following blundering entry, which
                        could hardly have referred to any other than Pocahontas:</p>
                    <q direct="unspecified">

                    </q>
                    <p>The child of Pocahontas was left in England in the care of Sir Lewis
                        Stewkley, and afterwards transferred to the care of his uncle, Mr. Henry <pb
                            id="VAA2409-283" n="270"/> Rolfe, a London merchant. He was educated in
                        England and afterwards returned to America. From him descended some of the
                        most respectable families in Virginia. There is on record a petition signed
                        by Pocahontas's son, Thomas Rolfe, and addressed to the authorities of the
                        colony in 1641, praying to be allowed to go to the Indian country to visit
                        his mother's sister, known among the white people as Cleopatra.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> spite of all his troubles at Jamestown, Smith, as he
                        says, "liked Virginia well." The remainder of his life was devoted to the
                        furtherance of colonization in the New World. No jealousy kept him from an
                        enthusiastic interest in the welfare of the Virginia colony. He was quick to
                        rejoice over its growing prosperity. Henceforth we see him in the meetings
                        of the Virginia Company, exciting merchants through a desire for gain to
                        adventure voyages, exploring the coast of North Virginia, writing books and
                        pamphlets to draw attention to the American colonies, and travelling over
                        England selling these works.</p>
                    <p>After the failure of the colony of the Plymouth Company in Maine, and the
                        dreary picture of the New England coast given by the colonists, Captain
                        Smith was the first to again attract attention to this part of the New
                        World. He set sail in March, 1614, with two vessels fitted out at the
                        expense of some London merchants, for the purpose of catching whales, or
                        discovering gold <pb id="VAA2409-285" n="272"/> mines, and if these failed,
                        of returning with a cargo of fish and furs.</p>
                    <p>Precious metal was not to be found, and whale fishing was pronounced a
                        "costly conclusion," for they "saw many and spent much time in chasing them,
                        but could not kill any." The best part of the fishing season was now gone,
                        but the sailors spent the remainder of the summer catching and curing
                        cod-fish. Meantime Captain Smith in a small boat with eight men explored the
                        coast from Penobscot to Cape Cod. He bought large quantities of furs from
                        the Indians along the coast, paying them in trifles. From his observations
                        Smith made a map. He returned to England with a cargo of furs, leaving
                        Captain Thomas Hunt in command of the second vessel to return by way of
                        Spain, where he was to dispose of the fish. This man, after the departure of
                        Captain Smith, decoyed twenty-four savages on board his vessel and sailed to
                        Spain with them, selling them for slaves in the port of Malaga. This
                        infamous deed, avers Captain Smith, was perpetrated for the purpose of
                        making the Indians so hostile as to prevent the establishment of a colony,
                        and thus leave the profitable trade to such adventurers as himself.</p>
                    <p>Smith reached England after having been gone <pb id="VAA2409-286" n="273"/>
                        some six months. He presented his map to Prince Charles, afterwards Charles
                        II., and requested him to change the barbarous names by which its different
                        capes, bays, and rivers were known. The young prince named Cape Ann, which
                        Smith had called Cape Tragabigzanda, after the Turkish lady who had loved
                        him; changed Gosnold's name of Cape Cod to Cape James; changed Massachusetts
                        River to Charles River, and made various other alterations, some of which
                        remain to this day while others are forgotten. Smith gave a lively
                        description of the country. The Plymouth Company, as owners of "the dead
                        patent to this unregarded country," engaged Captain Smith to undertake a
                        voyage in their service. Soon after the old Virginia Company made him an
                        offer to take the command of a fleet of four vessels. He was, however, bound
                        in honor to the Plymouth Company and refused. Meantime a vessel which had
                        sailed to the coast of New England in search of gold returned to report an
                        entire failure, and the Plymouth Company's ardor was dampened. Smith had
                        promised to return to Plymouth about Christmas. When he reached this place
                        in the early part of January, 1615, with two hundred pounds in his pocket,
                        ready and eager to again set sail, his hopes <pb id="VAA2409-287" n="274"/>
                        were disappointed, and it was too late for him to accept the offer of the
                        other colony.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith was destined never again to set foot in the New World, though
                        he lived many years after this. But he was always at work for the
                        furtherance of his project. To him New England owes its name. He says that
                        this part of America was formerly known as Norumbega, Virginia, Nuskoncus,
                        and Pemaquida. He expresses particular contempt for the name "Cannaday" in
                        his orthography, as applied to New England. In his writings Smith dilates
                        upon the fine fishing along the coast of this country. He says that fish are
                        "to be had in abundance, observing but their seasons; but if a man will go
                        at Christmas to gather cherries in Kent, though there be plenty in summer he
                        may be deceived; so have these plenties here each their season."</p>
                    <p>After his experience Smith thought he could plant a colony of three hundred
                        men on this coast, and supply them provisions by trade with the savages. "If
                        they should be untowards, as it is most certain they will," says Smith,
                        "thirty or forty good men will be sufficient to bring them all in
                        subjection."</p>
                    <p>With a sturdy pen Smith presented the advantages of colonization to the men
                        of his day. He <pb id="VAA2409-288" n="275"/> despises a tame staying at
                        home, and characterizes the manner of living of many men of his day in
                        descriptions which would not be inapplicable to-day. "Then who would live at
                        home idly," exclaims Smith, "or think in himself any worth to live, only to
                        eat, drink, and sleep, and so die; or by consuming that carelessly his
                        friends got worthily, or by using that miserably that maintained virtue
                        honestly, or for being descended nobly and pine with the vain vaunt of great
                        kindred in penury, or to maintain a silly show of bravery, toil out thy
                        heart, soul, and time basely, by shifts, tricks, cards, and dice, or by
                        relating news of other men's actions, shark here and there for a dinner or
                        supper, deceive thy friends by fair promises, and dissimulation in borrowing
                        where thou never meanest to pay, offend the laws, surfeit with excess,
                        burthen thy country, abuse thyself, despair in want and then cozen thy
                        kindred, yea, even thy own brother, and wish thy parents' death (I will not
                        say damnation) to have their estates."</p>
                    <p>Opposed to this Smith gives a picture of the delights of a life in the New
                        World. "What pleasure can be more," he says, "than being tired with any
                        occasion ashore in planting vines, fruits, or herbs, in contriving their own
                        grounds <pb id="VAA2409-289" n="276"/> to the pleasure of their own minds,
                        their field, orchards, buildings, ships, and other works, to recreate
                        themselves before their own doors in their own boats upon the sea." He
                        describes the pleasures of fishing in a passage which has a flavor like that
                        of Isaac Walton. "What sport," says Smith, "doth yield a more pleasing
                        content and less hurt and charge than angling with a hook and crossing the
                        sweet air from isle to isle, over the silent streams of a calm sea, wherein
                        the most curious may find profit, pleasure, and content?" Looking at another
                        side of fishing he says: "Is it not pretty sport to pull up twopence,
                        sixpence, and twelvepence as fast as you can haul and veer a line?" Smith
                        says that though a man may work thus only part of his time he will make more
                        than he can spend, "unless he be exceedingly excessive." "And lest any
                        should think the toil might be insupportable," says the persuasive captain,
                        "though these things may be had by labor and diligence, I assure myself
                        there are who delight extremely in vain pleasure that take much more pains
                        in England to enjoy it than I should do here to gain wealth sufficient. And
                        yet I think they should not have half such sweet content, for our pleasure
                        here is still gains, in England charges and loss: here nature <pb
                            id="VAA2409-290" n="277"/> and liberty affords us that freely which in
                        England we want or it costeth us dearly."</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith said that he had not been "so ill-bred" as not to have "tasted
                        of plenty and pleasure as well as want and misery;" that neither necessity
                        nor discontent forced him to "these endeavors, nor am I ignorant," said he,
                        "what small thanks I shall have for my pains, .. . . yet I hope my reasons
                        with my deeds will so prevail with some that I shall not want employment in
                        these affairs, to make the most blind see his own senselessness and
                        incredulity, hoping that gain will make them effect that which religion,
                        charity, and the common good cannot." He wanted to make a colony "of all
                        sorts of worthy, honest, industrious spirits, . . . not to persuade them to
                        go only," said he, "but go with them; not leave them there, but live with
                        them there. I will not say but by ill providing and undue managing such
                        courses may be taken as may make us miserable enough, but if I may have the
                        execution of what I have projected, if they want to eat let them eat or
                        never digest me, . . . and if I abuse you with my tongue, take my head for
                        satisfaction."</p>
                    <p>But anxious as Smith was to colonize New England he was not destined to be
                        father to that as well as to Virginia.</p>

                    <p>N<hi rend="sc">OTWITHSTANDING</hi> the failure of the Plymouth Company to
                        fulfil their engagement with Captain Smith, he still labored hard to
                        accomplish his object. After "a labyrinth of trouble" Smith was furnished
                        with two vessels by some friends, assisted by Sir Ferdinando Gorges. Smith
                        had planned to plant a colony with but sixteen men. He had indeed wished for
                        a much larger number with which to begin his settlement, "but," says Smith,
                        "rich men for the most part are grown to that dotage through their pride in
                        their wealth, as though there were no accident could end it or their lives."
                        He must therefore content himself with a colony of sixteen, and he believed
                        that, through his friendship with some of the Indians of the New England
                        coast and his experience at Jamestown, he might still succeed.</p>
                    <p>He set sail in March, 1615. He had gone but a hundred and twenty leagues when
                        he was separated from his other vessel, and lost his masts in <pb
                            id="VAA2409-292" n="[]"/>
                        <pb id="VAA2409-293" n="[]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2409-295" n="279"/> a storm. Smith was forced to return under a
                        jury-mast to Plymouth, while the other vessel continued her course and
                        returned in August with a profitable cargo. Captain Smith was not, however,
                        to be deterred by accidents. He immediately set sail again in a bark of
                        sixty tons burden, accompanied by his sixteen colonists. This time they were
                        chased by pirates. Their pursuers had thirty-six guns and Captain Smith's
                        vessel but four. His crew begged him to surrender, but this he refused to do
                        until he could do so on fair conditions. He vowed that he would sink rather
                        than be ill-used by the pirates. The pirate's men were astonished that a
                        bark of sixty tons with but four guns should higgle about the terms of
                        surrender. When it became known that Smith was the captain of the vessel it
                        was found that many of the pirates had been soldiers under him, probably in
                        the Turkish wars. They had run away from Tunis with this vessel. They were
                        now destitute of provision and "in combustion amongst themselves." They
                        offered their command to Captain Smith, but he declined the leadership of
                        these mutinous adventurers. His unfortunate bark having escaped this danger
                        again fell in with pirates. This time the enemy consisted of two French
                        vessels. Captain Smith <pb id="VAA2409-296" n="280"/> had much ado to force
                        his men to fight. He at last told them that he would blow up his ship rather
                        than yield while he had powder left. So, to use his own expression, the
                        ships "went together by the ears," and the bark at last escaped her pursuers
                        in spite of their shot.</p>
                    <p>Near Flores Captain Smith's vessel was met by four French privateers, who
                        said they had a commission from their king to take Portugals, Spaniards, and
                        pirates. They called upon Captain Smith to come aboard them and show his
                        papers. This he did after many fair promises on their part. He was no sooner
                        aboard the French vessel, however, than he was detained, his own ship
                        rifled, manned with French sailors, and his men divided among the different
                        vessels in the fleet. Within five or six days other ships joined them, and
                        the fleet numbered eight or nine sail. They at last surrendered the English
                        vessel to her sailors and returned much of her provision. The crew desired
                        to return immediately to England, but Captain Smith resolved to keep on for
                        his destination. Before he parted with the French fleet the admiral again
                        sent for Smith. While he was on board the admiral's ship a sail was spied
                        and she went in chase. Meantime the mutinous part of Smith's crew set sail
                        for England in the night, <pb id="VAA2409-297" n="281"/> leaving him on the
                        French vessel in his "cap, bretches, and wastcoat," as the narrative says,
                        his arms having been left aboard his own vessel, where the sailors divided
                        them among themselves.</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith led a life of excitement aboard the French ship. The admiral's
                        vessel was separated from the others of the fleet in a storm. While she lay
                        off the Azores watching for prizes Smith occupied himself in writing a
                        narrative of his last voyages. They were soon afterward chased by an English
                        pirate with twelve guns and thirty men, nearly starved. During this fight
                        Captain Smith was imprisoned in the gun-room. When the two vessels came to a
                        parley the English endeavored to procure relief from the French, who as
                        usual made fair promises in order to get them in their power. When they
                        found the English pirates were ready to defend themselves to the last, they
                        resolved to barter provision with them. While they were thus occupied they
                        received some shot from a small vessel.</p>
                    <p>The next fight was with a small English fishing smack. During this engagement
                        Captain Smith was confined in the cabin. From this station he could see the
                        captain robbed of all his valuables and half his cargo of fish. His poor
                        clothes were auctioned at the mainmast, and the proceeds <pb
                            id="VAA2409-298" n="282"/> did not amount to sevenpence apiece to the
                        pillagers.</p>
                    <p>The next capture was a Scotch ship. Fortunately for her she was not yet
                        loaded, and the French did not get much from her. They next descried four
                        vessels and "stood after" them. These vessels furled their sails and awaited
                        the approach of the French vessel; "but," says Captain Smith with evident
                        exultation, "our French spirits were content only to perceive they were
                        English red crosses." A short time after this the French ship chased four
                        Spanish vessels coming from the West Indies. When Spaniards were to be
                        fought Captain Smith was released and ordered to assist, and with an
                        Englishman's hatred of Spain he no doubt fought the Spaniards with some
                        relish. For four or five hours the English fought the Spanish ships,
                        "tearing their sides," says Smith, "with many a shot betwixt wind and
                        weather, yet not daring to board them, we lost them, for which all the
                        sailors ever after hated the captain as a professed coward."</p>
                    <p>A poor little Brazilian vessel was next chased. She was captured after a
                        short fight, with fourteen or fifteen, "the better half," of her crew
                        wounded. She was plundered of seventy chests of sugar, a hundred hides, and
                        seventy thousand silver coins. The plunderers soon after met a <pb
                            id="VAA2409-299" n="283"/> Dutch ship. They entrapped the captain aboard
                        under the pretence of showing his commission and then captured his vessel.
                        She was manned with French sailors, who took occasion in the night to run
                        off with the vessel.</p>
                    <p>In a day or two more they met a West Indian man-of-war. For one whole
                        forenoon they fought her. They captured her, and she proved the richest
                        prize of all. From her they took a large quantity of hides, cochineal,
                        coffers of silver, money and coffers containing the King of Spain's
                        treasure, with pillage from many rich passengers. The pirates seemed now
                        content. They had often promised to set Captain Smith ashore on some island
                        or send him home in the next ship they met. They had also promised him a
                        large share in their plunder. On their return voyage for France Smith was
                        put into the little vessel loaded with sugar. This was separated from the
                        admiral in a storm. She was once hailed by two West Indiamen. When they were
                        answered with the sign of France the vessels went on their way with a
                        parting broadside. Arrived at France, Smith was detained a prisoner in the
                        harbor of Rochelle. He was now accused of being the English captain who had
                        destroyed the French colony at Mount Desert, and was threatened with
                        imprisonment or "a worse mischief." <pb id="VAA2409-300" n="284"/> He
                        therefore took the first occasion to escape. A severe storm came on which
                        drove all on board under hatches. The night was very dark, Smith watched for
                        his opportunity and left the vessel in a little boat. He had but a "half
                        pike" for a paddle, the wind was strong, the waves high, and Captain Smith
                        drifted out to sea. For twelve hours he worked away in his little boat,
                        baling out water on a night when the coast was strewn with wrecks. He at
                        last reached a marshy island, nearly drowned and suffering from cold and
                        hunger. He was found here by some hunters. The admiral's ship, meantime, had
                        been wrecked, the captain and half his company with much of the plunder
                        lost. Smith pawned the little boat for means to reach Rochelle. Here he
                        lodged a complaint with the judge of the Admiralty, supported by some of the
                        sailors as witnesses. We do not learn that he got any thing more than "good
                        words and fair promises," with some paper certifying to the truth of his
                        story, which he presented to the British ambassador at Bordeaux. He received
                        great kindness on all hands, and especially from "the good Lady Chanoyes,"
                        who "bountifully assisted" him. Captain Smith returned to England to find
                        that he had been "buried" by his mutinous sailors. He took measures to
                        punish the ringleaders.</p>

                    <p>J<hi rend="sc">OHN</hi> R<hi rend="sc">OLFE,</hi> who was fond of novel
                        experiments in agriculture as in marriage, is said to have been the pioneer
                        tobacco-planter of Virginia. The raising of tobacco paid the planters so
                        well that for many years there was a constant temptation to neglect the
                        planting of sufficient corn for food. In consequence of scarcity in the
                        colony during the year 1616, the Chickahominy Indians were called upon to
                        furnish a tribute of grain according to their treaty. They refused, however,
                        and Yeardley with one hundred of his best shot marched into their country.
                        Here he was received with contempt. The Indians said he was only Dale's man;
                        they had paid Dale their tribute, but would not pay him. A skirmish ensued,
                        in which twelve Indians were killed and as many made prisoners. These were
                        ransomed with corn, and the Indians were glad to rid themselves of the
                        Englishmen by loading their boats.</p>
                    <p>Powhatan was growing old, and began to fear <pb id="VAA2409-302" n="286"/>
                        his brother Opechancanough. This Indian was as ambitious and influential as
                        Powhatan, while he was younger, and very popular with Indians and whites.
                        Since Opitchapan was both old and decrepit, Powhatan was the only obstacle
                        between him and chief dominion among the Indians. This wily old chief had
                        never loved the English any too well. He had on every occasion refused to
                        enter or approach the white settlements. He would not even go to Jamestown
                        to attend the wedding of his daughter. Powhatan now dreaded lest his
                        ambitious brother should betray him into the hands of the English. He
                        therefore retired to a distance from Jamestown, devoting himself to warding
                        off this danger.</p>
                    <p>The old chief expressed great sorrow when he heard of the death of
                        Pocahontas. He was, however, pleased that her son was living, and both he
                        and Opechancanough said they would like to see him. When Tomocomo returned
                        Powhatan called upon him for the number of people in England. "Count," said
                        Tomocomo, "the stars in the sky, the leaves on the trees, and the sand upon
                        the seashore, for such is the number of the people in England."</p>
                    <p>Captain Argall was now governor of the colony and John Rolfe was his
                        secretary. Argall found <pb id="VAA2409-303" n="287"/> Jamestown on his
                        arrival from England neglected, and the streets planted with tobacco. Poor
                        little town! it was never destined to be great. Sir Thomas Dale had before
                        this preferred to live at Bermuda Hundred. Virginians were fast becoming a
                        widely scattered community of planters, its situation was unhealthy, and
                        much of its site has since been washed away by the river. There still remain
                        some graves and a church tower built of brick brought all the way from
                        England.</p>
                    <p>In the year 1618 Powhatan died. Opitchapan nominally succeeded him, but
                        Opechancanough was far too ambitious and popular to remain in a subordinate
                        position. The power fell really into his hands. When the English came to
                        Virginia, Powhatan had long since established his reputation as a great
                        warrior, and could well afford to rest on his honors; but it was not so with
                        Opechancanough. Had the English known as much of Indian character as we do
                        to-day, they would have feared the younger chief, who had yet a career to
                        make, a reputation as a brave to gain. But Opechancanough renewed the treaty
                        of Powhatan, the English proceeded to scatter their settlements wherever
                        good land for the cultivation of tobacco was to be found, and Indians <pb
                            id="VAA2409-304" n="288"/> went in and out the planters' houses on
                        peaceful and friendly terms.</p>
                    <p>Argall's government was unscrupulous. He was the first public officer in this
                        new country to make money out of the public store. He seems to have been
                        cruel as well as unprincipled. Bitter complaints were sent by the colonists
                        to the Company in England. Meantime Lord Delaware, who had spent much money
                        and time in the service of the Company, again embarked with two hundred
                        emigrants to take into his own hand the government of the colony.
                        Unfortunately, he died on the voyage. Some of the members of the Company
                        soon after sent Argall a very severe letter, accusing him of many wrongs
                        against the Company and colonists. This was accompanied by a letter to Lord
                        Delaware, with many accusations against Argall. Owing to the death of Lord
                        Delaware both of these letters fell into Argall's hands. In October, 1618,
                        when the news of Lord Delaware's death reached England, Captain Yeardley was
                        appointed governor, and before his departure was knighted and treated with a
                        discourse from King James upon the duty of carrying religion to the Indians.
                        Before he reached Virginia, however, Argall was gone, and had turned into
                        the hands of friends his wrongfully <pb id="VAA2409-305" n="289"/> acquired
                        property, quite after the approved manner of public thieves in our time.</p>
                    <p>Sir George Yeardley's government covered the most prosperous years that the
                        colony had yet known. The first representative legislature held within the
                        limits of the United States convened at Jamestown in 1619. The Company had
                        granted the colony an annual assembly of the governor and council with two
                        representatives from each plantation. This assembly met in the chancel of
                        the Jamestown church, and among other things made the following laws: First,
                        against drunkenness, that any man found drunk was to be reproved privately
                        by the minister, if the offence were committed a second time he was to be
                        reproved publicly, the third time he must "lie in bolts" for twelve hours
                        and pay a fine, and if he still persisted he was to suffer such severe
                        punishment as the governor and council should decide upon. "Against
                        excessive apparel," an offence one would think hardly likely to creep into
                        so young a colony, it was enacted that every man should be assessed "in the
                        church for all public contributions; if he be unmarried, according to his
                        own apparel; if he be married, according to his own and his wife's, or
                        either of their apparel." It was found that many of the colonists <pb
                            id="VAA2409-306" n="290"/> being single men did not settle permanently
                        in the colony, but endeavored to make money at tobacco raising, intending to
                        return ultimately to England. The Company resolved to provide wives for the
                        colonists in order to bind them permanently to Virginia. "One widow and
                        eleven maids" were sent over in 1621. The Company in England wished it to be
                        understood that these women had been chosen with great care and came with
                        good recommendations. They were to be "lodged and provided for of diet till
                        they be married." If this did not quickly take place however, they were to
                        be "put to several householders that have wives till they can be provided of
                        husbands." Moreover, a price was set upon wives. Each man must pay a hundred
                        and twenty pounds of "best leaf tobacco" to defray the expense of his wife's
                        importation, and that there might be no dead loss to the Company if one of
                        the girls should die, the expense of her passage must be divided among the
                        husbands of the others. Pains must also be taken lest there should be any
                        cheating in the quality of the tobacco. Shortly after thirty-eight more
                        "maids and young women" were exported by the London Company, with the hope
                        that they would be "received with the same Christian piety and charity" <pb
                            id="VAA2409-307" n="291"/> as the others, from which we may infer that
                        these did not have to wait long for husbands. In the choice of the last,
                        also, the Company had taken "extraordinary care and diligence." They had
                        "good testimony of their honest life and carriage." This testimony, with the
                        name of each girl, was inclosed for the benefit of the husband. They were
                        labelled, so to speak. The price of wives was raised on this lot to one
                        hundred and fifty pounds of tobacco, with an addition if any of the girls
                        should die.</p>
                    <p>"Their own deserts," say the directions to Virginia authorities, "together
                        with your favor and care, will, we hope, marry them all to honest and
                        sufficient men whose means will reach to present repayment, but if any of
                        them shall unwarily or fondly bestow herself (for the liberty of marriage we
                        dare not infringe) upon such as shall not be able to give present
                        satisfaction, we desire at least as soon as ability shall be, they be
                        compelled to pay the true quantity of tobacco proportioned, and that this
                        debt may have precedence of all others to be recovered." The "maids" were
                        welcomed in Virginia. We can imagine a planter going to Jamestown to get him
                        a wife in exchange for a lot of choice tobacco. This sending out of <pb
                            id="VAA2409-308" n="292"/> wives was one of the wisest measures adopted,
                        for when there were wives in the cabin, and children born in the land, the
                        white men felt that Virginia was indeed their home.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> 1621, when Sir Francis Wyat became governor, the peace
                        with Opechancanough was ratified, and that chief seemed to the English to
                        show decided evidences of a religious inclination.</p>
                    <p>The colony of Virginia had grown and increased, spreading its arms wherever
                        fertile land was to be found. Eighty peaceful plantations lay widely
                        scattered and almost entirely unprotected.</p>
                    <p>Totally unsuspected, the religiously inclined Opechancanough laid his plans
                        for an extermination of the whites. Two days before the massacre the savages
                        guided a white man safely through the woods. Up to the very hour appointed
                        for the work to begin Indians lounged tranquilly about the plantations
                        according to their habit. Within the space of an hour or two more than three
                        hundred men, women, and children fell at the hands of the savages, who
                        burned their houses, butchered their cattle, and mangled their dead bodies.
                        One Indian servant out of affection for his master had revealed the plot on
                        the eve of <pb id="VAA2409-310" n="294"/> its accomplishment. By his means
                        Jamestown and the adjacent settlements were warned in the early morning, and
                        thus a much more dreadful destruction was avoided.</p>
                    <p>Great was the consternation in England when the news arrived. The Company no
                        more advised a tender and kindly treatment of the savages. The colonists now
                        hated the Indians with a bitter animosity. They wreaked vengeance on them,
                        they hunted them, they kept great mastiffs and bloodhounds to set upon them.
                        They averred that the dogs took the "naked tanned" savages for "no other
                        than wild beasts," while the Indians themselves feared them "worse than
                        their old devil which they worship, supposing them to be a new and worse
                        kind of devils than their own."</p>
                    <p>Captain Smith was fired with a desire to fight these savages and protect the
                        colony in which he felt so warm an interest. He offered his services to the
                        Company to lead a band of one hundred and thirty men to Virginia, promising
                        to make "a flying camp," with which he would so torment the Indians as
                        either to bring them into subjection or force them to leave the country. He
                        also planned to make such explorations as would bring the two maps of
                        Virginia and New England <pb id="VAA2409-311" n="295"/> together. Many
                        favored his project, but others of the Company considered that the expense
                        would be too great, and so were inclined to let the planters take care of
                        themselves. Smith says he was given to understand that he would be allowed
                        to undertake such an expedition at his own expense and might have the
                        plunder as a reward. But he says, truly, that the plunder to be procured
                        from Indian villages would not amount to twenty pounds in twenty years.</p>
                    <p>The massacre was a great drawback to the Virginia colony. The planters drew
                        together upon some few plantations for safety, and it was some time before
                        the Virginians gained a feeling of security and Virginia's prosperity
                        returned to her.</p>
                    <p>Opechancanough was a savage of the savages, crafty, cruel, and proud. Twenty
                        years later he instituted another massacre of the ever-encroaching settlers.
                        He was supposed to be nearly a hundred years old, and very feeble. But his
                        fierce ambition had by no means subsided with oncoming age. He led his men,
                        and the deadly work was the most destructive where he was in person. But no
                        resistance to white settlement could avail for the Indians of Virginia.
                        Opechancanough was taken prisoner. The once straight <pb id="VAA2409-312"
                            n="296"/> and active warrior was bent and emaciated. He was so weak that
                        he was carried on a litter from place to place. The muscles of his eyelids
                        were paralyzed so that he could not raise them. He was carried to Jamestown
                        and well used, but was naturally an object of curiosity. Hearing one day the
                        sound of many footsteps the old chief commanded his attendants to raise his
                        eyelids. He saw himself surrounded by a crowd of people curious to see the
                        famous Opechancanough. He sent for Sir William Berkley, the governor. "Had
                        it been my fortune," said the proud old man, "to have taken Sir William
                        Berkley prisoner, I would not have meanly exposed him as a show to my
                        people."</p>
                    <p>Soon after this the old chief was shamefully shot in the back by his keeper,
                        no doubt in revenge for his massacre of some family of women and
                    children.</p>

                        seem to have come to an end while he was yet young. He lived to see
                        successful colonies thriving in the two lands of his affection, Virginia and
                        New England. Had these perished he would no doubt have buckled on his armor
                        again and planted anew.</p>
                    <p>During the later years of his life he published many books, and a general
                        history of Virginia appeared under his supervision, but chiefly written by
                        others, and edited by the Rev. Dr. Symonds. Captain John Smith died in 1631,
                        in the fifty-second year of his age. He was buried in St. Sepulchre's
                        Church, in London, where the following inscription was set up to his memory:</p>

                    </lg>
                    <p>Of Smith's explorations, Robertson says in his famous History of America:</p>
                    <p>"After sailing three thousand miles in a paltry vessel, ill-fitted for such
                        an extensive navigation, during which the hardships to which he was exposed,
                        as well as the patience with which he endured and the fortitude with which
                        he surmounted them, equal whatever is related of the most famous Spanish
                        discoverers in their most daring enterprises, he returned to Jamestown; he
                        brought with him an account of that large <pb id="VAA2409-315" n="299"/>
                        portion of the American continent now [in 1774] comprehended in the two
                        provinces of Virginia and Maryland, so full and exact that after the
                        progress of information and research for a century and a half his map
                        exhibits no inaccurate view of both countries, and is the original upon
                        which all subsequent delineations and descriptions have been formed."</p>
                    <p>Of the private character of our great captain we may judge by what one of
                        Smith's former soldiers says of him:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">"I never knew a warrior yet but thee,</l>
                        <l n="2">From wine, tobacco, debts, dice, oaths so free."</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>Captain Smith was in his own day and until our time honored as the hero of
                        Virginia. But there is a pedantic pride which loves to show its knowledge by
                        unhorsing the heroes of history. In our own time the writings of Wingfield,
                        Newport, and others, recently brought to light, have been used to discredit
                        the narratives of Smith. Men have even assailed him with bitterness, and a
                        recent writer intimates that he was a "gascon and a beggar," though the same
                        author thinks that Virginia ought to erect a monument to his fame!</p>
                    <p>Men were not so careful of historical accuracy in the days of James I. as
                        they are to-day. History <pb id="VAA2409-316" n="300"/> in our sense of the
                        word was hardly known in English literature. The public expected travellers
                        to please them with well-varnished stories. That Smith may have allowed his
                        imagination too much play in setting down romantic facts from memory is not
                        improbable. It was the bad fashion of travellers in the sixteenth and
                        seventeenth centuries. But the statements of Newport, Wingfield, and
                        Ratcliffe, all enemies to Captain John Smith, and who yet say more to
                        confirm than to contradict him, are certainly not entitled to half the
                        weight of Smith's writings. For, on any theory, Wingfield was grossly
                        incompetent, Newport was as helpless as a porpoise when he set foot on land,
                        not efficient in exploring and foolish in negotiating, while Captain
                        Ratcliffe was an adventurer sailing under the false flag of an assumed name.</p>
                    <p>There are two fields in which we are able to test Captain Smith's veracity.
                        His map of the region about the Chesapeake remains to-day a wonderfully
                        accurate chart, when we consider that he lacked the use of modern
                        instruments for survey. His descriptions of the country are always correct,
                        and his accounts of the manners and customs of the Indians are in the main
                        true to the life, as we know the slow-changing Algonquin tribes of to-day.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2409-317" n="301"/>
                    <p>Now, if we remember the solid qualities of Smithif we remember the fact that
                        at the beginning of the settlement at Jamestown he was excluded from the
                        council and condemned by the other leaders, and that he was afterwards the
                        one man who could manage the settlers and the savages, the man who, by the
                        sheer force of necessity, was brought to the front and made presidentwe
                        shall see how little ground there is for these aspersions of his character.
                        Add to this that he was, after his return, a member of the London Council of
                        the Company, and that the Virginia Company and the Plymouth Company competed
                        for his services, and we can understand how little he deserves to be
                        condemned on the testimony of the incompetent, whom he pushed to the wall
                        for the sake of saving the colony. Make what reductions we may in his own
                        narrative or in the testimony of his friends, accept for truth all that is
                        said by his enemies, and on any possible theory of events John Smith
                        remains, of all that quarrelsome company, the one man whose
                        disinterestedness, courage, address, perseverance, and weight of character
                        fitted him to save colonists from the result of their own folly and from the
                        craft of the savages. Is such a hardy leader of forlorn hopes, such an
                        explorer of new rivers, <pb id="VAA2409-318" n="302"/> such a terror to
                        crafty savages, likely to be found in the person of "a gascon and a beggar"?
                        Not Virginia alone, but the nation ought to erect a monument to the first
                        explorer, the first defender, and the first historian of the country.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> story of Captain Smith's deliverance was not
                        mentioned in his "True Relation," published in England in 1608, nor in the
                        historical notices printed with his "Map of Virginia" at Oxford, 1612. It
                        first appears while Pocahontas was in England in 1616 or 1617, in a letter
                        addressed by Smith to the queen in behalf of the "Lady Rebecca" or
                        Pocahontas. Nor does any account of his romantic deliverance appear in
                        Wingfield's very brief narrative. The circumstantial account first appears
                        in the "Generall Historie of Virginia," published in 1624. This book was
                        gathered out of the writings of many writers, and was edited by Dr. Symonds,
                        though it was issued in Smith's name. In consequence of its not appearing in
                        the earlier accounts, the incident has of late years been very generally
                        given up by historians as a romantic tale invented by the gallant captain
                        after the daughter of Powhatan became famous <pb id="VAA2409-320" n="304"/>
                        as the first convert to Christianity, and the first Indian woman married to
                        an Englishman. We have thought it better to give the narrative in the text
                        as it is given in Smith's General History, and to reserve a statement of its
                        doubtfulness for this note.</p>
                    <p>Nor do we consider it quite clear that the pleasing story must be given up.
                        There are yet so many unsolved questions about Jamestown and about
                        Pocahontas, that we may have to return to the old belief in the veracity of
                        Smith. In the "True Relation," published in 1608, he praises Pocahontas as
                        "a child of ten years old which not only for feature, countenance, and
                        proportion much exceeded any of the rest of his [Powhatan's] people, but for
                        wit and spirit the only non-pareil of his country." If we suppose that this
                        child had delivered Smith, but that for some motive unknown to us he or his
                        editor suppressed the account, this praise seems natural. If not, why should
                        he thus praise this Indian girl? He mentions farther on that she was sent as
                        a messenger to intercede for certain savages that had been detained. Why
                        should Powhatan send so young a child to accompany a messenger on a
                        difficult mission? Why entrust his daughter to the whites? If she had
                        delivered Smith all this <pb id="VAA2409-321" n="305"/> would be natural
                        enough. It is all very difficult on any other supposition.</p>
                    <p>Again Pocahontas was always afterwards a friend and benefactor to the whites,
                        helping and warning them. She was especially devoted to Smith, and when she
                        was married to Rolfe she had been made to believe that Captain Smith was
                        dead. When she met Smith in England she was much moved. All of these things
                        are of the same piece with Smith's story of her interference in his behalf.</p>
                    <p>The "True Relation" was published somewhat mysteriously. Some copies bear the
                        name of Thomas Watson, with a preface explaining that it was a printer's
                        blunder, others the name of John Smith, others read "By a Gentleman of said
                        Colony." This variation is clearly made in the same form of the title-page.
                        The initials "I. H." are signed to the preface. Who is I. H.? Why this
                        halting about the name of the author? It is confessed that the editor came
                        upon his copy at second or third hand; that is, we suppose that it had been
                        copied in MS. He also confesses to omitting what he thought "fit to be
                        private." All account of the adventurous voyage is left out either by the
                        author or the editor. Some sentences are incomprehensible even to so careful
                        an <pb id="VAA2409-322" n="306"/> editor as Mr. Charles Deane, who reprinted
                        the tract in 1866, and the name of Captain Smith does not appear in it
                        throughout. Can any one doubt that the "True Relation" was carefully
                        revised, not to say corrupted, in the interest of the Company and of the
                        colony? And if so, what more natural than that the hostility of so powerful
                        a chief as Powhatan would be concealed? For the great need of the colony was
                        a fresh supply of colonists. Nothing would have so much tended to check
                        emigration to Virginia as a belief that the most powerful neighboring prince
                        was at enmity with the settlement. (The same reason may have procured the
                        omission of the fight at Kecoughtan-Hampton, as related in Chapter IV. of
                        this book; though indeed that story has a marvellous sound as told in the
                        General History.)</p>
                    <p>While, therefore, much doubt is thrown upon the incident of Smith's
                        deliverance by Pocahontas on account of its omission from the earlier
                        accounts, there are some reasons for believing it to be true.</p>

                    <head>NOTE 2. THE SURVIVORS OF THE ROANOKE COLONY.</head>
                    <p>William Strachey, who makes the statement about the slaughter of the
                        survivors of the colony <pb id="VAA2409-323" n="307"/> by Powhatan, in his
                        "Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia," has the following curious
                        sentence:</p>
                    <p>"At Peccarecamek and Ochanahoen, by the relation of Machumps [an Indian], the
                        people have houses built with stone walls, so taught them by those English
                        who escaped the slaughter at Roanoake, at what time this our colony under
                        conduct of Captain Newport landed within the Chesapeake Bay, where the
                        people had up tame turkeys and take apes in the mountains; and where at
                        Ritanoe, the Werowance Eyanoco preserved seven of the English alivefour men,
                        two boys, and one young maid (who escaped and fled up the river Chanoke)to
                        beat his copper, of which he had certain mines at Ritanoe." (1849, p. 26.)</p>
                    <p>That is to say, if we disentangle it rightly, that Eyanoco, chief at Ritanoe,
                        preserved the lives of seven of the English settlers, to beat his copper and
                        build his houses, and that these colonists were yet alive when Captain
                        Newport landed at Jamestown. From another very obscure passage we infer that
                        Machumps or some other Indian had told Strachey that Powhatan, instigated by
                        his priests, had sent into the country where these captives were, and put
                        them to death after the <pb id="VAA2409-324" n="308"/> settlement of
                        Jamestown, where the survivors of Roanoke had "twenty odd years peaceably
                        lived intermixed with those savages." This massacre may have been to prevent
                        communication with Jamestown by rival chiefs through the captives. If,
                        indeed, Strachey were not imposed on by the facile invention of an Indian
                        story teller, making a tale to suit the demands of his auditors, as others
                        had invented gold mines and an easy route to the Pacific to gratify the
                        whites. Strachey evidently believes his story, for he refers to it again and
                        again, proposing at one time to make it a ground for alliance with
                        neighboring chiefs against Powhatan (p. 103).</p>
                    <p>Lawson's History (1718) is quoted in the Transactions of the American
                        Antiquarian Society, vol. iv., p. 37, as citing a tradition among the
                        Hatteras Indians "that several of their ancestors were white people, and
                        could talk from a book; the truth of which is confirmed by gray eyes being
                        among these Indians and no other." But this proves little about the Roanoke
                        colony. If Strachey had finished his book we should perhaps have known more,
                        for he promised a fuller account in a future chapter. But he was, we fear, a
                        somewhat eager collector of stories; though there is nothing inherently
                        improbable in <pb id="VAA2409-325" n="309"/> his account of the fate of the
                        whites. But what shall we do with the apes which the Indians caught in the
                        mountains of North Carolina? (See the next note.)</p>

                <div2 type="section">
                    <head>NOTE 3. PREVIOUS MARRIAGE OF POCAHONTAS.</head>
                    <p>William Strachey, referred to in Note 2, uses these words in an account of
                        Powhatan's family: "and besides young Pocohunta, a daughter of his, using
                        sometime to our fort in times past, now married to a private captain called
                        Kocoum some two years since." (Strachey, p. 54.) As Indian marriages were
                        often fast and loose affairs, and as Powhatan sold his daughters in
                        marriage, and gave away his wives when he tired of them, it might well be
                        that Pocahontas was living with a husband when Argall captured her. The
                        English, with the religious prejudices of the time, would not think much of
                        the sanctity of a pagan marriage, and would not halt at anything that stood
                        in the way of the conversion of Pocahontas to Christianity. But it is worth
                        while to remember that Strachey probably wrote his book, according to the
                        best judges, more than two years after his return to England, and that he
                        could only know of the marriage to a private captain or petty chief, two
                        years previous <pb id="VAA2409-326" n="310"/> to his writing, by report of
                        others, and that he may very well have mistaken a report of the marriage of
                        any other of Powhatan's daughters for that of Pocahontas. If she had been
                        previously married, we should probably not have wanted for others to certify
                        that fact, and there would then have been no need of the suggestions of
                        various writers mentioned in the text as to the causes of her residence on
                        the Potomac. Or might he not have written as late as the early part of 1616,
                        before Rolfe's arrival in England? And this "private captain," may he not be
                        John Rolfe, transformed by some confusion of memory or mistake of a copyist
                        into Kocoum? We nowhere find the word <hi rend="i">captain</hi> applied to
                        an Indian. Strachey's book was first printed from the manuscript in the
                        British Museum in 1849.</p>
