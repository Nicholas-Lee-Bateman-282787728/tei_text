                    <l>The awful curtain; on our trembling souls</l>

                    <l>Fit for the gods, and all too good for men.</l>
                    <l>Thou witless student, authors have two eyes,</l>
                    <l>As many thou! with complement of ears,</l>
                    <l>(Though rather long ones); pray, had Plato more?</l>
                    <l>Bacon could smell and taste, and finger coin</l>
                    <l>As saith tradition; and great Socrates</l>

                    <l>Thou shalt be learn’d and famous ere thou die.</l>
                    <l>Thou ever lookest thro’ the telescope</l>
                    <l>Of great dead minds, seeing the shores remote</l>
                    <l>Of past and future time; thine own poor nose</l>

                    <l>Leaving us here forlorn to read her past?</l>
                    <l>Or do they rather live a fuller life,</l>
                    <l>Now dropping blessing down like fruitful rain</l>

                    <l>Matter yet plastic from the hand of God,</l>
                    <l>And spirits welling up from founts divine,</l>

                    <l>As I to Goethe then); and, so equipp’d,</l>

                    <l>A slowly winding road</l>

                    <l>A fringe of ferns cut into delicate shapes</l>
                    <l>By Nature’s graving tool, and richly dyed</l>
                    <l>In every shade of green, grew lavishly,</l>
                    <l>Rejoicing, quiet things, to be alive.</l>
                    <l>So wound we up, till unawares we gain’d</l>
                    <l>The broad high table‐land, and to our eyes,</l>
                    <l>Our dazzled, utterly astonish’d eyes,</l>
                    <l>Broke all that sea of heather, purple ton’d,</l>

                    <l>A luscious carpet far as eye could see,</l>
                    <l>Variously shaded, and the cotton‐rush</l>
                    <l>Here and there flecking with its snow‐white plume</l>
                    <l>The great expanse; and by us brown game‐birds</l>
                    <l>Went whirring in sharp fear. Ne’er in my life</l>
                    <l>Had I seen such a sight, and I stood dumb</l>
                    <l>In awful wonder. Leonard said, “God’s book</l>

                    <l>In a point of time</l>
                    <l>I seem’d to read long chapters, every word</l>
                    <l>Cramm’d full with meaning, and the strangest thoughts</l>
                    <l>Came over me; the great indwelling soul</l>
                    <l>Of all this beauty spake my heart within,</l>
                    <l>While in my veins a richer life‐blood ran;</l>
                    <l>The chaos of my fancy open’d out</l>
                    <l>Into an order never known before;</l>
                    <l>New thoughts, new paintings, and new poems rose</l>
                    <l>Like dreams of a futurity, more bright</l>
                    <l>Than ever was my past; I thought I heard</l>
                    <l>The stars all singing, though I saw them not,</l>
                    <l>And the earth swell the chorus; their song said,</l>
                    <l>“Glory to God who made the Beautiful!”</l>
                    <l>“Glory to God!” I said, and down my cheeks</l>
                    <l>Tears rain’d for gladness, till I could not see</l>
                    <l>The heather or the sunshine. Leonard then—</l>
                    <l>For he was of a different nature, strong</l>
                    <l>And blithe as mountain colt—bid me come on</l>
                    <l>And try another page, and while he went</l>
                    <l>He sang at topmost voice, “What shall he have</l>
                    <l>That kills the deer? the horn, the horn to wear;”</l>
                    <l>Or else the “Greenwood Tree.”</l>

                    <l>And so we pass’d</l>
                    <l>Over the hills, unto what seem’d a brink</l>
                    <l>O’erlooking half a world; hill after hill</l>
                    <l>Around us lay, encircling a great vale</l>
                    <l>Of many miles’ extent; and to the right</l>
                    <l>An opening stretch’d away: we thither bent</l>
                    <l>Our steps, and gain’d a verdant pasture deep</l>
                    <l>In shadow of thick trees, beside the Wharf,</l>
                    <l>Where comfortable monks had built a church,</l>
                    <l>And dwellings for themselves, and pray’d and eat,</l>
                    <l>And drank and eat and pray’d and drank again,</l>
                    <l>And taught the neighbouring poor some little lore,</l>
                    <l>And gave them alms, and gossip’d; no place this</l>
                    <l>For rigid anchorite of dreams divine,</l>
                    <l>But rather in these blossoming Bolton woods</l>
                    <l>Might all the Greek and Roman poets lie</l>
                    <l>Out of the reach of harm on dusty shelves,</l>
                    <l>And prophesy—the unrighteous pagans—times</l>
                    <l>When Bolton Abbey should lie low, and they</l>
                    <l>Should, in quotations, illustrate its fall.</l>
                    <l>But we were not to that offence inclin’d;</l>
                    <l>Little of Roman or of Greek thought we,</l>
                    <l>But only of sweet England and her bards.</l>
                    <l>Down to the river thirstily we went,</l>
                    <l>Where yet no deeper than a child’s blue eyes</l>
                    <l>It sparkled over stones; the yonder side</l>
                    <l>A rocky bank rose steeply, hung with trees.</l>
                    <l>There did we lie and dream in the hot noon;</l>
                    <l>Leonard read Shakespeare’s songs, as was his wont</l>
                    <l>Whenever he was glad. I hid my face</l>
                    <l>Far in the thick rich grass, and poems sang,</l>
                    <l>Within my spirit, of the olden days,</l>
                    <l>And then about the ruins and the trees,</l>

                    <l>And children paddling in the river. I</l>
                    <l>Seem’d verily like an Æolian harp that day;</l>
                    <l>I was so mov’d by Nature that I sway’d</l>
                    <l>Beneath her like a willow to and fro;</l>
                    <l>And ever as a song came in at one ear,</l>
                    <l>I felt constrain’d to sing it, and it went</l>
                    <l>Out at the other. So we lay till dusk;</l>
                    <l>Then, when the silver moon in beauty rose</l>
                    <l>Into the dark blue sky, and twinkling stars</l>
                    <l>Rose over Bolton, shimmering in the Wharf,</l>
                    <l>We back return’d. Over the heathery moors,</l>
                    <l>Now darkly radiant, silently we went.</l>

                    <l>At their own beauty; and the sportive fish</l>
                    <l>Leapt up, in their unviolated home</l>
                    <l>Fearless of heart; ’twas on an autumn day,</l>

                        <l>Fell the large tears from her mist‐blinded eyes.</l>
                        <l>Now rang the silver bells of Dawn; sweet smells</l>
                        <l>Breath’d from the wakening flowers; a streak of light</l>
                        <l>Was mirror’d in the sea; and Night arose,</l>
                        <l>Gathering her robe, retreating towards the west,</l>
                        <l>Till in its farthest depths her lofty form</l>
                        <l>Was lost, and all her path refulgent shone</l>
                        <l>With jewels, and the Day, advancing, shook</l>
                        <l>Perfume and music from his golden curls.</l>

                    <l>The fields all tranquil, and the waters calm.</l>
                    <l>Each drowsy flower hung down its gentle head,</l>
                    <l>The murmur of each insect died away,</l>

                    <l>A noble city and a nation’s pride,</l>
                    <l>Set in a lovely frame of sloping hills,</l>
                    <l>And girdled by a river, where the sun</l>

                    <l>Then to the distant height whereon I stood</l>

                    <l>And guesses at the unknown depth below.</l>
                    <l>Musing, I clos’d my eyes, and visions rose</l>
                    <l>In long array before them—of times past,</l>
                    <l>And times to come; and pictures of true life</l>
                    <l>Even at the moment painting stirr’d my tears.</l>

                    <l>Small sign of beauty or of wealth was there,</l>

                    <l>The fiat had gone forth, “The child must die;”</l>
                    <l>And wherefore? kill’d by very want and care.</l>
                    <l>It never play’d by marge of river clear,</l>
                    <l>It nothing knew of natural sounds or scents,</l>
                    <l>Nor thought of things divine; it only knew</l>
                    <l>A coarse humanity, a Godless world</l>
                    <l>Of streets and alleys, an avenging law:</l>
                    <l>So, one of many children, thus it died.</l>
                    <l>Father and mother mourn’d it all alone,</l>
                    <l>And weeping stood beside the little grave,</l>

                    <l>Quiet and holy, in some nest alone,</l>
                    <l>Was this grave made; no sound of village bells</l>
                    <l>Lull’d him to sleep; but where the rattling wheels</l>
                    <l>And loud shrill voices broke their darling’s rest</l>
                    <l>Throughout the day, and all the dismal night,</l>

                <l>A gentle hill unto the southern beam;</l>
                <l>Such was our father’s. Many fountains leap’d</l>
                <l>With murmuring music in the soften’d light,</l>

                <l>Of each carv’d basin, and, slow trickling down,</l>
                <l>Deepen’d the gracious hue of turfy lawns.</l>
                <l>There in profusion glow’d such gorgeous flowers</l>
                <l>As thou of northern birth hast never seen—</l>
                <l>The paler children of thy English home</l>

                <l>’Midst stately verdant walls of closest trim,</l>
                <l>Wherein our ancestors took such delight;</l>
                <l>Hawthorn and myrtle hedges, and thick wreaths</l>
                <l>Of honeysuckle flaunting in the breeze;</l>

                <l>Of the Campagna, we transplanted there;</l>
                <l>Such passionate flowers, daughters of Italy,</l>

                <l>Instinct with grace, who peopled solemn groves</l>
                <l>With genius, tho’ the master‐hand were cold.</l>

                <l><hi>I WAS</hi> a child when first I read your books,</l>

                <l>Being then (as still, perhaps,) a mystery.</l>

                <l>Whose image took my bookcase for a throne.</l>
                <l>As time went on, your words flew far and wide,</l>
                <l>I heard them quoted, critically scann’d</l>
                <l>With grave intentness, learnt, half mournfully,</l>
                <l>That you were <emph rend="i">a great Poet in the land</emph>,</l>
                <l>So far, so far from me, who lov’d you so,</l>
                <l>And never might one human blessing claim;</l>
                <l>Yet oh! how I rejoic’d that you were great,</l>
                <l>And all my heart exulted in your fame;</l>
                <l>A woman’s fame, and <emph rend="i">yours</emph>! I use no words</l>
                <l>Of any careful beauty, being plain</l>
                <l>As earnestness, and quiet as that Truth</l>
                <l>Which shrinks from any flattering speech with pain.</l>

                <l>Long nurs’d, demands expression, and alone</l>
                <l>Speaks by love’s dear strength—to approach near you</l>
                <l>In words so weak and poor beside your own.</l>

                <head>To E.B.</head>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l><hi>I SAW</hi> you seated in your lonely room,</l>
                    <l>Of human friends forlorn, of spirits full,</l>
                    <l>Who gave you comfort in your solitude,</l>
                    <l>And spoke to you in accents beautiful.</l>
                    <l>Hearing your voice, unknown, my spirit leapt</l>
                    <l>(Which, knowing, I have learnt to call so dear),</l>
                    <l>Fond memory of that first hour have I kept,</l>
                    <l>Tho’ scantly its result recorded here;</l>
                    <l>But in my heart such thoughts to it belong,</l>
                    <l>As hath, of its little fount, a river deep and strong.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>And now to those far shores, I say, God speed,</l>
                    <l>Where I have never been, but often now</l>
                    <l>That anxious heart will of your path take heed,</l>
                    <l>And daily pray success may crown your brow,</l>
                    <l>Shedding its glory on your quiet face,</l>
                    <l>Which needs that baptism, dear friend, no less</l>
                    <l>That you are strong, upheld in no embrace,</l>
                    <l>And, deeply natur’d, if unbless’d could bless.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>By years of loving hope at length fulfill’d</l>
                    <l>In our true friendship, by a common aim,</l>
                    <l>By weariness subdu’d and doubtings still’d,</l>
                    <l>By joint allegiance to a slander’d name;</l>
                    <l>By that eternity towards which we speed,</l>
                    <l>By glorious faiths we would incarnate here,</l>
                    <l>By ties which nor of space nor time take heed,</l>
                    <l>I charge you, going hence, to hold me dear.</l>
