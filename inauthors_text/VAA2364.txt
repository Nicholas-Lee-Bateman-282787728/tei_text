                TO JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY
                
                    
                        YOU came when song itself was tame,
                    
                    
                        Though many strove with idle aim
                    
                    
                        Like moths about the sacred flame
                    
                    
                        On ignorant wing;
                    
                    
                        You scorned, in beaten trails of fame,
                    
                    
                        To walk and sing.
                    
                
                
                    
                        You borrowed not Apollo's sign
                    
                    
                        Affixed to many a lifeless line;
                    
                    
                        You sought not the dim shadowy Nine
                    
                    
                        Obscure, remote:
                    
                    
                        You wove the human and divine
                    
                    
                        In one clear note!
                    
                
                
                    
                        You would not strive with them that deign
                    
                    
                        To seek on chaff-strewn floors for grain,
                    
                    
                        And even for trampled husks are fain,
                    
                    
                        But, in the field,
                    
                    
                        You strove with infinite care to gain
                    
                    
                        Life's golden yield.
                    
                
                
                
                    
                        You sought no high and strenuous key
                    
                    
                        To mark your new blithe minstrelsy,
                    
                    
                        Invoked no shrine on bended knee,
                    
                    
                        In Greece or Rome,
                    
                    
                        But, all ungyved, your spirit free
                    
                    
                        Sang most of home!
                    
                
                
                    
                        In the lone farm-house you laid bare
                    
                    
                        The drama of its toil and care,
                    
                    
                        But making love triumphant there
                    
                    
                        Rise strong and sweet,
                    
                    
                        Like herbs that scent the summer air,
                    
                    
                        Bruised 'neath our feet.
                    
                
                
                    
                        'Twas your voice sang the yet unsung
                    
                    
                        Faith of a people brave and young
                    
                    
                        To whose rude speech a wild tang clung,
                    
                    
                        Of clean earth born,
                    
                    
                        The variant Saxon of our tongue
                    
                    
                        You did not scorn!
                    
                
                
                
                    
                        You heard, in dewy haunts of spring,
                    
                    
                        The treble note of childhood ring,
                    
                    
                        The homing stroke you taught its wing
                    
                    
                        That you, again,
                    
                    
                        Might woo that vagrant note and sing
                    
                    
                        Once more its strain.
                    
                
                
                    
                        Not mine the right to sing your praise
                    
                    
                        Nor twine for you the deathless bays,
                    
                    
                        But mine to walk in lighted ways
                    
                    
                        Lured by your rhyme,
                    
                    
                        Glad for the faith through faithless days
                    
                    
                        You shield from Time.
                    
                
                
                    
                        And you still hold, as at the start,
                    
                    
                        That which God set for you apart
                    
                    
                        Faith, Love and Trust, that in your heart
                    
                    
                        Keep its song pure,
                    
                    
                        And the magician gift of art,
                    
                    
                        And these endure!

                    WHERE FOUR WINDS MEET
                    
                        FROM homes beyond the farthest space
                        The winds come to their trysting-place.
                        Swiftly from north, east, south and west
                        Assembled on some lonely crest,
                        Or gathered where the murmuring pines
                        Have summoned them by secret signs,
                        They tell of journeys over seas
                        And whisper of earth's mysteries.
                        They know why strong sap-currents sing
                        Through northern trees in earliest spring,
                        And why bold flowers put bravely forth
                        In snowy woodlands of the north.
                        Such things he learns whose guided feet
                        May find the place where four winds meet.
                    
                    
                        It is not true the winds are foes,
                        Though some bring buds and some bring snows;
                        For they divide the earth's estate
                        
                        As friendly kings might arbitrate,
                        And each is sovereign any hour
                        The mighty land is in its power.
                        They find delight in bold surprise
                        And would defeat man's prophecies.
                        Ships put not forth, seeds are not sown
                        Until the favoring gales have blown;
                        The destinies of nations wait
                        The winds that ruin or create.
                        These secret things he learns whose feet
                        May find the place where four winds meet.
                    
                    
                        Through summer woods at night's high tide
                        Lone winds from far horizons ride,
                        So quickly gone, so faint of wing,
                        Ear scarce may catch their whispering.
                        And no one knows from what far home
                        Those idle messengers may roam,
                        Nor any more may seek to gain
                        Their purpose from the weather-vane!
                        But swift those tides unchallenged flow
                        Where only silent trees bend low
                        
                        A stir of leaves, a sudden hush,
                        A thrill runs through the underbrush,
                        Then, he who runs with wingd feet,
                        May find the place where four winds meet!
                    
                    
                        Now I have sped in many a race
                        To find this secret trysting-place;
                        North, east, south, west have I been led,
                        Sometimes in hope but oft in dread,
                        Fearing to pause yet scorning rest,
                        Pursuing ceaselessly my quest,
                        For, whether on the land it be
                        Or foamy meadow of the sea
                        I find at last the tryst, lo, there
                        The tyrant captains of the air
                        Shall yield to me each plot and plan
                        By which they rule the world, and man
                        Thenceforth may walk with careless feet,
                        Indifferent where the four winds meet.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE WIND AT WHITSUNTIDE
                    
                        I
                        MAN names the stars across the gulfs of space
                        And calls the sea to tribute, and doth mock
                        The storm and lightning and the earthquake shock,
                        And lifts from lonely peaks
                        Toward the stars his still triumphant face;
                        But the far-driven, pathless winds of God
                        He still in ignorance seeks,
                        Crying his whence and whither with vain breath
                        Where in soft airs the tranquil gardens nod,
                        Or pondering the wind's will
                        Along the pine-hung hill
                        And where the trumpet seas roll round the gates of death.
                    
                    
                        II
                        First of the Blessd Three,
                        The adored, august and mighty Trinity
                        Jehovah to earth came
                        
                        In mystery and awe,
                        And gave to Israel out of cloud and flame
                        His iron-harsh, immitigable law
                        That for the rough, new-builded world was meet.
                        But man still restless yearned
                        For groves of peace whose springs should bubble sweet;
                        Nor smoking altars satisfied his need,
                        Nor fat of richest pastures sacrificed,
                        And Heaven seemed far indeed,
                        A fortress grim on an embattled slope,
                        Where hotly on dull eyes the shining bastions burned.
                        'Twas then the Christ
                        With love renewed man's hope,
                        Bringing the ark of peace down from the skies,
                        And out of golden deeds uprearing faith anew;
                        Nor Sinai's lightnings blinded more man's eyes,
                        But gentleness was crowned and meekness blessed,
                        While brighter shone the goal
                        To mankind seeking rest
                        
                        The long-sought haven of the laboring soul,
                        In Christ alone possessed;
                        And down the ages the bright marvel grew
                        That what is just and beautiful and true
                        Within the broad dome of near Heaven lies.
                    
                    
                        III
                        Thus of the Three
                        The high-ordained mysterious Trinity,
                        Jehovah and the Son
                        Man's need hath earthward won;
                        But who has seen or heard
                        The last, the majestic and ineffable One
                        And known His audible word?
                        To-night, midway of seas,
                        Out of the star-hung prairies glad with corn,
                        Out of the deep-pulsed, steady heart of Time,
                        Out of the golden pillars of the morn
                        A great wind thundered by,
                        Voicing a hymn in deep sonorous rhyme,
                        And tossed in billows the June-vestured trees.
                        Across the odorous, sweet, low-murmuring night
                        
                        I marked its urgent flight,
                        Then heard its laggard legion round me wake and sigh.
                        That wind, methought, may be
                        Breath of the brooding and exalted One
                        Who cometh in secrecy,
                        Far-ranging the bright track of star and sun!
                        Holier is earth for every wind that blows;
                        The challenged ocean 'mid its tumult sings
                        Exultant in God's might,
                        And on the mountain height
                        The retreating tempest flings
                        The gleaming vesture of divine repose.
                    
                    
                        IV
                        O Winds, far-driven and lost
                        In the uncharted ether's high demesne,
                        Com'st thou to greet
                        Earth newly with the tongues of Pentecost?
                        Is't thus the Paraclete,
                        Veiled from earth's seald eyes,
                        Doth from high Heaven lean
                        
                        Brooding o'er earth and sea?
                        O Winds, pour over me
                        Out of thy vast inviolable treasury
                        Thy winnowing, cleansing tide!
                        Anoint me from thy azure spaces wide!
                        Nearer than man's surmise
                        The Spirit of Spirits doth round about us bide,
                        The manifest breath and presence of the Three!
                        Thus doth Jehovah out of space
                        Again with man speak face to face;
                        And thus o'er earth Christ breathes again
                        The peace of the Judean plain,
                        The hope of all this earth may be!
                        And thus o'er plains and hills
                        The tides of the four winds flow;
                        Thus the glad earth thrills
                        When the trumpets of Heaven blow;
                        And messengers earthward winging
                        On marvelous errands fly;
                        While the world-heart wakes to singing
                        And the Spirit of God is nigh!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE VALLEY OF VISION
                    Isaiah XXII, 1 and 5
                    
                        OVER what peaks does it lie, the wonderful Valley of Vision,
                        Withholden afar in the realm of the Spirit of Rest?
                        Is it a verdurous cleft in the shadowy mountains elysian,
                        Hidden by mist and cloud where the suns go down in the
                            west?
                        I never may find the place, the wonderful Valley of Vision,
                        Though seeking for long the path that leads to its
                            singing streams;
                        The mountains unyielding stand, they laugh at my search in
                            derision,
                        Yet ever in faith I seek the hidden Valley of
                        Dreams.

                        IT is a presence sweet and rare,
                        A something oft attained by Art,
                        Yet oft possessed, all unaware,
                        By folk of simple mind and heart.
                    
                    
                        And he that has it can not pass
                        The secret on with gold or name;
                        It vanishes like dew on grass,
                        Or heat that hovers over flame.
                    
                    
                        In books that man but little seeks,
                        Neglected or forgotten long,
                        This living essence dwells, and speaks
                        In happy rhymes of deathless song.
                    
                    
                        The subtlest of all mystic things,
                        'Tis strange indeed that it should be,
                        When worn by poets, beggars, kings,
                        The garment of Simplicity.
                    
                    
                    
                        And you that seek it never find,
                        And you that have it never tell;
                        And all that strive to catch and bind
                        Can only startle and dispel.

                        PRINT not my Book of Days, I pray,
                        On meager page, in type compact,
                        Lest the Great Reader's calm eye stray
                        Skippingly through from fact to fact;
                    
                    
                        But let there be a liberal space,
                        At least 'twixt lines where ill is writ,
                        That I with tempering hand may trace
                        A word to dull the edge of it.
                    
                    
                        And save for me a margin wide
                        Where I may scribble at my ease
                        Elucidative note and guide
                        Of most adroit apologies!
                    
                
                
                
                    CHORDS
                    
                        THOUGHTS of deep pine-woods and of chanting seas
                        Follow the magic hand-touch on the keys;
                        Now 'tis the violins that loudest cry,
                        And now in saddest key the 'cellos sigh,
                        Blent with the lonely challenge of the horn,
                        Echoed, in seeming, from some height forlorn.
                        Again, the drums and viols with sullen roar
                        Break with their sound-waves on the mind's dim shore,
                        And sullenly die away. 'Tis then there come
                        Out from the cymbal-clash and roll of drum
                        Chords that are love and life, and even the sharp,
                        Hard pain of deathchords of the golden harp.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE WIND PATROL
                    
                        NO guard ventures to ask toll
                        Of the wind's midnight patrol,
                        And no eyes, however keen,
                        Have its flying legion seen;
                        Yet a thousand times and one
                        I have heard the vanguard run!
                        In the peaceful summer night
                        Or when snows lie cold and white,
                        From their far unmapped abode,
                        In contempt of beaten road
                        Come the wind men like a breath,
                        Fatefully and swift as Death.
                        Sometimes with a battle clash
                        Through the forest trees they dash;
                        And at other times they creep
                        Like a dream through vales of sleep.
                        Now these midnight riders own
                        Charms no daylight wind has known,
                        
                        Whether leaving in their wake
                        Needful rain or soft snowflake,
                        Or, the earliest night of spring,
                        Waking all the sap to sing!
                        Elms and beeches in my wood
                        Long as guard for me have stood;
                        But across their barricade
                        Ride the wind men unafraid,
                        And a fearful challenge roar
                        As they charge my pane and door.
                        Then, before the house grows still,
                        They have gained the farthest hill
                        Of my quiet valley's marge,
                        Thence again to charge and charge!
                    
                
                
                
                    A PRAYER OF THE HILL-COUNTRY
                    And the strength of the hills is his also.
                    
                        LIFT me, O Lord, above the level plain,
                        Beyond the cities where life throbs and thrills,
                        And in the cool airs let my spirit gain
                        The stable strength and courage of Thy hills.
                    
                    
                        They are Thy secret dwelling-places, Lord!
                        Like Thy majestic prophets, old and hoar,
                        They stand assembled in divine accord,
                        Thy sign of 'stablished power forevermore.
                    
                    
                        Here peace finds refuge from ignoble wars,
                        And faith, triumphant, builds in snow and rime,
                        Near the broad highways of the greater stars,
                        Above the tide-line of the seas of time.
                    
                    
                    
                        Lead me yet farther, Lord, to peaks more clear,
                        Until the clouds like shining meadows lie,
                        Where through the deeps of silence I may hear
                        The thunder of Thy legions marching by.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE SPIRIT OF MOUNTAINS
                    
                        SPIRIT of mountains that elusive leaps
                        From high-walled caon to unguarded height,
                        Only the thought may follow your winged flight
                        Where the swift torrent, down the rocky steeps,
                        A flashing line of spray and vapor sweeps,
                        And through dim caverns bears the noonday light,
                        Or in the august and tranquil summer night,
                        Among cloud harbors where the lightning sleeps.
                        Spirit of mountains! Freest of all free things,
                        Let me the star-companioned ridges climb
                        With heart as strong as the bold eagle's wings!
                        Guide me to those serener slopes where Time
                        Less harsh the immelodious challenge rings,
                        And song is truth, and truth is sweet like rhyme!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE PSALMS IN THE MOUNTAINS
                    
                        IN the great ocean's thunder
                        I heard the old songs ring,
                        I heard them in the prairies
                        Amid the grasses sing;
                        The murmur of the pine-wood
                        With Israel's hymns was sweet,
                        And through the little hills I heard
                        Their solemn rhythm beat.
                    
                    
                        But oh, 'twas in the mountains
                        Their mystery held me thrall!
                        Where the four winds of heaven
                        Sent forth their challenge call,
                        With martial trumpets thrilling
                        The rough-hewn brawny range.
                        And through dark canons chanting
                        The spirit of all change.
                    
                    
                    
                        The cattle of the foot-hills
                        In gathering snow stood deep;
                        The shepherds through white meadows
                        Went stumbling for their sheep;
                        And where the lonely hamlet
                        Slept 'neath. stern mountain walls,
                        The winds across the darkness
                        Sang hoarse antiphonals.
                    
                    
                        'Twas Zion's heart melodious
                        That woke the solemn height,
                        Till loud the ancient hymnal
                        Made glorious the night;
                        Far-sounding notes of triumph
                        To grief and wailing ran,
                        As Nature's voices uttered
                        The cry of God to man.
                    
                
                
                
                    IN THE GREAT PASTURES
                    
                        
                            Our cattle also shall go with us.
                        
                        
                            Exodus X, 26.
                    
                    
                        WHEN the grave twilight moves toward the west,
                        And the horizons of the plain are blurred,
                        I watch, on gradual slope and foot-hill crest.
                        The dark line of the herd.
                        And something primal through my being thrills,
                        For that line met the night when, life began!
                        And cattle gathered from a thousand hills
                        Have kept the trail with man,
                        Till their calm eyes his greater iliads hold;
                        The wonder-look, the dumb reproof and pain,
                        Have followed him since Abram's herds of old
                        Darkened the Asian plain.
                    
                
                
                
                    A SHADOW OF THE ROCKIES
                    
                        THE mountains from my window lie outrolled,
                        Their solemn peaks with coronals of snow
                        O'er which the fires of dawn and sunset flow,
                        And keen, high ridges by fierce winds patrolled.
                        With evening comes a mighty shadow cold
                        Across my doorway as the sun sinks low,
                        And, high above, the loftier summits show
                        Faint, as the twilight tames their outlines bold.
                    
                    
                        Then from the heights the spirit of repose
                        Steals earthward, with the peace that long has lain
                        Secure amid the deep, untrodden snows
                        A shadow stream, for which my soul is fain,
                        That from the towering peak of silence flows,
                        And pours its balm upon the toiling plain.
                    
                
                
                
                    SIMPLICITY
                    
                        IF power were mine to wield control
                        Of Time within my heart and soul,
                        Saving from ruin and decay
                        What I hold dearest, I should pray:
                        That I may never cease to be
                        Wooed daily by Expectancy;
                        That evening shadows in mine eyes
                        Dim not the light of new surprise;
                        That I may feel, till life be spent,
                        Each day the sweet bewilderment
                        Of fresh delight in simple things,
                        In snowy winters, golden springs,
                        And quicker heart-beats at the thought
                        Of all the good that man has wrought.
                    
                    
                        But may I never face a dawn
                        With all the awe and wonder gone,
                        Or in late twilight fail to see
                        Charm in the stars' old sorcery.
                    
                
                
                
                    AN APRIL EASTER
                    
                        THE sun has brought his golden keys
                        And opened wide the doors of spring,
                        Till earth's a-thrill with mysteries
                        Of breaking bud and eager wing.
                    
                    
                        I know not where spring's miracle
                        In the glad mold was earliest wrought,
                        No more by striving may men tell
                        What first was in His holy thought
                    
                    
                        When the light seal of sleep He broke,
                        And in the darkened sepulcher
                        Once more to human sense awoke,
                        And felt the life within Him stir.
                    
                
                
                
                    ASPHODEL
                    
                        ONE night while loitering in some grove of sleep
                        I saw a hand mysterious unbar
                        A gate, that from my heavy eyes did keep
                        A raging battle in a region far.
                        Then bugles sounded, and within, my dream,
                        But yet distinct, insistent, came the roar
                        Of that strange conflict and the sudden gleam
                        Of weapons that a myriad warriors bore
                        And on that dust-blurred field
                        With sturdy hand did wield.
                    
                    
                        Cool was the wood
                        In which I stood
                        Intent upon that heated plain, and sweet
                        Were the dew-laden flowers about my feet,
                        
                        Sky-woven violets and moonflowers wan,
                        Roses and hyacinths whereon ne'er fell
                        The rival hues of any new day's dawn,
                        And oh, the asphodel, the asphodel!
                    
                    
                        "Ah, but for power to pass that open gate
                        And for the strength to break this hated spell,"
                        And praying thus I strove against the fate
                        That held me prisoner to the asphodel.
                        "Why must I see afar the battle rage
                        And not be of the armies there that wage
                        Such glorious conflict?" And I sought again
                        To leave that quiet wood and its soft air
                        For the fierce ventures of the shaken plain;
                        But the gate closed before my wondering eyes,
                        Leaving me gaping, like a child whose hand
                        Aids in a trick beyond his vague surmise,
                        Vexed with himself, yet fain to understand.
                    
                    
                        Then from dream's thrall set free,
                        I slowly turned, but yet contentedly,
                        To the deep odorous wood
                        With its sweet solitude;
                        
                        Its roses, hyacinths and lorn,
                        Meek moonflowers, fearful of the morn,
                        Andoh, I loved it long and well!
                        The asphodel, the asphodel!
                    
                    
                        If you were keeper of that gate, if you,
                        My friend, could give me entrance to that field
                        That I thereon some valorous deed might do,
                        So fame to me would yield
                        Reward of honor and of gold,
                        Would you the way unfold,
                        Or I be left my little while to dwell
                        A neighbor of the asphodel?
                    
                
                
                
                    TO A DÉBUTANTE
                    
                        YOUR dreams have never known a world so fair
                        As this reality of joy and light;
                        The springs that o'er your head have winged
                            swift flight
                        Steal back again with all their fragrance rare
                        Of May-time blossoms. On the happy air,
                        Viol and harp and horn their burden bright
                        Add to the charm of this enchantment night,
                        That finds you queen, with none your reign to share.
                    
                    
                        But through the music's careless march and swing,
                        Beyond these dancers' forms that drift and
                            sway,
                        I hear for you a graver measure ring
                        Where, far along on your appointed way,
                        A girl's heart to a woman's task you bring,
                        Serene and pure, amid the troubled day.
                    
                
                
                
                    LOVE'S MUSIC
                    
                        LOVE'S music is not set in simple keys
                        Of jingling catches and light melodies,
                        But rings in deeper, mightier chords than, these.
                    
                    
                        Through marvelous symphonies it ebbs and flows,
                        In choral storms, with martial power it blows,
                        And chants in solemn oratorios.
                    
                    
                        Like hymns of victory are its pure chords blown,
                        Or like a bugle's notes that rise alone
                        And call, beyond man's thought, to Death's far
                            zone.
                    
                    
                        Its strength is more mysterious than the tides,
                        As, unresisted, through the soul it rides,
                        Until in Memory's quiet haven it bides.
                    
                
                
                
                    WEST
                    
                        NORTH, east, south, west,'tis thus geographers
                        Bound the known earth and for the unknown make quest;
                        But I, remembering each sweet way of hers,
                        Look only west.
                    
                    
                        And less reluctant now that she has gone,
                        The golden sun goes down its arching way,
                        Bearing to her the welcome light of dawn
                        And the new day.
                    
                    
                        Such peace, such calm as hers they only find
                        Who know life and its surging waters wide,
                        Who dare the deeps and shoals of soul and mind
                        At the supremest tide.
                    
                    
                    
                        So as each eve the western windows grow
                        Bright in the dying rays and discords cease,
                        The thought of her becomes an afterglow
                        Of joy, calm, peace.
                    
                
                
                
                    ESCHEAT
                    
                        TO my estate no heirs succeed;
                        When I have done with it no man
                        Shall find it suited to his need,
                        Adapted to his plan.
                    
                    
                        The walls for me were built, and when
                        I close the door and turn the key
                        No one shall enter there again,
                        Or rule in place of me.
                    
                    
                        This house is all I own; though poor
                        It shelters me, and many a storm
                        Has passed it, leaving all secure,
                        The inner hearthstone warm.
                    
                    
                        But after me no eager kin
                        Shall hold my former house in pride;
                        No enemy shall enter in
                        As tenant to abide.
                    
                    
                    
                        The friendly earth is good and sweet
                        And kindly to its heart will draw
                        Estates like mine when they escheat
                        By nature's changeless law.
                    
                
                
                
                    SHADOW LINES
                    
                        WHEN slow the brooding dark around you falls,
                        Save only as the lamp's rose-mellowed light
                        Burns through it, but without dispelling quite
                        Trembling along the dim and shadowy walls
                        What fleeting spirit of the evening calls?
                        What songs come stealing to you through the night
                        Along the vistas of brave fancy's flight
                        What story steals from old Romance's halls?
                    
                    
                        I can not fathom what these things to you
                        May bring; nor what sad thoughts to you belong;
                        Nor know I whether rosemary or rue
                        Awaits you here or there; the path is long
                        And some things must be false and some be true
                        And sad strains must be woven in the song.
                    
                
                
                
                    YOUTH AND WINTER
                    
                        WHEN summer days are long and sweet
                        The maples that o'erarch my street,
                        My linden and the crimson rose
                        That round my southern window glows,
                        Efface the outer world for me,
                        Scarce past the vine-clasped wall I see,
                        Nor longer flight my eyes are led
                        Than to my neighbor's canna bed!
                        But when the leaves have vanished quite
                        New vistas broaden to my sight;
                        December's broken arches give
                        Visions less faint and fugitive
                        Of Mabel, Grace and Josephine,
                        Who have not yet known seventeen!
                        Of Gwendolen,a few years more
                        In her brief audit I must score!
                        And Nora,she whose teasing eyes
                        Make wisdom futile,and unwise!
                        
                        Ah, easy 'tis in summertime
                        Within to find thoughts winged for rhyme;
                        But when the skies are gray and cold
                        And all the summer's tales are told,
                        My eyes leap eagerly to greet
                        Youth down the long aisles of the street.
                        From Mabel, Josephine and Grace
                        My pulse derives a quickened pace;
                        Hope's vanished hours grow gold again
                        Whenever I see Gwendolen;
                        And age-won wisdom meetly flies
                        From Nora of the teasing eyes.
                    
                
                
                
                    "IN WINTER I WAS BORN"
                    
                        In winter I was born,
                        So all my years I've loved the frost and snow
                        And the strong, tireless winds that, passing, blow
                        A battle note forlorn.
                    
                    
                        I love the year's long night.
                        The tumult of great storms, the biting air
                        Make my heart's summertime, when days are fair
                        And yield me true delight.
                    
                    
                        In winter I was born,
                        And as I came so let me pass away,
                        Out from the world on a December day
                        When the delaying morn
                    
                    
                    
                        In the far east shall creep
                        Last time for me; then let the winds I love
                        Come from their far-off homes and sing above
                        The place where I shall sleep.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE WINTER WIND IN THE ROCKIES
                    
                        SNOW-crowned the mighty Babels round me rise!
                        Long the rude towers and battlements have rung
                        With furious speech, in many a thunderous tongue,
                        Till a fierce clamor fills the wondering skies.
                        Anon, when the discordant chorus dies,
                        Low oratorios to the plains are sung,
                        Voicing the ages when these peaks were young
                        And echoed first the wind's confusd cries.
                    
                    
                        Hark! How at midnight the tumultuous throng
                        Blend their harsh dissonance in one deep roar
                        
                        Whose note through lonely canons wanders long
                        Hymning the north's withholden splendors hoar,
                        Chanting the stilled sea and the imprisoned shore,
                        With twice a thousand winters in their song!
                    
                
                
                
                    GOD SAVE THE STATE!
                    
                        ASK of me not that in the loud acclaim
                        I join, to laud the day's victorious name,
                        Whether your choice or mine,though I am prone
                        To plead inexorably for my own,
                        And flout your creed as false, proclaim mine wise.
                        Yet not with man or cause the triumph lies,
                        For what has been established, what disproved?
                        In the November midnight I am moved
                        Less by exultant shouts that o'er the town
                        Herald the chief new-laureled for renown,
                        Than by the thought that, safe from strife and hate,
                        August, serene, triumphant lives the State,
                        Immutable and steadfast like the hills!
                        Though over it a thousand warring wills
                        
                        Storm fitfully, they only prove it strong.
                        And you and I, who prate of error and wrong,
                        Hear many a challenge 'neath the citadel
                        While the calm sentry answers "All is well,"
                        And star-ward lifts his eyes! Man's faith in man
                        Remains the secret still of God's great plan
                        Whereof He gave to us the golden key
                        That seals our covenant with Liberty
                        And makes her holy ark for aye our own,
                        To hold for Man and not for men alone!
                        Your hand, my friend! The heavens decree our fate;
                        Who loses or who wins, God save the State
                    
                    
                        November, 1904.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE EARTH
                    
                        WITH gathering years the earth has not grown tame,
                        In man's firm clasp a mere imprisoned ball,
                        Though conquering feet have trodden nearly all,
                        And even the uncharted has received a name;
                        There still loom heights deserving of man's aim;
                        Forbidding isles still lie beyond his thrall;
                        The silent Polar doors heed not his call,
                        And inmost tropic wilds he scarce dare claim.
                    
                    
                        Yet, when at last the globe is mastered quite,
                        And prying man has left no inch unscanned,
                        He still must pause before earth's moods of might
                        That lift the sea and toss the desert sand,
                        That set the dread volcano's torch alight,
                        And send strange tremors through the startled land.
                    
                
                
                
                    AN OLD GUIDON
                    
                        THROUGH this torn scarf my father's hand
                        Set, 'mid the battle's thunderings,
                        More truly I can understand
                        The strifes of ancient chiefs and kings.
                    
                    
                        Faintly to-day Thermopylae
                        In song and story clangs and rings;
                        Shiloh and Kenesaw bring me
                        Nearer to all heroic things.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE HEART OF THE BUGLE
                    
                        I HAVE heard the bugle blown
                        Where the southern seas make moan;
                        And have followed east and west
                        At its trumpeted behest;
                        By the mighty mountains' marge
                        I have heard it sing the charge,
                        Till old battles in my blood
                        Were a mighty tide at flood
                        O bugle!
                    
                    
                        I have seen the bugler stand
                        With the trumpet in his hand,
                        When the winter's dawn-light gray
                        Brought again reluctant day,
                        Very silent, very lone,
                        With the whole world for his own,
                        Till he woke it with a note
                        From the brazen trumpet's throat
                        O bugle!
                    
                    
                    
                        Then I saw old battles fade
                        Far across the dim parade,
                        And a thousand knights went by
                        Like a moving tapestry;
                        Old crusaders riding fast
                        Down dark vistas of the past,
                        Worn and broken in their mail
                        While the bugle sang them hail
                        O bugle!
                    
                    
                        As within the fort's grim bound
                        Swift the bugler made his round,
                        Dawn and youth were in the call
                        That he sent from wall to wall!
                        I saw Troy and Marathon
                        In the faint light of the dawn;
                        Battles old and battles new
                        Agincourt and Waterloo
                        O bugle!
                    
                    
                        Now my blood more swiftly beats
                        Victories and brave defeats;
                        
                        Shiloh passes and I see
                        Swing in place a battery
                        With plunging horses seared and scourged,
                        By an undaunted leader urged,
                        And in that smoke-hung, fire-swept place
                        I seethrough tearsmy father's face
                        O bugle!
                    
                
                
                
                    SHILOH
                    
                        THOUGH the blest winds of peace down the highways are blowing,
                        And blithe birds are singing where bullets once sped;
                        Though the wheat and the corn on the old fields are growing
                        The ground is still hallowed by blood of the dead.
                    
                    
                        O battery boys, can you hear it, the roaring
                        Of great iron engines along the gray lines?
                        The bugles sing sweetly; the eagle is soaring
                        Where on the far borders your old guidon shines.
                    
                    
                        On the lumbering caissons you rode to your glory;
                        The lanyards were latch-strings that opened to fame
                        
                        While the rolling discharges gave rhythm to your story,
                        Your armor was woven of smoke blent with flame.
                    
                    
                        Is it riven and faded, or is it still gleaming
                        To mark, here the bivouac, and there, bat-tle-lines?
                        Wind and sun have been kind, so that still in your dreaming
                        On life's farthest margin the old guidon
                            shines.
                    
                
                
                
                    CUBA
                    
                        SHALL we who in the mighty west
                        Set foot upon a king's decrees
                        Let vulture Spain hide in her nest
                        The fair pearl of the southern seas?
                    
                    
                        In selfish ease we watch the fight
                        And say "How fine their battle-rage!"
                        Yet, lending nothing of our might,
                        We forfeit our own heritage.
                    
                    
                        We mock the Briton's cautious plan
                        Amid the Sultan's bloody work,
                        But while we prate of love of man,
                        May not the Spaniard match the Turk?
                    
                    
                        We praised Kossuth. Mazzini's name
                        And Garibaldi's warmed like wine;
                        Remembering them, 'tis to our shame
                        We aid not Cuba's wavering line!
                    
                    
                    
                        I know not whether black or white
                        They be who strive to make her free;
                        They seek the sun at darkest night
                        And prove their right to liberty.
                    
                    
                        I know not whether black or white
                        Nor care, since Lincoln's strong arm caught
                        The curled whip o'er the bondman's back
                        And a wronged people's freedom wrought!
                    
                    
                        A Latin people gave us aid
                        And dared for us to break a lance;
                        To Cuba let the debt be paid
                        We owe to liberty and France!
                    
                    
                        Hark! the long Caribbean wave
                        Moans on the island beach and dies;
                        We, with our lion's strength to save,
                        Feel the shame growing in our eyes.
                    
                    
                    
                        No! we are not a coward land!
                        A sword-flash with our sympathy!
                        Let us help rear, with practised hand,
                        A new republic of the sea!
                    
                    
                        January, 1898.
                    
                
                
                
                    "BLESS THOU THE GUNS"
                    
                        HID in earth's caverns deep,
                        In the cold ores asleep,
                        Or in the lightning's thrall,
                        Force waits for Freedom's call!
                        Out of Thy mountains old
                        Thou gav'st the iron we mold,
                        And the stern, tempered steel
                        To liberty we seal.
                        May we Thy gifts of might
                        Use well to serve the right;
                        And may our solemn wrath
                        Leave clear for peace a path
                        Bless Thou the guns!
                    
                    
                        Not worn with ancient hate
                        We the first shock await;
                        
                        Not that our Saxon kin
                        Hemmed the Armada in,
                        But that Thy word may be
                        No empty prophecy;
                        That faith may rise, restored
                        By the avenging sword,
                        We out of peaceful ways
                        Turn to the power that slays.
                        Out of the battle's flame
                        Lord, bring us free from blame
                        Bless Thou the guns!
                    
                    
                        Lord, at our very door,
                        Death clutches at Thy poor,
                        And stricken liberty
                        Raises her hand to Thee;
                        Lord, 'tis our task to do
                        If Thy own word be true!
                        Thou who the bright stars blent
                        In the flag's firmament
                        
                        Thou who to Freedom's hand
                        Gav'st the new western land,
                        Thou who didst Israel lead
                        Forth, free of Pharaoh's greed
                        Bless Thou the guns!
                    
                    
                        April, 1898.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE HORNS
                    
                        MY soul had died for joy what time
                        The violin sang out alone,
                        And requiem bells in solemn chime
                        Grieved through the viol's moan.
                    
                    
                        Then harp and 'cello led me on
                        Through maze of tender harmonies,
                        Beyond the hour, beyond the dawn,
                        Beyond the utmost seas.
                    
                    
                        But through that realm by music bound,
                        Like a bold blast of freshening air,
                        Sudden I heard the trumpets sound
                        With harsh and militant blare.
                    
                    
                        Then, as to Joshua's trumpet-call,
                        Seven days repeated, Jericho
                        Yielded its stern, reluctant wall,
                        So were such dreams brought low;
                    
                    
                    
                        And, their poor ruin quickly spurned,
                        Into fierce conflict I was hurled,
                        Where fields and cities brightly burned,
                        And battle shook the world.
                    
                
                
                
                    BELLONA
                    (Gêrome's Statue)
                    
                        WHAT wanton bold, exultant in her shame,
                        What monster art thou in this woman's guise?
                        Think'st thou with blatant shout the world to tame,
                        Or awe man with thy terrible great eyes?
                    
                    
                        Thou art Bellona, the fell scourge of earth,
                        Who set'st for man his false, ignoble goals;
                        Thou the destroyer of love and bane of mirth,
                        Thou the relentless trafficker in souls.
                    
                    
                        Death's lure thou art, on his dark mischief bent,
                        In splendor clad his livery gray to hide;
                        His cry thou bellowest from the battlement;
                        On ruddy fields before him thou dost ride.
                    
                    
                    
                        Art thou so glorious? Are thy deeds so great?
                        Canst thou awake earth's myriad slaughtered
                            hosts,
                        Or summon from the sea's unpillared gate
                        Thy drowned armada-sepulcher of ghosts?
                    
                    
                        I cower not before thy shining blade
                        Thou hold'st upraised and bloodily dost wield;
                        Nor fear the serpent that doth give thee aid,
                        Nor shrink before the radiance of thy shield.
                    
                    
                        Where thou destroy'st I build; where thou dost blight
                        My hands restore; I thy lorn thralls release;
                        My pinions touch thy darkened world with light
                        And healing for its wounds: Lo, I am Peace!
                    
                
                
                
                    A TENANT
                    
                        THIS spirit with its boundaries wide
                        Is not my own to hold in fee;
                        Through all my days therein I bide
                        As one of God's great tenantry.
                    
                    
                        'Tis not as unsown fallow land
                        To lie, the playground of wild weeds,
                        But lent me from the Sovereign's hand
                        To grow the fruitage of fair deeds.
                    
                    
                        And I ill-pay His faith and trust
                        If the field be but weakly tilled,
                        Unsown the rich unbroken crust,
                        Or sown in labor feebly-willed.
                    
                    
                        But 'tis for me to tend my field
                        Till white with harvest my life be,
                        And I full-handed bring its yield
                        In proof of honest tenancy.
                    
                
                
                
                    NEW YEAR'S COLLECT
                    
                        LORD, another year has wrought
                        Changes with deep meaning fraught;
                        Give us larger understanding
                        Of the lessons Thou hast taught.
                    
                    
                        By Thy hand our stars were sent
                        Forth into the firmament;
                        Help us lift our starry guidon
                        To the height of Thy intent!
                    
                    
                        Slow in anger to condemn,
                        May we Wrong's dull tide-wave stem
                        With the righteous wrath of Sinai,
                        And the love of Bethlehem!
                    
                    
                        Oh, 'twere shameful if, at last,
                        All forgetful of the past,
                        We should weld in roaring forges
                        Tyrant chains to bind us fast!
                    
                    
                    
                        In our hearts let hatred cease,
                        And tranquillity increase;
                        Teach us that the God of Battles
                        Is not less the God of Peace.
                    
                    
                        It sufficeth not that we
                        High before the world stand free,
                        We must still with infinite striving
                        O'er ourselves the victors be!
                    
                    
                        In our pride doth lurk defeat
                        If with dragon-wrongs we treat;
                        Strengthen us that, like Saint Michael,
                        We may break them 'neath our feet!
                    
                
                
                
                    FROM BETHLEHEM TO CALVARY
                    
                        FROM Bethlehem to Calvary, the Saviour's journey lay;
                        Doubt, unbelief, scorn, fear and hate beset Him day by day,
                        But in His heart He bore God's love that brightened all
                            the way.
                    
                    
                        O'er the Judean hills He walked, serene and brave of soul,
                        Seeking the beaten paths of men, touching and making whole,
                        Dying at last for love of man, on Calvary's darkened
                            knoll.
                    
                    
                    
                        He went with patient step and slow, as one who scatters seed;
                        Like a fierce hunger in His heart, He felt the world's
                            great need,
                        And the negations Moses gave He changed to loving deed.
                    
                    
                        From Bethlehem to Calvary the world still follows on,
                        Even as the halt and blind of old along His path were drawn;
                        Through Calvary's clouds they seek the light that led Him
                            to the dawn.

                        ONCE I have seen you press against your heart
                        A hand, in sudden pain;
                        Oh! it was mine, the pain, the cruel smart!
                    
                    
                        Once, only, pain made shadow in your eyes
                        My own were void of light,
                        For they the seas are that reflect your skies.
                    
                    
                        By day or night the clenching hand I see,
                        And eyes by pain possessed;
                        There is no other sight or thought for me.
                    
                    
                        This penance ceaselessly I must withstand
                        The pain in your sad eyes,
                        And close against your heart the clenching hand.

                        ACROSS the world the ceaseless march of man
                        Has been through smoldering fires, left by the bold,
                        Who first beyond the guarded outposts ran
                        And saw with wondering eyes new lands un-rolled
                        Who built the hut in which a home began,
                        And round a camp-fire's ashes broke the
                        mold.

                        Grim outposts of the fruitful land,
                        Defying winds and seas.

                        Unflavored by the salt-sea mist,

                    IRELAND
                    
                        IRELAND, weary mother sitting,
                        Lorn amid thy seas;
                        When shall thy far-scattered children
                        Gather at thy knees?
                        Thou art worn and old and broken,
                        Thou art lean and cold,
                        When shall they again assemble
                        In thine island fold?
                        They are aliens, they are wanderers,
                        Driven far to roam,
                        But with querulous voice thou call'st them,
                        Call'st thy children home.
                    
                    
                        Other lands thou gav'st to freedom,
                        Through thy dauntless sons;
                        O'er the round world they are buried
                        Dead beneath their guns;
                        
                        Seeking liberty thou sent'st them
                        Through far field and flood,
                        But they may not fight thy battles,
                        Shed for thee their blood!
                        Other soil has known their valor,
                        Willing heart and daring hand,
                        But again thy voice is calling,
                        Calling home to motherland.
                    
                    
                        Thou art in thine age majestic,
                        Queenly in thy rags,
                        Like an eagle mother stricken
                        In her native crags
                        Who, in her riven place of nesting
                        Sees by cruel hands far-flung
                        Her new brood of fledgling eaglets,
                        And cries fiercely for her young!
                        Ah, thou, too, art lonely, dreaming
                        In thy desolate home apart,
                        Yet thy foes may break thy pinions,
                        But they can not break thy heart!
                    
                    
                    
                        Thou art still a royal mother
                        By no child disowned;
                        To thy loyal sons and daughters
                        Thou art still enthroned!
                        Let thy fingers, slow and feeble,
                        That were once so quick and strong,
                        Wake thy harp's note, that, exultant,
                        Led of old a nation's song;
                        And thy dimming eyes shall brighten
                        Through the full-flood of thy tears,
                        As thou hear'st afar thy children
                        Marching home across the years.
                    
                
                
                
                    WATCHING THE WORLD GO BY
                    
                        SWIFT as a meteor and as quickly gone
                        A train of cars darts swiftly through the night,
                        Scorning the woods and fields it hurries on,
                        A thing of wrathful might.
                    
                    
                        There, from a farmer's home a woman's eyes,
                        Roused by the sudden jar and passing flare,
                        Follow the speeding phantom till it dies
                        An echo on the air.
                    
                    
                        Narrow the life that always has been hers,
                        The evening brings a longing to her breast;
                        Deep in her heart some aspiration stirs
                        And mocks her sou's unrest.
                    
                    
                    
                        Her tasks are mean and endless as the days,
                        And sometimes love can not repay all things;
                        An instrument that, rudely touched, obeys,
                        Becomes discordant strings.
                    
                    
                        The train that followed in the headlight's flare,
                        Bound for the city and a larger world,
                        Made emphasis of her poor life of care,
                        As from her sight it whirled.
                    
                    
                        Thus from all lonely hearts the great earth rolls,
                        Indifferent though one woman grieve and die;
                        Along its iron track are many souls
                        That watch the world go by.
                    
                
                
                
                    GRACE CHIMES
                    
                        "LEAD, kindly light," I heard the glad bells
                            ring,
                        And thought how God existeth everywhere;
                        Twas in a city strange that, sweetest thing!
                        "Lead, kindly light," I heard the glad bells
                            ring,
                        And summer quickened in the heart of spring,
                        For where the kind light leadeth all is fair.
                        "Lead, kindly light," I heard the glad bells
                            ring,
                        And thought how God existeth everywhere.
                    
                
                
                
                    DERELICT
                    
                        A HOPE once sailed me through the summer sea,
                        And bravely through the waves I plowed my way;
                        The captain and his crew in praise of me
                        Sang all the happy day.
                    
                    
                        Forth on my spars the nimble seamen drew
                        The snowy sheets to catch the sturdy breeze;
                        I thought, "How blest am I with captain, crew
                        And willing sails like these."
                    
                    
                        A great storm came and to my very heart
                        I felt the shattering wind that charged and wheeled,
                        Driving me into deeps no guiding chart
                        Had ever yet revealed.
                    
                    
                    
                        On calm sea meadows fell the gradual dawn;
                        Lifeless and helpless on the waves I lay,
                        By winds and ocean currents guided on
                        And with no hand to stay.
                    
                    
                        For my good captain and his merry crew
                        Abandoned me when, snapping like a reed,
                        One tall mast fell; quick to their boats they flew
                        Cowards in my dire need.
                    
                    
                        My rudder does the waves' behest, my keel
                        Unheedfully skims over hidden bars;
                        I answer not the noon sun's fierce appeal
                        Nor challenges of stars.
                    
                    
                        No longer matters it if storms prevail;
                        Of my decrepitude the waves make sport;
                        My decks will never hear a welcome hail
                        From any wide-armed port.
                    
                    
                    
                        Or far or near pass joyous peopled ships
                        And gaze at me with strange distrustful eyes;
                        Through fogs their pilots steer with tightened lips
                        Lest my dread ghost arise.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE WAYWARD MUSE
                    
                        ON pleasant days I'm prone to shirk
                        My well-planned hours of indoor work;
                    
                    
                        I find that fleetly speeds the time,
                        With no words caught in nets of rhyme.
                    
                    
                        I see my muse (the inconstant fay!)
                        Across the threshold dart away,
                    
                    
                        And through the woodland disappear
                        When first the breath of spring is here.
                    
                    
                        On all the long, bright summer days
                        She guides me through enchanted ways,
                    
                    
                        Through meadows fair, by singing brooks,
                        And scorns to speak of men or books!
                    
                    
                    
                        When autumn's golden days arc brief,
                        And earthward slants the withered leaf,
                    
                    
                        She leads me down the street's long aisle
                        Into the country, many a mile!
                    
                    
                        But when the skies in gray are set
                        And all our pleasant walks are wet;
                    
                    
                        When keen winds blow and snows are deep,
                        At home we twain our vigil keep.
                    
                    
                        She sits there in the ingle-nook
                        And dreams, or turns some mellow book,
                    
                    
                        And tends my fire, or, happiest chance!
                        Bends on my page her favoring glance.
                    
                    
                        Now I am glad when I can see
                        The summer skies arched over me,
                    
                    
                        And glad, when bluebirds bring me news,
                        To follow countryward the muse;
                    
                    
                    
                        But well I love these golden times
                        When from the fire I coax my rhymes;
                    
                    
                        When in the flame of hickory wood
                        I read new poems, sweet and good:
                    
                    
                        For then I need not turn the key
                        To keep my faithless muse with me;
                    
                    
                        I need not threaten, then, nor scold,
                        At home that errant girl to hold!
                    
                    
                        For when the first thin snows appear,
                        Her foot upon the step I hear,
                    
                    
                        And she steals in with smiling face,
                        Again to her remembered place,
                    
                    
                        And in her peaceful corner croons
                        Light-hearted songs of bloomy Junes,
                    
                    
                        Or, haply, she and I together
                        Send song-barbed shafts against the weather!
                    
                
                
                
                    MEMORY
                    
                        THIS hour the fateful tide runs up the beach,
                        As the sea wills it;
                        It seeks each hollow loved of yesterday,
                        Finds it, and fills it.
                    
                
                
                
                    UNMAPPED
                    
                        WHOSE hand shall limn the final chart,
                        Complete, with every stream that flows,
                        With pathways which the bold of heart
                        Have trampled through the Polar snows?
                    
                    
                        Perchance to-morrow's sun will shine
                        On outposts by some desolate shore
                        Where man's advancing picket-line
                        Must pause and camp forevermore.
                    
                    
                        E'en now the wide-strewn island host
                        Within the map's net has been drawn.
                        And soon no mere adventurous boast
                        Shall lure the tropic traveler on.
                    
                    
                    
                        But when the maps are finished quite,
                        And all the stranger world is known,
                        Still shall abide the elusive light
                        On coasts where Fancy's winds are blown.
                    
                    
                        And fearless eyes for long may strain,
                        And steady hands may guide the helm;
                        But none may ever hope to gain
                        The farthest shore of Fancy's realm.
                    
                
                
                
                    JOHN TYNDALL
                    OBIIT DECEMBER 4,
                        1893
                    
                        SERENE on cheerless seas he drove his bark,
                        Skirting with dauntless heart the ignorant shores;
                        Crossed roaring reefs and set his finder's mark
                        Beyond Imagination's open doors.
                    
                    
                        The oldest mysteries of this spinning ball
                        He solved, and at the door of Silence beat,
                        Nor was dismayed by echoes of his call
                        That broke afar, his purpose to defeat.
                    
                    
                    
                        The potent elements of giant force,
                        The heat and light girt on the earth's great
                            tire
                        He watched, as fast it flies its channeled course
                        Along a daily changing track of fire.
                    
                    
                        Nor as a dreamer who may vigil keep,
                        Seeing the mighty planets spin afar,
                        But with precision sounding deep on deep
                        And linking to the lamp the golden star.
                    
                    
                        High on the muffled line of ice and snow
                        He sought where others had not dared to seek;
                        There Knowledge made for him a new dawn's glow,
                        Lighting his beacon at the farthest peak.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE DEAD ARCHER
                    MAURICE THOMPSON,
                            OBIIT FEBRUARY 15, 1901
                    
                        THROUGH what dim alleys of the wood
                        Has he, the keen-eyed archer, gone?
                        By what bright lakes and bubbling streams
                        And o'er what golden hills of dawn?
                    
                    
                        Nor here nor there he gains the trail
                        His eager feet have known of old,
                        No eye may mark his careful track
                        Printed upon the winter mold!
                    
                    
                        Yet all the faint elusive things
                        His spirit knew and counted good,
                        Hark to the archer going forth
                        Through the still, twilight-shadowed wood.
                    
                    
                        And where afar the dying sun
                        Burns in the west its fiery mark,
                        Still with his song the archer goes,
                        Unawed into the Greater Dark;
                    
                    
                    
                        Nor knows that he has crossed the line
                        Long set to be the bound for men;
                        Nor knows that when the long trail ends
                        He never can return again!
                    
                    
                        His woodman's craft at last has failed,
                        At last the archer's eyes betray;
                        His own song lures him down the path,
                        His own song lights the darkening way!
                    
                    
                        The echoes fainter fall and die,
                        And grieving winds from cold seas blow,
                        Moaning above the gathering dark:
                        It was not time for him to go!"
                    
                    
                        For him there still was much to do
                        To stay the audit hand of time,
                        New bows to bend, new trails to seek,
                        New songs to wed to mellow rhyme.
                    
                    
                    
                        In youth the bugle's challenge note
                        Had led him 'mid the clang of war,
                        But happier he to roam the fields
                        An archer and a troubadour!
                    
                    
                        When clouds hung near and woods were gray
                        In olden books renowned and wise,
                        He learned the miracle that makes
                        Bright pages of the dullest skies;
                    
                    
                        And songs he gathered from o'er seas
                        With his own music woke and sang,
                        Till through the unhindering western hills
                        Hymns of Immortal singers rang.
                    
                    
                        But not in alien soil he sought
                        The faded trappings of romance;
                        He saw by western elm and beech
                        Fresher enchantments flash and dance;
                    
                    
                    
                        And dipped his blade and sped his shaft
                        In valleys men have little known,
                        Hearing faint chimes from elfland towers,
                        Mingled with songs the wind had sown.
                    
                    
                        His heart was like a bow of yew
                        That nature tempers fine and strong,
                        And from it the glad arrows went
                        Keen with the music of his song.
                    
                    
                        April her brimming cloud will bring,
                        And May her odorous charm repeat,
                        But here no more the happy grass
                        Will leap beneath the archer's feet.
                    
                    
                        Still, in far glades and by clear streams,
                        Where soft airs blow and glad birds wing,
                        The blithe, brave arrows of his song
                        Through the bright weather fly and sing!
                    
                    
                    
                        Spirits that guard the woodland paths,
                        And lie in wait beside the streams.
                        Lead him where he shall find anew
                        Green meadows, and his morning dreams!
                    
                
                
                
                    "SHE GATHERS ROSES"
                    
                        O WINTER night, O muffling snows,
                        From dolorous mountain summits blown!
                        So wild the night, so bleak and cold,
                        'Twas far to send a child alone!
                    
                    
                        But from our own poor watch and ward,
                        And our weak aims and needs and fears,
                        Her spirit sped and left behind
                        The untouched harvest of her years.
                    
                    
                        Blessed are they, who, old and worn,
                        Across the threshold creep at last,
                        With many a lingering glance behind
                        At the gray shadow-peopled past!
                    
                    
                        But thrice more blessd they who look
                        Scarce through the door Time opens wide,
                        Then back into the Father's arms,
                        From earth's untranquil strivings hide.
                    
                    
                    
                        And whether Heaven indeed may be
                        A gated city, builded strong,
                        That hath no need of stars or sun
                        To light the beatific throng;
                    
                    
                        Or whether in the home of spring
                        The haven lie of flower and grass.
                        O'er which the elect with tranquil mien
                        Through a perpetual morning pass,
                    
                    
                        I know not, yet however fair
                        May be God's hidden garden-lands,
                        I know that there, with happy heart,
                        She gathers roses in her hands.
                    
                    
                        The autumn gave her, and her eyes
                        Knew never spring's enchantment sweet,
                        Nor saw the mighty summer stars
                        Above the still earth throb and beat;
                    
                    
                    
                        And yet she loved the light, and turned
                        In childish wonder toward its glow,
                        She loved the light! and now has seen
                        The light perpetual round her flow.
                    
                    
                        Kingdom of Heaven, toward which we pray,
                        Whether alight of sun or star,
                        Kingdom of Heaven toward which we yearn,
                        'Tis there the little children are!
                    
                    
                        They keep for us, secure and sweet,
                        Youth, unassailed by winter's rime,
                        And are a hostage given to be
                        Our shield against the wars of time.
                    
                    
                        And there amid the ways of peace,
                        Through Christ's love-lighted garden-lands,
                        She wanders with untroubled heart,
                        And gathers roses in her hands.
                    
                    
                        January 30, 1901.
                    
                
                
                
                    VOICES OF CHILDREN
                    
                        VOICES of children breaking
                        On eve's delaying hour;
                        Voices in low mirth calling
                        From the dusky garden-bower;
                        They mock the late robin's chanting,
                        They call the young moon in glee,
                        And through the sweet lingering twilight
                        They steal in to me.
                        Shy girl with your low glad laughter,
                        Wee boy with your bubbling mirth,
                        The odorous garden around you
                        Is a playground 'twixt Heaven and earth!
                        And what can I do to keep you,
                        O sweetest and dearest twain.
                        Ignorant of earth's harsh discords
                        And free of its stress and pain?
                        
                        Soft treble and golden laughter
                        Fall faint through the starry eve;
                        And the robin in the maple
                        Wings home and ceases to grieve;
                        While with drowsy step and reluctant
                        To their cots the children climb,
                        Their throats still bubbling laughter
                        And their lips still murmuring rhyme.
                        I turn away to the garden
                        Their good night sweet in my ears,
                        And ponder and dream and wonder
                        At the mist-veiled tide of years;
                        Ah! if only the mirth and laughter
                        From their hearts might never die;
                        If the sweet, shy awe and wonder
                        In their gaze might always lie!
                        But the slim, young moon fades westward;
                        The night wind murmurs low,
                        And above me the planets question
                        What man nor star may know.
                    
                
                
                
                    AT THE MONUMENT
                    
                        MY little child about the Monument,
                        Climbs with slow step and awed and wondering eyes,
                        And in soft treble questions me and tries
                        To gather something of the shaft's intent.
                        And as on me her trusting gaze is bent
                        And she repeats her many "whens" and
                            "whys,"
                        She hears, as of some fable of the skies,
                        Why the gray column toward the heavens is sent.
                    
                    
                        And I am moved, thinking how tales of wars
                        Mean not so much to her as foolish rhyme
                        In her sweet ignorance of wounds and scars!
                        This is a plot to play in for a time,
                        The shaft a mighty pillar of the stars
                        With easy steps for baby feet to climb!
                    
                
                
                
                    MARJORIE
                    
                        AN arch of blue above a quiet lake,
                        And still low shores where languid ripples break:
                        In quiet deeps of wood the brooding June
                        Watches the shadows of late afternoon,
                        And o'er the water idle swallows slip
                        With startled cries, to find their wings adrip!
                        But pleasantest of all it is to see
                        There, In the swaying hammock, Marjorie,
                        Repeating rhythmic tales the while her eyes
                        Mirror the lake, the wood, the shore, the skies.
                        Her grave voice leads afar through golden ways
                        Up sunny slopes among the fair dream days,
                        Where trumpets faintly blow from guarded walls
                        And Youth (or Marjorie!) the answer calls.
                    
                
                
                
                    HORATIO AT ELSINORE
                    
                        THERE is no luck at Elsinore
                        Since death came by and barred the door.
                        None enters now save ghost of thee,
                        (And ghosts of every lock make free!)
                        The bat and owl now rule alone,
                        And spiders weave about the throne;
                        Never has there been any rest
                        Since jealous hate was here a guest;
                        And never more shall prince or king
                        Know love, or any kindly thing;
                        So through the chilling autumn rain
                        I call, and do not call in vain,
                        Good night, sweet Prince!
                    
                    
                        The watchman in the lonely tower
                        Calls plaintively the passing hour,
                        And I who walk the parapet,
                        My face with autumn rain made wet,
                        Have bartered all my hopes for fears,
                        My future days for vanished years.
                        
                        II alone at night may stand
                        Where once the Prince held fast my hand,
                        Or walk, where once as brothers twain
                        We walked, and shall not walk again;
                        And dreaming thus I cry to him.
                        Across the Deathland's border dim,
                        Good night, sweet Prince!
                    
                    
                        I promised that the world should know
                        The wretched crimes that wrought his woe;
                        And long to dull, unwilling ears
                        Have I discoursed, and known the jeers
                        Of doubt or mere contempt. I pause
                        At last, and leave my dead friend's cause!
                        I know that it is well with him
                        Beyond the Deathland's border dim.
                        Though luck be not at Elsinore
                        Her shame and wrong touch him no more.
                        So through the cheerless autumn rain
                        I cry, and do not cry in vain
                        Good night, sweet Prince!
                    
                
                
                
                    LABOR AND ART
                    
                        WITH bits of metal, ivory and wood
                        Man makes an Instrument and calls it good;
                        But he that wrought with joy the fair design
                        Can not evoke the hidden chords divine.
                    
                
                
                
                    THE BLIND BOYS
                    
                        I SAW three blind boys in the park at play,
                        Piling; with murmurous glee
                        The new-fallen leaves that round about them lay,
                        And rearing them in forms they could not see.
                        Their sealed eyes had not known
                        The spring's leaves when new-blown,
                        Caught high on boughs they might not hold or touch,
                        Yet they found sweet
                        These poor, dead, crumpled things about their feet.
                        And passing them thus, I thought
                        That from the fair green tree of life not much
                        Is ever within sight or touch
                        Through the bright springs and summers of our years,
                        
                        We, too, are blind!
                        The blindness of weak faith and idle fears,
                        And reaching we scarce find
                        The budding leaves when they are young and sweet,
                        And gain them only at last
                        When on the earth about us they are cast
                        To be a worthless plaything 'neath our feet.
                    
                
                
                
                    IN THE STREET
                    
                        I MET a dusky foreign woman, young
                        And curiously dressed,
                        With quaint coins hung
                        Above the yellow kerchief on her breast;
                        And by her side
                        A little child, dark-eyed,
                        Clutching some foolish plaything in its hand.
                        Such then, I thought, as these
                        We pick as flotsam from the ancient seas,
                        The tossed and helpless straws upon the flood
                        And bring to this new land,
                        To share what we have wrought with Saxon blood,
                        And you, with pedagogic lore,
                        Insistent that we close the great wide-open door,
                        Chide me not in hard supercilious tone!
                        
                        I am as proud as you
                        Of Saxon liberty and Saxon law,
                        Promised of old and by our hands reared true,
                        Yet would not stand apart
                        While under Pharaoh other peoples moan.
                        That half-barbaric child
                        With fear and awe
                        Of long-dead Caesars lurking in its heart,
                        God does not quite disown.
                        And we are weak if we may be defiled!
                    
                
                
                
                    MIRIAM: AT A CONCERT
                    
                        WHEN the great chords with mighty tumult rose,
                        Far-borne upon the trumpets' brazen cry,
                        While the sad 'cellos mourned and over all
                        As from spring meadows sang the violins;
                        When on dim shadowy frontiers the soul heard
                        Not sound nor melody nor taunting theme,
                        But challenge from a fairer world than ours,
                        'Twas then I saw you through the listening throng,
                        Lips parted, dark eyes wondering and grave,
                        Head reverently bent and fingers clasped
                        To stay their trembling. What did you behold
                        On those near coasts of golden harmonies?
                        Did Israel's fallen harp wake in your blood
                        A hymn of glorious deeds on sacred plains?
                        Heard you the crash of trumpet-shaken walls,
                        
                        Or, 'neath the moan of viols and call of drums,
                        The hosts of Zion clanging forth to war?
                        Ah me! Your snowy throat breaks in a sob
                        And tears are bright in your dream-haunted eyes,
                        As the bold chords climb to the heights and die;
                        For you have seen a world-old pageant pass,
                        And the dumb sorrows of a thousand years
                        Have clutched your simple girl-heart; you have known
                        The ghetto's squalor, cringed beneath the knout,
                        Flinched at the bargains of the markets-place.
                        But heard from Time's gray gulfs the ringing voice
                        Of Deborah, lifting Israel's fallen spears.
                        Marshaling the starry hosts 'gainst Sisera!
                    
                
                
                
                    EILEEN
                    
                        THE gods were sad the night that she was born:
                        The faery lights shone over darkling moors,
                        And voices whispering through the lonely hills
                        Stole seaward to dark shores and told the waves,
                        And wave and star conferred in wonderment.
                        The gods were sad the night that she was born.
                    
                    
                        She sang to-night, and in her voice I heard
                        Those whispers and those voices and beheld
                        The faery lights, and from the plaintive shore
                        Saw wave and star commune, ...; She does not know
                        How in her eyes the ancient marvels burn,
                        Or that the dreams flow in her blood like stars
                    
                    
                    
                        On quiet floods by night. There at the harp
                        Her voice caught up the centuries in a song
                        As old as heartache and as young as morn;
                        And armour rang and spears were glad with blood ...;
                        Ah me! Those eyes, that voice, that eerie cry!
                        The gods were sad the night that she was born!
                    
                
                
                
                    TO THE SEASONS
                    
                        SEASONS that pass me by in varied mood.
                        As on the unaging land you leave a trace,
                        Molding sometime a delicate flower's sweet
                            face,
                        Touching again with green the somber wood,
                        Or drawing all beneath a snowy hood,
                        Am I not worthy as they to find a place
                        In your remembrance? Am I made too base
                        To know what weed and thorn have understood?
                    
                    
                        Fair vernal time, I need your quickening
                        Even as the sleeping earth! O summer heat,
                        Make flower and fruit in me that I may bring
                        Full hands to autumn when above me beat
                        The serious winds; and winter, make me strong
                        Like the glad music of your battle song!
