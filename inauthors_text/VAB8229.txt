        VERSO.
        Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1882, by
          J. H. BINFORD, In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at
          Washington, D. C.
      
      
      
        PREFACE.
        Nearly forty years have elapsed since the first newspaper was established in Greenfield,
          and it is a singular omission that there has never been a history of the county Published.
          In this respect Hancock is behind her sister counties.
        The necessity of the work at this time is apparent to all. The first settlers, in whose
          bosoms are contained our unwritten local history, are fast passing away, and it is our
          duty to snatch from oblivion those facts, figures and items of interest worthy of record
          ere it is too late.
        The sketch of Westland Church and school contained herein was furnished by John Brown, an
          old citizen, and the only man living who knew all the facts, and in the absence of the
          records, which were burned, could furnish the same, and he is now no
            more on earth, save in memory. Other instances might be cited. Had the publication
          of the work been postponed a few years, much of the rarest and best history of the county
          would have been forever lost. Besides, it is a duty we owe to the memory of the noble
          fathers who have cleared the forests, made the roads, and prepared this fair land for our
          habitation, to preserve a record of their lives and noble acts.
        The plan of the work is simple and convenient. The reader is first furnished with a
          bird's-eye view of the county, from which he obtains a general idea of the territory to be
          surveyed and the magnitude of the undertaking. The townships are then considered in
          regular alphabetical order, and discussed as fully as practicable, consistent with the
          limits of the work. Following these are numerous  chapters,
          charts, tables, essays, sketches, biographies and discussions of all matters of historical
          interest in the county.
        It has been the constant aim of the publishers to furnish a complete history in every
          respect, including an elaborate pen picture of the present. Portraits and personal
          sketches of the prominent men of the county and all the county officers will be found
          herein. The heavy tax-payers, all the business men and officers are noted in the proper
          place, that our patrons may have a book to hand down to their children and grandchildren
          that will give them not only our past history, but such a complete view of the present, as we should be happy to have of the past, when our parents and grandparents were the
          pioneers, county and township officers, tax-payers and business men of the day.
        The publishers have striven to give a fair and impartial history, without fear or favor,
          regardless of race, color, party, sect, or any other consideration, hence the reader will
          find herein sketches and portraits of representative men, past and present, white and
          colored, rich and poor, churchmen and non-churchmen, native-born and foreigners, Whigs,
          Free-Soilers, Know-Nothings, Republicans, Democrats and Nationals.
        The publishers are vain enough to think that the book will be interesting, not only as a
          volume to be read, but as a work of reference on all important data connected with the
          county. They have endeavored to give their patrons more, in every respect, than was
          promised in the prospectus. The book contains a hundred and fifty pages extra, twice as
          many portraits, vastly more "rule and figure" work, and is fuller and better in contents
          and mechanical make-up than was originally contemplated or ever represented. In making
          these additions, however, it has delayed the delivery of the work somewhat, but, in view
          of the extra labor and expense expended thereon, they trust their friends will be
          satisfied. To partially offset this extra outlay, which the publishers were scarcely
          justifiable in making on a work with necessarily a small circulation, owing to the limited
          territory, they have introduced a very few  advertisements
          in the rear of the book, and there only. Not a cent has ever been
          received or asked for any notice in the various "business directories" herein, nor for any
          biography, personal sketch or other complimentary remark about any person or property, man
          or matter. Only what follows page 536 is subject to the charge of "paid notice," and even
          that in a few years will be valuable history, and appreciated by the public as showing who
          were some of the enterprising business men of to-day. The publishers emphatically
          repudiate any charge that may be made, as is often done against county histories, that it
          is made up of "advertisements" and "paid puffs."
        The first steps looking forward toward the publication of this work were taken about a
          year ago by King & Harden, the latter of whom did most of the canvassing, and aided
          materially in getting the work under headway, when he sold his interest, September first,
          to J. H. Binford, who had previously been employed to do the writing, since which the new
          firm of King & Binford have been the sole proprietors and managers, and upon, the
          former has devolved largely the labor of collecting the materials from official and other
          sources.
        In presenting this work to the public the publishers beg the indulgence of their patrons
          and friends for any errors that may have crept in. The materials have been collected from
          various sources, at a considerable expenditure of time, labor and patience, and the
          memories of some of the aged pioneer reporters being a little deficient, their accounts
          may occasionally differ, yet it is believed on the whole to be correct, more so perhaps
          than are histories generally, yet, should the reader discover errors, as he doubtless
          will, let him "pass them lightly o'er," for no regrets their occurrence more than the
          writer. As to the style of the composition, it was intended to be plain and simple and, as
          free from the diffuse, labored and pompous as possible, but is not at all times as far
          removed from some of these defects as would have been had the writer had the time to rewrite and properly revise, but such was impossible in  the limited time that could be spared from his other duties.
          As to the comprehensiveness of the work, should any one look in vain for some biography or
          early reminiscence, let such a one remember that it is impossible to crowd in a single
          volume an account of everything of interest in a county of the size and age of Hancock. To
          do so would require a half-dozen such works as this and more labor and expense than the
          legitimate patronage would warrant, hence it is only a question of a judicious selection
          of materials and representative facts. However, there are a few churches, individuals,
          bands, lodges and other matters left unnoticed that would have received proper attention,
          notwithstanding the amount of matter claiming admittance, had the publishers been able to
          find any person sufficiently interested in perpetuating their memory to open the bolted
          doors or furnish the necessary facts, but perhaps "what is our loss is their gain."
        As to the arrangement of the portraits, with the exception of a few mistakes, it is the
          best that could be done under the circumstances, consistent with an even distribution of
          the same and a logical treatment of the subject. In this respect, as in every other, the
          publishers have endeavored to be wholly impartial and non-sectional, hence each township
          is fully and fairly represented, the contrast being seldom greater than the difference in
          size and population.
        To Senator Ben Harrison, State Superintendent John M. Bloss, the county officers, older
          citizens of the county, and others who have contributed materials and substantial
          encouragement to the enterprise, the publishers would return their sincere thanks and make
          their final bow, admitting, after all, that how well they have succeeded is for their
          patrons to decide, whose verdict is irrevocable,
        KING & BINFORD.

        INTRODUCTION.
        After Christopher Columbus had returned from making his great discoveries which brought
          another continent into existence, all the enterprising nations of Europe fitted out
          vessels to make explorations in this land of promise, Spain sending her men to the
          Southern, France to the Northern and England to the Atlantic Coast of North America. Their
          claims necessarily conflicted, as the grants of Spain extended from the Gulf of Mexico to
          the Arctic Ocean, France from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, and England passing
          over both of these from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
        Indiana was originally claimed as a part of Florida, which became a Spanish colony in
          1543. Northern Indiana was included in the territory granted in 1620 to the Plymouth
          Company by King James, and was therefore claimed by Great Britain, but the French
          possessed a superior claim, and retained the territory by establishing settlements and
          fortifications. Vincennes settlement, the first in what is now Indiana, was made in 1702,
          one hundred and eighty years ago. This territory remained in the possession of the French
          until 1763, the close of the memorable French and Indian war, when by treaty it passed
          into the hands of the English.
        Indiana was at this time inhabited by the great Miami confederacy of Indians, whose
          territory embraced Indiana and the greater portion of Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and
          Wisconsin. Here the red men of the forests had held supreme control, unmolested in their
          rights for many years, an independent nation, commanding the respect of all the
          neighboring tribes. No wonder that when they saw the white man advancing and taking
          possession of their beloved hunting-grounds that the latent passions which lay slumbering
          in their breasts burst forth with all the fury of uncivilized manhood.
        In 1778 Colonel George Rodgers Clarke, with four companies of Virginians, captured Post
          Vincennes, but it was retaken  by the British in the same
          year. In 1779 Colonel Clarke again recaptured it. The Indians now began their depredations
          on the settlers, and a body of men, under General Harmur, was sent against them, which was
          totally defeated, in what is now Allen county, by the famous Indian Chief, "Little
          Turtle." In 1791 General Charles Scott destroyed the Wea villages on the Wabash. After the
          defeat of Harmur, General St. Clair organized a new force, which was also defeated near
          the present site of Fort Wayne. In 1794 General Wayne (familiarly known to the Indians as
          "Mad Anthony, a man who never slept") appeared against them, and completely humiliated the
          whole confederacy, moved on to the confluence of the St. Mary's and St. Joseph rivers, and
          erected Fort Wayne. This for a time ended the Indian troubles.
        In 1787 the North-west territory was organized, embracing the present States of Ohio,
          Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and that part of Minnesota east of the Missisippi.
          In 1800 Ohio was set apart as a separate territory, leaving the remainder of the
          North-west territory to constitute Indiana. Of this new Indiana territory William H.
          Harrison, of Virginia, was the first Governor, and the seat of government was located at
          Vincennes. John Gibson, of Pennsylvania, was appointed Secretary; William Clarke, Henry
          Vanderbourgh and John Griffin Territorial Judges. The whole white population then of what
          is now the great State of Indiana, with her hundreds of thousands, was only 4,875, but
          about one-fourth of the population of Hancock county to-day.
        Indiana was first organized into three counties, viz: Knox, Randolph and St. Clair. In
          1802 Clark was added and a convention held at the territorial capital, composed of
          delegates from the four counties.
        The first General Assembly met at Vincennes in 1805, with delegates from the above
          counties and Dearborn, which had since been added. New counties have been organized from
          time to time, till there are now ninety-two in the great "Hoosier" State. Governor
          Harrison's address to the first legislative assembly in Indiana was full of patriotism and
          exhortation to faithful, honest duty. Indiana territory was divided, and Michigan
          territory struck off and organized on the north in 1805.
        In the territorial code, framed in 1807, we see a wide difference

           from our present laws. Treason, murder, arson and
          horse-stealing were punishable by death. Manslaughter was punishable according to the
          common law. The crimes of burglary and robbery were punishable by whipping, fine, and in
          some cases by imprisonment not exceeding forty years. Larceny was punishable by fine and
          whipping. Forgery by fine, disfranchisement and standing in the pillory. Hog-stealing by
          fine and whipping.
        In 1802 Jeffersonville, the present county seat of Clark county, was laid out at the
          falls of the Ohio river according to a plan proposed by President Jefferson.
        Between the years 1805 and 1807 Aaron Burr, the man who at one time lacked only one vote
          of being President of the United States, visited the people of the Ohio Valley to get
          assistance to carry out his plans, which were undoubtedly treasonable to the General
          Government.
        In 1809 Illinois territory was cut from the western part of Indiana, comprising the
          territory west of the Wabash, from a line running north from Vincennes to the Dominion of
          Canada, and this now reduced Indiana to her present limits.
        In 1810 new troubles with the Indians commenced. A plan of campaign was formed, which
          ended in the great Indian battle of Tippecanoe, where General Harrison routed the Indians
          and caused them to sue for peace, but the war of 1812 coming on brought with it new
          difficulties with the Indians. Many murders occurred, and the frontier settlers were kept
          in alarm until the close of this second war with Great Britain. The farmers when working
          in the fields carried in their belts revolvers and knives. The gun was laid on the ground
          by a driven stake to mark the spot. Men then expected to be attacked at any time, and were
          ready to act on the "spur of the moment."
        In 1810 the census tables of Indiana territory showed a population of 24,520; and there
          were thirty-three grist-mills, fourteen saw-mills, three horse-mills, eighteen tanneries,
          twenty-eight distilleries, three powder-mills, 1,256 looms and 1,350 spinning-wheels.
        In 1813 the seat of government was removed from Vincennes to Corydon, the latter being a
          more central point.
        In 1814 the territory was divided into five districts, Washington and Knox constituting
          one, Gibson and Warrick one,

           Harrison and Clarke one, Jefferson and Dearborn one, and
          Franklin and Wayne one, in each of which the voters were empowered to elect a member to
          the legislative council.
        Indiana adopted a constitution and was admitted to the Union in 1816. Jonathan Jennings,
          under the new constitution, was elected first Governor of the State over Thomas Posey, who
          had been Governor of the territory, the vote standing 5,211 to 3,934. In 1820 the site of
          the present seat of government was selected by commissioners appointed by the General
          Assembly. In 1825 the capital was removed from Corydon to Indianapolis. In 1834 the State
          Bank was chartered. In 1842 imprisonment for debt was abolished.
        Indiana has had numerous Indian wars, and forty-four treaties have been made with the
          various tribes from time to time.
        Indiana, when the great rebellion threatened this country with destruction, came nobly to
          the front with her brave "boys in blue," from time to time, to the number of 200,000. Few
          States can say as much; and Hancock county was not afraid; to marshal her forces and send
          them to the front to be trodden in the dust by the iron hoof of the war-horse.
        The first railroad in Indiana was built in 1846, between Madison and Indianapolis. Five
          thousand miles of railroad are now in operation, and others in the process of
          construction. In 1851 our old constitution was abolished, and a new and much better one
          adopted. Our vote was as follows: 109,319 for and 26,755 against the same.

        Indiana now stands among the leading States of the Union. Her school fund is larger by
          two millions than any other State in the Union. Her manufacturing resources are unbounded,
          her coal fields are among the most productive, and furnish a large source of wealth, her
          water power is excellent, and her railroads numerous, Indianapolis, our capital, being the
          greatest railroad center in the State, and not surpassed by any city in the United States
          in this respect. Jeffersonville, New Albany and South Bend are respectively noted for
          their extensive "car works," "glass works," and "wagon factory.".
        We have seen Indiana when a forest, dotted here and there by prairies which seemed like,
          oases in a desert. We have seen noble, hardy pioneers with their families, entering into
          the country and, with their glittering axes, leveling the 
          giant progeny of the forest. We have seen Indiana when the red men owned the soil, and
          when only a cabin here and there showed where the march of civilization had begun. We have
          seen her in infancy, with a white population only one-fourth as large as that of Hancock
          county. We have seen her when the savage red men took the war-path, destroyed her
          property, murdered her children and rejoiced in the victory. But the noble pioneers who
          settled this country braved all these dangers, and established their institutions of
          liberty, religion and truth 
            ROBERT SMITH.
           upon a firm foundation. We see Indiana as she stands to-day in all her grandeur,
          glorying in her power, rejoicing in her resources, sending great men to the various fields
          of action, educating her boys and girls without cost, and shedding the glorious rays of
          truth and enlightenment to all her people.
        May her light still continue to shine in the firmament as brilliantly as the noonday sun,
          and diffuse the blessings of liberty to all mankind.
      
    
    
      
      
        HISTORY OF HANCOCK COUNTY.
        
          CHAPTER I. BIRD'S-EYE VIEW.
          HANCOCK COUNTY, Indiana, is located a little east of the
            geographical center of the state. It is in latitude 40° north, and longitude 86° west,
            of Greenwich, or 9° west from Washington, and is in townships fifteen, sixteen, and
            seventeen north, and ranges five, six, seven, and eight east. In size it is about an
            average county of the state, being composed of 307 sections, or square miles, and
            containing about 196,480 acres. It is bounded on the west by Marion and Hamilton, on the
            north by Madison and Hamilton, on the east by Henry and Rush, and on the south by
            Shelby, Rush and Henry. It is chiefly bordered, however, by Marion on the west, Madison
            on the north, Henry on the east, and Shelby on the south. Hamilton forms only one mile
            of the western boundary and four of the northern; Rush forms six miles of the eastern
            and two of the southern, and Henry forms but one mile of the southern boundary. The
            greatest length of the county is nineteen miles, east and west, and its greatest width
            seventeen miles north and south.
          Hancock county was cut off from Madison and organized in the year 1828, and named in
            honor of John Hancock, president of the convention that adopted the immortal
            "Declaration of Independence."
          
          At the time of the organization of the county it contained but few inhabitants, and
            they were scattered. At the first presidential election held in the county, which
            occurred November 3, 1828, the whole number of votes cast were 101, and now the whole
            number is, according to the census of 1880, 4,170. Then the entire population of the
            county was about 400; now it is 17,123. Then there were, perhaps, 135 children of school
            age in the county; now there are 5,646. Then there was but one clock in the county; now
            there is one in nearly every household. Then there were no broad fields of golden grain,
            cut with a self-binder and threshed with a steam thresher, but only here and there a
            small patch cleared in the green, cut with a sickle and threshed with a flail. Then our
            whole territory was almost one unbroken wilderness, in which were numerous Indians, wild
            deer, bears, panthers, wild cats, rattlesnakes, wolves, owls, turkies, opossums,
            raccoons, and porcupines. This condition of affairs has changed. The Indian has bid
            adieu to his native hunting grounds; the church bell has taken the place of the
            warwhoop; the poisonous fanged serpent, at the sight of civilization, has faded away as
            if under the benign influence of St. Patrick. What changes have taken place! The old
            landmarks are nearly gone; but few of the early pioneers,—our grandfathers and
            their sires,—are left, and they, one by one, are fast, passing away. Our progress,
            from a small beginning to our present status, has cost untold toil, hardships and
            privations, not fully appreciated by the youug of the present generation. This book is
            written, in part, that their names, and the trials they underwent, may, to some extent,
            be perpetuated. We shall show, step by step, the progress made decade after decade. This
            chapter is only intended as a bird's eye view of the territory, preparatory to a more
            detailed account, in which the townships will be considered separately, and elaborated
            thoroughly, when our minds will be carried back to the brave pioneers, to learn their
            names and mode of living, and to follow them up amidst the hardships incident to  pioneer life to balmier days and more pleasant surroundings
            even to the present time.
          Hancock county is quite flat, there being but few hills, except in the immediate
            vicinity of the water-courses, and .several-of these have no banks worthy of the name.
            Blue River and Sugar Creek have considerable banks, and Brandywine at places. Blue-river
            and Sugar-creek townships are rolling, and somewhat undulating, but the county, on the
            whole, is remarkably level, and was once considered "low and wet;" but since it has been
            so thoroughly drained by tile ditches, and good roads built, we hear but little
            complaint in that direction.
          It is now considered healthful, and as free from malaria and miasmatic diseases as any
            of its border counties; though there was once a great deal of ague and fever, bilious
            fever, and considerable milk-sickness.
          Our soil, generally speaking, is exceedingly fertile; indeed, almost exhaustless in
            resources. The black, low grounds, which in the early history of the country were
            considered almost worthless, and were, therefore, the last entered, are now, since being
            drained, found to be the richest and most productive. The first settlements in the
            county were made on the uplands, hills and knolls, if possible. Thirty years ago, about
            a hundred feet above Blue River, in the midst of a small field, there stood a tiny log
            cabin, without roof, window, chimney, or floor, unfinished, decaying, which the writer
            passed hundreds, of times when a boy, and then learned that it was begun long years
            since for a pioneer cottage; but in the "raising," there being little help, the
            proprietor was crushed by the falling of a log on nearing the gable.
          The principal exports of the county are wheat, corn, hogs, cattle, horses, oats,
            potatoes, flaxseed, apples, hay, and sheep.
          Hancock county's first exports were ginseng, venison-hams, firs, flax and tow
            linen.
          The statistical returns of 1880 show that our county produced, on 27,752 acres, 580,207
            bushels wheat; on  37,072 acres, 1,187,328 bushels corn; on
            1,665 acres, 45,129 bushels oats. The same year we produced 16,752 bushels Irish
            potatoes, 51,160 bushels flaxseed, 42,028 bushels apples, and had in our county 5,228
            head of horses, 285 head of mules, 9,609 head of cattle, 9,340 head of sheep, and 23,400
            head of hogs old enough to fatten. The county was once heavily timbered with a large per
            cent. of the best kinds of saw timber, such as walnut, poplar, oak, ash, and cherry.
            Walnut timber of the finest quality was once not only used for fencing and fire-wood,
            but was deadened and burned in log-heaps, to get it out of the way.
          There are large beds of sand and gravel in various parts of the county. At least seven
            out of the nine townships have sufficient gravel, of good quality, to make all her
            roads, public and private, in good order.
          The county is well watered with numerous streams, springs and wells of excellent
            limestone water.
          Blue River, the largest stream in the county, a fine, clear, lasting mill stream, runs
            across the south-eastern corner of Blue-river township, entering Shelby county just
            below Bacon's mill. Its bottoms are broad and exceedingly fertile.
          Sugar Creek, the next in size, is a clear, rapid, medium-size mill stream. It rises in
            the western part of Henry county, near Elizabeth City, enters Hancock county within a
            few rods of the north-east corner, and runs in a south-west direction to within half a
            mile of Warrington; thence northwest, dipping into the edge of Madison a few rods;
            thence in a general south-westerly direction through Brown, Green, and across the corner
            of Vernon; thence through Center, Buck-creek, and Sugar-creek townships, entering Shelby
            county a mile and a half south of New Palestine.
          Brandywine Creek, a rather small-sized mill stream, rises in Brown township, about a
            mile west of Warrington, and runs in a south-westerly direction through Brown and
            Jackson townships, and to the central northern middle 
            portion of Center township, four miles north of Greenfield; thence nearly south through
            Center and Brandywine townships, entering Shelby county six miles south of the county
            seat.
          Buck Creek, a small, sluggish stream, rises in Vernon township, about a mile and a half
            south-west of Fortville, runs south-west through Buck-creek township, across the
            north-west corner of Sugar-creek township, entering Marion county one mile south of the
            south-west corner of Buck-creek township.
          Nameless Creek is a small stream. Rising in the central portion of Jackson township, it
            runs south-west in Jackson, and empties into Blue River on the B. P. Butler farm.
          Six Mile Creek rises in Henry county, flows south through Jackson, past
            Charlottesville, across the corner of Rush county, entering Blue-river township at its
            central eastern border; thence south-west, emptying into Blue river on the Wm. Cook
            farm.
          Little Brandywine Creek rises near the boundary line between Center and Jackson
            townships, runs south-west, and empties into Brandywine two miles south by south-east of
            Greenfield.
          Little Sugar Creek, a small, sluggish stream, rises in the north-west part of Center
            township, and running south by south-west, empties into Sugar Creek.
          Flat Fork of Lick Creek rises in the south-east part of Vernon township, runs north by
            north-west, enters Hamilton county one mile west of Fortville, and empties into Lick
            Creek. These small streams have all been ditched and cleared out near their heads.
          Swamp Creek is a sui generis small stream, taking its rise in Madison
            county. It runs nearly south, crossing Lick Creek in Madison county and Sugar-creek in
            Hancock county; crossing the National road at the Robert H. Ross farm, and finally
            losing itself in Brandywine Creek. This stream presents the general appearance of the
            bed of a lost river, being from forty to eighty rods wide, filled with decayed and
            decaying vegetable matter, more or less  soft and yielding,
            and with a tiny, turbid stream running through the center thereof.
          Little Swan Creek rises in the south-western part of Center township, runs south by
            south-west, crosses Brandywine township, and enters Shelby county at the southern
            extremity of the boundary line between Sugar-creek and Brandywine townships.
          There are numerous other small streams, unworthy of notice, in various parts of the
            county.
          
            MAP OF HANCOCK COUNTY IN 1828.
          
          Hancock county is reasonably well supplied with good gravel road turnpikes, there being
            one hundred and eighty miles of the same, 104 of which are now incorporated and pay
            taxes, and seventy-six of which were once taxed, but have since rescinded their charters
            and gone back to the  public. These pikes are several in
            number, and were built at an average cost of $1,2000 per mile, making a total cost of
            $216,000. Her public reads are generally graded, and in many places graveled by her
            citizens in working out their road taxes, and personal privileges.
          Hancock county originally consisted of three townships, to-wit: Blue-river, Brandywine,
            and Sugar-creek.
          These townships were organized in 1828, at the time of the separation from Madison
            county, and each extending to the county line.
          Blue-river township was reduced in size and located in the south-east part of the
            county in 1831, with thirty sections. Jackson township was the name assigned to the
            remainder of Blue-river, and was located in the north-eastern part of the county, by the
            commissioners, in 1831.
          Brandywine township was reduced to thirty sections in the same year, and located in the
            central southern portion of the county.
          Center township was, in 1831, located north of Brandywine township, extending three
            miles north and south and six miles east and west, and containing eighteen sections.
          Harrison township was also organized in the same year, and composed of the remainder of
            Brandywine north of Center to the north line of the county.
          Buck-creek was cut off from Sugar-creek in 1831, and made to extend from congressional
            line sixteen to the north county line.
          Green was taken from the north part of Jackson and Harrison in 1832, and composed of
            that part of the county north of congressional line seventeen, and consisted of sixty
            sections; being the same territory now embodied in Brown and Green.
          In the year 1833, Brown township was dissevered from Green, and made to consist of
            thirty sections, its present size.
          In 1835, Center township was increased one tier of sections, taken from the northern
            part of Brandywine.  Vernon township was cut off from the
            north part of Buck-creek north of congressional line seventeen, and made to consist of
            thirty-one sections.
          Jones township was formed in 1838, by taking two tier of sections from the north part
            of Sugar-creek, and a like number from the south part of Buck-creek, and composed of
            twenty-four sections.
          
            HANCOCK COUNTY FROM 1850 TO 1853.
          
          Union township was made up from the eastern part of Buck-creek, the western part of
            Harrison, and the south-east corner of Vernon, in 1838; and composed of twenty
            sections.
          
          Worth township was composed of the north part of Jackson and the north-east corner of
            Center, and organized in the year 1850.
          At the March term, 1853, the commissioners divided Jones township between Sugar-creek
            and Buck-creek; Union township between Buck-creek, Vernon and Center; Worth township
            between Center and Jackson, and attached Harrison to Center; thereby obliterating Jones,
            Union, Worth, and Harrison, and leaving nine civil townships, as we now have them.
          Blue-river township is located in the south-east corner of the county; Brown in the
            north-east; Brandywine in the south middle; Buck-creek in the west middle; Center in the
            middle; Green in the central northern portion; Jackson in the eastern middle portion;
            Sugar-creek in the south-west corner; and Vernon in the north-west corner of the
            county.
          Thus it may be seen that the county is composed of nine civil townships, arranged in
            three tiers of three townships each. The eastern division, composed of Brown, Jackson
            and Blue-river, constitutes the first commissioner's district; Green, Center and
            Brandywine the second; Vernon, Buck-creek and Sugar-creek the third; the present
            commissioners of which are, respectively, Augustus Dennis, Ephraim Bentley and John
            Dye.
          Hancock county was first, settled about the year 1818. Previous to the United States
            survey of 1819, Andrew Evans and John Montgomery, with their families, and Montgomery
            McCall, came into this county, and settled on Blue River. At the same time, Platt and
            James Montgomery, brothers of John, and Isaac Roberts, with their families, and David
            Stephenson, settled in Center township. In 1820, Elijah Tyner, Harmon Warrum, Joshua
            Wilson, and John Foster, with their families, also settled on Blue River. In 1822,
            Solomon Tyner, John Osborn, and George Penwell, with their families, came and settled
            with the others on the same historic stream. The above, and a few others, were all in
            the county at, and before, its  organization. After this
            time the immigrants were more numerous, the more prominent of whom we will notice in the
            proper place in their respective townships.
          
            HANCOCK COUNTY FROM 1853 TO THE PRESENT.
          
          Among the early incidents, which are more numerous than were the pioneers themselves,
            we will note the following:
          The first school-house in the county was a log one, diminutive in size, and exceedingly
            rude in architecture, erected near Elijah Tyner's old place, on Blue River, in the year
            1823.
          The first male teacher who taught in the county was Lewis Tyner.
          Green township claims the honor of furnishing employment to the first female teacher,
            Mrs. Sarah Gant.
          In 1818, the first log cabin was built by Andrew Evans.
          In 1824, Joshua Wilson built the first grist mill, located on the banks of Blue River.
            This mill was a small, one-story  log structure, which,
            soon after being erected, was sold to Henry Watts, on account of some difficulty about
            the obstruction of water.
          In the neighborhood of John Hinchman's old farm, in Center township, now owned by Abram
            Hackleman, was organized, in 1820, by the Methodists, the first religious society in the
            county.
          The first blacksmith in the county was Thomas Phillips, who had his shop on Blue River,
            in about 1822.
          Among the first taverns in the county, was one erected by Andrew Jackson, near
            Greenfield, in about 1825.
          Elijah Tyner, on Blue River, had the first store in the county. He was also the first
            to set out an orchard.
          The first road in the county was an old Indian trail, known as the "Napoleon Trace,"
            which extended through Blue-river, Jackson, and Green townships, crossing Blue River
            near Warrum's old home, and Sugar Creek near 'Squire Hatfield's, at a place 'known as
            the "Stover Ford."
          When the Montgomerys, McCall, and Evans, first settled, they had to go to White Water
            to mill, where Connersville now stands, some forty miles distant.
          McCall, when he first came to the county, cleared a few acres of ground by yoking his
            oxen to the grubs and pulling them out by the roots. He then climbed up the surrounding
            trees, and trimmed off the branches to considerable height, and with them constructed a
            fence around his little patch, thus making the first fence in the county.
          It has been said; in illustration of the capacity of one of the rude mills, erected in
            what was then Vernon township, but now Center, on Sugar Creek, that Rev. Wiley
            Pilkenton, who was a zealous, long-winded, old-school Baptist, would put in the hopper a
            two-bushel grist of corn, attend a two days' camp-meeting, and return in time to toll
            it. This mill was located just above the Sugar Creek bridge, on the Noblesville road. In
            size, it was about sixteen feet square, one-story high, constructed of small logs, or
            poles, and covered with clapboards. A stranger was passing this mill, on a certain
            occasion, when  he vociferously ordered the girls to "hold
            that d——d thing till I get by!"
          The following are the post-offices and villages in Hancock county:
          Post-offices.—Westland, in Blue-river township; Warrington and
            Willow Brach, in Brown township; Cleveland and Charlottesville, in Jackson township;
            McCordsville and Woodbury, in Vernon township; Philadelphia and Gem, in Sugar-creek
            township; Mount Comfort, in Buck-creek township; Carrollton, in Brandywine township;
            Eden and Milner's Corner, in Green township; Binwood, in Center township.
          Incorporated Villages.—Our incorporated villages are:
            Fortville, in Vernon township, and New Palestine, in 
              COURT-HOUSE.
             Sugar-creek township. Charlottesville has been an incorporated town for a
            number of years until recently, when her corporation was dissolved, and a receiver
            appointed.
          
          The public buildings of Hancock county consist, at present, of a court-house, jail and
            sheriff's residence, poor-house, ninety-two public school buildings, and about fifty
            church buildings.
          The present court-house was built by Nathan Crawford, deceased, an old and honored
            citizen, in the year 1854, upon a contract of $14,400. It is a substantial, convenient,
            and commodious building, honestly built by an honest man, and is, perhaps, not equaled
            by any public building in the state, at as low a cost.
          The poor-house is located on the National road, two and a half miles east of
            Greenfield, in section thirty-five, township sixteen north, and range seven east. The
            building is a discredit to the county, being old and dilapidated, and not at all in
            harmony with the wealth and dignity of our citizens. The superintendent's residence is a
            plain, old-fashioned, story-and-a-half brick, built many years since for a private
            residence. The infirmary building proper is a cheap frame, known by carpenters as a
            "plank house," built in the rear of, and attached to, the superintendent's residence.
            The building is not only cheaply constructed, and poorly ventilated, but small and
            wholly inadequate to the demands of the unfortunate. A new building has been
            contemplated for several years; but, owing to "hard times" and "indebtedness of the
            county," the matter has been neglected.
          The county has a very elegant, commodious, and convenient jail, and sheriff's residence
            in front, built upon a contract of $32,900; but costing, according to the records,
            $75,000, without interest, before completion. The building is a brick, with stone
            foundation, slate roof, and neatly finished inside and out. The architecture is modern,
            and and the work all first-class. The sheriff's residence is large, convenient, and
            finished in good taste. Considerable complaint has been made on account of the number of
            escaping convicts, who have succeeded in cutting and breaking out; but this is not
            wholly owing to the weakness of the jail, but more, perhaps, to too great leniency to
            the inmates.
          
          The public school building, in Greenfield, is an elegant two-story brick, with
            basement, stone foundation, slate roof, and ash finish, and will accommodate nine
            teachers and five hundred pupils. It was built in the year 1869 and 1870 by Harmon
            Everett, upon a contract of $20,000, payable in bonds on the corporation of the town of
            Greenfield. Everett took $10,000 in bonds in part payment. The 
              GREENFIELD GRADED SCHOOL BUILDING.
             architects were Ennis and Hubert, of Indianapolis. The school trustees were A.
            K. Branham, Philander H. Boyd, and H. B. Wilson, of Greenfield. The stone for the
            foundation were shipped from St. Paul, in Decatur county. The brick were shipped and
            hauled, in part, from Knightstown. The building was begun in April, 1869, and the first
            school was taught in the fall of the same year.
          A comparison of the taxes, mode of collecting, property, and wealth of the county, in
            its early history, with the present, shows that our growth has not only been steady, but
            rapid. The total taxes for 1829 were $703,17. The record shows the following:

              (County Treasurer Hancock County).
            
          
          The summary for the year 1833 shows the total tax to have been $787.88½, signed by
            Joseph Chapman, C. H. C. C.; which, when interpreted, means Clerk Hancock Circuit Court.
            The report for 1833 further shows 616 polls, 606 horses, 168 oxen, twenty-three watches,
            and two pleasuring carriages; being an increase in one year of ninety-two polls,
            twenty-one horses, and four oxen, and a decrease of four watches and one clock, there
            being no clock returned for the year 1833.
          The reader will observe, from an examination of the summary report given above, that
            the ad valorem system of taxation, now prevalent, was not then used;
            but a specified tax was levied on each article of a certain class, regardless of value.
            This system continued in vogue till the year 1836.
          We give below a copy of the last report under the old specific tax system, made in
            1835.

              6 covering horses
              12 00
            
            
              684 polls
              342 00
            
            
              Total
              $925 28
            
          
          A comparison of the two reports shows that people were increasing in numbers and wealth
            and could afford more time-pieces, and other luxuries. In 1835, we find one gold watch,
            the first ever owned and taxed in the county; two brass clocks, and three composition
            watches.
          Under the system of specific taxation, the following were the rates till 1832: On each
            poll, 50 cents; on each horse, 37½ cents; on each ox, 18¾ cents; on each silver
            watch, 25 cents; on each gold watch, $1.00; on stallions, the rate they stood at per
            season; for land, half the rate of state taxes. From 1832 to 1834 the rates were: On
            each poll, 50 cents; on town lots, ½ cent on each $1.00; work oxen, 25 cents; horses
            over three years old, 50 cents; watches, 50 cents; clocks, $1.00; the tax on every
            100 acres of first-rate land, 40 cents; on second-rate land, 30 cents; on third-rate
            land, 20 cents. In the year 1834, the commissioners adopted the following list of rates:
            On each poll, 50 cents; on land, one-half the state tax; on each horse, valued at over
            $10.00, 50 cents; on each watch and pleasuring carriage, 50 cents; on horses and
            jacks, the price of the season at which they stand; on each yoke of oxen over three
            years old, 50 cents; on each brass clock, 50 cents; tavern license in Greenfield,
            $15.00; in other parts of the 
            
            
             county, $10.00; license to vend wooden clocks, $10.00;
            foreign goods, $10.00. These rates remained in force for two years, or until the
            adoption of the ad valorem system, in 1836, when the rates were fixed
            by the commissioners at 20 cents on each $100 of real and personal property, and 75
            cents on each poll.
          Prior to the year 1836, watches, clocks and carriages were considered luxuries in which
            only the rich were at liberty to indulge, and they were compelled to pay for the
            privilege. Hence, the tax on a watch, though it be ever so old and cheap, was
            twenty-five per cent more than the tax on one hundred acres of the best land, listed as
            " first-rate;" the tax on a brass clock, regardless of its cost and real worth, was just
            equal to the tax on two hundred and fifty acres of the best land, or five hundred acres
            of third-rate land; and the tax on a pleasuring carriage was equal to the tax on one
            hundred and sixty-six and two-thirds acres of second-rate land, or two hundred and fifty
            acres of third-rate land. Again, the taxes on a clock or gold watch were equal to the
            tax on two head of horses, or two hundred dollars in money. The policy of the law seems
            to have been to discourage luxuries by high taxation, and to encourage the purchasing
            and owning of land by making the tax on it low.
          From the year 1834 to the year 1836, it cost one as much to obtain a license to vend
            wooden clocks or foreign goods as it did to pay the county taxes on two thousand five
            hundred acres of the best land, or five thousand acres of third-rate land.
          From the records of the year 1836, being the first under the ad
              valorem system, the following report is obtained:

                Hancock county for the year 1881, shows the value of land to be
              $4,438,190
            
            
              Value of improvements

              $8,226,835
            
          
          It may be seen from the above that the value of lands and improvements was $27.00 per
            acre. The total value of taxables in the county averages $43.00 per acre. According to
            the auditor's report, the following is a true exhibit of the financial condition of
            Hancock county—the amount of funds on hand June 1, 1881:

              Total on hand, as per report of county commissioners
              $42,612 27
            
          
          From other official sources we learn that the county expends, annually, over $40,000
            for school purposes. The amount expended for the year ending September 1, 1881, was
            $42,562.83. Of this there was expended for tuition $26,077.07, and for special fund
            $16,485.86.
          In further illustration of the growth of the county and her present wealth, it may be
            noted that the receipts of the county for the year ending May 31, 1881, were
            $169,449.84, including a balance in the treasury, May 31, 1880, of $51,650.58. The
            expenditures, including a balance on hand of $42,612.27, are the same. Orders
            outstanding May 31, 1880, are reported at $695.95; orders issued within the year,
            $87,665.54; orders redeemed within the year, $87,973.50; orders outstanding May 31,
            1881, $387.99; county bonds outstanding, $25,000.
          Early in the history of our county, the poor were left to depend upon their own
            resources, supplemented by the gratuitous favors of their friends. But now it is
            otherwise. The poor and infirm, the sick and unfortunate, who are unable to care for
            themselves, are provided for at the county's expense. For the year ending June 1, 1880,
            the orders issued by the trustees of the different townships of the county amounted to
            $4,601.55. Of this amount Center township issued orders to the extent of $2,296.17,
            which was the largest amount expended by any one township, and Blue-river township
            issued orders for the same purpose to the amount of $54.25, being the smallest amount
            expended by any one township. The trustee of Sugar-creek township issued orders which
            foot up $92. 11, being next to Blue-river township in the ascending scale. The trustee
            of Jackson township issued orders to the  amount of
            $719.19, next to Center township in the descending scale.
          The county is reasonably well supplied with railroads. The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and
            St. Louis passes east and west through the central portion; the Cleveland, Columbus,
            Cincinnati and Indianapolis (Bee Line) crosses the north-western portion; and the
            Cincinnati, Hamilton and Indianapolis (Old Junction) crosses the south-western portion.
            The Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western railroad company is now extending a line
            across the county, entering Buck-creek, crossing Center and the north-west corner of
            Jackson, and out through Brown. This road will probably be completed early in 1882. The
            county will then have about fifty-six miles of completed road. Another road is
            contemplated, to extend north and south through the county, past Eden and the Junction,
            and through Greenfield to Shelbyville. The road is completed to Anderson, and if
            sufficient assistance is voted along the proposed route, it will be completed through to
            Shelbyville. Should this road be built, as projected, there will not be a township in
            the county without a railroad; and without it, all but Green are partially, or wholly,
            crossed by roads completed, or being completed. The P., C. and St. L., being the old
            "Indiana Central," has a line of about nineteen miles in the county; the "Junction" ten;
            the "Bee Line" nearly seven; and the I., B. and W. will have twenty miles when
            completed.
          We have four papers now published in the county; all in Greenfield. Three political
            news and miscellaneous weeklies, and one educational monthly.
          Our people are generally industrious, moral, thrifty, and intelligent. There is less
            illiteracy in the county than in the average counties of the state. According to the
            official returns, there were, for the year 1880, but two persons between ten and
            twenty-one years of age in the county unable to read and write; while in Madison, on the
            north, there were fifty, in Hamilton there were thirty-nine, and in the state there were
            two thousand and forty-seven,  which number divided by
            ninety-two, the number of counties, shows Hancock, on that basis, to be above an average
            county. The people are naturally very conservative; and it may be recorded as a
            historical fact that Hancock county once bitterly opposed the establishment of free
            schools, as shown by the official vote, when the question was submitted to the
            ballot-box. Though our voting population was then comparatively small, the county stood
            four hundred strong against the proposed establishment of free schools, and one township
            is said to have cast but two votes in favor of the same. But to-day she is not inferior
            to adjoining counties in the support of "free schools, the hope of our country;" and the
            individual that would publicly advocate their abolition would be considered, if not non compos mentis, at least a relic of the dark ages.
          Hancock county is the home, and has been the residence, of several prominent
            men—politicians, poets, and educators. Milton B. Hopkins, late state
            superintendent of public instruction, and A. C. Shortridge, formerly superintendent of
            the Indianapolis schools, and for a time president of Purdue University, were once
            citizens of the county. This is the home of Judge David S. Gooding, a personal sketch of
            whom is given elsewhere, and of the poets James A. Riley and Lee O. Harris, who have
            more than a state reputation.
          The county is democratic by about four hundred and sixty majority.
          The churches principally represented are the Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
            Christian, Friends, Catholic, and Dunkard. The Methodists are found all over the county;
            the Friends are principally in Blue-river township; the Presbyterians in Center
            township; and the Catholics in Center, Sugar-creek and Vernon townships.
          Hancock county is not behind her sister counties in loyalty and patriotism; but has
            ever been prompt and liberal in response to the country's call. In the war with Mexico
            she furnished a full company, organized by Captain James R. Bracken, and called into the
            service of the  United States by the President, under the
            act of Congress approved May 13, 1846, at Madison, Indiana, the place of general
            rendezvous, on the 8th day of October, 1847. In the war of the Rebellion she furnished,
            in response to the various calls of the President, nearly twelve hundred brave boys in
            blue, many of whom bled and died for their country's good.

          In the foregoing we have endeavored to take a brief general view of the county as to
            history, resources, and other matters of interest, which is intended to give the reader
            some idea of the territory to be surveyed before entering upon the work proper. This
            closes the first chapter, after which we will engage in more specific definite work, and
            will take up each of the townships in order, and speak of them separately; and will, in
            the course of the work, give a full detailed account of the several points mentioned
            herein.
        
        
        
          BLUE-RIVER TOWNSHIP. CHAPTER II.
          
            MAP OF BLUE-RIVER TOWNSHIP.
            SHOWING THE SECTIONS, TOWNSHIP, AND RANGES OF WHICH IT IS CONSTITUTED.
          
          THIS township takes its name from Blue River, the principal mill
            stream in the township. It was organized  The principal
            streams are Blue River, Six Mile Creek and Nameless Creek. Blue River cuts off the
            south-east corner of the township, running through four sections, and receives from the
            north, in section twenty-nine, the waters of Six Mile Creek, and in section thirty the
            waters of Nameless Creek. Six Mile Creek is found in four sections of the south-eastern
            part of the county, and Nameless Creek in five sections of the central portion, entering
            the central northern part and emptying in the central southern part. These were once all
            mill streams.
          The first mill in the county was a small log structure on Blue River, erected by Joshua
            Wilson in 1824. It was situated above the old Wolf's mill, now Bacon's mill. The latter
            is the only water-mill now in the township.
          Nameless Creek and Six Mile Creek both had at one time small sash saw-mills and corn
            crackers, all of which have long since been superseded by the modern inventions and
            improvements.
          Jesse Hunt used to run a small saw and grist-mill on Six Mile Creek, near where the
            Kysers now live. The writer from 1850 to 1855 spent many a day at this mill while his
            grist of corn was being ground, and there saw the first sawing by water-power of his
            life.
          
          John Hunnicutt run a small saw-mill on Nameless Creek for a number of years, on what is
            now the William Brooks farm. There was also another small mill further up the creek,
            near Westland Post-Office.
          Blue-river was settled at least ten years before the organization of the county.
          In 1818 Andrew Evans built the first log cabin in the township.
          In 1822 Thomas Philips had a blacksmith shop on Blue River.
          In 1823 there was built the first school-house in the township, or county, and Lewis
            Tyner was the first male teacher.
          Elijah Tyner, in 1824, erected the first store of the township, as well as of the
            county; and he continued to do business at the same place until his death, in 1872. The
            Writer's first pair of boots came from this store. Tyner was not only a merchant, but an
            extensive farmer, stock raiser, and stock dealer. For a great many years he bought and
            drove nearly all the stock raised and sold in that part of the county, and even in the
            adjoining portion of Shelby county. Tyner is also entitled to the credit of setting out
            the first orchard in the county. He brought the trees with him from the east.
          The first fence in the county was built in this township. The builder was a man by the
            name of McCall. It was a brush fence, made of the branches of the trees which McCall had
            climbed and trimmed. McCall had previously cleared a little spot by hitching his
            faithful "Buck" and "Bright " to the grubs and "pulling them out by the roots."
          Among the first settlers of this township were Andrew Evans, John Montgomery,
            Montgomery McCall, Harmon Warrum, Elijah and Solomon Tyner, John Osborn, Joshua Wilson,
            George Penwell, the Johnses, Adamses, James and Benajah Binford, Joseph Andrews, John
            Brown, David Dodge, David Smith, and others, with their families, were  among the more prominent pioneers of this section. The
            Binfords came in 1826.
          The township in its native state presented some fine scenery; especially in the rich
            bottom lands. The primitive trees were grand and stately, and some of them of enormous
            size. There is an oak now to be seen on the farm of Penn Binford that measured nine feet
            in diameter and about seventy feet to the first limb. It fell about the year 1852. It is
            said, by those who saw it, to have been large enough before the falling off of the bark
            to have made it possible to have driven an ordinary two-horse wagon and team from the
            butt to the first limb. The red-bud skirting the streams in early spring presented a
            bright picture among the green and luxuriant foliage. Pea vines spice-brush,
            grape-vines, and nettles, were common everywhere.
          The surface in the vicinity of the streams is somewhat hilly and undulating, while on
            the uplands it is moderately level to gently rolling. The only portion that may be
            considered strictly level, is in the north-west corner. It is the dryest township in the
            county. It consists of first and second-rate land, and is well improved and under good
            cultivation. Within its limits are many prosperous farmers, with fine residences, large
            barns, and good fences.
          Its educational and church advantages are not surpassed in the county.
          Its public schools, it having none other at present, are nine in number, arranged in
            three tiers of three each, and numbered regularly from one to nine, similar to the
            numbering of the sections in a congressional township, No. 1 being located in the
            north-east corner and No. 9 in the south-west corner. The teachers, for the present, are
            as follows: District No. 1, Pleasantview, W. B. Hill; District No. 2, Temperance Hall,
            W. E. Scott; District No. 3, Jessups, James K. Allen; District No. 4, Hopewell, Bertha
            Scott; District No. 5, Westland, Jethro Dennis; District No. 6, Hardy's Fork, Mattie
            Coffield; District No. 7, Handy's, John M. Winslow; Distric No. 8, Gates' Harvey New;
            District No. 9, Shiloh, Fanny Davis.
          
          The churches are six in number, named and located as follows, to-wit: Shiloh, Baptist,
            located in the south-west corner of the township, near Elijah Tyner's old place; Mt.
            Olivet, Christian Union, in the central portion, near the Newby farm; Gilboa, M. E.
            church, in the northern central portion; Westland, Friends, in the central portion, near
            Westland school-house, the voting precinct; Pleasantview, Friends, in the northeastern
            part of the township, adjoining Samuel B. Hill's farm; Western Grove, Friends, in the
            central western portion, on the pike near Mahlon Beeson's farm.
          The present mills and factories of the township are as follows: Bacon's Flouring Mill,
            water-power, previously located; Wiley's Saw-Mill, steam-power, in the western central
            portion; Marsh's Tile Factory, one mile west of Westland P. O.; Luse's Tile Factory, in
            the central northern portion.
          The roads in Blue-river, like other parts of the county, were once mere paths "blazed
            out" through the thick timber and underbrush, which presents quite a contrast to its
            present graded and graveled highways. The township now has eight and one-half miles of
            toll pike in addition to her public unassessed roads, many of which are nearly, or
            quite, equal to the revenue roads.
          The township has no railroad within its borders, but has five miles of the P., C. and
            St. L., the old "Indiana Central," on its north line.
          The entire population, white and black, in 1880 was 1,258. The polls in 1881 were 217,
            and the scholastic population 350.
          The number of acres assessed in the township for 1881 were 18,755, valued at $456,290.
            The improvements on the same were valued at $63,840. The total value of the personal
            property was put at $168,455. The total valuation of property, real and personal, was
            $688,585. The full amount of taxes due from the township for the current year is
            $6,540.47.
          Among the more prominent men of the township at  present,
            especially in a financial point of view, are the following, each of whom will pay taxes
            to the amount of $40 and, upwards for the year 1881, to be paid in 1882:

          At the present time the township has but one justice,—Elijah Tyner,—and he
            is not likely to become wealthy from the profits of the office, notwithstanding that he
            is much of a gentleman; but he is living in a quiet community of peaceable people, who
            patronize the courts only in case of necessity, and hence are seldom engaged in petty
            lawsuits and acrimonious legal contests.
          The township has one located physician, in the person of Dr. Oliver Andrews,
            allopathist, and son of Joseph Andrews, deceased, one of the pioneers. Much of the
            practice of the township is divided up between the physicians of the surrounding
            towns—Greenfield, Carthage, Morristown, Charlottesville, and Cleveland. Among the
            physicians who practiced in the township thirty and forty years ago, were: Drs. Lot
            Edwards, B. F. Duncan, R. E. Barnett, N. P. Howard, of Greenfield; John Clark, Patterson
            and Stratton, of Carthage; Whiteside and Riddle, of Knightstown; Wolf, of Morristown,
            and Edmundson, of Blue-river. The latter was a one-armed man, located on the Joseph
            Binford farm, where he also kept a small store. A few years later Dr. Newby held forth
            at Moore's shop, in the eastern part of the township.
          B. P. Butler is the post-master, and Thomas E. Hill trustee.
          Samuel Heavenridge built the first store, at Westland, in about the year 1852. It was a
            small log structure. He sold to Levi Reece; Reece to Ambrose Miller and Henry Newby;
            Miller & Newby to Calvary G. Sample, who run the store for a few years, and then
            sold out at public auction about the beginning of the civil war. There was no store in
            the place then until Wm. New opened up. New sold to Lemuel Harold and Levi Cloud; Cloud
            sold his interest back to Harold, who afterward formed a partnership with James L.
            Binford; Binford sold back to Harold, and Harold to Binford Brothers, who were burned
            out on the 13th of April, 1881, since which time there has been no store in the place.
            Joel Pusey erected a building in the eastern part of the township in about the  year 1855, in which he run a store for a number of
            years.
          In politics, Blue-river is republican by about seventy-five majority, being the only
            strictly republican township in the county.
          The magistrates of the township from its organization to date, as near as we are able
            to ascertain, were as follows:

          The chief exports of the township are corn, wheat, hogs, cattle, horses, apples,
            potatoes, and flaxseed.
          The value, in the judgment of the writer, of the nine frame school-houses in this
            township is $4,500; value of apparatus, $400; total value of school property,
            $4,900.
          At the presidential election for 1880, the township was republican by sixty-eight
            majority, the vote standing as follows: Republican vote, 175; Democratic vote, 107;
            Greenback vote, 18; total vote, 300. Blue-river in 1836 cast 32 votes; in 1840, 38; in
            1860, 212.
          The population of the township for 185o was 936; for 1860, 1,060; for 1870, 1,125; for
            1880, 1,258.
        
        
          CHAPTER III.
          
            MOUNT OLIVET CHURCH.
            The Christian church of Blue-river township, now known as Mt. Olivet, was organized
              in the year 1838, by  old Father Hubbard, in what was
              then known as the Allen School-House, in district No. 3. Among its early preachers
              were Elders Hubbard, Epplesizer and Jonathan Lineback. Its early members were Jonathan
              and Polly Lineback, Absalom Davis and wife, Eli and Anna Risley, John and Catharine
              New, and Miss Lizzie Miller. The same church was reorganized in the year 1862, by
              Elder W. A. Gross, at what is now called the Temperance Hall School-House, in district
              No. 2, with a few members, prominent of whom were Jonathan Lineback and wife, Nathan
              Newby and wife, and Abraham Lineback and wife. The membership at that time was about
              fifty-six. The present building was erected in 1871, at a cost of $1,000. It was
              dedicated in June, 1871, by Elder Homer. A. H. Allison built the church, and was the
              first preacher, followed by Elders John Burket, Davenport, and Peter Baker. Some of
              the present members are: Miles S. Cook and wife, Walter S. Luse, John Hackleman, Polly
              Lineback, and others, about forty in number. Preaching, usually, once a month.
          
          
            WALTER S. LUSE'S TILE FACTORY
            was erected in 1879, at a cost of $2,000, being the second in the township. It
              manufactures about 1,500 rods of tile per annum. Has been in operation eleven years.
              Total amount manufactured, 16,500.
          
          
            LEWIS G. RULE'S SAW-MILL,
            in Blue-rive township, was built in 1879, at a cost of $1,500. Capacity, 3,500 feet
              per day. It furnishes work for six hands, and ships lumber to Indianapolis, Buffalo
              and Cleveland. The mill is in the northern part of the township, a little south of the
              National road.
          
          
            ELIJAH TYNER.
            The subject of this sketch was born in Abbeville District, South Carolina, in 1797.
              He was the second son of the Rev. William Tyner, a Baptist minister, who removed  from South Carolina to Kentucky in the year 1802, and from
              thence to Indiana in 1805, near Brookville; thence to Decatur county. At the age of
              twenty-one Mr. Tyner was married to Martha McCure, of Franklin county. In 1820 he came
              to Hancock county, or the territory now comprising the county, which the reader will
              remember was not organized till eight years afterward; and even Madison, from which
              Hancock was struck off in 1828, was not organized till 1823. In 1821, September 19, he
              entered eighty acres of land in Blue-river township, being the third entry made in the
              county. The first entry was made August 10, 1821, by Harmon Warrum, and the second
              August 23, by James Tyner. In 1822 Mr. Tyner married Mary Nelson, who died in 1830. In
              1832 he was again married, this time to Sarah Ann Hollerston. Mr. Tyner was one of the
              staunch pioneers, coming into the county within two years from the first settlement
              made by the "pale-face." As a merchant, he was honest and accommodating, and thereby
              gained the esteem of all who knew him. Elsewhere we have shown that he was not only a
              pioneer merchant, stock-trader and farmer, but he was the first in the county to give
              any attention to horticulture, having set out an orchard in the year 1822, according
              to the best information now at hand. Mr. Tyner also acted as a kind of common carrier
              between the early settlers and the market. As a father, he was kind-hearted and
              gentle. He raised a large family, and provided well for them. As a neighbor, he was
              highly respected on account of his many amiable qualities. In politics, he was a whig
              and republican, but liberal in his views. He was a Baptist in faith, but by no means a
              bigot. He liberally supported the church, and every good cause found in him a friend
              and substantial encouragement. His remains lie buried in Shiloh cemetery, near his
              home, where loving hands have erected a stately monument to mark his last resting
              place.
          
          
            ADAM ALLEN'S PIONEER LIFE.
            Adam Allen, with his family, came to Blue-river township,  Hancock county, Indiana, in December, 1827. He moved into a small log cabin covered
              with clapboards; half of the floor was of rough slabs; the front and other half was
              simply the earth made smooth and pounded firm. The fire-place and chimney were very
              rude, made of rock, mud and sticks. It would admit a back log of six or seven feet in
              length. The loft was made of rough boards.
            There was not then a public road in the township; only a path "blazed" through the
              woods to a distant neighbor's cabin. He had but one neighbor within less than a mile,
              and that was James Wilson, who had settled two years before on the farm now occupied
              by Augustus Dennis.
            About 1830, while a man moving into the township was crossing the small stream that
              flows south, asked the name of the creek. Being told that it had none, he said: "It is
              a 'nameless creek;'" which name it still retains.
            When the Allens came, almost the whole surface of the earth was covered with
              undergrowth, which consisted of spice brush, pea vines, and coarse grass. Cattle and
              horses subsisted on it nearly the whole year. Hogs fattened on the mast almost
              entirely, and were penned only for a few days before killing time, and then that they
              might be fed a little corn to harden the lard. There was an abundance of wild
              gooseberries, plums and ginseng. "The latter I have often gathered," says Thompson
              Allen, his son, "and dried for market, which sold at about twenty-five cents per
              pound." There were wolves, wild cats, turkeys, and white and black squirrels in great
              numbers; and in the summer and fall, when the corn was ripening, the daily employment
              of the boys was to scare the squirrels away from the corn field.
            Mr. Allen's plow was of the old wooden mold-board kind. He cut his wheat with a
              sickle, and either carried or hauled it on a sled; then threshed it out with a flail
              on a dirt floor. If the wind was blowing, he would clean it by standing and slowly
              pouring the wheat to the ground in a small stream, letting the wind blow the chaff
              away.  If there was no wind, then two persons with a
              sheet would fan while a third poured the wheat.
            For several years he had no cook stove; all the cooking was done by the fire. The
              johnny-cake board was as common then as a tea-kettle is now.
            They had no apples, peaches, or tame fruits, but substituted pumpkins, and, of
              course, were very familiar with pumpkin pies. Dried pumpkins were laid up in the fall,
              which served for dessert when they had company or on Sunday mornings for breakfast. On
              one occasion Mr. Allen went out to a mill on Flat Rock, and on his return brought home
              with him about half a bushel of apples, the first ever seen by the children. The
              mother gave each of them an apple, and put the rest away in the loft, telling them
              that, as she now had some flour, they must not touch the apples, and she would make
              some pies. That night Thompson Allen woke up, and hearing the boards rattle, looked in
              the direction of the apples, and presently saw something white descending, which
              proved to be one of his brothers, who could not refrain from the unfrequent temptation
              of satisfying a keen appetite superinduced by that one apple.
            The first school-house in the north part of the township was built on the southern
              part of Noble Warrum's farm, in section six, township fifteen. It was made of logs,
              and had five corners. It was not chinked and daubed; had no windows and but one door.
              A man by the name of Sanford taught the first school therein. The second school was
              taught by Mr. McPherson. One day a boy had done something contrary to the "rules," and
              the teacher, to punish him, made him go outdoors and climb up in a dogwood sapling; he
              then detailed another boy to stand at the foot of the bush and keep him up there.
            "In 1844," says Thompson Allen, "I commenced teaching school. The price then was
              about thirty dollars per term of sixty-five days, about ten dollars of it being public
              money. The law required teachers to have certificates; but the examinations were not
              very rigid. Once  I went to Greenfield to get license. I
              told the examiner what I wanted. He said: 'How long will you be in town? Call before
              you go home, and I will have them ready. I am busy now.' I called, gave him fifty
              cents, his fee, and received my license, without being asked a single question.
            The first man that preached in the northern part of the township was Father McClain,
              the father-in-law of Wesley Williams, of Jackson township.
            Adam Allen was a strong, robust, honest and honorable man—a good representive
              of the majority of the early settlers of the country.
            [We are indebted to Thompson Allen, Esquire, and James K. Allen, teacher, son and
              grandson of the above, for most of the foregoing facts.]
          
          
            HISTORY
              OF SHILOH CHURCH.
            On the fifth Saturday in May, 1841, a number of Baptists met at the house of Richard
              Hackleman, in the south-western part of the township, to consider the propriety of
              organizing a church. After some consultation, they agreed to call a council of
              brethren, to meet at the house of Solomon Tyner on the fourth Saturday of the next
              month. At this council there were thirteen persons present, and they organized by
              choosing Elder McQuary as moderator and J. T. Price as clerk. After some deliberation
              the council proceeded to adopt a constitution. The names of the constituent members
              were as follows, to-wit: Solomon Tyner, John H. Caldwell, John M. Duncan, Jemima
              Tyner, Nancy Duncan, Caroline Randall, and Rosanna Caldwell; being seven members in
              all, which was increased to fifteen at their next meeting. Elder McQuary was their
              first pastor. He was one of Indiana's pioneers; a man of unusual energy and piety, and
              his preaching was considered powerful and impressive. His hallowed influence still
              survives in the hearts of many of the brethren.
            
            The following are the pastors in order, and the time each served:
            
              From 1841 to 1852, Elder McQuary.
              From 1852 to 1853, Elder Wm. Baker.
              From 1853 to 1854, Elder Elias Boston.
              From 1854 to 1857, Elder Wilson Thompson.
              From 1857 to 1864, Elder J. G. Jackson.
              From 1864 to 1868, Elders J. S. Weaver and D. Caudel.
              From 1868 to 1872, Elders G. S. Weaver and A. B. May.
              From 1872 to 1876, Elders A. B. May and Harvey Wright.
              From 1876 to 1879, Elders Harvey Wright and D. Caudel.
              From 1879 to 1881, Elders D. Caudel and J. F. Weaver.
            
            The church continued to hold her meetings from house to house until the year 1854;
              she then erected a frame building, 30x40 feet, at a cost of $800. The house is on the
              pike, just north of Tyner's old store, on the south-east corner of section 26,
              township fifteen north, range seven-east. This house is still her place of
              worship.
            Shiloh first asked admission, and was received, into the Lebanon Association; but
              afterward withdrew, and, for convenience, joined the White Water Association. It would
              be well to state here that Baptist churches are not under the control of a superior
              organization, but each church is independent. The association is merely an annual
              meeting for mutual correspondence. One session of the Lebanon Association and three
              sessions of the White Water Association have been held with this church. It was here
              that the Lebanon Association was held in August, 1846, at which time the great
              question of "Means and anti-Means" was discussed. Some churches had already divided,
              each party sending messengers, whose seats were contested. It was an exciting time,
              and party spirit ran high. Those of the means party claimed that "God quickens,
              regenerates and makes alive dead sinners by his spirit through the written and
              preached word. That God has proposed salvation in the Gospel to the world of mankind.
              That Jesus did not die as man, but as God." The anti-means party claimed that "God
              quickens  the sinner by the power of his spirit without
              the aid or instrumentality of human power. That the written and preached word is for
              the instruction and comfort of God's people after they have been quickened by his
              power. That God has not proposed salvation to any one, but has secured the salvation
              of all saints by the blood of Christ; and that repentance and remission of sins is a
              gift of God, and not the act of the creature by the free volition of his will." They
              also held that "Christ died as man and not as God." Other points were discussed, but
              the foregoing are the main ones.
            This church is anti-means, and though at present numbering but thirty members, it is
              at peace with mankind, and enjoying a reasonable degree of prosperity.
            [We are indebted to W. N. Tharp, a teacher and the church clerk, for most of the

            was born October 10, 1787, in Prince George county, N. C., and came to Hancock county
              in 1826, and was one of the first settlers of Blue-river township. He was married to
              Mary Ladd in 1817, by whom he had five children, viz.: Robert, Ann, Joseph, Benjamin,
              and William L. Mr. B. was married a second time to Jane Binford, to whom were born
              one, child. In politics, Mr. B. was a staunch whig; and, notwithstanding his father
              had owned and worked slaves, he was bitterly opposed to the accursed traffic, and
              never hesitated to denounce it in the strongest terms consistent with his Christian
              profession. When in health he was regular in attendance at the place of worship with
              the Society of Friends, the church of his choice, twice or more per week.
            Mr. B. was a very plain-spoken man, yet kind-hearted, and ever ready to help the
              worthy poor. He was also very conscientious, and although he loaned a great deal of
              money for his time, he was never known to accept more than six per cent. interest, nor
              usury in any form. By industry, strict economy, and the avoidance of all vicious  and luxurious habits, he succeeded in amassing a neat
              fortune, and was thereby enabled to do much for charitable purposes, and to give each
              of his five children a quarter of a section of good land, and as much more in ready
              cash. He died August 19, 1863, aged seventy-five years, eleven months and eighteen
              days, and was buried according to the simple custom of the Friends at the Walnut Ridge
              burying-grounds, in Rush county, Indiana. His first wife died in 1822, and was buried
              in North Carolina, and his second December 14, 1867, at the age of seventy-nine years
              and nine months, and was buried beside her husband.
          
          
            ELIHU COFFIN, SEN.
            The subject of this sketch is a native of Clinton county, Ohio. Date of nativity,
              March 31, 1807. He was principally raised in North Carolina; came to Milton, Indiana,
              in 1828 and remained till 1831, when he came to Hancock county, and shared with the
              few settlers the privations and hardships of frontier life. The roads were to make,
              the forests were to clear, the wild animals to exterminate, and the physical man to
              provide with food, clothing and shelter. The first winter Mr. Coffin was in the county
              he, in common with many others, did without bread for weeks at a time, owing to the
              mills being frozen up so that they could not grind, there being no steam mills in
              those days. They lived on potatoes, pumpkins, and wild game.
            Mr. Coffin has traveled quite a good deal, has a retentive memory, and takes great
              pleasure in telling of the sights. From 1850 to 1852 he lived in Iowa; thence he
              wended his way across the plains to the gold regions of California, where, for two
              years, he had an experience brighter in imagination than in reality. From California
              Mr. C. returned to Iowa, by way of Panama, New York and Chicago. But still not
              contented with any point yet visited between the Atlantic and Pacific, save on the
              fertile, salubrious soil of old Hancock, he determined to retrace his steps, and
              accordingly, in 1865, permanently  located in Blue-river
              township; where, with the wife of his bosom and the companion of his travels, he is
              enjoying a peaceful old age; and would, doubtless, take pleasure in telling the reader
              a hundred fold more than we have recorded.
            Mr. C. is a square-built, muscular man, a good Mason, a republican, and an orthodox
              Friend.
          
          
            PERSONAL SKETCH OF AUGUSTUS DENNIS.
            Mr. Dennis was born in Virginia in June, 1827; came to Hancock county in 1844; was
              married to. Miss Jemima C. Tyner in October, 1847. Mr. D. was bred on a farm, and has
              given that branch of industry his whole attention. He came to the county a poor boy,
              with only twelve and one-half cents in his pocket, and worked at eight dollars per
              month. He now has a good farm in fine state of cultivation.
            Mr. D. is an uncompromising democrat, yet he accords to others what he asks for
              himself—liberty to think and act for himself. He has ever since early manhood
              been identified with some religious society, connecting himself first with the
              Methodists, and later becoming a member of the Friends Society, as it best suited his
              opinions and convenience, without the sacrifice of any vital principle taught by the
              church of his first choice.
            Mr. D. was elected county commissioner for the first commissioner's district in 1878
              over Elisha Earles, a worthy opponent, by 3,000 majority.
            He has always taken a decided stand on the side of temperance, both by example and
              precept, and even hesitated to qualify as commissioner, owing to the relation of the
              office with the licensing of the traffic.
          
          
            SKETCH OF THE PIONEER LIFE OF HARMON WARRUM.
            (Furnished by his son, Honorable Noble Warrum.)
            Harmon Warrum was a Kentuckian by birth, the son of an Englishman who went to
              Kentucky from Pennsylvania  in an early day, and who was
              recognized as an expert with the rifle, and also a proficient backwoodsman, being
              constantly employed as scout and trailer. He died when the subject of the above sketch
              was quite a child, leaving him in the care of an uncle, whose name was Thomas Consley,
              on whom fell the duty of educating him for the stern realities of frontier life which
              he was destined to experience. After arriving at majority, he became a rather cool,
              self-possessed man, endowed with great courage and physical ability. He was quick to
              resent a wrong and never forgot a kindness. He was an active, strong man, having
              fought, wrestled and run with both whites and reds, but never vanquished.
            He came to Indiana about the year 1807, and in 1809 or 1810 married a young lady of
              English descent, who had lately emigrated from Georgia. Her name was Edith Butler. I
              was born in 1819, and when about four years of age my father moved to Hancock county
              (then a part of Madison), and settled on Blue River, in the southern part of the
              county, and took a title for the land now owned and occupied by Dayton H. Gates, Esq.
              This was the first piece of land entered in the county; he alse entered the last piece
              situated on Swamp Creek—the first on August 10, 1821, and the last on January
              16, 1854.
            When he first came to Blue-river it was a dense wilderness for miles and miles; no
              sound save the rustling of the leaves, the moaning of the wind, and the angry voice of
              the storm cloud; no music broke the calm stillness of the summer air save the buzzing
              of mosquitoes, the howling of the ravenous wolves, or the fierce yell of the prowling
              panther; no noisy hum of laboring factories; no clanking hammers in dusty shops. No,
              the great work-house of nature, covered with the blue canopy of heaven, walled in only
              by the horizon, and lit up by nature's lamps, sufficed. Then we heard no ringing of
              Sabbath church bells; no locomotive whistle. Had a train of cars passed through the
              country at that time, the pioneers would have declared it haunted.
            
            Our nearest neighbors, about seven or eight miles distant, living on Brandywine, were
              the families of Roberts, Montgomery and Stephenson; but after awhile here came the
              Tyners and Johnses; also, Penwells, Watts and Wilsons to our immediate neighborhood.
              But neighbors living then at a distance of eight or ten miles apart were more
              neighborly than those of to-day in adjoining lots. Well, as neighbors kept coming,
              cabins were being put up in every direction. Everything in a bustle, and all at work
              that could work. The pioneer cabin was cheaply made and easily constructed. Ours was
              built of round logs, notched to lay closely together; the roof was of four-foot
              clapboards, weighed down by poles laid across each course of boards; then there was
              what was termed the "eaves bearer," a log laying parallel with the ends of the cabin,
              and projecting about eighteen inches over the wall; a good splitting stick was
              selected, split through the center, placed on the ends of the "eaves bearer," and
              notched for the roof boards to butt against; this was called the "butting pole"; a
              door-way was sawed out, and the logs were used as steps; then a window was cut, a single opening; we called it a window because it was the largest hole in the cabin to let in the light; it was made by placing sticks
              across as a frame-work, on which a piece of greased newspaper was placed; through this
              the light shone like dim moonshine through the room; the chimney was built of sticks
              and mud, and was called "cat and clay chimney." While this rude hut was being
              constructed by father, mother, a hired hand from a distance, and my oldest sister, the
              family were living, with all of their household goods, in a hollow
                sycamore tree.
            After moving into our new house, we furnished it with a couple of one-legged
              bedsteads, produced by father's own hands; and he not being a professional mechanic,
              they were, consequently, not so stylish as those from the factories of to-day. But I
              rested just as easy on them as many do to-day on their seventy-five dollar
              bedsteads.
            Then the doors were of puncheons pinned together.  Such
              a thing as a nail was not to be had. The hinges were of wood, and the door-latch, a
              wooden catch, or trigger, which, when shut, was opened from the outside by pulling a
              string, one end of which was fastened to the latch, and the other, passing through a
              hole in the door above, hung outside, so that those who wished could enter. To lock
              the door, you would pull the string inside. Hence the stereotyped expression, "the
              latch-string hangs out."
            Half the floor, which was made of puncheons lying loosely across the sleepers, was
              not finished for about a year after we moved into our cabin home. The hired man soon
              left, declaring that he would stay no longer where the air was black with gnats and
              mosquitoes. Said he: "If they were the size of me, I would fight them; but they are
              just a little too small and too many to keep company with." I have seen the air
              darkened by flies, gnats, and mosquitoes, a number of them weighing over a pound: but
              I can't say that it would take a small number.
            The winters passed on slowly, but we had always an excellent supply of venison on
              hand. Being an excellent marksman, father's table groaned under the abundant supply of
              turkies and deer; but it was an impossibility to procure salt with which to preserve
              the venison. It was then necessarily taken through a process called "jerking." This
              operation was performed by cutting the fleshy parts of the body of the deer,
              cross-grained, into thin slices, which were duly placed on splits and hung inside of
              our "cat and clay chimney" and garret to dry, after which process it would keep from
              months to years. When in very great need of salt, father would make his way back to
              Wayne county in quest of that rare article. I remember on one occasion, after his
              journey of riding one horse and leading the other, on whose back the salt was
              strapped, that when we had removed the bag of salt, we removed the hair also, for the
              brine caused by the melting of the salt had lain bare the sides of the horse.
            The first mill of the neighborhood was at Fall Creek Falls, afterwards called Fall
              Creek Mills. The distance  being about twenty-five miles,
              father imagined it quite convenient for milling. And as he was a skillful
              backwoodsman, and had some knowledge of the route and locality, it was agreed that he
              should take his yoke of oxen and the fore wheels of his wagon, and with a "turn of
              corn" for himself and each of his neighbors, cut his may through to Fall Creek Mills.
              Preparing himself with ammunition and his gun, followed by his trusty dog, he "blazed"
              his way through the thick forest. And after receiving his grinding, he started upon
              his homeward journey; at night, "coralling" his oxen and making his bed under his
              cart, he made his dog lie at his feet as a protection from the wolves. One night the
              wolves approached where he was laying, and the poor dog kept crawling higher and
              higher until he lay on father's face. He awoke and frightened the wolves away. When he
              returned home, after being absent four or five days, he was sure to bring in some four
              or five pairs of venison hams, the same number of deer skins, three or four wild cats,
              and about a dozen raccoon skins. Those deer skins were very useful, as I was clothed
              almost entirely in buckskin, dressed by my father's hand and cut and sewed with whang,
              or thongs, by the hand of my mother. Father always kept on hand from six to a dozen
              dressed deer skins. And when my mother would treat me to a new pair of buckskin
              breeches, I felt very proud, and would hang on to my old ones as long as possible to
              save my new ones for Sunday. Occasionally I was presented with a buckskin
              hunting-shirt, a loose at the bottom and tight at the top arrangement similar to a
              sack coat, having a cape which hung over the shoulders, fringed all around by
              splitting the cape into threads for some two or three inches from the edges, similar
              to the fly-nets we cover horses with to-day. I have attended dances where all of the
              young men were incased in their buck-skin suits. Then the girls were neatly attired in
              plain dress. Little did they care for outside show. They lived for something higher
              than an earthly fancy. They looked not after the fashions of the day. They had pride,
              it is  true, but wisdom too. Their pride was for their
              home and country, and they labored for its upbuilding. They were good for the sake of
              goodness, and truer, better wives were never known. And in a few years they became
              very attractive to me, especially the younger ones. It seems that it did not take as
              much to beautify them then as now. I thought them the most beautiful of God's
              creation. None of those humps and tucks and frills, nor ribbon and lace and birds
              tails placed on top of their heads.
            Prayer-meetings were organized, to which ladies would walk a distance often of from
              four to five miles; but the meetings were held almost always in the day-time. On one
              occasion it was announced that the Rev. James Havens (father of George) would preach
              at the widow Smith's cabin, on a certain night. Night meetings being few, I attended,
              as much through curiosity as anything else, it being a rare thing to hear preaching;
              it was always exhorting. Some time during service the dogs got to fighting at the
              door, causing considerable confusion, which soon subsided; then the Rev. Havens took
              time to remark that the devil and the dogs always attended night meetings.
            Almost every pioneer who attended church on the Sabbath, came with gun on his
              shoulder; and if a deer or wolf crossed his track, and a favorable opportunity
              presented, he killed it. They were wide-awake and always on the lookout. And thus they
              were supplied with provisions. Father once killed three deers without, probably,
              moving from his tracks. The way of it was this: Father was out on a hunting
              expedition, walking through the forest, gun on shoulder, and I was riding a little
              distance behind, when we suddenly came upon three good-sized deer—one was an old
              one, while the others were apparently yearlings—grazing peacefully along, until
              the well-known crack of my father's rifle laid the old one low; the fawns stood
              watching their mater in the agonies of death until father, twice
              reloading, placed a veil between them and the painful sight—one falling dead on
              the spot, the other running some fifty yards before falling. I was, on  that occasion, on horseback, a very common thing, for the
              purpose of carrying in the game; frequently coming loaded with a dozen turkies.
              Usually in cool weather we tore out the entrails from the deer, and placing the end of
              a pole in the body would run it up a tree, thus preventing the wolves from making a
              meal of it; and, if there was snow on the ground, we visited them soon, and, lashing
              them together with withes, hitched them to a horse and dragged them home on the snow.
              If there was no snow, we took them the best way possible.
            Often a bear would lurk forth and attack some lonely pioneer's hog-pen, or
              poultry-house, or sheep-fold. Father kept his sheep in a pen a little in the rear of
              the house. This was to be able to protect them from the wolves, whose growls and
              snarls were heard many times at the fold. As a surer way of protecting the sheep,
              father went to Wayne county and procured two savage curs. They could drive away or
              whip any wolf, but were never able to hold them until assistance arrived. From
              constant running, dogs were taken with a disease called the "slows." Father thought a
              great deal of his dogs, but lost them. One was bitten by a rattlesnake and died. It
              was no uncommon thing to kill from twenty to twenty-five black rattlesnakes in a
              day.
            On one occasion my father returned from Shelby (there was no Shelbyville then, there
              being only a small blacksmith shop where it now stands), followed to the house by a
              pack of wolves.
            Soon after Mr. Penwell settled in our vicinity. He came to father's house one morning
              and solicited his assistance, telling him that a large bear had attacked his hogs,
              killing one and devouring it within a stone's-throw of the house. They got father's
              bear dogs on the trail, and followed it as far as the Big Swamp, on Brandywine, where
              all trace of it was lost, never getting sight of it but once. Our experience in
              backwoods life was full of such incidents.
            A large eagle had built a nest, not far from our house, 
              
                Wm. R. Hough
              
              
               in a very large sycamore tree. After a great many
              trials, my father brought his trusty rifle and unerring aim to bear upon this "monarch
              of the clouds," and brought him to the ground severely wounded. He was then attacked
              by the dog, who soon drew off much the worse for the wear, having the skin ripped open
              at the back and hanging down on either side. When at last he yielded, we stretched his
              wings apart, to find that they were eleven and one-half feet from tip to tip.
            About this time there was a tanyard, the first there had been in the county,
              established a short distance south of Cleveland, by a Mr. Wood. To this we went for
              our tanned hog-skin, with which we soled our moccasins. It wore very well; but if left
              too near the fire, the soles would curl up and burst off, and were to be tacked on
              every morning; so it became necessary for us to rise quite early for that as well as
              for earning our daily bread, which was some times more than half pumpkins, meal being
              scarce; this was called pumpkin bread.
            Pumpkins being our only fruit, so to speak, we took pains to preserve them. First, we
              peeled them, hung some of them on poles, placed some of them in the garret, and some
              in the lower room, to dry. Frequently they were boiled, mashed fine, spread thin and
              smooth on a board, and dried into what was called "pumpkin leather." This was reserved
              for use when the pumpkins were gone. This was made into delicious pumpkin pies.
            
              
                The country was new and the people were few;
                But what there were, were brothers;
                They'd never eat this savory meat
                'Til they shared it with their brothers.
              
            
            The first physician in my father's house was an old doctor from near where Freeport
              now stands, an old and venerable physician by name of Dr. Tracy. The second was Dr.
              Lot Edwards, one of the first doctors in Greenfield. The settlers in those days were
              principally their  own M. D.'s, using roots and herbs
              instead of drugs and liquors. The medicinal properties of plants were learned, to a
              large extent, from straggling Indians, whom the settlers saw quite often, sometimes in
              small tribes.
            These old pioneers, when gathered together, were not quarrelling over the political
              issues of the day. They left that to those occupying the higher positions. They were
              not in the habit of gathering to listen to flighty orations, but simply sitting around
              giving their hunting narrations, encounters with bears, strugglings against want, and
              sufferings from mosquitoes. The world turned the same then as now, and turned just as
              easily, too. And I firmly believe that were our country thrown back into a wild
              condition, where nature's handiwork alone shone forth; replace these smooth, unbroken
              meadows with mighty branching oaks, towering maples and spreading beech; let deer,
              with arched necks and stately step, their haughty antlers bowed as they graze from the
              abundance of wild grass lining the little rivulet, abound; let the hoarse and angry
              growls of ever-famished wolves be heard; the rustling of the leaves and breaking of
              limbs, over which the sluggish bears are stalking; together with the life-like cry of
              unseen panthers, the howling of wild cats and the screaming of eagles, and people it
              with the same people of to-day, it would go to the dogs, and the people eventually
              starve. This arises from a different kind of education. Those pioneers were men of
              iron wills and nerves of steel. They were endowed with a knowledge of the difference
              between right and wrong. Truth and honesty beamed from every countenance. They were
              industrious as well as adventurous. Though they loved the wild and savage backwoods
              life, they were working for the promotion of civilization. They knew none but the
              school of experience. At their touch the mighty monarchs of the forest turned to dust
              and ashes. At their glance the wild beast cowered. For their children and their
              posterity they toiled and denied themselves the luxuries of civilized life. "The latch
              string always hung outside of the door," so  that the
              weary pilgrim of life might enter. You had but to ask, and you would receive. They
              toiled. They practiced self-denial. For what? For their children. For the upbuilding
              of a civilized country. Have they not achieved success? Look around you. Whence came
              these cities and towns, with their factories and shops and mills and beautiful
              buildings and churches? Whence. came these lovely farms, with their orchards of
              luscious fruits, their fields of waving corn, their ripe meadows, and gem-like lots of
              golden wheat? Had you an ear for nature's song, these would fill your ears with
              praises for those hardy pioneers, some of whom, much to the discredit of those for
              whom they toiled, are still in the field, a few of them barely keeping want from their
              doors. They lived, as God intended you and I and every one should live, by the sweat
              of the brow, determined to earn their bread before eating it. Many of them, like
              Columbus, never lived to enjoy what they achieved, but we hope are repaid by heavenly
              comfort.
          
          
            WESTERN GROVE CHURCH.
            This meeting was established in the Eleventh Month, 1864.
            The society held its meetings for ten years in a log house formerly used as a
              potter's shop, located a few rods north of the present building.
            Prominent among its first members were Elias Marsh, Isaac Beeson, John Hunt, Elihu
              Coffin and Mahlon Beeson.
            The first minister that ever preached in the house was Asenith Clark (Dr. Dugan
              Clark's mother), followed by Luther B. Gordon, Mahlon Hockett, Mary Rogers, Jane
              Jones, and several others. The present minister is Joseph O. Binford.
            The house now in use was built in the year 1874. It a handsome, substantial frame
              building, size 36x44, erected at a cost of $1,400.
            Regular meetings are held twice every week. The 
              mid-week meetings occur on Fourth Day (Wednesday). The monthly meetings alternate with
              Westland.
            The organization is in a healthy, flourishing condition. Present membership, one
              hundred and sixty-five.
            A Sabbath-school in connection with the church has been kept up the year around ever
              since its organization. Present superintendent, Thomas L. Marsh. Average attendance,
              fifty.
            The organization term themselves Friends, but are generally known as Quakers.
          
        
        
        
          BRANDYWINE TOWNSHIP. CHAPTER IV.
          
            MAP OF BRANDYWINE TOWNSHIP.
            SHOWING THE SECTIONS, TOWNSHIP, AND RANGES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED.
          
          THIS township takes its name from Brandywine, the principal stream
            in the township. It was organized in 1828, and then consisted of the entire central part
            of the county, what now constitutes the second commissioner's district, to-wit:
            Brandywine, Center and Green townships. In 1831, it was reduced in size to thirty
            sections, its present length east and west and one mile greater north  and south. This reduction was made by striking off Center
            and Harrison townships, Center then consisting of eighteen sections and Harrison of the
            remainder north. In 1835, Brandywine township was further reduced in size one tier of
            sections, six miles long on the north, which was added to Center. From 1835 to the
            present she has remained unchanged.
          It is located in the central southern part of the county, and is bounded by Center
            township on the north, Blue-river on the east, Sugar-creek on the west, and Shelby
            county on the south. In extent, it is six miles east and west and four miles north and
            south, being the smallest township in the county. It is all located in township fifteen
            north and ranges six and seven east. Two tiers of sections on the west are in range six,
            and four on the east are in range seven. The range line dividing the two fractional
            congressional townships of which Brandywine is composed, runs past J. G. Service's land,
            dividing the farm of B. F. Wilson.
          The principal streams are Brandywine and Little Sugar Creek. The former enters the
            township on the north line, one and one-half miles west of the north-east corner, and
            flows south by south-west through the township, passing out through section thirty-two
            into Shelby county. Little Sugar Creek is a small stream, which rises in the south-
            western part of Center township, enters Brandywine township on the northern line, one
            mile east of the north-west corner, and flows south four miles to within one mile of the
            southern line; thence south-west, entering Shelby county at the south-west corner of the
            township. Both of these streams are small and sluggish, and not now considered available
            for water-power; hence this township, unlike Blue-river, Sugar-creek, and others,
            intersected by larger streams, has no water-mills at present; yet, in the early history
            of the county there were two small mills on Brandywine—one in Harrison township
            and one in Brandywine.
          The first grist-mill in Brandywine township was built  by
            N. Swim in the year 1826, and located on Brandywine Creek, in the central part of the
            township. Swim afterwards attached a small saw-mill; but soon sold out to Geo. Troxwell,
            who added a tiny bolt to run by hand. Troxwell was a man of considerable enterprise. He
            carried on a hatter shop at the mill, and also built a still-house near by. The water
            some times got too low to grind, when the people patronized a small horse-power
            "coffee-mill" on the Dickerson farm, then in Brandywine, now Center, township.
          William Wilkins run a saw-mill in the south-east part of the township for several
            years.
          There is at present no flouring mill in the township. There was one at Carrollton run
            for a number of years, but recently moved away.
          In 1856, H. and J. Comstock erected a steam saw-mill in Carrollton. It was burned down
            a few years since, and was rebuilt by Wm. Gordon. It is now owned and run by James
            Boyce.
          Brandywine township was first settled in about 1820. Isaac Roberts and family came in
            1819. Prior to which there were located: David Stephenson, James Montgomery, and a Mr.
            Rambo. Soon afterward came James McKinney, Jonathan Potts, James Montgomery, N. Swim,
            George Troxwell, James Goodwin, J. H. Anderson, Robert and James Smith, Jacob and Joseph
            Zumalt, and William Lucas. Among the oldest present residents of the township are : Mrs.
            Isaac Roberts, J. P. Banks, John Roberts, William Thomas, sen., Mrs. Andis, Richard
            Milburn, Wellington Collier, and Alfred Potts.
          This township is rather level, with portions undulating. No swamps. The soil is
            good.
          The township once abounded in fine timber in great quantities, similar to that in
            adjoining townships. She has recently sold off her walnut and large quantities of the
            oak.
          Brandywine has fourteen miles of toll-pike and three 
            miles of railroad. The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Indianapolis cuts off the south-west
            corner of the township.
          The first school-teacher in the township was Abraham Vangilder.
          The first birth was Mercer Roberts, daughter of Isaac Roberts.
          The first burial in the township was Emily Roberts. The next, a child of James
            Montgomery. The latter in 1824.
          The first man married in the township was Zedric Stephens, who was married in a shed
            covered with brush. The supper consisted of spice-wood tea, corn-bread, venison and
            hominy.
          The first church house was built of logs and puncheons, by voluntary labor, in 1830, on
            the farm of James Smith. It was burned down in 1858. The first ministers were Hale,
            Horn, Vangilder, and a blind man by the name of Hays.
          Brandywine township has seven public school-houses, numbered and named as follows, and
            at present supplied with eight teachers, whose names are set opposite the respective
            numbers:

            elected in 1869, and served his township faithfully till the election of his successor.
            J. G. Service was elected in 1874, and continued till the election of the present
            trustee.
          William Wilkins, ex-county sheriff, who died in office during his second term, was from
            this township.
          William Thomas, jun., ex-sheriff, and James Tyner, ex-commissioner, are both residents
            of the township.
          It was here that Ezekial Wright, aged twenty-five, and Thomas Hughes, aged eighteen,
            were instantly killed by the falling of a tree, April 19, 1849. Mr. Wright's only
            daughter is now the wife of A. T. Brown.
          In this township William Alyea was killed by the falling of a limb, in about the year
            1860.
          
          Near Carrollton, a son of Henry Carrington was killed by the cars soon after the
            railroad first passed through the place.
          The chief exports of the township are corn, cattle, hogs, wheat, horses, and
            flaxseed.
        
        
          CHAPTER V.
          
            CARROLLTON.
            This little village is located in the south-west part of the township, on the C., H.
              and I. R. R., about seven miles south-west of Greenfield. The railroad gave the
              station at this point the name of Reedville, but the town has always borne the name
              above.
            It was laid out by Hiram Comstock, on the 25th of February, 1854, and consisted of
              twenty-five lots. The first and only addition ever made to the town was by Rev. M. S.
              Ragsdale, in 1870.
            It contains a school-house, one church, one steam sawmill, two merchants, one grain
              shipping firm, two blacksmiths, one wagon-maker, one physician, two carpenters, one
              painter, one postmaster, one shoe-maker, and one barber.

            SUGAR-CREEEK CHURCH (CHRISTIAN),
            in Brandywine township, located one and one-half miles north of Carrollton, and
              organized in the year 1831, first met at the private house of William Thomas,
              senior.
            The following were among the original members: William Thomas, sen., father of
              Ex-Sheriff Thomas; Elizabeth Thomas, Helry Thomas, John Baker, Elizabeth Baker,
              William McConnell and wife, James and Margaret Anderson, and Eleazer Snodgrass.
            The first preachers were Elders John Gregg, D. Holt, and J. P. Banks.
            The meetings were afterwards held in a log schoolhouse one mile north of
              Carrollton.
            The present house was built in the year 1869, at a cost of $2,000, and dedicated by
              O. A. Burgess. Size of house, 38x48.
            The following are the present trustees: John S. Thomas, Robert Davis, and Henry
              Fry.
            Among the more recent Elders were Arthur Miller, David Franklin, Robert Edmondson,
              and Elder Bennett. The present preacher is Elder Coffield.
            This church has a good Sunday-school, organized about 1869. Present superintendent,
              Robert Williamson. Average attendance, forty-five.
          
          
          
            EDEN CHAPEL (UNITED BRETHREN),
            was organized in the year 1840, and located one mile east of Carrollton.
            Among the first members were George Muth and family, Mrs. Higgenbottom, John Elmore
              and wife, Mrs. Hoagland, and others.
            The meetings of the society were held in George Muth's house until 1850, when a
              substantial frame house, costing $1,400, was built.
            The first ministers were George Muth, Amos Hanaway and Rev. Father Ball.
            About 1866, they sold their house to the Radical Methodists, who are still holding
              forth in the same house, with Rev. Callahan as their present minister.
            The United Brethren removed the class to Carrollton about the year 1879, and held
              their meetings in a small building formerly the old public school-house. Present
              minister, Rev. McNew.
            This church has a prosperous little Sunday-school. Willard Low, Esq., superintendent.
              There are several small Sunday-schools in the school-houses. In 1865, the Brandywine

            Officers: Frank Kinder, president; J. W. Scott, treasurer; Charles Scott,
              secretary.
          
          
          
            WILLIAM H. PORTER.
            The subject of this sketch was born May 10, 1810, near Dayton, Ohio. He came to
              Fayette county, with his parents at the age of eighteen.
            He run on the river as flat boatman for four years from Kanawha Salt Springs, W. Va.,
              to New Orleans, at fifty cents per day.
            In 1832 he came to Hancock county and entered one hundred and sixty acres of land in
              Brandywine township, where he remained till his death, in 1866.
            His remains rest in Mt. Lebanon cemetery, near his farm.
            He was a successful, prosperous farmer in his time.
            He raised three sons. J. W. and F. M. Porter are both respectable citizens and
              prosperous farmers in their native township. William H. Porter is engaged in
              butchering in Greenfield.
          
          
            MRS. ISAAC ROBERTS.
            This good lady, the mother of John Roberts, is the oldest resident citizen in
              Brandywine township, having come to the "new purchase" prior to the organization of
              the territory into Madison county and settled on the farm now owned by Marion
              Steele.
            She was married in New York just at the close of the war of 1812. Her husband was a
              faithful, valient soldier of said war. They came through on foot, carrying their
              effects, and crossed the Ohio River in an Indian canoe. They settled in the dense
              forest, making a temporary room by piling brush against a large log and covering it
              with bark until they could erect a small pole cabin.
            There was at that time no roads, and not a mill within thirty-five miles. Beat
              hominy, venison and spice-wood tea were the chief eatables.
            During the Indian troubles following the "Indian massacre" in Madison county, of
              which this later formed a part, her husband and Mr. Rambo went to Pendleton, the  county seat at that time, to attend the trial and act as
              guards. There was great uneasiness all over the country at this time, the whites not
              knowing at what time they might be murdered by the justly indignant Indians. These two
              women remained alone during their husbands' absence at the trial, a full account of
              which will be found further on. During this time one evening Mrs. Roberts, hearing
              considerable noise, opened the door to discover the trouble, when Mrs. Rambo, more
              thoughtful, bid her come in, which she did just in time to escape the jaws and claws
              of a hungry panther, which prowled around and over the cabin and against the door till
              the morning light.
            Mrs. Roberts tells of another narrow escape from a panther on a certain occasion when
              she and her little boy, eight or ten years of age, were in the rye patch. She was
              laying up the gap, when the little boy said, "Mother, what is that in the weeds?" She,
              seeing that it was a panther just in the act of springing on the boy, snatched him
              from the spot, and, putting him in front of her, made for the house; but it was not so
              easy to escape the cunning of the blood-thirsty panther, which intercepted their path
              in the rye and sprang for the boy, who, being active, barely succeeded in escaping
              unhurt. The mother, in seeing the ferocious beast alight on the spot where her darling
              boy had just saved a precious life, was so frightened that she was unable, for some
              time, to move from the spot.
          
        
        
        
          BROWN TOWNSHIP. CHAPTER VI.
          
            MAP OF BROWN TOWNSHIP.
            SHOWING THE SECTIONS, TOWNSHIP AND RANGES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED.
          
           THIS township took its name from Prior Brown, one of the first
            settlers. It was organized and incorporated in the year 1833, at which time it was
            struck off from Green, of which it had formed the eastern part for one year, prior to
            which it had been a part of Jackson for a similar time, and preceding that a part of
            Blue-river for three years.
          
          
            Eph Marsh
          
          
          
          Brown not being one of the original townships, like Blue-river and Brandywine, just
            described, and Sugar-creek, yet to consider, it now becomes necessary to digress a
            little and introduce a map and explanations, in order to make clear to the mind of the
            young reader the origin and early history of the township now under consideration, and
            of the other non-original townships to follow.
          
            HANCOCK COUNTY IN 1832.
          
          Explanations, Suggestions, and Historical Facts.—In order to comprehend the
            descriptions of the origin and early history of the county and several townships, the
            reader should study carefully our outline maps and history connected therewith; also the
            wall map published in 1875 by the senior member of this firm. To show the number of the
            townships and their exact size and location by maps, would require eight illustrations.
            We hardly deem it necessary to give all; but with what we shall introduce,  together with the printed history, the student may easily
            comprehend the various political changes.
          Let the reader ever bear in mind that the county consisted of—
          In 1828, three townships—Blue-river, Brandywine and Sugar-creek.
          In 1831, seven townships—Center, Jackson, Harrison and Buck-creek being
            added.
          In 1832, eight townships—Green being added.
          In 1833, nine townships—Brown being added.
          In 1836, ten townships—Vernon being added.
          In 1838, twelve townships—Jones and Union being added.
          In 1850, thirteen townships—Worth being added.
          In 1853, nine townships—Harrison, Jones, Union and Worth being annihilated.
          With this brief outline, in connection with the maps given, to which we shall often
            refer, the reader may readily locate any and all of the civil and congressional
            townships, present and historical.
          Location, Boundary, Size, Topography, Timber, etc.—Brown township is located in
            the north-east corner of the county, and is bounded by Madison county on the north,
            Henry on the east, Jackson township and Henry county on the south, and Green township on
            the west. It is the only township in the county that is not partially bounded by
            Center.
          In dimensions, Brown is six miles east and west and five miles north and south; and,
            consequently, consists of thirty sections. It is all located in township seventeen north
            and ranges seven and eight east, the west tier of sections being in range seven and the
            remainder in range eight east.
          In topography, the face of the township is mainly level, though somewhat undulating in
            the vicinity of the streams; soil, limestone deep, rich and lasting; subsoil, gravel and
            clay.
          It was once heavily timbered with beech, sugar-maple, 
            oak, elm, walnut, cherry, and poplar, and especially abounded in fine oak. The
            destroying angel passed over this township and selected out the fine walnut and poplar
            and claimed them for his own.
          It is almost wholly an agricultural and grazing district. The only manufactories in the
            township, outside of the flouring mills, are a saw-mill and a tile factory.
          Streams.—Sugar Creek enters the township at the north-east
            corner and flows south-west three and one-half miles to the center of section
            twenty-one, and within half a mile of Warrington; thence north-west, dipping into
            Madison county at the north-west corner of section eight; thence south-west, passing out
            on the west line of the township, one and a half miles south of the north-west corner,
            on the west middle line of section thirteen. Brandywine rises west of Warrington, in
            section twenty, runs south by south-west and passes out of the township one and a half
            miles east of the south-west corner, and near the middle southern line of section
            thirty-one. Willow Branch rises in the Western central part of the township, in the
            eastern part of section twenty-four, and flows south two miles; thence west, passing out
            a half mile north of the south-west corner. The Pedee rises in the south-east part of
            the township, flows north-west four miles, passes Warrington on the north-east, and
            empties into Sugar Creek in section seventeen. Brandywine, in Brown, is a small, torpid
            stream. The first of these streams once furnished limited water-power for
            "corn-crackers" and "muly saw-mills," but has no mills on its banks to-day. The last two
            are short, sluggish brooks, rising in wet, marshy land and flowing through level
            territory, are of little use save for drainage.
          Earliest Land Entries.—The first land entered in the township
            was on July 3rd, 1830, by Prior Brown, being the east half of the north-east quarter of
            section thirty-three, in township seventeen north, and in range eight east. The second
            entry was made on December 2d of  the same year, by Isaac
            Davis. This land was then in Blue-river township.
          First Settlers.—Among the first settlers of the township were:
            Prior Brown, after whom the township was named; John and Ezekiel Morgan, Geo. Nance, Mr.
            Davis, Perry Wilson, Sarah Baldwin and her family of seven children, Morgan McQuery, the
            Johnses, Nibargers, Sparkses, Hiatts, Seth Walker, Mosby Childers, Stephen Harlan, and
            Thomas Collins. All of whom are gone to the happy hunting grounds beyond the rolling
            river, and with the spirit's eye look with pleasure on the pleasant surroundings of
            their posterity, now enjoying the fruits of their labors. At a later date came Alfred
            and John Thomas; Jonas Marsh, the father of William, Montgomery, Ephraim, and Dr. John
            L. Marsh; William Bussel; Aaron Cass, grandfather of Annetta Cass, murdered in Green
            township; John Hays and Joel Cook, steady, prosperous farmers.
          First Election.—The first election in the township was in 1834,
            held at the residence of Barzilla Rozell. The ballots were cast in a hat, and covered
            with a kerchief. There were no complaints of "stuffing the ballot box" in those halcyon
            days.
          Mills, muly and modern.—The first grist-mill in the township
            was simply a corn-cracker, built by Stephen Harlan in 1835, and located on Sugar Creek,
            one and one-half miles north-east of Warrington, near where the Concord church now
            stands. This mill was run successfully for several years, when Harlan abandoned it and
            erected a new one on a more extensive scale lower down the stream propelled by an
            overshot wheel. The older citizens declare that the wheel was too large and set too high
            to secure the proper fall for the water, which in the dry season was low; so that on the
            occasion of letting the water into the race, it passed down very slowly till it came to
            a craw-fish hole, when it suddenly disappeared, to the utter chagrin of the enterprising
            miller and the amazement of the rural spectators.
          In about 1852, Lane & Co. built a sash saw-mill in the  central southern portion of the township, which they run for a number of years, when
            they sold to Dr. S. A. Troy, who refitted it and kept it in operation for two years, and
            then traded it off, and it was moved away.
          Daniel Blakely, in about 1836, erected a small saw-mill on Sugar Creek, near Nashville,
            which fed upon the choice logs of the vicinity for a number of years.
          A Mr. Jenkins built a steam saw-mill in the north-east part of the township in 1850,
            and run it for a considerable length of time.
          Harlan & Brown, about 1855, erected a steam saw-mill near the old Harlan mill,
            referred to above, which was successfully operated for, probably, ten years.
          Trees & Company erected a steam circular saw-mill in Warrington about 1863, just
            across the road east from where the present flouring mill now stands.
          A little west of Nashville, on the pike, Allen Walton & Brother built, about 1868,
            the largest and most successful circular saw-mill ever erected in the township, if not
            in the county, which continued in operation till 1879, when it was removed.
          Roads.—This township is reasonably well supplied with good
            public roads, many of which have been graded and graveled by her enterprising citizens.
            There are in the township nine and three-fourth miles of toll pike, besides about six
            miles surrendered to the public. To this township belongs the credit of having the first
            gravel road toll pike in the county, built in 1859, and known as the "Knightstown and
            Warrington Gravel Road."
          Railroads.—This township has no railroad completed. The I., B.
            and W. are extending a line through the county, which will pass through the township,
            entering at the south-west corner and passing out near the central middle line on the
            east.
          Synopsis.—Brown township has four churches, to-wit: Baptist,
            Methodist Episcopal, United Brethren, and Christian.
          
          There are three secret orders in the township—Masons, Odd Fellows, and Daughters
            of Rebecca.
          It has two villages,—Warrington and Nashville,—and two
            post-offices,—Warrington and Willow Branch. The former is the only voting
            precinct.
          She has a tile factory, flour mill, saw-mill, three pikes, one county officer, one mill
            stream, two border counties, and is democratic by about sixty majority.
          Teachers and Schools.—The names and numbers of the schools, and
            the teachers at present employed, are as follows:
          
            
              District No. 1

              District No. 6
              Mays
              Jennie Kitterman.
            
            
              District No. 7
              Brewer
              Rose M. Thompson.
            
            
              District No. 8
              Democrat
              Lucy Morris.
            
            
              District No. 9
              Spiceland
              W. J. Thomas.
            
          
          Remarks.—These several schools are numbered similar to the numbering of the
            sections in a congressional township, No. 1 being found in the north-east corner and No.
            9 in the south-west, there being three tiers of houses of three each. The Buchanan
            school-house is located in the western middle part, near J. N. Martindale's farm. The
            senior member of this firm once swayed the green birch with regal authority at this
            point, and had the honor of having under his instruction the future county clerk,
            Ephraim Marsh; Dr. John L. Marsh; and Dr. David Myers, since deceased. At the old
            original Spiceland school-house, Dr. J. G. Stuart, of Fortville; Wm. Sagers, and
            Montgomery Marsh, also received his instruction.
          In 1838, Montgomery Marsh attended a school located just north of the Buchanan, the
            building of which was made entirely of buckeye logs. The teacher was David McKinsey, now
            in the poor-house of this county.
          
          Population and Polls.—The scholastic population of Brown for
            1881 is 489. Polls, 243. Population for 1850, 878; for 1860, 1,161; 1870, 1,329; for
            1880, 1,400.
          Vote.—The number of votes cast in Brown in 1836 were 52; in
            184, 110; in 1860, 205; in 1870, 235; in 1880, 328. Her vote for President in 1881
            stood: Republican, 125; democratic, 186; independent, 17.
          Value of Real and Personal Property.—Brown township has 19,248
            acres of assessed land, valued at $423,620. Her improvements on the same are valued at
            $53,810. Value of town lots, $2,330; with improvements on the same valued at $6,380.
            Personal property, $158,605. Total value of real and personal property, $644,745.
          Taxes.—This township is assessed for the current year, to be
            paid in 1882, for $7,141.45 taxes. Of this amount, the following men pay $40 and upward,
            viz.:

          Murders, Suicides, and Remarkable Deaths.—It was in this
            township that a Mr. Bell, brother of Senator Bell, of Madison county, was eaten by the
            wolves in 1838. His body was found by Mosby Childers north-west of Nashville in a badly
            mutilated condition. His bones, and fragments of his clothing and pocket-book, were
            picked up in different places. Cause of death never known.
          In 1832, a child of Vincent Cooper was frozen to death on the banks of Sugar Creek, in
            this township. It had wandered from home and was lost.
          In the early history of the township a man by the name of Tullus committed suicide, by
            hanging, within one hundred yards of Warrington.
          In 1856, William Mitchell, a young man, was killed by horse-racing, being thrown
            against a tree by the horse taking an opposite side of the tree from what the rider
            intended he should, and supposed he would, take.
          Alfred Jones' wife committed suicide in 1875, by hanging in a small house near her
            residence. Cause unknown. Her husband was absent from home at the time.
          Township Trustees.—The following are the names of the township
            trustees from the time they were empowered with authority to levy taxes, together with
            the date of their appointment:
          
            Wm. L. Garriott
              1859
            Montgomery Marsh
              1861
            B. F. Reeves
              1863
            J. W. Trees
              1864
            Wm. Marsh
              1865
            Wm. L. Garriott
              1878
          
          It will be seen from the above that William Marsh held the office of trustee for more
            than a dozen years, and we speak from our own personal knowledge in testifying to his
            earnestness and efficiency. William L. Garriott sways the scepter at this date, being
            the first and last trustee in the township under the new regime. Attorney Marsh and
            Esquire Reeves carried the township safely through the perilous times of the civil
            war.
          Justices of the Peace.—The following are the justices  of the peace for Brown township from its organization to the
            present time. We copy from the records since 1840. Prior to that time we find no records
            either in our own court-house or at Indianapolis in the state records.

            Benjamin McCarty
              1866
            Alfred F. McKinsey
              1870
            Benjamin F. Reeves
              1870
            Benjamin F. Reeves
              1874
            H. B. Collins
              1876
            Benjamin F. Reeves
              1878
            Joseph Garriott
              1880
          
          Esquires Reeves and Garriott hold the scales of justice in Brown at present.
          Ex-County Officers.—Brown township, like Virginia, the mother
            of Presidents, has not been wanting in furnishing county officers.
          Among these ex-officers we call to memory Ex-Auditor Lysander Sparks, one of the
            pioneers of the township. His father was the first merchant in Warrington.
          Captain Taylor W. Thomas, deceased, late resident of Center township, was elected and
            served as sheriff from Brown.
          Wm. G. Caldwell, one of the staunch resident farmers of Brown, was the immediate
            predecessor of William Wilkins as sheriff of the county.
          Of the ex-commissioners were Seth Walker, Daniel Wilkinson, and Nevil Reeves, all
            honest, honorable, "well-to-do" farmers.
          Ex-Prosecuting Attorney M. Marsh and Ex-County Surveyor James K. King were both elected
            in Brown township.
          There may be others; but as there is no record of the 
            residence of the various county officers, it must be taken from memory and hearsay,
            which are not always reliable.
          Exports.—The chief exports of Brown are corn, wheat, hogs,
            cattle, horses, lumber, and flaxseed, with small quantities of apples, potatoes, and
            sheep.
        
        
          CHAPTER VII.
          
            WARRINGTON
            was laid out near the center of the township, on the Fort Wayne State road, by John
              Oldham, on the 6th of October, 1834, and consisted of forty-eight lots. The first and
              only addition to the original plat was made by Dr. Wm. Trees on the 13th day of April,
              1877, and consisted of eight lots.
            Warrington is about fifteen miles north-east of Greenfield, on the Knightstown and
              Pendleton turnpike, the extremes of which are its shipping points.
            It has no railroad, except in prospect. The I., B. and W., when completed, will have
              a depot within about one and a half miles.
            It has two churches, three lodges, a school, flouring mill, two stores, a postoffice,
              and other essentials to a small village.
            It has been the voting precinct since 1834.
            The Knightstown and Anderson daily stage passes through Warrington.
            It has a daily mail, with Henry C. Garriott postmaster.
            The post-office was kept for many years by Samuel Blakely at his private residence,
              between Warrington and Nashville.

            NASHVILLE,
            located two miles north-west of Warrington, on Sugar Creek, was laid out December 30,
              1834, by Blakely and Kennedy, and consisted of thirty-two lots, most of which have
              been sold for delinquent taxes.
            The only business now in the place is blacksmithing, by Morgan Whistler.
            In the ,early history of the place, Elisha Thornburg kept a general store, followed
              by Allen White and others for a short time.
          
          
            WILLOW RANCH P. O.
            is located in the south-west part of the township, on the  stream Willow Branch, from which it derives its name. The place contains
              eight dwellings, a store, blacksmith, painter, physician, post-office, a ware-room,
              and a saw-mill.
            The first business done in the place was in 1874, by A. B. Thomas, who established a
              store and accepted the appointment of postmaster for Willow Branch, when the office
              was removed from across the line in Green, where it had been kept for a number of
              years by Jonathan Smith, a farmer and merchant.
            The business of this place is done by A. B. Thomas, merchant, grain and implement
              dealer; Henry Kenyon, blacksmith and carriage maker; George Fowler, painter; H. B.

            CONCORD BAPTIST CHURCH
            was organized October 29, 1838, at the house of Stephen Harlan. Morgan McQuery was
              chosen moderator and Jacob Parkhurst clerk, with the following members: William
              Sparks, Jane Wilkinson, Hiram Harlan and wife, Charity Wilson, Jane Ross, and Stephen
              Harlan and wife.
            The way of life and salvation has been definitely pointed out from time to time
              during the history of the church by the following Elders, to-wit: Daniel Cunningham,
              John F. Johnson, Thomas Smith, John Sparks, J. F. Collier, S. D. Harlan, and T. S.
              Lyons; the latter of whom is the present preacher.
            The first meetings were held in private residences until the existence of log
              school-houses, which accommodated the congregation for a number of years, terminating
              in 1855, when the present frame building, thirty-four by thirty-six feet, was erected
              and completed in good style, and dedicated in 1856 by Elder John Sparks. The first
              trustees were Cicero Wilkinson, William Wright, and Jacob B. Hamilton.
            This society is of the regular Baptist faith and order.
            
            The White Water Association has often held its annual meetings at this place.
            Present membership, thirty-seven. Church clerk, J. P. Harlan.
            Adjoining the church on the east is a cemetery, where many of the pioneers lie
              slumbering. First interment, Caroline Mays.
          
          
            ZIONS CHAPEL M. E.
            The Methodist Episcopal Church had a small society in the early history of the
              township near Nashville. Among the first members were John Kennedy and wife, Mariah
              Wilson, Samuel Griffith and wife, Elizabeth Walker, wife of Seth Walker; Sarah
              Newkirk, John Nibarger, Sarah Nibarger, and Amanda Childers.
            This society met at private residences in the winter time, and at the log
              school-houses during the warm season, until they built a church in 1839 at Nashville.
              It was constructed by voluntary labor. The chief contributors were Samuel Griffith,
              John Kennedy, Seth Walker, Thomas Collins, David Noble, Dr. William Trees, and Thomas
              W. Collins. They continued to meet here till 1856, at which time the building became
              unfit for use, and a school-house near by was brought into service until 1859, at
              which time this society united with a small organization at Warrington and erected the
              present building, known as Zions Chapel, located at a midway point, being two miles
              north of Warrington and one and three-fourth miles east of Nashville. The Warrington
              wing held their meetings at the house of Dr. William Trees, one of her generous and
              most liberal members, prior to the coalition with the Nashvilleites. This building was
              burned in July last; but at this date they are rebuilding at an estimated cost of
              $1,100. Present minister, Rev. John Thomas.
          
          
            THE UNITED BRETHREN,
            of Warrington, organized a meeting about 1859, and worshiped  in Zions Chapel till 1871, at which time they built a neat, good-sized
              frame building in Warrington, at a cost of $2,400. The new building was dedicated in
              the same year by Bishop Edwards. The minister was Milo Baily. The trustees were John
              W. Trees, John Bridges, and Thomas Armstrong. The present minister is Rev. Felix.
              Presiding Elder, Milton Wright. The membership is numerous. The society is in a
              flourishing condition, and has upon its church rolls some of the best and most
              influential men of the township.
          
          
            CHRISTIAN CHURCH, WARRINGTON.
            This church was first organized near Elizabeth City, and was known as the "Six-Mile
              Church." It was organized about the year 1838 by Peter Rader, who was its first
              pastor. Having quite a number of the best citizens as members, it continued its
              usefulness for several years at this point. Death and removals having crippled it so
              much, it was discontinued here as a church organization; but subsequently reorganized
              near Warrington, where the following Elders preached occasionally: Robert Low, Drury
              Holt, John Walker, and Silas Mawzy; all of Rush county. The meetings at first were
              held at private houses and log school-houses in the immediate neighborhood. The
              society struggled long and hard to build a house in which to worship; but were unable
              to accomplish the object, being low in spirits and few in numbers, and, in 1862,
              disorganized. In March, 1877, the society took fresh courage, and was again,
              established, or reorganized, by Elder Robert Edmonson. J. N. Martindale and John
              McCray were chosen Elders, and John Vandyke and C. C. Loder deacons. H. C. Garriott,
              clerk. The church edifice is very well located in Warrington; is a handsome frame,
              thirty-six by fifty-four feet, constructed at a cost of $1,650, and will seat five
              hundred persons. It was dedicated December 25, 1877, by Elder Wiley Ackman, who
              preached for the society two years, followed by Elder David Franklin,  who was succeeded by Elder Cornelius Quick, the present
              pastor. The society is in a prosperous condition, with a membership of eighty. On the
              20th day of March, 1877, J. N. Martindale, John Vandyke, and W. L. Garriott were
              elected trustees.
            [We are indebted to W. L. Garriott, Esq., of Warrington, for the above facts.]

            BENJAMIN F. REEVES, ESQ.,
            was born in Brown county, Ohio, on the second day of May, 1828. In the fall of 1837
              his parents moved to Rush county, Indiana, and three years later came to Hancock
              county and settled on Brandywine Creek, in Brown town-ship, their home being a rude
              log cabin in the wilderness. His father had a large family of small children, and he,
              being the oldest, was compelled to work out from home to aid in maintaining the
              family.
            By the time he was grown he had obtained, what was considered in those days, a good
              education, and taught  school in the winter and worked
              at moulding brick in the summer.
            On the first day of November, 1849, he was married to Caroline Harlan, a daughter of
              Stephen Harlan, one of the first settlers of the county. The result of this union was
              ten children—five girls and an equal number of boys, eight of whom are still
              living.
            In the summer of 1863 he united with the Baptist church, and is still a member
              thereof.
            On the 25th of March, 1873, he had the misfortune to lose his wife, who was a most
              estimable lady, and sincerely mourned by all who knew her. On the 15th day of August,
              1874, he was again married, choosing for his companion Nancy Garner, with whom he is
              still happily living.
            Mr. Reeves is well-known throughout the county, and perhaps no man in his township
              enjoys in a higher degree the confidence and esteem of the people; and, as a result,
              he has held many offices of trust. In 1851 he was appointed school trustee by the
              county auditor, and in the spring of 1858 was elected township trustee, and again
              elected in the spring of 1862. In the spring of 1866 he was elected justice of the
              peace, and was re-elected in 1870, 1874, and 1878, having served continuously for
              fifteen years in that capacity, and, probably, married more people than any man in the
              county. In addition to his duties as justice, Mr. Reeves attends to a large share of
              probate business.
            By his thrift and industry he has secured to himself one of the best farms in the
              county; and now, in the evening of his days, surrounded by all the comforts of life,
              and enjoying the confidence and esteem of all who know him, he can look back over the
              record of a life well spent and forward to a crown well won.
            Dr. H. J. Reeves, a young physician of good standing in "Liztown," Henry county, is
              his son. Another son is teaching school and studying law, preparatory to entering the
              legal profession.
          
          
          
             BENJAMIN F. REEVES, ESQ.
          
          
          
            STEPHEN HARLAN
            was a native of the old "Palmetto State," and dates his earthly career back to the
              first year of the present century. He came to Hancock county in 1834, and settled in
              Brown township, on the farm which he entered, and where he lived and died. He was,
              consequently, one of the first settlers in this section.
            Mr. Harlan was married, near Connersville, to a Miss Sparks, a tall, slender, noble
              woman, still living beyond her three score and ten.
            The first brick house and the first mill in the township were built and owned by
              Stephen Harlan, who was not only an enterprising, thrifty farmer, but a miller and
              millwright, having built two grist-mills and a saw-mill, the first in 1835.
            He was a zealous member of the Baptist church. It was at his house that the meetings
              of this society in Brown were first held.
            This liberal-hearted, brave pioneer "shuffled off the mortal coil" and bade adieu to
              earthly scenes April 19, 1877, and was buried at the Concord Baptist church among his
              brethren in the faith.
          
          
            JOHN NIBARGER,
            a native of the "Buckeye State," was born in Green county, just at the beginning of
              the second war with the mother country. He emigrated to Hancock county in 1830 and
              settled on Sugar Creek, near the Concord Baptist church, in Brown township. He was
              married to Miss Julia Ann Walker in 1837. She dying, he was married the second time to
              Margaret Asbury April 3, 1845; and a third time to Sarah Mead, on February 20, 1853.
              He had three children by his second wife. He obtained all of his wives in sight of his
              farm.
            Mr. Nibarger was a consistent member of the M. E. church, a thrifty farmer, an
              exemplary man, and a good citizen.
          
          
          
            PHINEAS THOMAS,
            a native of the "Keystone State," began his earthly pilgrimage about the year 1765.
              He came to Kentucky at the age of nineteen, being about the year 1784, and under-went
              the hardships of a Daniel Boone life. He lived in a "block-house," with other
              families, as a protection from the ill-treated, wily red man, who encompassed them
              about so closely that they were compelled to place guards at the house while a few of
              the men worked in the adjoining field.
            From Kentucky he went to Ohio, to engage in the United States survey, which he
              followed till the Indians became so hostile he was compelled to decline further
              employment. From Ohio he came to Rush county, just as she was first being peopled by
              the "pale face," where he remained for a few years; thence to Hancock county, Brown
              township, in 1836, where he remained till his death, in about the year 1847, at the
              good old age of eighty-two. Mr. Thomas was fond of frontier life, and was truly a
              pioneer from first to last.
            He left four sons and an equal number of daughters, viz.: Martha, Elizabeth,
              Margaret, Nancy, Alfred, John M., David, Ephraim and Taylor W.; five of whom are
              living at this date, three sons and two daughters, all useful good citizens.
            Mr. Thomas was a highly esteemed citizen that under-went the hardships incident to
              pioneer life. His remains lie buried in the Pleasant Hill cemetery, on the line
              between Jackson and Brown townships.
          
          
            THOMAS COLLINS,
            of Brown township, was born May 9, 1806, in Gallia county, Ohio. He was married in
              the twentieth year of his age to Miss Sarah W. Bray, of the same state, where he
              remained for three years; then, with brave hearts and determined hands, they set out
              to seek their fortune in the unknown forest, and, in 1829, stopped in Madison county,
              bought a little farm and remained four years; thence to 
              Hancock in 1833, where, for $400, he purchased one hundred and sixty acres of good
              land in the native green. Here he toiled and endured the privations of a pioneer till
              1834, when his companion died and left him in the wild woods with five little children
              to care for. In a short time he married Rachel Blakely, with whom he shared the fruits
              of industry for forty-four years.
            Mr. Collins succeeded in raising a large family, and provided well for their wants.
              He set off eleven children with over $3,000 each, and provided for the widowed mother
              her life-time.
            Mr. Collins attached himself to the M. E. church in 1837, and remained an earnest,
              faithful member till death. He was ever a liberal supporter of church and schools, and
              ready to lend a helping hand to the advancement of every good cause. He died July 9,
              1878.
          
          
            WILLIAM TREES, M. D.
            Dr. William Trees, of Warrington, Brown township, Hancock county, Indiana, is a
              native of the "Buckeye State," born in Clermont county September 9, 1816; and is,
              therefore, able to compare ages with the State of Indiana, and lose but little by the
              comparison.
            He emigrated to Rush county, Indiana, in 1826, while the county was yet new, and
              Hancock county not known, and studied medicine in Milroy with the well known medical
              firm of Doctors Day and Sharp, active physicians of their time. He then attended
              lectures, and took a course of study and instruction in the Indiana Medical Institute,
              receiving a diploma of which the following is a copy:
            
              
                
                  
                    INDIANA MEDICAL INSTITUTE. (CONSTITUTED FEBRUARY, 1839.)
                    Unto whom this may come, greeting:
                    Know ye, that Mr. William Trees having completed all the requirements of this
                      institution, and been duly examined according to its regulations in the
                      various branches of medical science, and found to be well qualified
                      therein,
                    We, therefore, by the power invested in us by the act of  incorporation of this body, do authorize him to practice medicine,
                      surgery, and obstetrics, and recommend him to the favorable notice of the
                      profession and the patronage of the public.

            Dr. Trees moved to Warrington, his present home, June 10, 1841, where he soon built
              up a good practice, an impregnable character, and a name that will go down to
              posterity loved and honored by all.
            Dr. Trees has been a liberal, consistent, zealous member of the M. E. church ever
              since its organization in Warrington. As previously remarked, it was at his house the
              meetings of this society were first held in Brown township.
            The Doctor is an intelligent, social gentleman, and generally well informed.
          
          
            JONAS MARSH,
            a native of the "Ancient Dominion," was born in Lancaster county in 1796. His father
              moved to East Tennessee in 1800. In 1837 Mr. Marsh came to Hancock county, where he
              remained till his death, in March, 1877. While in Tennessee he followed wagon-making
              for about ten years; but after coming to Hancock county he successfully engaged in
              farming.
            Mr. Marsh was married in Tennessee to a Miss Kennedy, by whom he had five children:
              George, Henry, Elizabeth, Rebecca, and Mary Jane; the first of whom is now living in
              Missouri, and Henry is well known to our citizens. By his second wife (who was a
              sister of the first) he raised six children: William, Montgomery, Matilda, Martha,
              Ephraim, and John; the latter three of whom are natives of the township, the others
              are Tennesseeans.  The youngest is a practicing
              physician; Ephraim is county clerk; Montgomery is one of the older attorneys of the
              county; and Martha is the wife of William Pratt,
            Mr. Marsh was one of the early settlers of the township who helped to clear the
              forests, make the roads, and convert the wilderness into broad grain fields. Though
              not a member of any church or secret order, he was a firm, honest, exemplary man,
              unpretentious and devoid of deceit, He died on his farm, and his remains lie buried at
              the McQuary graveyard, near his home, where loving hands have placed a plain monument
              to mark the final testing place of his mortal remains.
          
          
            DR. JOHN L. MARSH.
            The subject of this sketch was born in Brown township, this county, December 27, 185
              1. At the age of eighteen he entered the office of Dr. William Trees as a medical
                
                DR. JOHN L. MARSH.
               student. In 1872 and 1873 he attended a course of lectures in the Louisville
              Medical College. The next year he attended the Ohio Medical College, receiving the  degree of M. D. at the close of the term. He was the
              youngest member of the graduating class, having just attained his twenty-first year.
              After leaving college, in 1874, he located in Warrington and entered upon the practice
              of his chosen profession. The following year he married a daughter of John W. Trees.
              In the spring of 1877 he moved to Greenfield, put out his shingle, and entered upon a
              lucrative practice. In the fall of 1879 he commenced the publication of a medical
              journal, which soon gained an extended reputation. During the winter of 1880, 1881 he
              delivered a course of lectures in the Indiana Eclectic Medical College. In addition to
              his professional duties, he has contributed papers on scientific and medical subjects
              to various journals.
          
        
        
        
          BUCK-CREEK TOWNSHIP. CHAPTER VII.
          
            MAP OF BUCK-CREEK TOWNSHIP.
            SHOWING THE SECTIONS, TOWNSHIP, AND RANGES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED.
          
          THIS township took its name from the stream that flows through it,
            which, in turn, is supposed to have derived its  name from
            the numerous "buck" once found on its banks. It was struck off from Sugar-creek in 1831,
            and then consisted of the territory now embodied in both Buck-creek and Vernon. For five
            years it consisted of sixty-seven sections, when, in 1836, it was reduced to thirty-six
            sections, its present size, by striking off the northern portion, which took the name of
            Vernon. In 1838, Buck-creek was still further reduced in size (see map on p. 32) by
            striking off two tiers of sections from the south and adding to Jones township and one
            tier from the remainder on the east and adding to Union township, leaving it diminutive
            in size, of only twenty sections, from 1838 to 1853, at which time it was restored to
            its former size of six miles square, which it still retains. It is located in the
            central western portion of the county, and is bounded on the north by Marion county and
            Vernon township, on the east by Center, on the south by Sugar-creek, and on the west by
            Marion county. It is all located in township sixteen north and ranges five and six east.
            Township line sixteen forms its southern boundary and seventeen its northern. Two tiers.
            of sections are in range five west and four in range six. The range line extends a half
            mile west of Mt. Comfort.
          The surface in general is very flat, the only rolling portion being in the south-west
            corner. The surface being low and wet, was once rather uninviting for settlement. It was
            very heavily timbered with beech, oak, ash, elm, sugar-maple, walnut and poplar, and
            especially abounded in fine burr oak. It has been ascertained since being cleared and
            drained that it is very productive. The soil is a black loam. The low portions
            previously thought unfit for tillage proves to be the most productive.
          Streams.—Buck-creek, a small, sluggish mill stream, enters the
            township on the north line, at the north-east corner of section five, and flows in a
            general south by south-west direction through the center of the township, a half mile
            east of Mt. Comfort, passing out on the south line near the south-west corner of the
            township. This stream  has no banks at all in the
            township, except for about a mile through the Fish farm, on the south line. It has,
            therefore, been found necessary and expedient to deepen the channel in order to reclaim
            the overflowed land along the stream. Sugar Creek, a brisk mill stream, the largest in
            the township, cuts off the south-east corner of section twenty-seven, and extends
            through section thirty-four.
          First Settlement and Land Entry.—This township was first
            settled about the year 1827, in the southern portion. The first entry of land was made
            in the year 1822, January 18, by George Worthington, being the south-east quarter of
            section thirty-four, in township sixteen north, in range six east. The second entry was
            made by John Chamberlain, and the third by John Smith.
          First Settlers.—The first settlers in this township were James
            Burris, John Shirley, Thomas Craig, William Smith, William Arnett, Obadiah and John
            Eastes, J. A. Dunn, Thomas Rodgers, Isaac Snider, John Dance, Daniel Skinner, Archy
            Smith, Benjamin Percell, Charles Fish, Landis Eastes, Hance Steel, and the Beechman
            family. Burris, Smith, Rodgers, and Dance were from Ohio; Shirley and Craig were from
            Kentucky; Snider from Virginia; and Skinner from Delaware. At a little later date came
            George Grist, Joseph Wright, J. W. Shelby, John and Samuel Steel, John and William
            Collins, Jacob Smith,: W. A. Dunn, Lawrence and O. O. Harvey, E. Scotten, S. Arnett,
            Owen Griffith, J. H. Murphy, J. W. Campbell, and the Barnards and Parkers.
          Births, Deaths, Marriages, etc.—The first child born in the
            township was Permelia Craig, the wife of O. O. Harvey. The second, Archibald Smith, son
            of Jacob Smith.
          The first death was Thomas Rodgers, buried at the Scotten graveyard in about 1833.
          The first burial at the Arnett graveyard was Jennings Henderson, who was found frozen
            to death, one mile from his home, in 1847. He had gone to Greenfield to get his  gun repaired, and starting home late, night overtook him,
            and the next morning was found dead.
          In about 1847 James Burris, a very industrious, quiet man, and one of the earliest
            settlers in the township, after giving some directions to his son, left the house, and
            going into the woods, sat down by a tree and opened the veins in his arms and bled to
            death.
          The first grown person buried in the Steel graveyard was a daughter of Hance Steel. The
            first in the Dunn graveyard was the mother of William A. Dunn. The first in the Millard
            graveyard was Sarah Hodges, a sister of William A. Dunn. The first in the Snider
            graveyard was the wife of Isaac Snider. The first in the Eastes graveyard was Lucinda
            Arnett, wife of William Arnett, junior.
          The first marriage in Buck-creek township was that of George Shirley and Fanny
            Crump.
          Among the first physicians were Doctors John H. Sanders, Lyman Carpenter, and J. W.
            Hervey.
          Ebenezer Scotten was the first blacksmith in the township. George Grist, located near
            Mt. Comfort, is the only son of Vulcan following the trade in the territory now under
            consideration.
          The first resident preacher was Stephen Masters, and the second Philip Thurman. The
            first postmaster was Robert Wallace. The first teachers were Philip Masters and a Mr.
            Tisdell.
          The first school-house of any kind built in the township was erected near Isaac
            Snider's, senior, in the south-west part of the township. It was quite a rude
            affair.
          Mills.—This township being poorly supplied with water-power,
            her streams being small and sluggish, she has not been noted for pioneer water-mills.
            The first and only primitive grist-mill propelled by water-power was a small hominy mill
            on Buck Creek, north, near Mt. Comfort, erected in the year 1854 by William Eastes, and
            of short duration. The next mill was a steam corn-cracker and saw-mill located west of
            Mt. Comfort, about the year 1860, built by Corbin. It burned down in a few years,  and was never rebuilt. Whitlock built a steam sash saw-
            mill in 1863, which was operated some four years, and then moved out of the township. A
            steam saw-mill erected. by McLain and Buroaker, in 1869, located one and a half miles
            east of Mt. Comfort, was run several years, when it was moved north-west of Mt. Comfort
            two and one-half miles, where it was operated a short time, and where a portion of the
            mill and machinery still remain. Maulden and Hopkins erected a steam circular saw-mill
            on the south side of the road, a few rods east of Mt. Comfort school-house, in the year
            1874, which was operated a few years, when it was burned; but shortly rebuilt, run about
            two years, and then removed to Oaklandon, in Marion county. Ebenezer Steel erected a
            large tile factory on his farm, one and one-half miles north-east of Mt. Comfort, about
            the time the ditching enterprise first struck the county, which was kept in operation,
            doing an extensive business, for a series of years, or till all the immediate section of
            country was thoroughly drained.
          The above are the only mills of which we have any account, save the two circular
            saw-mills now in operation; one of which is known as the Wilson mill, being located on
            the Adam Wilson farm, in the central eastern portion of the township, and the other
            erected the present season by Ebenezer Steel on his farm, located on the I., B. and W.
            R. R., about a mile north-east of Mt. Comfort.
          Merchandising.—From an examination of the old records in the
            auditor's office, we ascertain that in the year 1832 John Eastes was licensed, according
            to law, to vend merchandise in Buck-creek township. His place of business was in the
            southern portion, where he kept a few staple articles in accordance with the demands.
            There is no record of further business at this stand. The settlement soon extended
            farther north in the township, covering the northern portion as well as the southern,
            which was first settled, thus making it necessary, for convenience, to change the place
            of business to a more central location. Thus originated, the first store at Mt. Comfort,
            kept by Charles

            W. J. Woods, Church > Thomas, Woods > Eastes, D. G. Hanna, J. W. Jay, and Smith

            S. Smith.
          Educational.—This township has nine frame schoolhouses, numbered, named and
            supplied with teachers for the present term as follows, to-wit:

          These houses are numbered east and west as a boy would drop hills of corn in a row
            running in the same direction; No. 1 being in the north-east corner of the township and
            No. 9 in the south-west. The buildings are all plain, medium-sized frame houses,
            plastered and painted and covered with shingles, and each consists of a single room. The
            greatest want in an educational line at present, perhaps, is more apparatus. The nine
            school-houses are estimated worth $4,000; apparatus, $100; total, $4,100. Total number
            of school children, 492. Township institutes in this township have generally been well
            attended, interesting and profitable; more so than the average township, owing to the
            interest manifested by the trustee in the matter.
          Synopsis.—This township has four churches, viz.: two United
            Brethren and two Methodist Episcopal; one post-office—Mt. Comfort; one voting
            precinct—School-house No. 5; two circular saw-mills; a pike; one county officer;
            one deputy; two mill streams; nine school-houses; one 
            railroad; five ex-county officers; one store; and a democratic majority, on the vote for
            President in 1880, of twelve.
          Roads.—Buck-creek township has less graveled road than any
            other township in the county, there being only three and one-half miles of toll pike
            within her borders. This is owing, no doubt, to her lack of gravel-pits, being, as
            previously remarked, low and wet., The roads are less improved and in worse condition in
            this township than in any other in the county.
          Railroad.—The Indiana, Bloomingtan and Western Railway Company
            has just extended its line through this township; but have established no station as
            yet.
          Population.—The population of Buck-creek for 1850 was 420; for
            1860, 999; for 1870, 1,227; for 1880, 1,460. In 1860 there were five colored persons and
            no foreigners, and in 1870 there were thirty-one foreigners and no colored.
          Vote and Polls.—The vote for 1860 was 189; for 1870, 217; and
            for 1880, 357. The vote for President in 1880 stood as follows : Republican, 166;
            democratic, 178; independent, 13. Polls for 1881, 279.
          Value of Real and Personal Property.—The number of acres of
            land assessed for taxes for 1881 is 22,620, valued at $528,895; improvements on the
            same, $37,545; value of personal property, $160,830; total, $727,270.
          Taxes.—Total amount of taxes assessed against her for 1881, to
            be paid in 1882, $646,326. Of this amount, the following men pay $40 and upward:

          Ex-County Officers.—Buck-creek was the home of Bazil G. Jay,
            ex-county auditor; Mordecai Millard, ex-sheriff; and John Collins, ex-commissioner; all
            deceased, but green in the memory of the older citizens. On her fertile soil and broad
            plains still flourish Joshua W. Shelby, ex-sheriff, and Ephraim Thomas, ex-commissioner,
            prominent men well-known throughout the county.
          Productions.—Buck-creek is almost wholly an agricultural and
            grazing territory, there never having been any manufactories in the township, save a
            tile factory, saw-mill, and a hominy mill, which did only a local business. Owing to the
            great abundance of burr oak in this section, it is probable that when the new I., B. and
            W. Railroad is completed there will, for a time, spring up a lively trade in lumber for
            staves, heading, etc. There is also an abundance of white elm poles, used in making
            hubs, which will probably be used.
          Physicians.—There being no located physicians in this township
            at present, the northern part of the township, for medical skill, call on the physicians
            of Fortville and McCordsville; the eastern and southern part go to Greenfield and
            Philadelphia; and the western to Cumberland and the above points. Dr. J. W. Hervey, of
            Indianapolis, named in the foregoing as one of the pioneer physicians, still has
            considerable practice among his old friends in the western portion of the township. The
            old citizens say that at one time nearly all the practice of the township was done by
            the said Dr. Hervey and the following physicians from Greenfield, viz.: Drs. Lot
            Edwards, B. F. Duncan, N. P. Howard, and R. E. Barnett.
          *To ascertain the assessed
            valuation of a man's property, real and personal, divide tax by the levy, which will
            give the number of hundreds.
          
          Justices of the Peace.—Though the people of this section are
            quiet and peaceably disposed, it has been necessary, in compliance with law and the
            needs of the community, to have disciples of Blackstone to settle the petty differences
            arising between people; and for this purpose, the following justices of the peace have
            been appointed from time to time in and for said township, to-wit:

            jurisdiction, are Esquires Rose and McConnell.
          Township Trustees.—In the early history of the county trustees
            were scarcely more than mere nominal officers, having but few duties, subject to various
            changes. The following are the names of those acting, with dates of election, from the
            time their duties were enlarged, and their powers so increased that they could levy a
            local tax :

            John C. Eastes
              1880
          
          Remarks.—The needy poor of this incorporated portion of the county look to John
            C. Eastes for assistance in the day of adversity; the farmer calls on him for pay for
               his sheep killed by the hungry hounds; and the faithful
            teacher pays him a visit at the close of the term (if necessity does not prompt an
            earlier call) to receive remuneration for his services.
          Families.—Buck-creek is the home of the Steels, Parkers,
            Wrights, Shelbys, Easteses, Dunns, Smiths, Harveys, Craigs, Collinses, Grists, and
            Arnetts; all prominent, well-known families.
          It was once the home of Professor A. C. Shortridge, ex-superintendent of the
            Indianapolis public schools, and late president of Purdue University.
          Upon her fruitful soil once trod the veritable Lorenzo Dow, the "Quaker Methodist"
            itinerant preacher, who had more than a national reputation for his zeal, industry and
            peculiarities. Here he entered land, a fuller account of whom will appear elsewhere.
          Here lived, in his peculiar style, the eccentric John D. Hopkins, and still lives the
            industrious Mrs. Sabie Craig, perhaps the most extensive, successful, industrious,
            practical lady farmer in the county.
          Murder and Suicide.—Here occurred the Kennedy tragedy, in which
            Thomas Kennedy killed his own daughter, the wife of George Hudson, for which he was
            sentenced to the penitentiary for life; but was in the course of a few years, through
            the intercession of his attorney, T. D. Walpole, pardoned, after which he returned to
            his own neighborhood, where he remained till his death, which occurred only a few years
            since.
          It was in this township that James Norman became tired of terrestial scenes, and
            determined to put an end to his earthly pilgrimage, which he accomplished by hanging
            himself in the south-east part of the township, in about the year 1861.
          With this brief outline, we close the general review of the township. A more specific
            account of many of the Matters mentioned herein will appear in the next chapter.
        
        
        
          CHAPTER IX.
            BUCK-CREEK TOWNSHIP—Continued.
          
            HOPEWELL M. E. CHURCH
            was organized about the year 1836, and was originally known as Sycamore Chapel. Among
              the first members. were Thomas Craig and wife, Hiram Crump and lady, John Cochanhour
              and helpmeet, Miles Burris and wife, Jeremiah Beach and wife, Obadiah Eastes and lady,
              A. Cooper and family, and Mother Burris.
            The first ministers were Revs. Edwards, Landy Havens, Morrow, George Havens, J. B.
              Birt, and Millender, some of whom are still living as valient soldiers of the
              cross.
            Meetings were originally held, before the building of the Sycamore church, at the
              private residences of Daniel Skinner, Thomas Craig, and Obadiah Eastes.
            In 1840, the first church building was erected, and continuously used till 1863, when
              it was burned. The society was without a place to worship till 1870, when it erected
              the present building, a neat frame, at a cost of $1,000, and known as Hopewell
              Chapel.
            This organization has upon its church rolls but few members, and is, consequently,
              not strong, and have preaching only semi-occasionally.
          
          
            PLEASANT GROVE M. E. CHURCH
            was organized by Rev. C. Harvey, in the year 1872. Among the first members were the
              said Harvey and wife, Samuel S. Smith and wife, D. D. Boyd and wife, William Vest,
              Jackson Apple and lady, and William Horton and family.
            This society had no building in which to meet for the first two years of its
              existence. In 1874, it erected a neat,. handsome church building, at a cost of $1,450.
              Dedicated by Dr. Robison.
            
            The trustees are D. D. Boyd, Hamilton Welling, and Samuel Smith.
            The first minister in charge was Samuel Lamb, followed by Freeman and John Cain; they
              by Freeman and R. H. Smith; the last of whom served till 1875, when the Fortville
              circuit was divided and the Pleasant Grove church attached to the McCordsville
              circuit. Since which time the following divines have led the flock: R. B. Powell, T.
              J. Elkin, and G. N. Philipp, the last of whom is the present minister.
          
          
            UNION CHAPEL.
            The United Brethren perfected an organization in Buck-creek township about the year
              1856, and held their meetings in private residences and log school-houses till the
              year 1858. In January of this year, Washington McConnell, Thomas Preble, and Jackson
              Price were elected by the Quarterly Conference as trustees to build a church, to be
              called Union Chapel. At this time, D. Stoner was presiding Elder and Thomas Evans
              preacher in charge. The circuit was called Pleasant View, and belonged to White River
              Conference.
            The first sermon preached in the building was on Christmas evening, 1858. On the
              following day (Christmas) the funeral of John Underwood, senior, who donated the
              ground on which the church stood, was preached.
            Meetings have been continuously sustained since its organization, notwithstanding the
              building was burned in 1880.
            The circuit has been presided over from time to time by the following Elders:
            
              A. King,
              A. E. Evans,
              J. Myers,
              A. Hanway,
              John Vardeman,
              R. B. Beatty,
              Wm. Nichols,
              Halleck Floyd,
              R. B. Beatty,
              W. Wit,
              W. C. Day,
              Lewis Crawford,
              D. O. Ferrell,
              Halleck Floyd,
              J. Pruner,
              Milton Wright,
              M. Cabrich,
              W. C. Day,
              D. Stoner,
              Thomas Evans,
              Alexander Carrol,
              
              C. Smith,
              A. B. Dary,
              William Hall,
              P. S. Cook,
              Alexander Carrol,
              Monroe Gronendike,
              Thomas Evans,
              Amos Hanway,
              T. H. Halstead,
              A. E. Evans,
              D. Stoner,
              J. M. Ware,
              D. Stoner,
              Thomas Evans,
              A. Davis,
              Simon B. Irvin,
              Henry K. Muth,
            
            The preachers in charge for the time were William Gossett, Irvin Cox, A. C. Rice, I.
              Tharp, and Henry Huffman. I. Tharp preached but one sermon till he was thrown from his
              sulky and had his leg broken, and Henry Huffman finished out his term.
            The present Elder is Milton M. Wright, and the minister in charge F. M. Demunbren.
              The charge is attached to the Warrington circuit.
            The more marked revivals were during F. Evan's first year, T. H. Halstead's ministry;
              and William Gossett's supervision, when there was quite an ingathering of souls.
            This society was doubtless established through the instrumentality of J. B. Collins,
              local preacher, since gone to his long home, and of precious memory to many.
            [We are indebted for the above facts to James H. Murphy, an obliging, Christian
              gentleman.]
          
          
            JOHN D. HOPKINS,
            an exceedingly eccentric man, came to Hancock county about the year 1843, and built a
              pole shanty in the woods of Buck-creek, about four by seven feet, covered it with
              dirt, and daubed it inside thoroughly to the exclusion of all light and air, save at
              the small entrance, about fifteen inches wide and five feet long, which was closed by
              a single blue board called a door. The furniture consisted of a rude stool, on which
              he sat, made by his own hands; a primitive writing table, at which he spent much of
              his time; and a small sheet-iron stove, which he carried on his shoulder from
              Richmond, Indiana, and at the same time, under his arm, the fancy door for his
              contemplated rustic home.
            Mr. Hopkins was a single man, and lived alone, not so 
              much from choice, perhaps, as from force of circumstances. Physically, he was large,
              strong, and vigorous, weighed two hundred pounds and upwards, of florid complexion,
              and had sandy hair, inclined to redness. Mentally, he was truly sui
                generis, loved sport, courted flattery, inclined to poetry, and imagined
              himself the "preacher, poet, orator and philosopher of the age." He spent much of his
              time in writing hymns, poems, and political songs, which he would sing on seasonable
              occasions. He has been denominated a monomaniac on the, subject of religion. He termed
              himself a "good gathering preacher," and did finally succeed in gathering a half dozen
              or more joiners in the township to his little band, which he termed "The good
              gathering army." To this little "army" he preached for some time, composing his own
              hymns and texts, never adopting anything, knowingly, from even the best authors. Of
              him it may truly be said that he was never guilty of plagiarism. His poetry was not
              classic nor polished by any means, nor was it faultless in meter and figure; but was
              like much of the early spring poetry, mere doggeral.
            He courted a certain prominent young widow of energy and means and portly appearance,
              and for a time apparently received some encouragement, which prompted him to compose a
              number of songs expressive of his feelings relative thereto.
            During the political campaigns he was especially an object of interest. For ten cents
              he would make either a whig or democratic speech, it was immaterial which. Indeed, for
              a dime he would make a public speech on the street on a goods-box, or any public place
              outside of a house, on any subject, political, religious, or scientific, or sing a
              campaign song, adapted to either party, or sing a "sabie song," which was one of his
              love effusions. After singing one of his ballads, he would pass through the audience
              and offer them for sale. A single dime would pay the bill for the entire lot, which he
              had been at the trouble and expense of having-printed.
            
            In dress Mr. H. was not less odd than in other respects. He seldom wore a hat, coat,
              or boots, save in the coldest weather, and his pants he had usually rolled up to the
              knees. He was exceedingly strong and active, and preferred jumping a fence to opening
              a gate. Mr. Samuel Harden says that he saw him, a few years since, in Anderson, and
              invited him home with him for dinner, which he accepted, ate heartily, took his
              departure, and leaped over the fence rather than open the gate, though it was
              convenient and in good working order.
            The last seen of Mr. H., in Greenfied, was about three years since. Of his present
              whereabouts we are not reliably informed. We heard that he was located in Missouri, on
              a good farm of his own, doing well, which, if true, he will probably remain there for
              some time.
            The chorus to one of his songs used to run thus: 
                
                  "John D. Hopkins always remains the longest
                  Where the pot boils the strongest."
                
              
          
          
            JOSHUA SHELBY
            is a native of Union county, Indiana, and dates his earthly career to June 16, 1815.
              He is the oldest son of Joshua Shelby, sen., who came to Sugar Creek township in 1835,
              and died there in 1839.
            The subject of this sketch was married to Nancy Dunn, sister of Wm. A. Dunn, in 1839,
              who was also an early settler. He served in the capacity of trustee and justice of the
              peace in his township for six years-two in the former and four in the latter. He was
              elected county sheriff in 1852, over G. W. Sample, a popular candidate, and after
              serving thirteen months, he resigned for the more congenial, healthful pursuit of
              agriculture. He is a fearless, staunch democrat; but as a whig was elected to the
              above office.
            Mr. Shelby and his amiable companion were pioneers in the wild woods of early Buck
              Creek, and, as such, endured many privations and hardships incident to pioneer  life. The following are the names of their children:
              Catharine F., Samuel N., Sarah J., Lydia, Elvira and John F., six in all.
            Mr. Shelby is not a member of any church, for reasons best known to himself. Though
              rough in speech and exterior, he is social, kind-hearted and well disposed.
          
          
            GEORGE W. PARKER, ESQ.
            was born November 13, 1842. He was married to Mary C. Coleman (whose parents came
              from South Carolina), January 7, 1866. Mr. P. was elected to the office of justice of
              the peace in 1872, and held the position for eight years, with general satisfaction to
              his fellow citizens. Mr. P. is also a teacher of some considerable experience in the
              schools of his township, and prides himself on being an unflinching democrat. Mr. P.
              is especially possessed of I the distinguishing characteristics of the family industry
              and economy, and has, thereby, succeded in accumulating considerable means for a young
              man, owning a fine farm under a good state of cultivation. The following are his
              children's names: Clinton, Dora A., Mary J., and William; four in all.
          
          
            SHADRACH H. ARNETT
            was born September 3, 1819, in Franklin county, Indiana. He came to this county with
              his father, William Arnett, in 1831, and settled in Buck-creek township, where he
              lived, bearing a good name, till his death, which occurred February 13, 1879. His last
              remains peacefully rest beneath a stately monument erected by loving hands. The
              deceased was an active, influential member of the Masonic order, in which he took the
              greatest delight. Early in life he was a member of the Baptist Church; but at the time
              of his death was not associated with any religious order. Mr. A. filled creditably the
              office of trustee for several years; and, also, that of "enrolling officer" during the
              late civil war. By industry, good habits, and 
              
                SHADRACH H. ARNETT.
              
               economy, he succeeded in acquiring a large estate. In
              appearance Mr. A. was large, portly and athletic, weighing two hundred pounds, and of
              fair complexion. Unto his kind oversight were committed the following children: Sarah
              A., Mary, Isabelle, Elizabeth, Lucinda, and William H. His widow, still living,
              resides on the old homestead.
          
          
            JOSEPH WRIGHT,
            a distant relative of Ex-Governor Joseph Wright, is a native of the "Keystone State,"
              beginning his earthly career in 1810, December 27. He came in early youth with his
              parents to Butler county, Ohio, where he remained a few years; thence to Wayne county,
              Indiana, where he remained till the year 1832, when he was married to Elizabeth
              Stephens, of that county, and afterwards removed to Buck-creek township, Hancock
              county, Indiana, where he has since resided. Mr. Wright is the father of Auditor Henry
              and Deputy Auditor William M. Wright. He served in the capacity of justice of the
              peace in his township for twenty years. When Mr. W. first came to the township it was
              one vast wilderness, inhabited by wild animals; but by determined hands and a strong
              will he has succeeded in making a commendable transformation. Amid all these changes
              and vicissitudes of life. Mr. W. has been encouraged and strengthened by the companion
              of his bosom, a noble woman. God bless her! Mr. W. is an uncompromising democrat, yet
              accords to others what he claims for himself, the right to vote his sentiments. He is
              a member of the Masonic fraternity, and no good brother ever knocks at his door
              without receiving admittance. Unto him were born the following children: John W.,
              Mary, Henry, Isom S., Celia, and William M.; all of whom are still living, save John
              W. and Celia.
          
          
            BARZILLA G. JAY
            was a native of North Carolina, born in 1794, where he lived till 1837. In 1822 he
              was united in the holy bonds  of wedlock to Miss Jane
              McCullough, of the same state. In company with his companion he emigrated to Hancock
              county, Indiana, and settled in Buck-creek township, in 1837. Mr. J. was from birth
              and education a democrat unwavering; and, as such, was elected to the office of county
              auditor in 1855, which position he held creditably and satisfactorily for four years.
              Mr. Jay also served as justice of the peace for some years, with credit to his
              judgment and good sense. He was a man of firm character, honest and conscientious, and
              was an influential member of the Masonic order, by which he was buried June 17, 1860,
              at the Hodge cemetery, in Buck-creek township, where, by his side, the companion of
              his life was laid in February, 1876. His children were Eliza A., Mary J., Margaret C.,
              John H., Martha A., James W., Susan F., and Amanda A.
          
          
            MACEDONIA CHURCH
            of United Brethren was organized, about the year 1860, on the land of William
              Shaffer, but was afterwards moved farther south, on the opposite side of the road,
              where it now stands. The society was organized by Thomas Evans, followed by Rev.
              Hanway.
            The following were among its first members: John and Isabelle Parker, Isaac Wilson,
              Thomas Price, James Wilson and wife, William and Margaret Wilson, Lewis Barnard, Mary
              Barnard, James Wallace, Sarah A. Wallace, and Cynthia Barnard.
            The following are the present trustees: John Parker, James Wilson, and Thomas
              Price.
            The society is not very strong in numbers, and have services only once a month. The
              house is a log, and wholly insufficient for the demands of the audience and the times,
              and the society contemplate building, at an early date, a new house near the residence
              of G. W. Parker.
          
          
            LORENZO DOW.
            Last, but not least, of the prominent men and remarkable  characters of this historic township is that of the Rev. Lorenzo Dow. Not until
              recently, when the dusty records and the earliest inhabitants were being consulted for
              material out of which to make this history, and some of the discoveries were made
              public through the paper, was it known but by a few that this truly pious, eccentric,
              and remarkable man ever set foot on Hancock's fertile soil, or owned land within her
              borders; but such is the the case. A. T. Hart and, possibly, others testify to having
              heard him preach in Greenfield. R. A. Smith says his father heard him in Rush county.
              Dow, in his journal before us, which we have twice read, speaks of passing through the
              "New Purchase,"* and of being
              next at Louisville, Ky.
            The "entry book" in the recorder's office shows that Lorenzo Dow, in 1826, May 8,
              entered the north-west quarter of section thirty-five, in township sixteen north, in
              range five east, containing one hundred and sixty acres. This was then, of course, a
              part of Madison county. The land is now located in the south-west part of Buck-creek
              township, section thirty-five, of which it forms a part, being the corner section. The
              land is now owned by Spencer Huntington, and lies on the Marion county line. Dow died
              in Georgetown, D. C., February 2, 1834, and his second wife, Lucy Dow, on the 13th day
              of December, 1838, deeded the same land to Hector H. Hall, and in the deed says: "It
              is the same land owned by my deceased husband, the Rev. Lorenzo Dow, situated in
              Hancock county."
            It is authoritatively reported that Dow lived on his new entry for a short time; and
              a place is pointed out in a certain bank, about ten or twelve feet high, on the farm
              where Dow dug a cave and spent a portion of one season.
            Auditor Wright says he has authority for saying that a number of children in the
              vicinity were named Lorenzo D. in honor and memory of him, occasioned by said
              residence.
            *This section of country
              was at that date termed the "New Purchase."
            
            History is full of apparent contradictions, which are often, difficult to explain
              owing to our lack of sufficient information. I well remember a glaring contradiction
              in U. S. History which claimed my attention while pursuing the study. One author
              stated that there were one hundred of the Puritan Fathers on the May Flower, and
              another asserting that she bore up a precious cargo of one hundred and one souls. Why
              this discrepancy? I queried, there being no note of a death; and I determined to look
              it up. A number of authors were examined before I discovered the explanation which
              harmonized the statements of the apparently conflicting authors. The number was one
              hundred on starting, but on the way was increased to one hundred and one; and I have
              since had the pleasure of seeing the cradle in which that extra pilgrim was rocked on
              the briny deep. I first read Dow's journal in the backwoods of Arkansas about thirteen
              years ago, and then observed a little laughable contradiction, which I am still unable
              to satisfactorily explain. Lorenzo Dow, on page 212 of his "Journal," says he and
              Peggy were married on September 3, 1804. Peggy Dow, in her "Journey of Life," 12th.
              edition, page 610, says that she and Lorenzo were married late in the evening on
              September 4, 1804. The query is how that could be. Future generations in Hancock
              county may be equally puzzled over the real cost of our present jail and sheriff's
              residence. The records show that it was contracted to be built for $32,900. We say
              that it cost $75,000; but it has otherwise gone down in history as costing over
              $100,000. Why this discrepancy? Possibly owing to adding interest to the original cost
              in one case and not doing so in the other.
            After fully examining and weighing all the evidence, parol and written, we are of the
              opinion that the veritable Lorenzo Dow twice preached in Greenfield, and entered land
              in Hancock county, which, after his death, there being no other legal heirs, his wife
              deeded to said Hector H. Hall.
            Lorenzo Dow was in many respects a most remarkable 
              man. Though physically slender and frail, his indomitable will and wonderful zeal
              spurred him on to the accomplishment of more work than is seldom ever allotted to one
              man to perform. Though he was a public preacher less than forty years, it is probable
              that more persons heard the gospel from his lips than from any other divine since the
              days of Whitfield. He traveled extensively in England and Ireland, and repeatedly
              visited almost every portion of the United States. He wrote a number of books and
              lectures, and particularly a history of his own life, so singularly eventful and full
              of vicissitudes. He would have a thousand appointments out at one time. On a certain
              occasion he was speaking from a pine stump, I think, in North Carolina, when he
              announced that in one year from that day, at that hour, he would (God permitting)
              preach from the stump on which he was standing. Time rolled on, and when the appointed
              hour arrived, notwithstanding a thousand appointments were to be filled in the
              meantime in accordance with promise, he was standing on the identical pine stump
              preaching to a large audience.
            Dow was a Methodist in principle, and though not a member, was held in high esteem by
              many who knew him best and acknowledged his loyalty to truth and honesty of purpose.
              He was exceedingly conscientious, and though very poor and often wanting for the
              necessaries of life he repeatedly refused handsome sums of money tendered him by his
              admiring hearers and children in the gospel for fear of its being a stumbling block in
              his way, and thereby retarding the progress of the gospel. He was very eccentric in
              dress, manners, and style of preaching, which attracted much attention, while his
              shrewdness and quick discernment of character gave him a wonderful influence over the
              masses that daily assembled to hear him. Some supposed him possessed of supernatural
              powers, even to the discernment of thought and the "raising of the devil." It is
              recorded of him that at one time, when he was traveling in the south, he asked
              permission to remain over night. The woman of the house informed him that, as her
              husband  was not at home, she could not accommodate him.
              As was unusual with him, he insisted, as there were no houses near, the country being
              sparsely settled. But she positively refused till he told her that he was a preacher,
              and would sleep in the stable, if he could do no better. This information, together
              with his long hair and odd dress, suggested to her who he was, and she inquired if he
              were not Lorenzo Dow. Being answered in the affirmative, she waived her objections and
              decided that he might stay; probably more out of fear that evil might befall her than
              through any real desire to have him in the house. Mr. Dow put up with her for the
              night, and at the usual hour retired in a back room, where he had not long been till
              he heard a man arrive, whom he soon discovered was not the woman's husband. A series
              of jokes passed between the two, which continued with a good deal of pleasantry till
              about midnight, when a rap at the door announced the arrival of the husband. Surprise,
              alarm, and consternation followed. There was but one door to the rude house, and at it
              stood the husband seeking admittance. To be caught there at that unseasonable hour of
              the night, without a valid excuse, would possibly create suspicion, and at least
              secure him a sound threshing. To escape seemed impossible. Just at this critical
              juncture, when the boasted ingenuity of man failed, the quick perception of woman, as
              in most cases of emergency, found an expedient. Near the foot of the bed stood a large
              gum half full of raw cotton, in which she hurriedly buried the visitor; then, as
              composedly and calm as a June morning, turned around and admitted her husband. But his
              lordship had been to the grog-shop, and, in, his own conceit, was wise and wiry.
              "Hush, hush," said the wife, as the husband blundered in and roared out: "Thunder and
              potatoes, Mag, and why didn't you open the door?" "Hush, my dear, hush ! Lorenzo Dow
              is in the house." "Oh, blood and tobacco ! and is it Lorenzo Dow, the man who raises
              the devil?" "Sure it is; and why don't you be still?" "Oh, by Saint Patrick, he shall
              come forth,  and you shall see the devil before you
              sleep!" So, blundering into the bed-room, Mr. Dow was compelled to come forth; and
              nothing would satisfy the husband but that Lorenzo must raise the devil. Mr. Dow
              protested, and urged his inability to perform such wonders; but no excuse would
              satisfy the determined, uncompromising husband. He had heard that Dow could raise the
              devil, and now, that he had him in his house, nothing would satisfy him but that he
              must do it. Finally, Mr. Dow consented on the condition that his lordship "stand at
              the door and deal him a few good thumps as he shall pass forth, but not so hard as to
              break his bones." This his lordship agreed to do, and stationed himself accordingly.
              All things now ready, Lorenzo, taking the candle in his hand and walking up and down
              in the room, touching it quickly to the dry cotton, said: "COME FORTH
                OLD BOY!" when out jumped the hidden sinner all in a blaze, and breaking for
              the door, a living mass of fire, made good his exit; but not without a sound blow over
              the shoulder from the husband's cudgel. The job was now complete. Lorenzo had raised
              the devil, and the husband thought it a supernatural performance by the eccentric
              Yankee preacher.
            As a further illustration of his influence over the people and their firm faith in
              his supernatural powers, we will give, in brief, the story of the "Cock and the Dinner
              Pot." One night after Mr. Dow had retired to bed after a hard day's travel in
              Virginia, a crowd assembled in the barroom of the inn to enjoy their revelries, as was
              the custom in those times in that part of the country. Toward the "wee small hours" of
              the morning it was announced that one of the company had lost his pocket-book, and a
              search was immediately proposed. Whereupon the landlord remarked that Lorenzo Dow was
              in the house, and that if the money was there he knew he could find it. Accordingly
              Lorenzo was rudely called forth from his warm bed to try his powers in finding the
              lost treasure He first inquired if any of the party had left since the money was lost;
              and being informed in the negative, then said Lorenzo 
              to the landlord: "Go and bring me your large dinner pot." This created no little
              surprise; but as supernatural powers were universally conceded, his directions were
              unhesitatingly obeyed, and the pot was brought and set in the middle of the room.
              "Now," said Lorenzo, "go and bring the old chicken-cock from the roost." This was
              accordingly done, and the pot was turned over the cock. "Now," said Lorenzo, "let the
              doors be locked and the lights extinquished." Which being done, he said: "Every person
              in the room must now rub his hands hard against the pot, and when the guilty hand
              touches the cock will crow." Accordingly all came forward and rubbed, or pretended to
              rub, the pot; but no cock crew. "Let the candles now be lighted," said Lorenzo; "there
              is no guilty person here." "If the man ever had any money he must have lost it some
              place else. "But stop," said Lorenzo, when all things were prepared, "let us now
              examine the hands." This was the essential part of the arrangement. An examination was
              instituted, when it was discovered that one man had not rubbed against the pot. The
              others' hands were all black with the soot of the pot, as proof of their innocence.
              "There," said Lorenzo, pointing to the man with clean hands, "there
              is the man who picked your pockets!" The guilty one seeing his detection, at once
              acknowledged his crime, and gave up the money.
            Numerous' other interesting circumstances are related tending to show the ingenuity
              of the man and his insight into human nature, but we will not take time to rehearse
              them. Much of the oddity and eccentricity of Dow was the result of necessity,
              especially that part belonging to his dress: much of it was natural and in accordance
              with constitutional make, and a part was, doubtless, designed, and aided in the
              accomplishment of his great object in life. He lived to be fifty-seven years old,
              thirty-nine of which he spent in the public ministry.
            Hancock county may well be proud in claiming him as one of her citizens, and the
              reader may reasonably  excuse the writer for occupying a
              little extra space in giving this biographical sketch.
            Since the above was written, we have received an 'interesting letter from Judge
              Hector H. Hall, of Indianapolis, formerly of this county, in answer to a letter of
              inquiry in reference to various disputed points pertaining to Dow, which we insert in
              full.

                    "Gentlemen: I received your letter of inquiry in reference
                      to Lorenzo Dow, and in reply I send you a copy of his will, taken from the
                      records of New London county, Connecticut.
                    "I bought one hundred and sixty acres of land from Lucy Dow, second wife of
                      Lorenzo Dow. Peggy Dow was his first wife. Dow never lived on the land, but
                      had twenty acres deadened. I had the twenty acres grubbed after I bought it,
                      the first work done by me. Dow built no mill that I ever heard of. In the same
                      section a man by the name of Lawson lived one winter, and slept in one half of
                      a hollow log. Lawson afterwards traded the land for a saw-mill on Sugar Creek,
                      near Philadelphia, subsequently called Black's Mill, I believe. Many of these
                      books of which you speak (L. Dow's works) I understood were in the possession
                      of John Givens, of Indianapolis, now deceased. Givens paid the taxes on the
                      land before I bought the same of Lucy Dow.
                    "'L. Dow' was marked on the beech trees near the four corners of the land. I
                      think it was the only land owned by him in the west at the time of his death.
                      The trees have all since died or been cut down.

          CHAPTER X. CENTER TOWNSHIP.
          
            MAP OF CENTER TOWNSHIP.
            SHOWING THE SECTIONS, TOWNSHIP, AND RANGES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED.
          
          
          THIS township derived its name from the central location which it occupied. Being
            partially bounded by all the townships save Brown, it was very appropriately named
            Center. The original Center township was named and organized in the year 1831, just
            three years after the organization of the county.
          At the date of organization Center was composed of eighteen sections, being in extent
            six miles east and west and three miles north and south, and was, therefore, the
            smallest township in the county.*
            In the year 1835 Center township was increased from eighteen to twenty-four sections, by
            taking one tier of sections from the north of Brandywine and adding to the south of
            Center. This size it retained for eighteen years, or till the year 1853, at which time
            Harrison township and a part of Union and Worth were added to it, bringing it up to its
            present size of fifty-four sections, and making it by far the largest township in the
            county. From 1853 to the present there has been no change in the geographical outline of
            the township.
          In extent it is eight miles north and south and seven miles east and west, and would,
            therefore, contain fifty-six sections were it a perfect rectangle; but the two sections.
            wanting in the south-east corner to make it such belong to Blue-river. It is bounded on
            the north by Vernon and Green townships, on the east by Jackson and Blue-river, on the
            south by Brandywine and Blue-river, and on the west by Sugar-creek and Buck-creek. It is
            located in townships fifteen and sixteen north and in ranges six and seven east.
            Township line sixteen passes through the court-house, and township line seventeen forms
            the northen boundary. All that portion south of the court-house is in township fifteen
            north, and the remainder of the township in sixteen north. Two tiers of sections on the
            western portion of the township are in range six east, and the remainder in seven east.
            Range line seven, which thus *See map on p. 89 for size of Center from 1831 to 1835.
             divides the township, is located at the second cross
            roads west of Greenfield, and divides the M. T. Willett farm, and is found in the center
            of the first road west of the S. T. Dickerson farm.
          Surface, Soil, Drainage, and Productions.—The surface is
            generally level, and especially in the central northern and central eastern portions and
            several sections north-west of Greenfield. Along the streams in places it is slightly
            hilly, and for a short distance back undulating.
          This township once contained considerable third rate land as well as first and second;
            but since being cleared, ditched and cut up with good roads there is reported but little
            third rate land.
          For the last few years much attention has been given to tile ditching, and under the
            recent ditch laws a number of public ditches have been put through the flat, swampy
            portions, whereby hundreds of acres have been reclaimed.
          The chief productions are corn, wheat, oats, flax, hogs, horses, cattle, Irish
            potatoes, and the products of the forest and factory. In 1880 she produced 113,004
            bushels of wheat, 163,625 bushels of corn, and 10,740 bushels of oats; being on an
            averave per acre equal with the best in wheat and corn, and excelled in oats only by
            Sugar-creek and Blue-river. For the same year she reported 1,669 tons of hay, 1,140
            bushels of Irish potatoes, and 7,000 pounds of tobacco. Center produces more tobacco
            than all the rest of the county.
          Streams, Names and Location.—Sugar Creek enters the township on
            the north line, about one and three-fourth miles east of the north-west corner, and
            flows south by south-west, passing out through section twenty-six, about three and a
            fourth miles north of the south-west corner.
          Brandywine enters the township on the east line, one and one-half miles south of the
            north-east corner, flows south-west a half mile; then north-west one and one-half miles;
            thence south-west to the south-west corner of section sixteen; thence south, running
            east of Greenfield, and passing out of the township on the John Hinchman farm.
          
          Little Brandywine rises near the center of section fourteen, in the central eastern
            portion of the township, and flows south-west and empties into Big Brandywine a half
            mile west of the bridge spanning it north-west and near Hinchman's old residence.
          Little Sugar Creek rises in the south-west part of the township and flows south,
            passing out about a mile east of the south-west corner.
          Swamp Creek, which is simply a slough, enters the township on the east half of the
            north line of section four and flows nearly due south two and one-half miles, and is,
            for the time, lost in Brandywine.
          First Entry and Early Settlers.—The first entries of land in
            Center township were in the south-east part, in sections four and nine, by Platt
            Montgomery, Robert Burton, Isaac Roberts, and David Vangilder. The first entry was made
            September 12, 1821, by Platt Montgomery, being the east half of the south-east quarter
            of section nine, in township fifteen north, in range seven east, and is now owned by
            Levi Elsberry's heirs and Abram Hackleman. The second entry was the eighty-acre tract on
            which Wesley Addison lives, entered by Robert Burton May 10, 1822. The third entry, by
            Isaac Roberts, on July 12, 1822, forms a part of the Marion Steele farm. The fourth was
            by David Vangilder, the west half of the north-west quarter of section nine
            aforesaid.
          The first settlements in this township by the whites were made about the year 1819,
            from one to two miles south-east of where Greenfield now stands. Among the first
            settlers were Platt Montgomery, Corda Glandon, Samuel B. Jackson; Moses, David, and
            Abraham Vangilder; Jeremiah Meek and his two sons, Cornwell and Joshua; John and William
            Carr, Benjamin Spillman, Elisha Chapman, Jared Chapman, Joseph and Henry Chapman;
            Morris, Harry and Ovid Pierson; John and William Justice, Lydia Jones, James Hamilton,
            and John Wingfield. Samuel B. Jackson was the first tavern-keeper, holding forth in a
            log house said to be the same house now standing south of the  flax factory. He left the country under a cloud of suspicion, being accused
            of killing one of his guests, who was traveling through the state on the National road,
            supposed to have considerable money, and was never seen nor heard of after stopping with
            Jackson. Jeremiah Meek is said to have been the first settler in Greenfield. Cornwell
            Meek was a stock trader and dry goods merchant. Joshua Meek was recorder for twenty
            years. Joseph Chapman was a prominent public man, a fuller account of whom appears
            elsewhere. James Hamilton was a prosperous merchant, the father of Moses W. Hamilton.
            John Wingfield and Benjamin Spillman were two of the donors of the original plat of
            Greenfield.
          First Preacher, Birth, Death, etc.—The first preacher in the
            township was Moses Vangilder, a Methodist exhorter. The first physician, Jared Chapman.
            Jared C. Meek was the first child born in Greenfield. The first death in Greenfield was
            a daughter of Benjamin Spillman. The first blacksmith was William Rice. The first church
            was the M. E. The first grocery store was kept by John Justice, and the first general
            store was kept by W. O. Ross.
          Mills and Factories.—The first mill in the township was built
            in 1825, by William Pierson, on Sugar Creek, five miles north-west of Greenfield. It
            ground corn and wheat, and had a bolt to run by water. This mill burned down in
            1846.
          The next mill in the territory under consideration was built by William Curry, six
            miles north by north-east of Greenfield, in the year 1835, and was used to grind corn
            and wheat, and had a bolt worked by hand.
          Isaac Willett built a mill on Sugar Creek, near Cedar Grove church, four miles
            north-west of Greenfield, in 1838. This was a grist-mill with a bolt to run by water. It
            continued in operation till after 1850.
          The first steam saw-mill in the township was built in the year 1848 by Captain J. R.
            Bracken and John Templin, and located in the eastern part of Greenfield, a few rods
            south-west of the Hancock Flouring Mills. The first 
            engineer was Major A. K. Branham. In 1852, the weather-boarding and roof were burned
            off. The frame was saved. This mill cut a quantity of the lumber for the plank road in
            1852. It was a sash saw-mill.
          Benjamin Cox erected, in the southern part of Greenfield, about 1860, a steam saw-mill,
            which is still in operation; but recently removed to the south-west part of the
            city.
          About 1862, a circular saw-mill was erected south-east of the old depot, which was run
            a few years and then moved away. About the same date was erected a steam circular
            saw-mill about three miles east of Greenfield, on the railroad, which did an extensive
            business for a number of years.
          In 1869 G. W. Curtis & Bro. erected a steam saw-mill two and one-half miles from
            Greenfield, on the Lysander Sparks farm, which was run about three years, when it was
            moved three and one-half miles north of Greenfield, on the west side of the Greenfield
            and Pendleton pike. Here it was burned down and rebuilt in 1878, where it is still in
            operation.
          Aaron Little, a few years since, built a circular saw-mill six miles north-west of
            Greenfield, which has recently been moved to Buck-creek.
          The first tanyard in the township was erected by Henry Chapman, in the bottom north of
            the stone culvert on the National road, in the east part of town, in the early history
            of the county. It did an extensive business for the time. Chapman sold to Samuel Henry,
            who soon formed a partnership with Nathan Crawford, who, after running it successfully
            for a time, sold to A. T. Hart. Hart conveyed to Randall & Milton. Randall sold to
            Milton, in whose hands it went down. H. B. Wilson, P. M., run a tannery in Greenfield
            from 1865 to 1873.
          In 1855 there was erected in Greenfield, in the south-west part, a steam flouring mill
            by Nathan Crawford, Samuel Longinaker and Freeman H. Crawford, which continued in
            successful operation till about 1860, when it  was burned
            down. After a lapse of a few years it was rebuilt by a Mr. Chaney. It soon passed into
            the hands of Hiram Woods, during whose ownership it was burned in July, 1869, and soon
            rebuilt. It is now owned and run by Alexander, New & Boots, and has recently been
            refitted and supplied with the modern improvements and adapted to the manufacture of the
            "new process."
          In 1872 Joseph Boots, J. B. Fouch, and Samuel E. Gapen erected a steam flouring mill,
            now known as the "Hancock Mills," owned and run at present by Nelson Bradley and W. G.
            Scott under the firm name of Scott & Co. Gapen sold his interest to the other two
            partners, Boots and Fouch. After a time Fouch sold to Smith and Hogle, and they to
            Nelson Bradley in 1874. Boots conveyed his interest to W. G. Scott in 1878.
          The steam planing-mill and furniture factory of Williams Brothers & Hamilton,
            located in the south part of the city of Greenfield, was erected in 1870, by H. J. and
            A. P. Williams, and run for a time, when Moses W. Hamilton bought an interest, and the
            new firm continues the same to this date.
          In 1876, the desk factory and planing-mill of G. W. Puterbaugh was erected by A. E.
            Teal and George W. Puterbaugh, in the south-west part of the city, and run for three
            years under the firm name of Teal & Puterbaugh, when Teal conveyed to Puterbaugh,
            the present proprietor.
          F. M. Gilchrist, in 1876, built, in the south-east part of the city, a desk factory and
            planing-mill, which he operated till 1879, when he conveyed to J. E. Brown, the present
            proprietor. During the present summer Brown was burned out; but has recently rebuilt,
            with an addition of a saw-mill.
          In 1875 Cammack & Sons started a flax factory in a two-story brick building in the
            eastern part of the city, erected through the enterprise of William S. Wood, and owned
            and controlled by the Hancock Manufacturing Association. This factory, like nearly all
            others ever started in the county, met with the misfortune of being burned;  but was soon rebuilt, but not to its former height. It is
            now owned and controlled by Henry L. Moore & Son.
          Gordon & Son, about 1877, built a steam saw-mill in the south-west part of
            Greenfield, which is still in operation.
          In 1876 George Newhall erected a steam saw and planing mill south of the railroad, in
            the west part of town. It run two or three years, when it met with the common fate of
            such mills, and was never rebuilt.
          Charles Cammack established a heading factory in 1880, run by steam-power furnished by
            Puterbaugh's engine, which did an extensive business till the summer of 1881, when it
            was stealthily removed between two days by parties from Anderson claiming ownership
            thereto. Prall & Puterbaugh, in the summer of 1881, attached a second heading
            machine, which is doing a lively business.
          In 1868 a woolen factory was built by Morris Pierson, and located south of the
            railroad, opposite the old depot, and was successfully operated for a time by Craig
            & Minick, and then by Scofield, when it met the common fate and succumbed to the
            flames; and, unfortunately for the farmers and wool-growers of the county, was never
            rebuilt. Roads.—Center township, in her early history, had no
            roads, but what were used as such were mere paths. The first road in the county was the
            old State road; the next was the National road, which was laid out prior to the location
            of the town of Greenfield. But the first good road, as an improvement over the dirt and
            corduroy, was the National plank road, built by a company in 1852. Prior to the "late
            unpleasantness" there was not a single gravel road in the township; but since that time
            Greenfield has been made the focal point from which radiate finished gravel pikes to all
            the cardinal, and even sub-cardinal, points of the compass. She has at this date twenty
            and one-half miles of toll pike and fourteen miles of non-tollable, ten and one-half
            miles of which were once corporation roads, but have recently surrendered their
            charters. For a few years after the war a wonderful stride was taken in the improvement
            of roads. Under the recent free pike  law two gravel pikes
            are now being built in the township, viz.: the Fortville pike and the Frost pike.
          Railroads.—Center township has two railroads crossing her
            territory. The P., C. and St. L. has a line seven miles within and along her borders,
            valued at $51,310, and pays a tax of $677.66 in the township and $180.91 in Greenfield.
            The I., B. and W. has a line of seven and one-half miles, not yet taxed, now completed.
            Each road has a station in the township. Greenfield is on the former, and the Junction
            on the latter.
          Educational.—Close on the heels of the first settlers of the
            territory were the industrious, stern pedagogues characteristic of the times. Though our
            forefathers often suffered for the essentials of life, and had few of the luxuries,
            nevertheless they fain would have at least some of the rudiments of an English
            education. Perhaps the first school taught in the township was in a diminutive pole
            cabin, which stood on a knoll south of the railroad, between the two cemeteries. The
            second stood on the spot now occupied by the Vanwie house, owned by Thomas Carr; the
            third on or near the Rardin vacant lots, and north of Tindall's livery stable. The first
            frame school-house in the town was built contemporary with the plank road in 1852. It
            was finally sold to the Catholic church, and now, enlarged and repaired, and located on
            the old grounds, it forms their place of worship. From this time on small frames began
            to take the place of the rude, floorless "make shifts " heretofore occupied for school
            purposes. The writer once heard the late Milton B. Hopkins speak of receiving his first
            lessons in the English rudiments in one of those primitive floorless school-houses in
            this township during an exceedingly cold winter.
          Among the first "masters" and "school-marms" of the town were Mrs. L. S. Church,
            Caroline Depu, Mr. Coy, Mr. McCoy and a Mr. Fisher. The first teacher in the north part
            of the township (then Harrison township) was Joseph Anderson, who held forth in an old
            deserted residence on William Martin's farm. His terms were rather  high for the times, being $1.50 per term or quarter, owing to his boarding
            himself, being a married man. His pay he took in money, trade and promises, and on the
            latter he failed to realize encouragingly.

              JAMES K. KING.
            
          
          Value of School Houses and Apparatus.—Center township has
            sixteen school-houses, five brick and eleven frame, valued at $9,600, including grounds,
            furniture and out-buildings. Her maps, charts, globes and other apparatus are valued at
            $400. Total value of school .property in the township, exclusive of the city, $10,000.
            In Greenfield, the school realty is valued at $20,000 and the apparatus at $200; total,
            $20,200.
          Scholastic Population.—The scholastic population of Center, for
            1853, was 498; for 1860, 752; in 1870, 754; in 1880, 753 For Greenfield, for the last
            three decades, the figures were respectively 351, 417, 653.
          Township Trustees.—The following are the names of the trustees,
            with the time of their appointment, since 1859, at which time the office assumed some
            dignity and importance:
          
            John Foster59
            John H. White61
            William Frost62
            Robert Barr63
            J. W. Walker64
            William F. Pratt68
            S. T. Dickerson70
            James McClarnon74
            William Potts78
            Robert D. Cooper80
          
          Remarks: John Foster, a portrait and sketch of whom appear elsewhere, had the honor of
            being not only the first sheriff of the county, but the first trustee also under the new
            regime. He was re-elected, and consequently held the office for two years, the term of
            office for a number of years being but one year. White, Frost and Barr each ruled right
            royally for one year. J. W. Walker, S. T. Dickerson and James McClarnon each looked
            after the poor and pedagogues for four years. Robert D. Cooper holds the purse strings
            at this date.
          Churches.—Center township and the city of Greenfield are
            reasonably well supplied with churches, the former having six, viz.: four Methodist and
            two Baptist, and the latter one Methodist Episcopal, one Presbyterian, one Christian,
            one Catholic, one Missionary Baptist, and one African Methodist Episcopal-six in all.
            Most of the buildings  are good frames, a few are
            substantial bricks; a more specific account of which will appear further on.
          Population.—An examination of the census reports of this
            township for a few decades shows a steady, rapid growth. Only thirty years ago, or in
            1850, she had a population of 806, and nine of which were colored; ten years later she
            reports 2,529, and seventeen colored, an increase of over 200 per cent. In 1870 she had
            a population of 3,464, and thirty-one colored. The last census gave her a total,
            including Greenfield, of 4,284, a remarkable increase of 531 per cent in thirty years.
            Greenfield, in 1860, just before the civil war, had within her corporate limits 738
            souls; in 1870, 1,173; in 1880, 2,012.
          Polls and Vote.—For 1881, Center township has 395 polls and
            Greenfield 372. Last year Center reported 373 taxable polls and Greenfield 321, a
            handsome increase at both points, and especially in Greenfield.
          Center township, for voting purposes in general elections, is divided into two
            precincts. At the first precinct, the court-house, all those citizens being legal voters
            of the city and township residing east of State street and the road extending through
            the township north and south cast their ballots; and at the second precinct, a small
            building across the street west from the court-house, those vote living west of the
            above points. The total vote of Center township for 1860 was 485; for 1870, 717; for
            1880, 1,034, with a democratic majority of 152 for 1880, the vote standing: Democratic,
            581; republican, 429; independent, 24.
          Value of Real and Personal Property.—Center township being the
            largest in the county, reports 32,290 acres of land, valued at $784,465, and
            improvements on the same same valued at $120,080, being an average of about $28.00 per
            acre. The personal property in Center, exclusive of Greenfield, is valued at $270,250.
            Value of telegraph lines in Center, $1,320. Total value of taxables in Center township,
            $1,167,900.
          Taxes.—Center township paid taxes to the amount of  $867.83 for 1842, and $6,945.66 for 1860; for 1881 she pays
            the sum of $13,666.64. The levy on each $100 is $1.12. Of this amount, levied in 1881,
            to be paid in 1882, the following men pay fifty dollars and upwards:

          Greenfield has in her corporate limits, other than lots, 251 acres of land, valued at
            $10,645; the improvements on the same are estimated at $13,775; value of lots, $177,580;
            value of improvements, $227,655; value of personal property, $355,690; value of railroad
            property in the city, $12,810; value of telegraph lines in the corporate limits,
            $270.
          
          Total taxables of Greenfield are assessed at $785,355; the levy is $1.49 on each $100.
            Greenfield was assessed for 1860, and paid in 1861, the first year that she had a
            separate duplicate, $2,071.46, and in 1870 she paid $7,979.24, a comparison of which
            with the present taxes shows a rapid stride in this direction. The total taxes assessed
            against her for 1881, payable in 1882, are $13,039.04. Of this amount the following
            persons, partnerships, and corporations pay fifty dollars and upwards, viz.:

          Remarks.—The reader will observe that in Center and  Greenfield we have given in the list of heavy tax-payers only the names of those
            paying fifty dollars and upwards, while in most of the townships we record those paying
            forty dollars and upwards. We make this difference on account of the difference in the
            levy. A man paying fifty dollars taxes in Greenfield is not assessed on as much property
            as one paying forty dollars in Buck-creek.
          Law and Esquires.—Older than the history of the county is the
            provision for the convenient adjustment of petty difficulties and grievances among the
            citizens of a township at a trifling expense to the erring parties. The township system
            for promoting justice include two officers only—a justice and constable; the former acts
            as judge and clerk, and the latter is the executive officer, and corresponds to the
            sheriff in his duties.
          The first justices acting in the territory now under consideration were Benjamin
            Spillman, Lucius Brown and O. H. Neff, all of whom served some time between the
            organization of Brandywine township and the formation of the original Center township,
            and hence were really justices of the peace in and for Brandywine township. The first
            justice of the peace for Center township proper after her organization was Joseph
            Chapman. W. O. Neff was elected in 1831, followed by Jonathan Dunbar, elected in
            1834.

             Joseph Matthews1851
          
          The above, it must be borne in mind, were the justices in Center proper during her
            twenty-two years' existence in her original diminutive size, as shown on page 89. During
            this same time the following persons served in  Harrison
            township, which now forms the northern part of Center, viz.:
          
            Isaiah Curry1831
            William Martindale1831
            John Martin1835
            William Martindale1835
            John Martin1840
            J. D. Conway1843
            John Martin1845
            J. D. Conway1848
            John Martin1850
            W. C. Walker1850
            E. B. Chittenden1851
          
          From 1853, the date of the organization of Center township into her present size, the
            following esquires have served the people:
          
            John Rardin1854, 1858
            James B. Rawlins1854
            Joseph Matthews1856
            William J. Foster1860
            W. P. Cragan1860
            George Barnett1862, 1870
            John Rardin1862, 1866
            Isaac Mullen1870, 1874
            W. C. Walker1870, 1874
            George Barnett1874, 1880
            John W. Walker1874, 1878
            James H. Thompson1878
            James W. Wilson1880
          
          Remarks: It will be observed that John Rardin served one term in the original Center
            township, being elected in 1848, and went out of office in 1870. John Martin served
            continuously for eighteen years, dating from 1835 to the termination of Harrison, in
            which he served. Mr. Martin was also elected in Center after her accession, but declined
            to serve. George Barnett, Esq., served one term in Sugarcreek township; afterwards, in
            1862, was elected in Center, and is still holding forth. The present acting justices of
            the township are Esquires John W. Walker, George Barnett and James W. Wilson, all
            residents of the city. James H. Thompson served about half his term, when trouble from
            shortcomings in office overtook him, and he married a respectable lady of the city,
            obtained her ready cash; and skipped the county, and is now paying the penalty of a
            wasted life in a poor-house in Southern Indiana. The amount of business done by some of
            the early justices was very limited indeed. The first justice in Harrison  township, Isaiah Curry, served one year and died; the only
            business coming before him during that term was the advertising of an estray.
          It is authoritatively said of another pioneer justice of this township, that in
            rendering judgment in a case of assault and battery, in the absence of definite
            instructions and a knowledge of the law, he assessed a fine of so much for "assault" and
            so much for "battery."

          First Settlers of Harrison Township.—William Curry, for a time
            county commissioner, built the first grist-mill in the township. Joseph Anderson was the
            first school-teacher. William Martindale, the second justice in the township, became
            eccentric on religious matters, and took the name of "Buck Martindale." Among the other
            first settlers were John and David Kingen, Richard Frost, John  Carr, John Johnson, Jeremiah Hagan, John L. Garwood, Richard Guymon, John
            Martin, William Anderson, Elijah Leary and Isaiah Curry. John L. Garwood was one of the
            jurymen who tried the Whites for the Indian murders on Fall Creek, near Pendleton, in
            1824. The first burials in the Curry cemetery were Allen Curry and Lucinda Simmons, son
            and daughter of William Curry.
          First Business.—The first business of this section was with
            Elijah Tyner, of Blue-river township, who bought the venison hams, furs and ginseng of
            the pioneers, and sold them a few of the staple articles in exchange. Some of the
            trading of this section was done at Indianapolis, Pendleton and Raysville about this
            time. The first store in Center township was in Greenfield, about the year 1826, a
            fuller account of which will appear further on. We have no knowledge of any store in
            Center township, outside of Greenfield, during her entire history, other than the one
            now kept by Dr. George Tague, in the north-east part of the township, where the new
            post-office, Binwood, is kept by the proprietor of the store.
          Ex-County Officers.—Center township, and especially that part
            of it incorporated as Greenfield, like Virginia, the "Mother of Presidents," has been
            truly liberal and patriotic in furnishing her quota of county officers to serve the
            people.
          This was the home of Lewis Tyner, a pioneer merchant of Greenfield, and the first
            county clerk, being elected in 1828. Here resided John Foster, the first sheriff, and
            afterward representative for three terms and county treasurer. Greenfield was the home
            of Joshua Meek, the first recorder, who filled the office for twenty-one years. Henry
            Watts, the first treasurer, elected in 1828, was from Brandywine township. This was the
            home of Elisha Chapman, one of the three original commissioners who divided the county
            into townships.
          In the little town of Greenfield resided Dr. Leonard Bardwell, the second physician and
            the first representative from this county.
          
          In Greenfield lived John Templin, a merchant, and the first auditor, being elected in
            1841, the first date at which the State laws required that officer.
          Here also lived Meredith Gosney, the first county surveyor and also school
            commissioner. He died in Green township.
          Here lived in their day Thomas D. Walpole, senator and representative; Joseph Chapman,
            representative and clerk of the court; Joseph Matthews and John Alley, representatives;
            William Sebastian, John T. Sebastian, John Hager and Henry A. Swope, county clerks;
            Nathan Crawford and Samuel C. Duncan, treasurers; Jonathan Dunbar, Joseph Anderson, John
            Osborn and William H. Curry, sheriffs; John Milroy, Levi Leary, Frances O. Sears and N.
            H. Roberts, recorders; Isaac Willett, Nathaniel Henry, Abram Rhue, William Curry,
            Benjamin Spillman, Jacob Tague and Hiram Tyner, county commissioners; George Y. Atkison,
            joint representative, representative, and county clerk; James Rutherford, county clerk
            and school examiner; and Morrison Pearson, county treasurer and surveyor.
          Still living and residing among us in the territory under consideration are the
            following well-known, honorable citizens, ex-officers: David S. Gooding, probate judge,
            senator, representative, and prosecuting attorney; James L. Mason, senator, joint
            representative, and school examiner; William R. Hough, senator, district attorney, and
            school examiner; Reuben A. Riley, representative, prosecuting attorney, and school
            examiner; John H. White, representative; Charles G. Offutt, representative; Morgan
            Chandler, sheriff, clerk, and representative; Jonathan Tague, auditor; A. C. Handy,
            auditor and representative; A. T. Hart, treasurer; L. W. Gooding, recorder and
            prosecuting attorney; William Mitchell, recorder by appointment; Jacob Slifer,
            commissioner; William Fries, school examiner and surveyor; James A. New, school
            examiner.
          Here, also, lived William R. West, recorder and probate judge, now living in Anderson,
            and John Hinchman, county commissioner, who now resides in Rush county.
          
          Murders, Suicides and Remarkable Deaths.—In 1833 John Hays, an
            ex-sheriff of Rush county, was burned to death at the burning of the first log jail in
            the county, located on the south part of the public square. Hays kept a boarding-house
            on the corner now occupied by Doctor Boot's residence. He drank immoderately; became
            jealous of one of his male boarders; reason and judgment were dethroned; and he
            determined to wreak out his vengeance on somebody. Being indiscriminate in his
            selections, he entered the Milroy family and committed an assault and battery, for which
            he was confined in jail. In his account of the matter, he said he dirked and clubbed
            them as frogs, and they turned to "Milroys." Hays was the only one at the time
            incarcerated in the jail, which he set on fire, and was smothered and partially burned
            to death before the fire was discovered. From the "Illustrated Historical Atlas of Rush
            County, Indiana," by J. H. Beers & Co., we copy the following: "The second session
            of the circuit court met on the 3rd day of October, 1822. The sheriff, John Hays, did
            not appear this term, nor does his name hereafter appear on the record as officiating as
            sheriff. From other sources it is known that the unfortunate man became insane, wandered
            out to Hancock county, was placed in jail in Greenfield, set fire to the jail, and was
            consumed with it ere he could be rescued. An awful death to die!" But few people remain
            to recall the sad occurrence.
          Mrs. Harris, wife of George Harris, hung herself, in March, 1845, with a skein of yarn
            attached to one of the joists. She was a woman in middle life, and nothing definite is
            known as to the cause of the act. Strange as it may seem, this was done while Mr. H. was
            asleep in the same bed from which she arose; and he knew nothing about it till morning,
            when he awoke to find the lifeless form of his wife cold in death. He did not delay to
            inform the coroner, but cut her down at once, when Mr. Thomas B. Miller, acting coroner,
            was informed, and proceeded to hold an inquest, and rendered a verdict: "Came to her  death by hanging. Cause unknown." This occurred on
            Brandywine Creek, on the land now owned by Thomas B. Miller, in Center township, about
            six miles north-east of Greenfield.
          Isaac Stuart was born in Guilford county, North Carolina, April 23, 1796. He married
            Miss Sarah Johnson, who was seven years his junior, in his native county, December 8,
            1822. In 1829 they immigrated to Indiana, and stopped one year in Wayne county and a
            similar time in Henry county, then removed to Rush county, six miles south of
            Knightstown, where they remained until July 14, 1835, when they made a permanent
            settlement in Harrison township, Hancock county, Indiana, where he remained until his
            death. Here, in the green woods, he carved out a home and reared his family, earning his
            bread by the sweat of his brow, never owing any man a cent. He accumulated some
            property, and on the night of December 28, 1846, at eleven o'clock, he was awakened by
            hearing some one walking across the room. Supposing it to be his son, Dr. John G.
            Stuart, who was practicing medicine at Charlottesville, and frequently stopped there
            when belated, he told him that the hired girl, Charlotte Reeves, was in the bed. On
            hearing the old gentleman speak, James Wise, a robber, turned, and rushing upon Mr.
            Stuart, struck him over the head with a large club (which is still in possession of the
            family), felling him to the floor. Mr. Stuart attempted to grapple with him, when he was
            struck again, and pushed out of the door, to receive another blow, this time from
            another robber, named Bodkins, which knocked him senseless. The two then entered the
            house, and demanded of Mrs. Stuart the money. She gave them all in the house at the
            time, about $I25-eleven in paper, the rest in silver, twenty-eight dollars being in
            quarters. After Wise received the $128 he called for $1,000 more, in reply to which Mrs.
            Stuart told him that was all that they had about the house; that Isaac had just loaned
            out $1,000; and that if he wanted to kill her he would have to do so, as they had no
            more. Whereupon he knocked her down  and beat her nearly
            to death, vainly attempting to compel her to hand over the $1,000 (which it was
            impossible for her to do). When the doctor arrived the next morning, the first thing
            that greeted him was the pigs licking up his parents' blood. The neighbors soon came in,
            and organized two searching parties of eleven each, and went to the houses of the guilty
            parties, but failed to find them at home. The companies then separated, one starting for
            Pendleton and one for Huntsville. One man was sent forward who should recognize, speak
            to, and pass the suspected parties, and give the rest the signal; and when near where
            George Mingle now lives they met Wise on horseback. They captured him, and soon took
            Bodkins also. On taking them in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Stuart they immediately
            recognized them, although they were blackened the evening before, and they were taken to
            Indianapolis and committed to jail, there being at that time no jail in Hancock county.
            Their trial came off in February, 1847, and on the 12th of February they were sentenced
            to the penitentiary, Wise for twelve years and Bodkins for six. The latter died in about
            eighteen months, and Wise was pardoned by Governor Joseph Wright, on a petition on which
            the names of the Stuart family were forged. Mr. Stuart never fully recovered from the
            injuries, never being able afterwards to attend to business, and after being paralyzed
            eighteen months, during which time he was as helpless as an infant, he died August 6,
            1859. As a last request he ordered that as he had never owed anything in life, all his
            funeral expenses should be paid before he was buried, which was done. Mrs. Sarah Stuart,
            whose injuries were less severe, is still living with relatives, at the age of
            seventy-eight, loved and respected by all who know her.
          William S. Wood committed suicide by taking sulphate of morphia and chloroform, at the
            Union depot, Indianapolis, September 30, 1875, aged thirty-seven years. The cause of
            this sad occurrence was financial difficulties and large forgeries, a full account of
            which were given by him in his dying statement and confession, published at the  time in many of the city and county papers of the state. On
            the 28th, two days before his death, he took two policies in the Masonic Mutual Benefit,
            for his children, to the amount of $5,000, and $7,000 in the Franklin for his wife and
            children, and he had previously taken $2,500 in the Union Mutual, or Northwestern, of
            Milwaukee. Among his forgeries last made were his father's and father-in-law's names to
            a note for $4,000, payable in the First National Bank of Cambridge City, Indiana; and
            the names of Pratt & Baldwin, Marion Forgy, J. W. Ryon, and Thomas Wood to a note
            for $1,000, which he discounted at the Citizens' National Bank of Indianapolis. Of his
            forgeries he said, which was doubtless true, that he "never intended that any one should
            know it or have a cent to pay for him." But the financial crisis was too severe. The
            shrinkage of values, the high rates of interest, and the difficulties experienced in
            borrowing money at any rate drove him to desperation, and for the time dethroned reason
            and judgment. Mr. Wood was one of the most enterprising citizens of the county. Starting
            in the grocery business in a limited way in Greenfield, in 1862, with but little
            capital, he had greatly extended his business; then in the hardware and implement trade,
            speculating in land and lots; was the prime mover in erecting the Citizens' Bank (of
            which P. H. Boyd, John B. Simmons, Abiram Boyd, W. S. Wood, and I. P. Poulson were the
            stockholders); he built the two-story brick in the east part of town, since known as the
            flax factory, then owned by the Greenfield Manufacturing Association, of which he was
            president at the time of his death. At heart Mr. W. was a good man; a little vain, but
            exceedingly charitable; and was one of the most liberal members of the Christian church.
            He was at the time of his death Grand Chancellor of the Knights of Pythias for the
            state; president of the school board in Greenfield; superintendent of the Christian
            Sunday-school; and an active, energetic man, who was greatly missed by the community.
            In person he was square-built, heavy-set; weight, 160 pounds; dark features and dark
            hair, a keen  eye, healthy and temperate; of nervous,
            sanguine temperament; five feet eight inches in height, quick-motioned and dignified
            bearing. He left a wife, the oldest daughter of William L. Garriott, and three children
            to mourn his loss, and fight life's battles all alone, unaided by paternal guidance and
            a father's strong arm. Mr. Wood's education was limited, never having had the
            opportunity of attending school but for a short time; but by observation, quick
            perception, and a retentive memory, he had partially made up the loss; and being of an
            imaginary turn of mind, a fluent talker, and possessed of a strong voice, he was
            considered a good extemporaneous speaker on all ordinary occasions and subjects. The
            last public speech he made was on Monday morning, September 27, I875, in the collection
            room in the public school building, in Greenfield. Those who heard it will remember it
            as at least good for an extemporaneous effort. The writer knew him well, and on that
            Monday morning, the beginning of the school year, had met him a few minutes before the
            time for opening, and invited him, as the president of the board, to be present and make
            a few appropriate remarks to the children on entering on their year's work, which he
            accepted, as he usually did such invitations, on condition that he found the time.
            Little did we think while following him in his speech through the Elysian fields, and
            drinking deep of the crystal fountains, that he was then contemplating so rash an act,
            to be returned to us in three short days a lifeless form.
          In this township, about four miles north-east of Greenfield, lived William Frost, well
            known throughout the county as a local politician, thoroughly posted in the current
            history of the county, a successful farmer, an unwavering democrat and once a trustee of
            Center township, who came to an untimely death by falling from the top of a willow tree,
            near a cranberry patch north of town, where he had stationed himself to watch for a fox
            which he supposed would pass that way for its place of resort. On Friday morning,
            January 19, 1877, Mr. Frost, in company with William Martin and William Creviston,  started out on a fox hunt. Frost being a good marksman, it
            was decided that he should take a station near the said cranberry patch, the fox
            rendezvous, while his companions should drive them up. In order to be unobserved by the
            fox, Frost took a stand in the fork of an inclining willow tree, some twelve or fifteen
            feet from the ground. Noon coming on, and Martin and Creviston being tired, finding no
            fox, and supposing that Frost had left the woods, went home. But as Frost failed to
            return home that evening, his family became uneasy, and early next morning instituted a
            search. About nine o'clock he was found dead in the snow under the tree where he had
            stood. From the scars on and about his head, and broken teeth lying in his mouth and
            driven into his split jaw, it was supposed that he had relied too much on a small limb,
            which would strike him about the shoulders as he stood in the tree, and which had broken
            and let him fall to the frozen ground head foremost, dislocating his neck and producing
            instant death.
          On the evening of August 30, 1876, there occurred, in the northern part of Center
            township, just east of the Junction, one of the most shocking, horrible and diabolical
            tragedies ever enacted in the county, which resulted in the murder of James Reedy, a
            cripple, by his father, Jerry Reedy, in a drunken quarrel between the two after
            returning from Greenfield, where they had taken a load of melons, sold them, and partook
            freely of fire-water, or better called devil's water, which drowned
            reason, smothered judgment, obliterated natural affection, and drove the actors to
            desperation and deathly combat. In a quarrel about "bossing" the household, each of them
            claiming that high prerogative, the butt end of a buggy whip was broken across the head
            of young Reedy, breaking down the bridge of his nose, and two or three flesh cuts
            inflicted on the father, terminating with a horrible death gash in the skull of young
            Reedy, from the edge of an axe in the hands of a crazed, enraged and excited father.
            According to the statement of Mrs. James Reedy, the only witness of the terrible
            tragedy, the parties had returned from town about four o'clock, and both 
            
              WILLIAM TREES, M. D.
            
             declined to partake of the supper prepared for them; that
            James was lying on the floor asleep, when Jerry struck him a few licks with the whip and
            told him to get up, which originated the quarrel terminating as above. Young Reedy died
            in a few hours, leaving a young wife and an unborn child. Jerry Reedy said that while in
            Greenfield they drank together, each four glasses of whisky; that he remembered nothing
            about using the ax on his son, and after becoming sober and rational, wept over the act
            and mourned the loss bitterly. But past acts he could not recall; the life taken he
            could not return; and notwithstanding his sense of shame, grief and remorse of
            conscience, he must suffer the penalty of an infracted law, and is now serving out a ten
            year's sentence in the penitentiary south. This is the result of giving way to the first
            glass. Had poor Jerry Reedy never begun the use of intoxicants, he might have escaped
            the disgrace of being a worthless sot and murderer, and have gone down to his grave with
            a clear conscience and the approval of Heaven. What a grave commentary on the common
            habit of dram drinking. Let the unconfirmed and uninitiated take warning, and "touch
            not, taste not the unclean thing," remembering that reliable statistics show that
            nine-tenths of the crimes of the civilized world are the result thereof; that the
            accursed habit fills our jails, penitentiaries and alms-houses of various kinds, and is
            the mother of pauperism, illiteracy, illegitimacy, crime and high taxes, and produces
            untold toil, suffering, and despair by unnatural widows and helpless orphans, left
            unaided to fight life's battles. "Oh! that men would consider, and heed wisdom's ways
            ere it is too late."
          In this township, on the fair grounds, at the south end of floral-hall, on the morning
            of June 26, 1875, William Keemer died of what Mark Twain denominates "throat trouble."
            The facts in the case are too fresh in the minds of the peoplo to need much rehearsing.
            Keemer was a tall, strong mulatto man, about twenty-six years of age, who had committed
            a rape on Mrs. Jerusha E. Vaughn, wife of Mr. William Vaughn, then of Blue-river
            township,  for which he was caught and placed in the
            county jail at Rushville, where he remained one night, when fears were entertained of
            violence, and he was removed to Greenfield after night, and placed in the new jail. On
            the following morning, at half-past twelve o'clock, about 150 masked men, realizing the
            enormity of the crime, and fearing the technicalities and uncertainties of law,
            determined to take the law in their hands for the time, and see that justice was
            speedily meted out. They entered the jail, broke into Sheriff Thomas's room, forced the
            keys from him, unlocked the cell doors, and took their prisoner by force, placed him in
            a spring-wagon drawn by a gray horse, and marched to the place of execution, as
            aforesaid. The testimony is that the wagon was backed up to the fatal spot and a cotton
            rope placed around his neck, when he was asked if he had anything to say; in reply to
            which he said: "Men, you are doing a great wrong," which he repeated, and the wagon was
            driven out, and the frail frame was left writhing and dangling between the certainties
            of earth and the uncertainties of the future, with the dark waters of death near by.
            After life was extinct a placard was pinned on his bosom, to be read by hundreds the
            next morning, of which the following is a copy: "It is the verdict of 160 men from
            Hancock, Shelby and Rush that his life is inadequate to the demands of justice." After
            life was pronounced extinct by one of the city physicians, who was present as a
            spectator, one of the masked men arose and announced in slow, measured tones something
            like the following: "Comrades and spectators: The scene just enacted was done in no
            spirit of bravado or revenge, but to vindicate in some degree an outrage upon an
            innocent, unprotected woman, and to give protection and security in the future to your
            wives, as well as mine. Now, if any one, be he officer or citizen, divulge the secrets
            of this night, he shall surely suffer (pointing to the hanging man) in the same way."
            The crowd then dispersed. The next day an inquest was held, and a verdict rendered in
            accordance with the above facts. The corpse was then cut down,  placed on Frank Barnett's old dray, and taken to an undertaking
            establishment, and after being gazed on by hundreds from the county and town, was taken
            that night, about eleven o'clock, and deposited in its last resting-place on the county
            farm, "unwept, unhonored and unsung." Not being a citizen of Greenfield, he could not be
            buried in the new cemetery without the payment of the required fee of two dollars, and
            no one was found to advance the money; hence, with the box in a wagon and "Buffalo Bill
            " to dig the grave, his last remains were deposited as aforesaid. Thus ended the
            earthly, career of William Keemer. We are no apologist for mob law; but if it is ever
            justifiable, this was one of those cases.
          It was in this township, about five miles north-east of Greenfield, that Samuel Derry
            "came to his death by stabs and wounds inflicted in and upon his body, by a knife or
            knives, by Harrison Kingen and Lucinda Kingen," on the 26th day of July, 1873, from
            which he died on the 30th. It will be remembered that the immediate cause of the fatal
            affray was a tiny gosling, the ownership of which was in dispute. On the day before the
            culmination of the trouble Lucinda Kingen, wife of Harrison Kingen, and sister of Samuel
            Derry, had gone to the house of her brother and driven away the said gosling. This act
            revived an old feeling existing between the families, and on the Saturday following the
            three parties met in the public highway, near the residence of said Derry, which
            resulted in a fatal fight, in which it seems a club, brick and knife were freely used.
            While there were several cuts on the body of Derry, in the opinion of the physicians the
            wound in the back, extending into the cavity of the chest, was the immediate cause of
            the death of Derry. A post mortem examination also disclosed the fact
            that the stomach and part of the intestines had passed upward through the cut in the
            diaphragm into the chest, and lay in front of the heart and lungs, rather on the left
            side, where the lung was collapsed. The coroner's jury returned a verdict in accordance
            with the above facts. This was considered one of the  most
            shocking murders that ever occurred in the township. Considering the relationship of the
            families and the insignificant differences between them, it was wholly unnatural and
            unaccountable, and is certainly a sad commentary on family feuds and petty strifes.
            Hereby two families were ruined, and their happiness forever destroyed.
          It was in this township, also, at the Judkins schoolhouse, that Theodore Gant was
            struck over the head with a wooden poker by his teacher, on March 8, 1870, which
            resulted in his death on the same evening.
          There have been a number of other strange sudden deaths in this township, which we will
            notice briefly: Lewis B. Paris was found dead and badly mutilated on the railroad, west
            of the depot, in November, 1865; supposed to have been murdered and thrown on the track.
            Jesse McKinney was killed by the cars, at the depot, in 1860. John Tacket was killed in
            1863, a few rods east of the depot, by the cars striking him in the head. He was
            standing beside the track, leaning too far over. John Crush was killed, it is thought
            intentionally, in a similar manner, on July 29, 1875. Henry H. Baxter, a shoemaker, fell
            dead at the Dunbar corner, April 13, 1872. He left in 1852, and had returned on a visit.
            W. F. Barnard was killed in November, 1878, on the Washington Duncan farm, by a pole
            falling on his head at a barn raising. David T. Davis's daughter committed suicide by
            drowning in Brandywine, near her home, a few years since. A Mr. Johnson, in the early
            history of the county, drowned himself in a pond north-east of the Junction. Henry Ford,
            an elderly man, dropped dead in the woods, in the presence of Sylvanus Campbell and
            David Deshong, December 26, 1876. In February, 1869, a man by the name of Chambers was
            killed at the Brandywine bridge, by his head striking against the top thereof. On the
            15th of October, 1873, a man whose name was unknown was killed in the same manner and
            place. Shortly after, perhaps in 1874, a brakeman was killed at the depot in Greenfield
            by his head striking the projecting roof.
          
          Exports.—The exports of this township and town are mainly the
            products of the farm, forest and factory, and consists of corn, cattle, hogs, horses,
            flaxseed, flax-tow, staves, heading, school desks, lumber, potatoes, butter, eggs, hay,
            wool and furniture.
          Remarks.—With this general view of the township we close the
            present chapter. Many of the points herein merely alluded to will receive more attention
            in the next chapter, entitled "Center Township—Continued," and also further on in
            the book.
        
        
          CHAPTER XI.
            CENTER TOWNSHIP—Continued.
          
            GREENFIELD.
            Greenfield, the county-seat, metropolis, and only city in the county, was laid out in
              June, 1828, by five commissioners, appointed for that purpose by the legislature of
              1827 and 1828. The original plat consisted of sixty acres, owned and donated by
              Cornwell Meek, Benjamin Spillman, and John Wingfield. The town was named by the first
              three commissioners of the county, viz.: Samuel Vangilder, Elisha Chapman, and John
              Hunter.
            The instructions by the legislature to the said commissioners were to locate the seat
              of justice of Hancock county on the National road, midway between the east and west
              lines of the county. It is said upon reasonably good authority that Cornwell Meek and
              Benjamin Spillman measured the county from east to west with a string, in order to
              ascertain the center thereof, and future location of the prospective county-seat.
            In order to settle a disputed point relative to the method by which the county
              acquired title to said original plat of  sixty acres, we
              produce an abstract from the old original commissioners' record, embodying the report
              of said five state commissioners:
            "At a special term of the board of county commissioners of the county of Hancock, met
              at the house of Samuel B. Jackson, in the said county, on the 7th of April, 1828, it
              is ordered by the board *[that]
              a report returned to the board of county commissioners of Hancock county by the
              honorable board—the James Smock, Thomas Martin, James Anderson, Levi Jessup,
              [and] Richard Blackledge, commissioners appointed by the state legislature of Indiana,
              to meet at the house of Samuel B. Jackson, in said county, for the purpose of locating
              the seat of justice in and for Hancock county, aforesaid, is [be] received by said
              board [of county commissioners] as is specified in the same, [report aforesaid] and
              ordered to be filed by the clerk of said board, [of county commissioners] spread on
              record, as follows, to-wit:
            "'INDIANA, TO-WIT: "'HANCOCK COUNTY.

              said county of Hancock, on Monday, the 7th day of April, A. D. 1828, and after being
              sworn as the law directed, proceeded on the discharge of the duties of our
              appointment. On Tuesday, the 8th day of April, John Anderson appeared, and was sworn
              as commissioner appointed by the act aforesaid; and on the same day Richard Blackledge
              appeared, and was sworn as a commissioner appointed as aforesaid; and after examining
              the several sites shown to us, and duly considering all the donations offered, we have
              unanimously agreed to accept a donation of sixty acres of land donated by Cornwell
              Meek, John Wingfield and Benjamin Spillman, bounded as follows, to-wit: Beginning on
              the line dividing sections thirty-two and thirty-three, in township sixteen north,

              north thirty rods from the north side of said road, and the same distance south from
              the south side of said road; thence west on lines parallel with said road one hundred
              and sixty rods, to the open line of section five north and south, to contain sixty
              acres, which we have selected as a permanent seat of justice for the county of
              Hancock. And it is further agreed and allowed by us, that the donors aforesaid be
              allowed every fourth block in that part of town respectively donated by them, in
              manner following, to-wit: John Wingfield and Benjamin Spillman to be entitled to every
              fourth block, the county commissioners having first choice, and that Cornwell Meek be
              allowed every fourth block on that part of town donated by him, the said Cornwell Meek
              to have the first choice in the first four blocks, and afterwards for the county
              commissioners to have the first choice. And it is further agreed by us, that the
              donors aforesaid be allowed to remove buildings, rails, boards, and board-timber
              already sawed off which may be included in their respective donations; and we have
              further received donations by subscriptions amounting in cash and labor and lumber to
              $265; and furthermore, we have taken bonds on the donors aforesaid for the conveyance
              of the land above described, which, with the paper containing the subscriptions
              aforesaid, is submitted to the county commissioners.

            The original plat, it will be observed from the above report, was just sixty rods
              wide, extending thirty rods on either side of the National road, and a half mile in
              length. The original plat consisted of a public square and thirty-four blocks, divided
              into one hundred and sixty-one lots.
            It may be of some interest to the young to know not only the size, but the boundaries
              of said original plat. The east line thereof runs just west of Martin Lineback's
              residence and Morgan Chandler's property. Benjamin T. Rains resides on the north-east
              corner lot. The north line extends along the alley south of Dr. Martin's residence,
              and forms the north line of the Catholic church. Thomas Carr, Sr., resides on the
              north-west corner, and John Ryon on a central west lot. The south line of the old plat
              forms the north line of the old seminary lot, and runs just south of Nelson Bradley's
              residence.
            Additions.—From time to time a number of additions have been
              made to Greenfield and the original plat, numbering more than a score in all. The
              first addition was made by Edward K. Hart, a brother of A. T. Hart, on March 4, 1839,
              and consisted of twelve blocks, fifty-six in-lots and twelve out-lots, and lies south
              of the old plat and east of State street, except one tier of lots, which lies on the
              west.
            The second addition was made by Morris Pierson, on the 14th of April, 1853, and
              consisted of six blocks, divided  into fifty-four lots,
              located about the old seminary, which it surrounds, except on the north.
            The third addition was made by Meek & Hart, on the 23rd of July, 1853, and
              consisted of four blocks, fifty-one in-lots and twelve out-lots, located north of the
              western portion of the old plat. The writer's residence is in this addition.
            The fourth addition was made by Morris Pierson, being his second addition to the
              town, on the 28th of February, 1854, and consisted of twenty-three in-lots and four
              out-lots, located due south of Pierson's first addition, and extending the whole
              length thereof.
            The fifth addition was made by the railroad company, on the 28th of July, 1854, and
              is located in the south-west corner of the original plat, and west of Pierson's first
              addition, and consisted of three blocks and fifteen lots, the third block not being
              divided into lots.
            The sixth addition was made by Captain James R. Bracken; said addition declared null
              and void.
            The seventh addition was made by Fletcher & McCarty, on the 24th of December,
              1860, and consisted of eighteen lots, located west of the old addition and north of
              the National road.
            The eighth addition was made by Nelson Bradley, on the 23rd of September, 1867, and
              consisted of eleven blocks and forty-four large lots, located east of North State
              street and north of the old town plat.
            The ninth addition was made by Benjamin Elder, on the 20th of April, 1870, and
              consisted of thirteen blocks and ninety-two lots, located north-west of the old plat
              and west of Meek & Hart's addition.
            The tenth addition was made by Thomas Snow, on the 19th of August, 1870, and
              consisted of fifteen lots, located on the west side of North State street.
            The eleventh addition was made by Wood, Pratt & Baldwin, on the 5th of June,
              1871, and consisted of seven blocks and fifty-six lots, located east of the old plat
              and north of the National road.
            
            The twelfth addition was made by William C. Burdett, on the 2nd of July, 1871, and
              consisted of forty-seven lots, located west of Elder's addition.
            The thirteenth addition was made by Wood, Pratt & Baldwin, being their second
              addition, on the 28th of October, 1871, and consisted of nine blocks and seventy-eight
              lots, located north of their first addition and east of Bradley's addition.
            The fourteenth addition was made by Wood, Pratt & Baldwin, and called their first
              addition of out-lots, on August 30, 1871, and consisted of seven out-lots of various
              sizes, from one to seven acres each, and located east of their first addition.
            The fifteenth addition was made by William Teal, on the 17th of October, 1871, and
              consisted of twenty-four lots, located west of Burdett's addition.
            The sixteenth addition was made by Wood, Pratt & Baldwin, on the 26th of October,
              1872, and known as their second addition of out-lots, and consisted of four out-lots
              of several acres each, located east of Hart's addition.
            The seventeenth addition was made by John Hinchman, on the 2nd of June, 1873, and
              consisted of ten lots, located north of Fletcher & McCarty's addition.
            The eighteenth addition, known as Stewart's addition, was made by Ithamer Stewart, on
              the 3rd of July, 1873, and consisted of four blocks and twenty-eight lots, located in

              south-west part of town.
            The twentieth addition was made by Wm. S. Woods, and known as Woods' addition, on the
              12th of May, 1875, and consisted of thirty-seven lots, located south of the National
              road, in the east part of town.
            The twenty-first addition was made by John Hinchman, and known as Hinchman's second
              addition, on the 2nd of June, 1875, and locatad between the school-house  lot and the National road, and consisted of ten lots, the
              central two of which the city council bought and appropriated as a street.
            The twenty-second addition was made by Morgan Chandler, on the 4th of June, 1875, and

              plat.
            The twenty-third and last addition was made by Wm. C. Burdett, and known as his
              second addition, on the 10th of October, 1877, and consisted of twenty lots, located
              in the north-west part of town, north of Teal's addition.*
            Cemeteries.—Greenfield has two cemeteries, and has had none
              others. The first, now known as the "Old cemetery," was donated to Hancock county by
              Andrew P. Jackson, May 9, 1843, and located south-east of the original plat of the
              town of Greenfield. It is not very large, and, consequently, has been about full for
              several years. The first burial here was Docia Spillman, a daughter of Benjamin
              Spillman, who died in September, 1828, aged fourteen years. Here lie slumbering the
              men who cleared the forests, and established the little county-seat that should become
              the future city of Greenfield. Here lies buried much of the early history of
              Greenfield and the country surrounding. Here, beneath moss-covered monuments, lie the
              business men and their companions of forty and fifty years ago. Dear to the memory of
              many is this sacred spot, around which clusters fond memories and hallowed
              associations of other days. Sacred, solemn place! Stranger, step gently over her
              unmarked graves—
            
              
                "Some mute, inglorious Milton here may rest,
                Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood."
              
            
            Mow down the briers; pluck up the weeds; fill up the sunken graves; repair the broken
              down fences; strew flowers over the graves; and let not the immortal spirits view
                *The additions in every
                case, except the first, bear the name of the proprietor. The ordinal numbers, from
                one to twenty-three, of the additions we have given to show the order in which they
                were made.
               the ungrateful neglect of their mortal remains. In
              1868, March 3, the county commissioners deeded the Old cemetery to the city of
              Greenfield, which now has the management and control of the same.
            The New cemetery was purchased by the city of Greenfield, April 28, 1863, for $450,
              and surveyed and entered of record the 30th day of June, 1865, and consisted of a
              little over six acres It is located in the south-east part of the city, due south of
              the Old cemetery. It is laid out into blocks, lots, streets and alleys, with a circle
              in the centre. It has four blocks and four hundred and twenty-one lots. The south-east
              block is only partially divided into lots, but left for a common burying-ground. It
              has a drive way around it, and across it at right angles, and is reached by a well
              graded and graveled street. The plan of the grounds is good; but the drives, or
              streets, are unmade, and the grounds unkept, save in a careless, parsimonious manner
              unbecoming the dignity of the city.
            
              FIRST LOG CABIN IN GREENFIELD.
            
            Early History.—The land from which Greenfield was carved was
              entered in 1826 and '27 by the donors aforesaid. The town was laid out in the woods by
              Jared Chapman, the county agent, who was authorized to sell and convey on behalf of
              the county all unreserved lots. The first lot sold was to John Anderson, the deed
              bearing date of June 4, 1828. The first to settle on the town site were Cornwell Meek,
              Morris Pierson, Dr. Lot Edwards, William Carr,  and
              Lewis Tyner. The first business house in Greenfield was built by John Justice, some
              time prior to the organization of the city. It was a primitive structure, made by
              settling posts in the ground, and weather-boarding and covering with clapboards. The
              first frame building was erected in 1830, by Benjamin Spillman. The first dwellings,
              like the stores, were also cheap, rude structures, made of poles, and the better ones
              of hewed logs. A few years later saw-mills became more plentiful and convenient, when
              small frames superseded the primitive cabin. The first frame of any note was built by
              James Hamilton (Moses W. Hamilton's father) as a two-story tavern stand, located near
              where the Guymon house now stands. The next was erected by Jonathan Dunbar on the
              opposite side of the street, and is a part of the Walsh property. A little later was
              erected the Gooding corner, a portion of the lumber of which was sawed by hand with a
              whipsaw. This building was used as a tavern, and was the finest frame of the town at
              the time. East of it, on the north-west corner of the public square, was a pond from
              three to five feet deep, used by travelers to wash off their horses. It was afterwards
              drained by a blind ditch, passing out north-east under Hart & Thayer's store.
            The first courts were held in a log house located a little south of the Gooding
              corner. The papers were kept in boxes and barrels, and stowed away miscellaneously,
              without much, if any, classification.
            Postoffice.—The amount of postal matter at that date was very
              limited, scarcely sufficient to justify the keeping of an office; indeed, it is said
              that for a time while Joseph Chapman was working for "Uncle Sam" as postmaster he
              carried the postoffice and its contents in his hat, as a convenience to the public and
              himself. There need have been no complaint of "posting bills," crowding, loud talking
              and smoking in the postoffice in those halcyon days.
            Sidewalks.—The sidewalks up to this date were generally made,
              if at all, by placing boards and plank either cross or lengthwise. Even up to the time
              of the civil war,  twenty years ago, there were but few
              brick sidewalks, and no gravel. It is said that Dr. N. P. Howard made the first brick
              sidewalk in the town.
            First Business Bricks.—The first business brick in the town
              was built by Hugh Wooster and Cornwell Meek, recently torn down by Thomas Randall, and
              known as the Edwards drug store. The next, perhaps, was the Williams brick, recently
              removed by Williams and Crawford, and built by Meredith Gosney. The Walker corner, at
              a little later date, was built by Wooster and Templin.
            Private Residences.—About this date a few good residences
              were erected. Among the first was a two-story frame by Dr. Lot Edwards. Later the A.
              J. Banks residence, built by A. M. Patterson; the P. H. Boyd residence, built and
              owned by Dr. B. F. Duncan; the A. T. Hart residence, built by Cornwell Meek; the Dr.
              N. P. Howard, senior, residence, built by T. D. Walpole.
            Other Buildings.—At the time of the building of the Banks
              brick by Patterson, he also erected the two-story frame on the corner, south, used as
              a stove store. Patterson used it as a hatter shop. The Christian church, the oldest
              church building in town, was built about this time, long before the building of the
              court-house, and was used for about two years as a court-room. The county seminary was
              built in 1842, and a frame on the Catholic church lot in 1852. The court-house and
              Masonic hall were erected in 1854.
            Remarks.—The plank road was built in 1852 and the railroad
              about 1853. Let the reader, in imagination, go back to 1854, a very important era in
              our history, and take a view of Greenfield. All the buildings mentioned above were
              built during, or prior to, that date, and most of them standing. There were then two
              churches—the Christian and Methodist; the latter was not the present brick, but
              a frame due south, now used as a residence; the Masonic hall was then new—the
              largest and grandest building in town; the Catholic church building was then used as a
              school-house; the most of the business houses then were 
              frames; the streets and sidewalks only partially graded, and-none of them
              graveled.
            Fires.—About 1839, the fire fiend fought furiously with
              Greenfield, destroying all the business portion on the north side of Main street
              between the tavern, located ,about where the Guymon house now stands, and State
              street. Several business men lost all their stock, A. T. Hart being one of them.
            Previous to the building of the Walker corner, Joseph Chapman erected a three-story
              frame hotel (or tavern, as such buildings were then called), on the corner now
              occupied by said Walker brick, in which Elijah Knight was keeping tavern, and
              controlling a large frame stable, both of which were burned, and about fifteen horses
              were lost.
            In 1857 another frightful fire raged in the town, destroying all the buildings
              between Dr. Howard's residence and the Walker corner.
            Among the other fires from time to time we note the complete destruction thereby of
              two flouring mills, two planing mills, one flax mill, one extensive pump factory, a
              woolen factory, a ware-house, a stable containing four horses, and several dwellings
              of more or less value.
            It will be seen that Greenfield has had a full share of fires for the time,
              sufficient at least to give her liberal citizens a reasonable warning to provide ample
              protection. Greenfield to-day is unprepared for a big fire, like some that have
              visited her in the past, and is liable at any time to sustain a loss many times
              greater than the cost of an engine, cisterns, and other means of protection; but we
              trust that she will not be "penny wise and pound foolish " always. History is of
              little practical use save as it teaches us lessons for the future; and judging from
              the past history of our county-seat, we can't be too careful in providing a defense
              for the frightful fire fiend.
            Incorporation as Town and City.—Greenfield was incorporated
              as a town in 1854, and grew gradually, yet slowly, till 1867, when it took a stride
              forward and improved rapidly in buildings and graveled streets, and increased 
              
                HON. NOBLE WARRUM.
              
               proportionately in population. She was incorporated as
              a city in 1876, with a population of 2,023.
            Location.—It is handsomely located on the west side of
              Brandywine Creek, and from its location admits of easy drainage, and is laid out with
              broad and commodious streets at right angles, which afford an open view.
            Streets and Sidewalks.—Prior to the close of the war there
              were few, if any, graveled streets in Greenfield; after that for a few years there was
              considerable graveling done, and but little grading. In 1876, after the incorporation
              as a city,* she begun in
              earnest the grading and graveling of streets and sidewalks, and continued the same
              with unabated energy to the present. The first street thus made was Pennsylvania, by
              John R. Johnson, contractor. North State street was next made, by Thomas B. Miller,
              contractor; then Fourth street and Bradley street, by Comstock; followed by Walnut
              street, South State street, South Pennsylvania street, Mechanic and Main streets,
              besides a number of alleys, by Faurot & Brown, contractors. The sidewalks were in
              all these cases graded and graveled at the same time. The most extensive improvement
              of the time was the grading and graveling of Main street, the paving of her sidewalks,
              and bouldering of her gutters, the present season.
            Synopsis.—Greenfield now has many handsome residences,
              commodious business houses, and good public buildings, constructed in modern style.
              Outside of the county buildings, she has two substantial bank buildings and banks,
              three brick churches and one frame; one large two-story brick school-house, with slate
              roof and stone foundation; two flouring mills, three planing mills, one furniture
              factory, a flax factory, a heading factory, three saw-mills, an iron roof factory, one
              railroad, telegraph and express lines, three printing presses, four papers; lodges of
              Masons, Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias, Red Men, *Under town laws streets are built out of the
                common fund, while in a city the improvements are paid for by the abutters on the
                street.
               Good Templars; also, merchants, grocerymen, druggists,
              saloonists, mechanics, doctors, lawyers, preachers, teachers, editors, poets, eight
              pikes, and twenty-three additions, covering an area of one square mile.
            First Doctors.—The first practitioners of the healing art
              were Drs. Lot Edwards, Leonard Bardwell, Jared Chapman, B. F. Duncan, Simon Alters,
              Hiram Comstock, R. E. Barnett and N. P. Howard, two of whom are still holding forth in
              Greenfield.
            First Attorneys.—At the first term of court, on the 24th of
              March, 1828, there were admitted to the bar, on motion, Calvin Fletcher, Henry Gregg,
              Marinus Willett and Charles H. Verder; the most of whom, however, were non-residents.
              In 1846, the attorneys were: David M. C. Lane, J. H. Williams, T. D. Walpole and David
              S. Gooding.
            Remarks.—At this date, 1846, which was prior to the time of
              the railroad, the Dayton and Indianapolis stage passed daily east and west through
              Greenfield. John Templin & Co. and A. T. Hart & Co. were the principal
              merchants. William Sebastian was postmaster.
            First Business Men of Greenfield.—Among the first settlers
              and business men of Greenfield were John Justice, who had the first grocery store,
              some time prior to 1828; O. M. Ross, who had the first general store, also prior to
              1828; William and Lewis Tyner had a store in 1828; and the following men were
              subsequently licensed to vend merchandise, as shown by the old records in the
              auditor's office, viz.: James Parker, James Hart, A. H. Freeman, Jared Chapman, Samuel
              Duncan, Joseph Chapman, Nathan Crawford, E. & R. Tyner, John Mongle, James
              Hamilton (father of Moses W. Hamilton), E. & D. Troxwell, Samuel C. Duncan, Robert
              Wilson, John Harris, C. S. Perkins, Joseph Andrews, John White (not Hon. John H.), Eli
              Gapen, Joseph Stallord, Dunbar & Clark, T. W. Smart, William Bussell (not the
              present William B.), Burton & Co., Milroy & Clark, Calvin McRay, Tyner &
              Chittenden, W. H. Curry and A. T. Hart. All of the above were  licensed, previous to 1834. A. T. Hart, the last named of the above, was
              licensed in 1833. After this date we will note only a few, viz.: George Tague (father
              of Jonathan and G. G.), Cornwell Meek, Wooster & Wood, and Foley &
              Gooding.
            First Taverns.—Prior to 1828, the date of the establishment
              of the county-seat, S. B. Jackson and Jeremiah Meek supplied the wants of the
              traveling community at their taverns and stables, the former holding forth in the
              bottom, near Brandywine, and the latter in Greenfield. We have no record of their
              being licensed. John Branden was the first licensed tavern-keeper; he held forth on
              the Gooding corner, followed by James Hart, then Asa Gooding, at the same stand.
              Elijah Knight held forth in a three-story frame, about the same time, on the opposite
              corner. All of the above did business some time prior to 1840. We could trace the
              subject up to 1852, the date of the new constitution, at which time the license law
              for merchandising and tavern-keeping ceased, but we deem it inexpedient. From then on
              we have no official records to instruct us, but must depend on living witnesses
              mostly.

            MASONIC LODGE, No. 101.
            February 14, 1849, the dispensation was issued by Elzur Deming, Grand Master, and A.
              W. Morris, Secretary, to the brethren at Greenfield. The following are the original
              officers and members under said dispensation: James Rutherford, W. M.; Harry Pierson,
              S. W.; J. R. Bracken, J. W.; George Tague, Orlando Craine, James Shipman, Nathan D.
              Coffin and Morris Pierson, members. The first initiation was that of Dr. R. E.
              Barnett. A charter was granted to Lodge No. 1O1, by the Grand Lodge, on the 28th of
              May, 1850. The lodge was organized under the charter on the 20th of the following
              June. The officers were: James Rutherford, W. M.; Harry Pierson, S. W.; J. R. Bracken,
              J. W.; Morris Pierson, Treasurer; John Templin, Secretary; R. E. Barnett, S. D.;
              Jonathan Ralls, J. D.; E. D. Chittenden, Tyler.
            Prior to 1854 the lodge had no building of their own, but held forth for a time in
              the old seminary building. During this year the lodge, having grown in size and
              wealth, began the erection of a handsome three-story brick building, the most
              commodious in the town. The corner stone was laid with appropriate ceremonies by
              Deputy Grand Master Elijah Newlin, on the 15th of August, 1854.
            The present officers are: George W. Dove, W. M.; W. S. Fries, S. W.; Lee O. Harris,
              J. W.; Nelson Bradley, Treasurer; S. E. Duncan, Secretary; Ephraim Marsh, S. D.; M. F.
              Williams, J. D.; Benjamin Price, Tyler; William F. Pratt, Steward; Joseph Baldwin,
              Steward. The present trustees are Ephraim Marsh, F. E. Glidden, and S. W. Barnett.
            From the date of organization to the present this lodge has initiated two hundred and
              three members. The membership at this date is about seventy. The lodge is in  good working order, out of debt, and owns desirable
              property worth $6,000. It has expended for charitable purpurposes $2,000. Their
              regular communications occur on Tuesday evenings on or previous to the full moon of
              each month.
          
          
            I. O. O. F., No. 135.
            Greenfield Lodge, No. 135, I.O. O. F. was instituted July 26, 1853. The lodge was
              organized in the old courthouse; afterwards removed to the third story of the Walker
              block; from there to the county seminary, where, for several years, the lodge
              prospered; but preferring a more central location, the trustees sold the seminary and
              took a lease on a new hall in Howard's block. In the course of time the increase of
              membership, added to the desire on the part of many to have a hall of their own,
              caused the lodge to instruct their trustees to contract with William C. Burdett for a
              third story on his new brick in which to hold its meetings. Since 1876 the lodge has
              occupied its own spacious hall, which is conveniently arranged, neatly furnished, and
              affords a pleasant retreat for its large membership.
            The following officers conducted the instituting ceremonies in the organization of
              the lodge, viz.: Theodore P. Haughey, Deputy Grand Master; Past Grand Cameron, G. W.;
              Fred. Bragg, Grand Secretary; A. Cotton, Grand Treasurer; W. N. Lumis, G. M.
            The following were the charter members: N. P. Howard, George Armstrong, M. W.
              Hamilton, Simon Thomas, and John R. Boston.
            The following members were initiated on the first evening, viz.; Robert A. Barr, M.
              G. Falconbury, Benjamin Deem, Eli Ballenger, James H. Leary, Benjamin Miller, John D.
              Barnett, and Chelton Banks.
            The first election of officers resulted as follows, to-wit: George Armstrong, N. G.;
              N. P. Howard, V. G.; John D. Barnett, Secretary; Jonathan Dunbar, Treasurer.
            This lodge had received up to the first of January, 
              1877, $10,122.75. The lodge is out of debt, in good working order, with money in the
              treasury.

              week. Lodge hall, third story, over Walker's store, in the city of Greenfield,
              Indiana. The first Good Templars lodge of Greenfield was organized about the year
              1869, by Sister Jackson, of Jeffersonville, and known as the Good Templars of
              Greenfield, No. 194. Among the first members of this lodge were L. E. Rumrill, J. A.
              Dobbins, G. W. Duncan, J. A. New, Mrs. Anna Offutt, Mrs. Lou Scott, Miss Hattie
              Havens, S. M. Shumway; S. M. Walker, and G. W. Dove. The lodge met and organized over
              Randall's store, and continued in successful operation for a time, and finally
              declined and surrendered her charter.
          
          
          
            THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
            of Greenfield was organized July 30, 1855. The plans for the organization of this
              church were conceived and completed in the house where R. P. Brown now lives. Dr. B.
              F. Duncan and John Wilson were watching by the bedside of a sick friend, near the hour
              of midnight, when the idea was conceived and arrangements were made. Among those who
              petitioned the Indianapolis Presbytery for this church were Mrs. T. D. Walpole, Dr. B.
              F. Duncan, John Foster, Captain J. R. Bracken, John A. Richey, Alexander Crocket, and
              Gen. John Milroy. The request was granted, and the committee to organize consisted of
              the following eminent divines, viz.: David Monfort, David Stephenson, and Colonel
              James Blake. The committee, on the date aforesaid, met in the old M. E. church, on
              south State street, and perfected an organization, and received the following members
              into full communion, viz.: Gen. John Milroy, Dr. B. F. Duncan, John A. Richey,
              Alexander and Elizabeth Crocket, Mrs. Martha Meek, Hugh Gambrel and wife, John Foster
              and wife, Misses Nancy P. and Mary J. Crocket, Ellen Sturk, Miss Isabel Clency, and
              Samuel and Mary Creveston. Of the fourteen who petitioned for this church, only three
              are living, to-wit: Mrs. T. D. Walpole, Mrs. J. T. Lineback, and Mrs. J. C. Meek. And
              only two are living of the seventeen who united with the church at its organization,
              viz: Mrs. J. T. Lineback and Mrs. J. C. Meek.
            The following are the ministers who have served this church from the date of its
              organization to the present, with the date of appointment and time served:

            The founder and first minister of this church, Rev. David Monfort, was a remarkable
              man, of great spirituality, positive in character, and beloved by all who knew him. He
              is said not to have been a profound preacher, but a volumnious talker, tender-hearted,
              sympathetic, of good executive ability, and a fine judge of human nature. He received
              into the church one hundred and twelve members. He is still remembered as the founder
              of a day school, that was conducted in the Masonic hall for eight years. At this date
              the public schools of Indiana were in their infancy, and of little force; but this
              school, under the management of Monfort, assumed a high standard in point of
              education.
            The total number of members received into the communion of the Presbyterian church of
              Greenfield from the date of its organization, in 1855, to the present was about four
              hundred. Present membership, one hundred. The church worshiped in the Masonic hall for
              thirteen years, and has worshiped in the present building for fourteen years. Their
              building is a handsome, substantial brick, 44x76 feet, and a gallery capable of
              seating one hundred and twenty-five adults. The whole church will seat six hundred
              persons. It was dedicated on the 27th of December, 1868, by Rev. Robert Sloss,
              assisted by Dr. Monfort, of Cincinnati. Cost of building, $10,500. At the close of the
              services on the day of dedication, there were subscribed $3,097 to complete the
              building. The present pastor is Rev. J. H. Hawk, the last, but by no means the least,
              of the shepherds of the flock. Mr. Hawk is an 
              extempore speaker, a good conversationalist, and has succeeded in
              adding a goodly number to the church.
            There is in connection with this church one of the best Sunday-schools in the county.
              It was organized cotemporary with the church, starting out with fourteen adults and
              children all told. Rev. David Monfort was the first superintendent, Dr. B. F. Duncan
              assistant, and Joseph Mathers secretary. In 1857 Robert Hall, recently of Cambridge
              City, was elected superintendent, and Dr. E. I. Judkins secretary. In 1861 Dr. R. E.
              Barnett was elected superintendent, and the secretary's book shows that on the same
              day $106 were raised to pay the prizes due the school—a very respectable sum to
              raise in a Sunday-school more than twenty years ago simply for prizes. Dr. Barnett
              continued to serve in this capacity for sixteen consecutive years, with credit to
              himself and honor to the school. Q D. Hughes served as secretary for fourteen years
              constant and faithful. The infant class of this school is under the efficient
              instruction and oversight of Miss Sue Wilson, assistant postmaster, who has had charge
              of the babies for more than a dozen years. Her class swarms semi-annually, sending off
              new colonies to be directed by others. This school has enjoyed nearly fourteen hundred
              Sabbaths, or about four years of Sunday-school instruction. H. B. Wilson, our present
              postmaster, has been an efficient and faithful bible school teacher a greater portion
              of that time. In 1864, the school had enrolled one hundred and fifty-six scholars, and
              the growth has been steady to the present date. R. E. Barnett is now superintendent
              and George Wilson secretary.
          
          
            GREENFIELD METHODISM.
            The early history of Methodism in Greenfield and vicinity can only be given in an
              incomplete and fragmentary form. The first class known was organized in a cabin which
              stood near the present residence of Wesley Addison.
            Some of the earliest settlers of Greenfield were Methodists,  among whom may be named the families of Abram, Samuel and Moses Vangilder;
              Major Stephens and Jeremiah Meek; and a little later James Parks, John Rardin, Jacob
              Tague, Dr. Lot Edwards, Richard Guymon, and others. The earliest settlers found the
              Methodist itinerant wending his way through the almost unbroken forest searching for
              the lost sheep of the House of Israel, carrying with him the Word of Life, at as early
              a date as 1828. As early as 1830 Greenfield became the headquarters of a circuit, with
              a large number of appointments scattered widely, which were supplied with preaching
              once in four weeks. Since that time frequent changes have occurred in the boundaries
              of the circuit as the population increased, and as the growth of the church demanded,
              until the spring of 1878, when Greenfield became a station. The names of all the
              pastors cannot be given prior to 1837, nor can the order of their pastorate since that
              time be given with certainty in every case.
            The following are the names and date of service, as nearly as can be given: Rev.
              James Havens and Rev. Tarkington were the first preachers in charge; then Rev. Swang;
              ——— Bradley, in 1837; J. B. Burt, in 1838; Frank Richmond and
              Charles Morrow, 1839 to 1840; George Havens, in 1840; John L. Smith, in 1841; J. S.
              Donaldson, in 1842; ——— McNally, appointed in 1843, died during the
              year, and the year was completed by ——— Manly; Joseph Barnick, in
              1844; George W. Bowers, two years; ——— Beasly, two years; J. W.
              Smith, one year; J. M. Mershon, one year; Eli Rammel, one year; Frank Richmond,
              appointed in 1852, died during the year, and Elisha Earl, a well-known local preacher,
              was appointed to fill the vacancy; S. M. Campbell, one year; J. R. Davis, one year; C.
              C. Cooper, died while in charge, and Elisha Earl completed the year; J. S. McCarty,
              one and one-half years; William Anderson, two years; Michael Black, one year; John
              Hill, two years; J. W. White, one year; George W. Bowers, three years; Charles
              Martindale, two years; H. J. Lacy, three years; George Havens, 
              
                BENJAMIN F. FREEMAN.
              
               three years; L. R. Streeter, five months; I. G. Brown,
              seven months; Y. B. Meredith, one year; J. F. Rhoades is now completing his third year
              as pastor.
            Among the class-leaders of the church are George W. Dove, Jonathan Tague, C. W. Gant,
              and O. M. Edwards. This office is about the same as that of deacons or elders in some
              other churches.
            The society was without a house of worship for a long time; but through courtesy of
              public officials, used a log school-house, on North State street, and the old log
              court-house, on the north-west corner of State and South streets, south of the Gooding
              corner, and afterwards in the first brick court-house. In 1841 a church was erected on
              the west side of South State street, south of and near the railroad. This building is
              now occupied for a dwelling. The growth of the society and surrounding circumstances
              demanded better accommodation for religious worship, and accordingly, under the
              efficient leadership of Rev. George W. Bowers, the present structure was begun in the
              year 1866, and completed in 1867 and dedicated free of debt by the lamented Dr. T. M.
              Eddy. The building is a plain, comfortable brick, 40x72 feet. In 1878, the church was
              repaired and greatly improved in appearance, and provided with gas fixtures, which
              lights the large audience-room completely. The work was done under the pastorate of
              Rev. Y. B. Meredith. The church has owned four parsonages. The first parsonage stood
              on East North street. The second one stood on the east side of State street, just
              north of the railroad. About twenty-three years ago the parsonage on West Main street,
              now owned by E. P. Thayer, was purchased, and sold in 1875. The present one is a
              large, substantial, handsome two-story building adjoining the church building. It was
              erected in 1876, under the direction of Nelson Bradley, J. Ward Walker and A. P.
              Williams, and is valued at $2,000. The value of the church and parsonage is estimated
              at $10,500. The membership of the church is about two hundred. More than sixty of this
              number have been  added within the last two years under
              J. F. Rhoades' pastorate. Every department of the church is in fine working condition.
              The society has not been in debt for a number of years. There is a large and
              prosperous Sunday-school attached, with an average attendance of about one hundred and
              fifty. Collection, from two to five dollars per Sabbath. Nelson Bradley superintendent
              and Eddie Thayer secretary.
          
          
            MT. GILEAD CHURCH (BAPTIST).
            On the 15th day of August, 1827, a few individuals of the Baptist faith met to
              discuss the propriety of adopting a constitution and establishing a place of worship,
              which resulted in a decision to extend a cordial invitation to John Caldwell and
              brethren, of Blue-river township, and Abram Smock and brethren, of Bethel church, to
              "come over into Macedonia " and lend a helping hand. Accordingly, on the 19th day of
              August there was a meeting at the house of Mr. Samuel Jackson, with the ministers and
              members aforesaid present; and after preaching by Elders Smock and Caldwell, followed
              by an investigation of the faith of the prospective members, they were constituted
              into a church, to be named and known as Brandywine church. The following persons were
              received into membership, and given the right hand of fellowship, viz.: Samuel and
              Rachel Jackson, Benjamin and Jane Spillman, and James and Elizabeth Reeves. The church
              bore the name of Brandywine till the 2nd Saturday of August, 1838, at which time the
              members gave it the name of Mt. Gilead, by which it is known to this day.
            The following have been moderators, viz.: Benjamin Spillman, Elders
              ——— McQuary, Thomas Martin, C. Hood, T. Martin, William Baker, David
              Caudel, ——— Zion, G. S. Weaver, William H. Curtis; the last of whom
              is the moderator at this date.
            This church is located four miles north-west of Greenfield,  on the Noblesville road, on the west side, in a small grove. The building
              is an old frame, antique in style and void of paint.
          
          
            CURRY'S CHAPEL (METHODIST EPISCOPAL),
            is located about five miles north-east of Greenfield. Methodist meetings in this
              neighborhood were first held about 1830; but not till 1834 was there a permanent
              organization, and meetings were held for a time at the private residences of Moses
              Vangilder, James Park, and others, till 1843, when a log meeting-house was erected
              near by where the present frame now stands. At that date, and until within the last
              few years, this charge belonged to the Greenfield circuit. In 1866, the old log was
              superseded by a neat frame, costing $1,300. It was dedicated by J. W. T. McMullen. The
              first pastor was Rev. Barwick. The first class-leader was William Martindale. The
              present pastor is Rev. H. Woolpert. A Sunday-school is sustained during the summer
              season.
          
          
            SUGAR CREEK M. E. CHURCH,
            located five miles north-west of Greenfield, on the banks of Sugar Creek, was
              organized in the year 1838. Among the first members were James Gant, Jeremiah Gant,
              John Alexander, H. Hunt, Robert Wilson, and Thomas Smith. In 1840 they erected a log
              church, prior to which time they had no regular place of meeting. In this log house
              they held forth and prospered till 1872, when they erected the present neat frame, at
              a cost of $1,000.. Among the shepherds who have fed the flock at this point were John
              Burt, George Havens, John Millender, G. W. Bowers, and Emerson and Beasley. The first
              trustees were John Alexander, Hezekiah Hunt, and Robert Wilson. This charge is now
              attached to the Philadelphia circuit. The present minister is H. Woolpert.
          
          
          
            MT. CARMEL M. E. CHURCH,
            in the north-west corner of Center township, on the banks of Sugar Creek, was
              organized about 1838, in a log school-house near where the present house stands. Among
              the first members were Owen and Andrew Jarrett, Martha Swope, William and Polly Jones,
              John Alley, Riley Taylor, John and Nancy Lewis, Samuel Henry and wife, and Martha
              Chapman, wife of Hon. Joseph Chapman. This organization moved quietly along with
              reasonable success till 1850, when, under the ministration of Eli Rammel, a remarkable
              revival was had, in which over one hundred were added to the membership of the church.
              In 1853, the society had so grown in size and means that it decided on the building of
              a house, which resulted in the erection of the present frame, by Henry L. Moore, at a
              cost of $800, and is now attached to the Philadelphia circuit.
          
          
            GREENFIELD CORNET BAND
            was organized in 1865, from a remnant of a band that existed during the war, and
              prospered till 1874, when it was reorganized and equipped, with considerable change in
              the membership. There having been no record kept of the organization, we are unable to
              give the names of the members, with any degree of certainty, during her early
              existence. The following are the names of the present organization, viz.: Isaac R.
              Davis, Thomas Carr, John Davis, Charles Davis, Abijah Davis, Penn Bidgood, Geatano
              Ponti, Quinn Johnson, Frank Barr, and Charles Carter. The members are uniformed, and
              supplied with good instruments, at a cost of $250, and a band wagon worth $600.
          
          
            STEPHEN T. DICKERSON.
            The subject of this sketch was. born October 27, 1830, one mile east of Fountaintown,
              Shelby county, Indiana, where he remained with his father on the old homestead 
              
                STEPHEN T. DICKERSON.
              
               till the date of his marriage with Nancy Wiggins, of
              Hancock county, in the twenty-second year of his age.
            Mr. D. engaged in the stock trade at the age of eighteen with George Roberts. Their
              first speculation was in sheep, purchased north of Greenfield, of Harlan Reeves and
              others in that neighborhood, at fifty cents per head for the choice of the flock. His
              next trade was with Hugh Wooster, of Greenfield, of whom he purchased fifteen large,
              choice steers, at $15 each. When they were turned out of the large woods pasture, on
              the farm now owned by John T. Lineback, to drive to town, they bounded off through the
              woods and brush and over the logs at such a rate that Mr. D. got completely lost, and
              came on to Greenfield to await results. In the course of an hour Mr. Wooster put in an
              appearance with the cattle, telling Dickerson that he was not worth a "continental
              copper" to drive stock, or he could get through the brush fast enough to keep up with
              an old man like him. Mr. D. has been in the stock trade in Hancock county for
              thirty-three years, and has probably bought and sold more stock than any other man in
              the county; and we may add, has always enjoyed the confidence and esteem of his
              customers and the public generally. He also filled the office of trustee of Center
              township for two consecutive terms, during which he took great interest in the
              schools, and encouraged both pupil and teacher by frequent visits.
            Mr. D. is a liberal, public-spirited man, and has taken great interest in organizing
              pike companies, and encouraging the citizens of the county to construct good gravel
              roads, to which he has always been a liberal subscriber. It was through his management
              that the Greenfield and New Palestine gravel road was completed, which was probably
              the most difficult road of the kind ever made in the county, owing to the distance to
              which the gravel had to be hauled, being on an average of more than two miles. Mr. D.
              also organized the Center and Brandywine Pike Company, and was one of its most liberal
              subscribers.
            He was one of the first children born on Brandywine, 
              and, consequently, has seen a good deal of pioneer life. He says that the first apple
              that he ever saw growing was in the orchard of James Smith, about five miles south of
              Greenfield. He recollects the first frame house, sawed boards and painting, in the
              neighborhood. It was on the farm of Robert P. Brown, built by the late Jacob
              Foglesong. When Mr. D. first saw Greenfield, there were but two houses south of Main
              street; one, he thinks, was Mr. Offutt's and the other was near where Mr. Paullus' new
              residence now stands. The first public gathering which he recollects attending was
              "muster," on "muster day," at James Goodwin's residence, now owned by John Richey, of
              Brandywine township. He attended school on Hominy Ridge, and was one of the boys that
              helped to carry Jackson Porter on a rail to Brandywine before he would "come down"
              with the cider, apples and ginger-bread. Mr. D. says he well recollects when there
              were more still-houses in Brandywine township, Hancock county, and Van Buren township,
              Shelby county, than there were school-houses; and that it was a very common thing for
              the neighbors to send to the still-houses for beer, and use it in the place of milk to
              drink. But notwithstanding the evils of that day, the young folks had their sport and
              amusement of many kinds. In the fall and winter seasons there would be a wood-chopping
              and quilting in the neighborhood about once a week, and a dance at night. Then there
              were the apple bees, pumpkin peelings, flax pullings, and corn-husking—all
              sources of amusement. When the Mt. Lebanon church was organized, a great number of the
              young joined, and held out faithful for a season; but when the time for parties
              arrived, no small number would persist in dancing, greatly against the rules laid down
              by old Fathers Muth and Havens, the clerical advisers of that time. Mr. D. well
              remembers seeing one young fellow arraigned before one of the old fathers, charged
              with the sin of dancing. His reply to which not being satisfactory, he was told that
              it would not be tolerated. "Then," said the youngster, "take my name off the church
              book. I  only intended to join through the sickly
              season." Mr. D. is in harmony with the doctrines of the Christian Church, and has ever
              been liberal in the support of the same. He is a democrat in principle, though not
              dogmatic in his views, and was always opposed to slavery. Mr. D. is president of the
              New Palestine gravel road, and has several times served as president of the Hancock
              Agricultural Society, and has ever been an enterprising, energetic citizen.
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XIII.GREEN TOWNSHIP.
          
            MAP OF GREEN TOWNSHIP.
            SHOWING THE SECTIONS, TOWNSHIP, AND RANGES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED.
          
          Name and Organization.—This township took its name from John
            Green, the first settler, or at least one of the first settlers thereof. It was
            organized in 1832, and then consisted of sixty sections, the same territory now embodied
            in Brown and Green. It was taken from the north  part of
            Harrison and Jackson, which in 1831 extended to the north line of the county, their
            southern boundary being the same as shown on map, page 89. In 1833 Brown was taken from
            the east part of the original Green township, leaving it composed of thirty sections,
            the present size. *
          Location, Size, Boundary, etc.—Green township is located in the
            central northern portion of the county, and in extent is five miles north and south and
            six miles east and west, being uniform in size with Brown and Blue-river. It is bounded
            on the north by Madison county, on the east by Brown township, on the south by Jackson
            and Center, and on the west by Vernon. It is located in township seventeen north and in
            ranges six and seven east. The west tier of sections is in range six east, and the
            remainder in range seven east. The range line runs one mile west of Eden, and forms the
            east line of Thomas McClarnon's farm.
          Surface, Soil, Drainage, and Productions.—The surface is
            generally level and slightly undulating, with the exception of a small portion bordering
            along Sugar Creek. The greater portion of the soil is a black loam, rich and productive,
            and portions of the uplands a good clay, both red and blue. There is but very little
            third-rate land in the township at this date, since the recent attention given to tile
            draining and public ditching. The chief productions are hogs, cattle, wheat, corn,
            horses, oats, flaxseed, and Irish potatoes. She has no factories, and owing to her
            distance from the railroad heretofore, she has not drawn so heavily on her forests as
            her sister townships have done. In 1880 she produced from 3,094 acres, 52,598 bushels of
            wheat; from 3,362 acres, 92,796 bushels of corn; from 349 acres, 8,027 bushels of oats;
            being about an average township of the county. For the same year she reported 753 tons
            of hay, 266 bushels of Irish potatoes, and 905 lbs. of tobacco.
          *For a fuller history of the
            organization and boundaries see pages 31
            and 90.
          
          Streams.—Sugar Creek* takes a general diagonal course across the township. It
            enters on the east line; one and one-half miles south of the north-east corner, and runs
            one mile north-west; thence two miles south-west into section twenty-two, in the middle
            tier of sections; thence in a general westerly course, passing Eden on the north,
            through sections twenty-one, twenty and nineteen to the center of section twenty-four;
            thence in a south by south-west course, passing out of the township at the north-west
            corner of section thirty-six.
          A small stream rises on the south line of section thirty-two, runs north by north-west,
            and flows into Sugar Creek on the west line of section nineteen.
          Swamp Creek extends through sections thirty-two and twenty-nine, and enters Sugar Creek
            near the center of section twenty.
          First Land Entries and First Settlers.—The first land entered
            in Green township was by William Shortridge, on the 26th day of May, 1829, being the
            northeast quarter of section nineteen, township seventeen north, in range seven east,
            lying north of Eden. John Green and Andrew Jackson made entries a little later in the
            same year.
          The first settlers were John Green, from whom the township was named; William Rickard,
            Miles Walker, Thomas Dorson, John Hanger, Vincent Cooper, John L. Alford, Abraham Rhue,
            Robert Walker (father of Rev. Miles Walker), Thomas L. Fuqua, and John Denney; all of
            whom settled prior to 1833. Afterwards came Jonathan Horniday, Isaiah and Jesse Jackson,
            John Forgy, Willliam Thomas; Joseph, William and Jesse Roberts; Jacob and William Amack,
            James Walker, Edward Barrett; George Henry, associate judge; Samuel Henry, William
            Galbreath, and John Myers. Most of the above have long since bid adieu to terrestrial
            scenes; but are still green in the memory of many of the older citizens who will read
            these names. Many of them we are unable to *To locate the streams accurately, observe our section map at the
              head of this chapter.
            learn much about, except that they were representative
            pioneer men, modest, unassuming, never aspiring to office, industrious, hardy and
            hospitable. Their names are doubtless written in the Lambs Book of Life, and are now
            found in the history of the county, to be handed down to the third and fourth
            generations, and remembered as the forerunners of a brighter civilization. There are
            doubtless others who might, with propriety, be placed in the list; but to name all would
            be tedious.
          First Election, etc.—At the first election held in Green in her
            original size, as shown on page 89, there were but nine votes cast. The election was
            held at the residence of Morgan McQuary. The first election in Green after Brown was
            struck off was held at the residence of John Hanger. The votes were cast in a hat, and
            covered with a kerchief. We hear of no complaints and serious charges of stuffing the
            ballot-boxes in those primitive days.
          Historical Anecdote.—In June, 1833, Rev. Miles Walker, John
            Walker and Vincent Cooper, caught thirteen young wolves, about the size of a six months'
            cur dog, in the hollow of a log. They brought the scalps to Greenfield, and the county
            gave them a credit of fifty cents per scalp on their taxes, and the state paid a reward
            of the same amount in money. Before they could avail themselves of the bounty of either
            state or county, however, they had to comply with the law requiring them to take an
            "iron-clad" oath that they had never raised a female wolf, nor owned a male dog part
            wolf, for the last ten years. The policy of this requirement was to prevent citizens
            raising wolves for their scalps, and the reward obtained therefor. Wolves were numerous
            at this early date, and very destructive to sheep, and especially to lambs and pigs,
            insomuch that it was impossible to raise them without penning.
          A Few First Things.—The first preacher in Green township was
            Stephen Masters, one of the pioneer preachers of the county, who is reported as the
            first and one of the first in all the north-western portions of the county. The first
            teacher was Miss Eliza Moore. The first physician  was
            Paul Moore. The first death was that of Samuel Walker, buried at the Baptist church, in
            the west part of the township; being the first burial also. The first road was the
            blazed route from Greenfield to Pendleton, the county-seat of Madison county. The first
            miller was George Mason. The first school was near Eden. The first church building was
            by the Baptists. The first church organization was by the Methodists. The first merchant
            was George Henry, father of Attorney Charles Henry, of Anderson. The first post-office
            was at Eden. The first tanners were Dudley Eakes and J. Price.
          Mills.—In 1835 George Mason had erected the first water-mill,
            grist and saw mill combined, in the township, located on Sugar Creek, north-east of
            Eden. Indeed, it was the first mill of any kind in the township.
          In 1836 William Beeson erected the second water-mill in the township. It was located
            about two and one-half miles east of Eden, and cracked corn and scratched logs for
            several years.
          Subsequently Bragg & Guy built the first steam sash saw-mill in the township, near
            Eden. It was traded and sold several times, burned down in 856, rebuilt by Samuel
            Archer, and finally moved away.
          Dr. Samuel A. Troy, in 1865, put in operation a circular saw mill, three miles east of
            Eden, operated it for a time, and then sold to Trueblood & Barrett. Barrett sold to
            Walker, and the new firm, Trueblood & Walker, moved it on the Henry land, south-west
            of Eden. It was then run for a time by Cooper & Roberts, and finally moved away.
          A steam saw-mill was operated on H. B. Wilson's farm, three miles east of Eden, for a
            few years. It was moved away about 1878.
          About 1873, a steam saw-mill was set in operation at Milner's Corner, by Walton, Rule
            & Milner, which required about eighteen months to devour the saw timber in that
            vicinity, when it departed. A steam saw-mill was built at Eden, by C. Mingle, about
            1875, and is still in operation.
          
          Stephen V. Tucker erected a steam saw-mill at Milner's Corner in 1880, which is still
            running.
          There are no factories nor flouring mills in the township; though there is a good
            opening for both, and especially should the North and South railroad come through, as
            contemplated.
          Roads.—Green township has twelve miles of toll pike, and ten
            miles the charter to which has been surrendered. The Greenfield and Pendleton pike
            extends across the township from north to south. There is a line extending from Eden to
            Warringotn; one from Eden to McCordsville; another from Eden to Fortville; and one from
            Eden to Milner's Corner. The last three lines do not extend to Eden directly, but
            intersect the North and South pike, near thereto, so that the several points mentioned
            are reached by pike.
          Green is the only township in the county without a rail-road, and she recently voted
            $10,000 to the prospective Anderson and Shelbyville road, which, it is thought, will
            pass through Eden.
          Educational.—"'Tis education forms the common mind; as the twig
            is bent the tree is inclined." The first settlers, though void of a finished literary
            and classic education, and not even possessing the rudiments in many cases, yet they
            began early to give some attention to the education of their children, and small schools
            were sustained in the winter months in the more thickly settled neighborhoods where
            enough children could be gotten together to constitute a school, and a teacher could be
            secured to teach the young idea to shoot at from twenty to forty dollars per quarter and
            "found," or "board round." Among the first "school-masters" and "school-marms" of this
            section were Miss Eliza Moore, a relative of the present resident Moores of the
            township; George Henry, afterwards associate judge and representative; David McKinsey, a
            faithful, efficient instructor for the time, but now among the unfortunates faring in
            the county infirmary; and Sanford and Jehu Lewis, brother pedagogues. The  first school-house was built in 1836, and located a short
            distance north-east of Eden. It was one of those primitive "educational institutions"
            made wholly of saplings and split boards, without paint, putty, glass, iron, or modern
            patent fixtures of any kind. Soon after this there was one of a similar kind in the
            north-east part of the township.
          Green, however, like other townships outside of Center, was opposed to the
            establishment of free schools. In the vote of the county on the free school question in
            1848, she cast seventy-five votes for "free school" and ninety-one votes for "no
            school"; and in 1849 the vote stood, "free school," forty-five; "no school," one
            hundred.
          The following table will show the names of the public school-houses in Green and the
            present instructors:

          Green township has ten small frame school-houses, valued at, including grounds,
            furniture and outbuilding, $4,000. Her maps, charts, globes and other school apparatus
            are valued at $100. Total value of school property in the township, $4,100.
          There has been a gradual, steady decline in the number of school children in this
            township since 1853, the first enumeration. The enumeration for 1853 was 474; for 1860,
            406; for 1870, 388; for 1880, 384; and for 1881, 353; a decrease of 121 in the last
            twenty-eight years.
          Township Trustees.—The following list shows the names of the
            trustees and their date of appointment from 1859, at which time they were empowered by
            law to levy  a local tuition tax, and the office assumed
            some dignity and significance:
          
            
              Meredith Gosney
              1859
            
            
              Edward Valentine
              1861
            
            
              Joseph Barrett
              1865
            
            
              Edward Valentine
              1866
            
            
              Andrew H. Barrett
              1869
            
            
              William L. McKinsey
              1874
            
            
              Sidney Moore
              1880
            
          
          Remarks: Meredith Gosney, who figures extensively in the early history of the township,
            was the first trustee under the improved school law. He held the office for two terms of
            one year each. Edward Valentine carried the township through the perilous times of the
            civil war, being four times elected. Andrew H. Barrett was the first trustee who had the
            opportunity of voting for county superintendent of schools. We have dipped salt with
            "Andy" more than once. May he live long and prosper. William L. McKinsey held the office
            longer than any other trustee who has filled the place. Sidney Moore looks after the
            poor and pedagogues at this date.
          Churches.—This township, for reasons unknown to the writer, is
            not as bountifully supplied with good buildings especially dedicated to the worship of
            the author of all good as her sister townships; but possibly what she lacks in numbers
            she makes up in the efficiency of the few. Green reports three church buildings, viz.:
            Two Methodist Episcopal and one Christian. But it must be borne in mind that Green has
            no saloons or billiard halls, and, perhaps, less evil to counteract.
          Population and Poll.—An examination of the United States census
            reports for the past few decades shows a slow growth for a time, and recently a decline
            in the population. The report for 1850 gives her 1,019 souls; for 1860, 1,007; for 1870,
            1,177; and for 1880, 1,166; a growth in twenty years of one hundred and fifty-eight and
            then a decline in the last ten years of eleven, for which we are scarcely able to
            account, considering her steady growth in wealth, good roads, and other improvements.
            But  there is a great tendency among the young in this
            fast age to leave the monotony of the country and seek the town and city. The railroad
            enthusiast would make an argument in favor of railroads out of the circumstance; and,
            indeed, it is rather a singular circumstance, if such it may be called, that the only
            township without a railroad should be the only one declining in population. The stickler
            for plain dress, rather than frivolous fashions, would say that it is owing to her
            having no dress-making establishments and milliner shops. The falling off in numbers
            seems not to have been among the men and boys for the last ten years. There was only a
            loss of four school children during the decade, while there was an increase of
            thirty-one taxable polls, the numbers standing thus: Taxable polls for 1870, 190; for
            1880, 221; and for 1881, 231; showing an increase of forty-one taxable polls in eleven
            years. But we will state the facts and figures, and leave the reader to draw his own
            conclusions. The polls in Green for 1840 were 130; in 1850, 149; in 1860, 178.
          Vote.—Green township for 1860 cast 184 votes; for 1870, 229;
            for 1880, 286; with a democratic majorty of fifty-four for 1880. The vote stood:
            Democratic, 170; republican, 116. The voting precinct is Eden.
          Value of Real and Personal Property.—Green township is assessed
            on 19,194 acres of land, valued at $372,110, and improvements on the same valued at
            $101,050, being an average of about $25 per acre. Value of lots, $1,625; value of
            improvements on same, $9,120. Value of personal property, $129,670. Total value of
            taxables, $613,595. The total value of taxables for 1839 was $60,930, less than
            one-tenth of the amount for 1881.
          Taxes.—Green township paid taxes to the amount of $599.19 in
            1842, $836.18 in 1850, $3,465.52 in 1860, $5,652.34 in 1870, and the levy for 1881, to
            be paid in 1882, is $6,528.44; an examination of which shows a rapid growth in taxation.
            The levy on each $100 is ninety-four cents.
          The following list shows the heavy tax-payers in Green 
            township; being a complete showing of those who will pay $40 taxes and upward in
            1882:

          Law and Esquires.—The policy of our law is to bring justice
            near the door of every man, to offer an opportunity for the convenient adjustment of
            petty grievances at the least possible expense to the people. For this purpose Indiana,
            following in the wake of the English custom, wisely embodied in her constitution a
            provision for the election in each township of a competent number of justices of the
            peace, who shall continue in office four years. These officers are empowered to act in
            both a ministerial and judicial capacity. Ministerially, in preserving
            the peace. Judicially, as when he convicts for an offense. In the
            prosecution of said policy, the following men have filled the office of justice of the
            peace for a time, being elected at the dates set opposite their names:
          
            John L. Alford1833

            W. T. Hamilton1870
            William Collins1880
          
          Remarks: John L. Alford was the first justice in the township. Twelve of the above
            number served one term each. Elijah S. Cooper and William Barrett filled the office for
            eight years each. William Cook and J. M. Trueblood were each three times elected. W. R.
            Ferrell, who was first elected thirty-five years ago, is now on his fourth term. Ferrell
            and William Collins preside at the scales of justice in the township at this date. About
            half of the above have bid adieu to earthly courts, to appear at the bar Divine before
            the Judge Supreme of all the earth.
          First Business.—The first business of this section was done at
            Pendleton, where the pioneers went to exchange their furs, ginseng, venison, and
            porkers, for a few of the staple articles. For milling they went to Fall Creek. The
            first stores in the township were at Eden, a central point for the first settlements.
            Among the first merchants were George Henry, C. & J. Lewis, J. & E. McPherson,
            J. A. Alford, the "Squire," and Hiram Barrett. Later were Brandt & Fry and Barrett
            & Co. Very early in the history of the township Dudley Eakes run a tannery in the
            south-west part of the township, on Leander Roberts's farm. His vats consisted of large
            troughs made of walnut. Later John Price had a tannery in Eden. In 1850 Speagle carried
            on a blacksmith shop in the eastern part of the township. Jonathan Smith opened a store
            at Willow Branch in 1853, and was the first postmaster on the establishing of the
            post-office in 1854.
          Physicians.—The first settlers of Green, in case of serious
            sickness, called for aid on the medical talent of Pendleton and Greenfield. The first
            resident physician  was Paul Moore, followed by William
            Loder, Jones & Edwards (the latter of whom is now holding forth in Greenfield), and
            J. J. Carter.
          Ex-County Officers.—This was the home of George Henry,
            associate judge, county surveyor, and representative. Here lived Andrew T. Hatfield,
            representative; Elijah S. Cooper, county treasurer; Samuel Archer, sheriff; and Robison
            Jarrett, commissioner. Jonathan Smith, ex-commissioner, is still among the living.
          Prominent Families,—This is the home of the Barretts, Ferrells,
            Mingles, Walkers, Robertses, Wilsons, Jarretts, Alfords, Coopers, Henrys, Moores,
            Crists, Troys, Collins, Kellers, Barnards, Franks, Cooks, Smiths, McKinseys, Baitys,
            Truebloods, McClarnons, and Olveys.
          Murders and Fatal Accidents.—In, or about, 1831, two men, who
            were from Madison county, camped out in the woods, and built a fire beside a dead tree,
            as a protection against the wolves, and retired for the night, during which the tree set
            on fire fell on one of them. The other built a pen around him, to prevent his being
            devoured by the wolves, while he procured assistance to remove the log from the
            body.
          Michael Crist, father of John and George, was found dead in the public highway, near
            the Crist school-house, April 26, 1876. Aged eighty-five years.
          On the 8th of May, 1877, William Cook, Esquire, was found dead in the woods beside a
            log, near where he had been cutting wood.
          A boy by the name of Johnson was killed at the Cooper saw-mill, a few years since, by a
            saw-log rolling over him.
          The most foul, atrocious, diabolical and unnatural murder that we are called upon to
            record in the history of the county was perpetrated, on the night of June 7th, 1878, in
            Green township, on the persons of Mrs. Sarah Jane Wilson, aged forty-three years, widow
            of the late Woodford Wilson, and her little niece, Anaretta Cass, aged six years. The
            strange, sad news of this atrocious double murder  soon
            spread throughout the county, and before noon of the next day hundreds of people could
            be seen rapidly making their way to the sad scene, and surrounding the house were
            hundreds more, filled with anguish and anger at what had transpired. By whom and just
            how this scene was enacted, has never been legally determined. The plain facts in the
            case are about as follows: Mrs. Wilson and 
              SARAH JANE WILSON.
             her little niece lived alone on her farm, about two miles east of Eden. They
            were at peace with the world, having harmed no one, and anticipated no trouble or
            personal violence from any body, and had only taken the usual precaution of locking the
            doors and windows, not deeming it necessary to go to the trouble and expense of having
            additional company to stay with them of nights. Next morning Mrs. Wilson was found dead,
            lying on her face on the  floor in the sitting-room, in
            her night clothes, partially covered with a thin comfort. Anaretta was found on the
            floor near the door of their bedroom, lying almost naked. The bodies were examined by
            good physicians, which developed the fact that they had come to their deaths by
            strangulation from pressure of the thumb and fingers of the left hand of a man, the
            marks of the ends of the fingers 
              ANARETTA CASS.
             being plainly visible on either side of the trachea. It is left to
            circumstantial evidence, "theory and reason to determine the cause and manner of this
            double crime. It is supposed that the party, or parties, by some means gained entrance
            to the rear of the house, committed the rash act, and made his, or their, exit at the
            front door, breaking a glass beside the door in passing out. The theory is supported by
            the fact that the broken pieces of glass were  found on
            the porch and none on the inside of the room. Considerable effort was made to discover
            the guilty parties, but to no avail. Time and eternity may develop the facts, but as yet
            it is shrouded in mystery. We only know that two innocent lives were violently and
            suddenly plunged into eternity by some hellish fiend in human form. Who can look at the
            portraits of the innocent victims, and contemplate the atrocity of the crime, without
            feelings of holy indignation?

          CHAPTER XIV.
            GREEN TOWNSHIP—Continued.
          
            EDEN.
            The modern Eden, once known as Lewisburg, was laid out on the 21st of August, 1835,
              by—the records fail to show whom, but the older citizens say by Alford—and
              consisted of thirty-five lots. The first and only addition to this date was made by
              Levi Archer, on the 26th of April, 1871, with seventeen lots. It is a small village,
              on the south bank of Sugar Creek, near the center of the township, eight miles north
              of Greenfield and seven south of Pendleton, on the pike. It has one church, a district
              school, a pleasant location; a post-office, with mail tri-weekly, L. A. Riggs,
              postmaster; and the following business men, to-wit:
            
              Merchants—
                
                  L. A. Riggs,
                  Joseph Canohan.
                
              Painter and Carriage Maker—
                
                  E. P. Lawrence.

                  B. J. Jackson,
                  A. H. Barrett.
                
              Boot and Shoe Makers—
                
                  Trueblood & Jarrett.
                
              Physicians—
                
                  John A. Justice,
                  W. A. Justice.
                
              Undertaker—
                
                  J. M. Trueblood.
                
              Carpenter—
                
                  A. J. Popink.
                
              Blacksmiths—
                
                  A. J. Taylor,
                  Henry Curtis,
                  Green Osborn (a little east of town).
                
            
          
          
            MILNER'S CORNER.
            The second post-office in the township is known as Milner's Corner, located in the
              central eastern part of the township, on the line between Green and Brown. It is  about thirteen miles north-east of Greenfield, and
              derived its name from James Milner, in 1850. There has never been a plat of the place
              made and recorded, and, consequently, no additions.
            The first store at this point was kept by David McKinsey, an ex school-teacher,
              followed by John Dawson, Henry Milner, Nimrod Davis, Joseph Decamp, Caldwell &
              Keller, William and Joseph Bills, S. A. Troy, Tague & Brother, and W. Vanzant. The
              present merchant is Charles H. Troy. The post-office was established in 1868; the
              first postmaster was Nimrod Davis; the present employee of Uncle Sam is Charles H.
              Troy. The previous physicians were D. H. Myers, S. A. Troy, George Williams, and
              Charles Pratt; the present physician is S. A. Troy. The blacksmiths are Vandyke and
              Manning; the wood-workmen are Josiah Long and Joel Manning. It has a steam saw-mill,
              owned by L. Tucker, previously mentioned; capacity, five thousand feet per day;
              employs four hands. Mail tri-weekly.
          
          
            EDEN CHAPEL (M. E.)
            The first meetings of this order, in the early history of the township, were held
              near Eden, in the private dwellings of Blackburn, Thomas Dorson, Robert Walker, and
              Robison Jarrett. The first ministers were Stephen Masters and James Vess. The first
              itinerant minister was Rev. Donaldson, followed by Revs. John Leach and Frank
              Richmond. In 1838, the society erected a log house at Eden, near where the present
              frame stands, in the east part of town. Here it held forth till about 1860, when it
              erected the present building, a commodious frame, at a cost of $1,500. It was
              dedicated by Rev. John McCarty. Near by is a cemetery, where slumber many loved ones
              that have died in the faith, and are now members of the church triumphant. The first
              burial here was Enos Jarrett. The present minister is Rev. John S. McCarty. The
              society is in a flourishing condition. A  very
              interesting revival has recently been experienced, which has added a goodly number to
              the church roll. This charge formerly belonged to the Greenfield circuit, and was
              supplied by the Greenfield minister.
          
          
            ROBERTS CHAPEL.
            In an early day there was an M. E. church building and organization in the Roberts
              neighborhood, south-west of Eden, called the Roberts Chapel. The first members are
              dead. Some lost their zeal, others found it about as convenient to worship at other
              points, and the organization went down and the membership was scattered.
          
          
            REGULAR BAPTIST CHURCH.
            While the Methodists had the first society in this township, the Baptists built the
              first church house. It was a small log, eighteen by twenty feet, erected in 1830, and
              located one and one-half miles west of Eden, near the line between Green and Vernon
              townships. Elder Morgan McQuery organized the society, and preached there for several
              years, followed by Charles McCarty and others, when the organization moved to Vernon
              township. The old graveyard near by still remains to mark the place of the first
              church in Green township, as well as a number of the first burials. The first
              interment in this lonely spot was Samuel Walker.
          
          
            LICK CREEK CHRISTIAN CHURCH
            is located in the north-west part of the township. Benjamin Legg, John H. Huston,
              Snodgrass, Joseph Winn and Lawson Fuqua were among the first members. Elders David
              Franklin and W. F. Ackman were for a time its ministers. Elder J. W. Ferrell preached
              there nineteen nights during a revival, and had nineteen accessions. The building is a
              good frame, the church is in a prosperous condition, and a lively Sunday-school is
              sustained  in connection with it. Several of the most
              prominent and influential persons of the vicinity are members of this church, and
              throw their influence on the side of truth, morality and Christianity.
          
          
            DR. JOSEPH J. CARTER
            was born in Green county, East Tennessee, March 7, 1823. He came with his parents to
              Wayne county, Indiana, in 1829, thence to Madison county in 1830, when the country was
              new and the forests unbroken. There he 
                DR. J. J. CARTER.
               labored on the farm with his father and brothers till he arrived at
              majority, when he began the study of medicine at Pendleton, the county seat, with Dr.
              Thomas Jones. After taking a course of study, he located at Eden and began the
              practice of medicine with Dr. William S. Loder. Aspiring to loftier attainments, and a
              fuller understanding of the abstruse mysteries of materia medica, he
              determined on a regular college course of reading and lectures, and consequently had
              the honor of graduating at the Cincinnati Medical College in the spring of 1856.
            In 1860, April I7th, he was joined in marriage with 
              Miss Sarah J. Smith, with whom he lived happily to the day of his death. He was a
              consistent member of the M. E. Church for more than forty years. During his long and
              extensive practice, he made hosts of friends and but few enemies. He was a man of
              noble impulses, generous and hospitable, in whom the people had the fullest
              confidence. He died on the 29th of January, 1879, after a very short illness, in his
              fifty-sixth year, leaving the companion of his bosom and two promising boys to mourn
              his untimely death.
            In the death of Dr. Carter the community lost an attentive, skillful physician, the
              church a faithful member, and the family a kind husband and an indulgent father. His
              family now reside in Greenfield; the boys are young men, the older of whom will
              graduate at the Indianapolis Medical College shortly.
          
          
            EDEN LODGE, No. 477, F. A. M.,
            was chartered May 26, 1874. The charter members were L. H. Riggs, E. S. Bragg, G.
              Morrison, A. H. Trueblood, D. H. Alford, T. T. Barrett, Samuel Alford, J. W. Green, G.
              W. Hopkins, and A. W. Powell. The lodge has never been large, but is healthy and
              prosperous, with a present membership of twenty-four. The present officers are: D. H.
              Beaty, W. M.; W. A. Justice, S. W.; H. B. Wilson, J. W.; A. H. Trueblood, S. D.; John
              Crist, J. D.; Isaac S. Barrett, Treasurer; A. H. Barrett, Secretary; J. W. Anderson,
              Tyler; Samuel Alford and J. M. Trueblood, Stewards. Its meetings occur on Saturday
              evening on or before the full of the moon of each month.
          
          
            CENTER GROVE M. E. CHURCH.
            In 1845, the Episcopal Methodists organized a class three miles east of Eden. Their
              meetings were held for a time at the Barrett school-house. As the society increased in
              strength and numbers, it determined on a place of worship under its own control, which
              resulted in  the building, in 1854, of a convenient
              frame, at a cost of $1,200, which was recently fully repaired and put in good order,
              and dedicated by Rev. Frank Harding. The present preacher is Rev. H. Woolpert. They
              have regular services. There is no graveyard in connection with the church property,
              but they use one located north, on the banks of Sugar Creek, where the mortal remains
              of the late lamented murdered Mrs. Wilson and her niece were buried.
          
          
            DR. SAMUEL A. TROY
            was born at Batavia, Clermont county, Ohio, August 27, 1827, and is, consequently, in
              his fifty-fifth year. He was left an orphan at the early age of ten years. The family
                
                DR. S. A. TROY.
               being poor, he was at once thrown on his own resources. He learned the trade
              of cabinet-maker; came to Anderson, Madison county, in the spring of 1847; thence to
              New Columbus, where he continued to work at his trade; and in April, 1849, was married
              to Elizabeth, daughter of Abner Cory. He then moved to York, in Delaware county, where
              he began the study of medicine with Dr. 
              
                THOMAS COLLINS.
              
               John Horn. His wife died shortly after, when he again
              moved to New Columbus, and continued his studies with Dr. Weyman. In 1854 he was a
              second time married; this time to Martha Manning. He then attended a course of
              lectures at the Cincinnati Eclectic Medical College; then returned and located near
              Bunker Hill, this county; thence to Cleveland, where he formed a profitable
              partnership with Dr. Amos Bundy, which continued for five years; thence to his farm in
              Green township, where he practiced for several years. He was a candidate for
              representative before the democratic nominating convention in 1868, and was defeated
              by the Hon. Noble Warrum by three votes only. In 1870 he moved to Fortville, and was
              the prime mover in organizing the Fortville band, which, in honor of its founder, was
              named the "Troy Band." While there he was in partnership with Drs. Stuart and Yancy.
              The Dr. is now located at Milner's Corner, where he has an extensive and lucrative
              practice.
          
          
            EDEN CHURCH (BAPTIST)
            was organized at the Crist school-house on the second Sunday in April, 1871. On the
              day of organization, after praise and prayer by the brethren, Elder Gavin Morrison was
              chosen moderator, and G. W. Hopkins clerk. Elder M. Lummis, of Kentucky, aided in
              establishing this church. The following are the original members: G. W. and Henrietta

          CHAPTER XV. JACKSON TOWNSHIP.
          
            MAP OF JACKSON TOWNSHIP.
            SHOWING THE SECTIONS, TOWNSHIP, AND RANGES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED.
          
          Name and Organization.—This township took its name from "Old
            Hickory," President of the United States, at  the time of
            the formation of the township. It was organized in 1831, at which time it was struck off
            from the north part of Blue-river, having its present southern boundary and extending to
            the Madison county line on the north, and consequently embodied the same territory now
            included in Jackson and Brown. In 1832 Green was formed, embodying the territory now
            included in Brown and Green. In 1833 Brown was formed from the east part of Green.
            Hence, from 1831 to 1832 Madison county formed the northern boundary of Jackson, and
            from 1832 to 1833 Green formed said boundary. From 1833 to 1850 Brown, Harrison and
            Green constituted said boundary. From 1850 to 1853 Worth and Harrison formed her
            northern boundary. Since 1853 there has been no change in her boundaries.
          Location, Boundary, Size, etc.—It is located in the central
            eastern part of the county, and is bounded on the north by Brown and Green townships, on
            the east by Henry county, on the south by Rush county and Blue-river township, and on
            the west by Center township. In extent it is six miles square, and hence contains
            thirty-six square miles. It lies in township sixteen north, and is in ranges seven and
            eight east, one tier of sections on the west being in range seven east and the remainder
            in eight east. The range line runs past Brown's Chapel, Leamon's Corner and Bunker
            Hill.
          Surface, Soil, Drainage, and Productions.—The surface for the
            most part is quite level; especially in the north-eastern, central southern, and central
            western portions. Along Six Mile, Nameless and Brandywine creeks there are occasionally
            low banks, and a somewhat hilly and undulating surface for a short distance
            therefrom.
          The soil in the creek bottoms is a loose brown or black loam, rich and productive. On
            the level upland may be seen a limited soil with a subsoil of red or white clay,
            excellent for grass and meadow and fair to good for the ordinary cereals.
          There has been considerable tile ditching put in by the 
            enterprising farmers of this township since the close of the American civil war, by
            which no small amount of land has been greatly improved and reclaimed.
          The chief productions are stock and grain, viz.: Hogs, cattle, corn, wheat, horses,
            sheep, flaxseed, and oats; to which may be added small quantities of potatoes, grass,
            hay, apples, butter, eggs, and chickens. In 1880, Jackson township produced, on 4,050
            acres, 72,905 bushels of wheat; on 4,782 acres, 88,805 bushels of corn; on 380 acres,
            7,600 bushels of oats; and on 544 acres, 1,088 tons of hay.
          Streams.—Brandywine Creek enters the township on the north
            line, two and one-half miles east of the north-west corner, in section five, and runs
            south-west to near the center of section seven; thence north-west about a mile; thence
            in a south-west course, passing out of the township on the west line in section twelve,
            about one and one-fourth miles south of the north-west corner.
          Six Mile Creek enters the township on the east side, one mile south of the north-east
            corner, takes a general south course, passes on the west and near Charlottesville, and
            leaves the township near the south-west corner of section thirty-five.
          Nameless Creek rises in section sixteen, near the center of the township, runs
            south-west about three miles to the east side of section twenty-five; thence south by
            south-east, passing out of the township one and a half miles east of the south-west
            corner.
          Willow Branch has only one mile of its course in Jackson, all found in section one, in
            the north-west corner, where it flows into Brandywine.
          First Land Entry and Original Settlers.—The first land entered
            in Jackson township was by William Oldham, on the 20th of November, 1824, being the
            north-west quarter of the north-west quarter of section twenty-three, in township
            sixteen north, in range eight east. The second entry was by Thomas Ramsey, on the 21st
            of July, 1825.
          Among the first settlers were William Oldham, John 
            Forts, John Catt, Bazil Meek, David Templeton, Samuel arid John Dilla, James and
            Benjamin Forts, Mr. Lackey, John and James Sample, Andrew Jackson, Sanford Pritchard,
            Samuel Thompson, Absalom Davis, James Vanmeter, James Bartlow, Henry Woods, David
            Longinaker, Valentine Slifer, John Magart, Thomas Ramsey, and John Shields. At a little
            later date came John Burris, Joseph Hall, John Thompson, J. P. Foley, Jacob Slifer, John
            Parks, the Barretts, Hatfields, John Bevil, William Wolf, Jacob Brooks, Richard Earles,
            Samuel Smith, and John Stephens.
          The naming of the above will call to the minds of many of our readers fond
            recollections of earlier days, when they received the counsel and instruction of these
            hardy pioneers, most of whom have gone to the happy hunting grounds, no more to undergo
            the privations and hardships incident to pioneer life. They are gone, forever gone! No
            more their forms shall we behold! But their works live after them. They labored long and
            well, and we have entered into their labors. They sowed seed that shall bring forth
            fruit many years hence. Their children and children's children now rise up and call them
            blessed. Long may their names live fresh and green in the hearts of their legatees.
          A Few First Things.—The first church was by the New Lights; the
            first school teacher was Leartus Thomas; the first miller was John Forts; the first
            landlady was Mrs. Landis, recently deceased; Mr. Lackey sold the first whisky; David
            Johnson was the first merchant; the first road was the old State road; the first county
            road in the township was viewed by Daniel Priddy, David Heimer and Jacob Slifer; Isaac
            Barrett, about 1840 and later, cultivated a nursery at Charlottesville, and later in the
            north-east part of Center township; Abram Huntington had a blacksmith shop in the
            north-west part of the township prior to 1840, where he forged bolts in Vulcan style for
            several years.
          Mills and Factories.—The first water mill in Jackson  township was built by John Forts, in about the year 1827,
            and located on Six Mile, one mile north of Charlottesville. It was a genuine "corn
            cracker," of the primitive pattern.
          Some time prior to 1833, David Longinaker built a water sash saw-mill on Six Mile,
            about a mile above the Forts corn cracker. It was run by different parties, and finally
            had steam power attached.
          In about 1855, a steam sash saw-mill was put in operation on Henderson McKown's farm,
            four miles north of Cleveland. It was run for several years, then moved on Joseph
            Higgins' land, and was recently moved away.
          Walton & Rule erected a steam circular saw-mill at Leamon's Corner, about the year
            1860. It was run for some time, then moved to Cleveland, afterward to Eden, where it is
            still in operation.
          James R. Bracken, afterwards captain of a company from this county in the Mexican war,
            erected a tannery about a half mile north-west of the Pleasant Hill M. E. church, about
            the year 1844, where he made the leather for the farmers' "horse-hide collars,"
            "dog-skin gloves" and "cow-hide shoes," for a few years, when it went down.
          In 1869, T. L. Marsh & Draper erected a tile factory in the central western part of
            the township, which was run for a few years, when Marsh sold to Draper, who is still
            manufacturing.
          Roads.—The first road in this township was an old trail
            extending across the new purchase, known at the time of the formation of the township as
            the State Road, and later on as the old State road, built many years prior to the
            National road, which was the second in the township. The third was called a county road,
            laid out in 1835, and extended from the Longinaker saw-mill, two miles north of
            Charlottesville, on the county line, to *Charleston, on Sugar Creek, in Green township, where Mrs. Wilson and niece are
            buried. This road was a continuation of a Henry *In the early history of Hancock county, a town
              was laid out in Green township, just north of H. B. Wilson's farm, and named
              Charleston. No record was ever made of the plat, and the town was a failure.
             county road, extending from Knightstown to the said
            Longinaker saw-mill. Nearly all the roads in this part of the state, prior to 1835, run
            from one business point to another, regardless of "land lines." None of the early roads
            corresponded with the cardinal points of the compass. As the settlements began to
            increase in number, short routes were blazed out to suit the convenience of the
            settlers. There are no toll pikes in the township at this date. There are fifteen miles
            of pike that have been returned to the districts, and their charters cancelled. We are
            unable to state just how much graveling has been done in working out the road taxes and
            personal privileges; but considerable, we are assured. The National road passes through
            this township, a distance of six miles, no portion of which is graveled, and there is no
            other road in the county that so much needs it at this time. It is really an eyesore and
            a discredit to the county. If the road can not be built in any other way, we would
            suggest to the liberal citizens along the line its construction under the free gravel
            road law of March 3, 1877, as amended March 1, 1881, which will exempt their land from
            taxation in purchasing the toll roads of the county, under the act concerning the
            purchase of toll roads, and providing for their maintenance as free roads, approved
            April 9, 1881. Her citizens will then have something of value to themselves, tangible
            and convenient in lieu of their money and taxes for free roads.
          Railroads.—The P., C. and St. L. has a line of six miles on the
            southern boundary of the township, on which the company has two stations, viz.:
            Charlottesville and Cleveland. The I., B. and W. crosses the north-west corner of the
            township. Construction trains are passing over the line, but no stations are yet
            established.
          Educational.—The first schools in this township were "pay
            schools," taught by itinerant school-masters, about the year 1833. They were not the
            most efficient teachers by ,any means; indeed, they made no claims to greater knowledge
            than was necessary to teach reading, 
            
              JOSEPH FORTS.
            
             writing, and "ciphering to the double rule of three."
            There were citizens of the township better qualified, that could have taught better
            schools than many of these tramp, teachers, but the pay did not justify, and besides
            they were not naturally so disposed; and hence the grave responsibility was shifted to
            the shoulders of the professionals, who taught from Castle Garden to the Gulf. Schools
            were sustained but three months in a year, or a quarter of thirteen weeks. As the
            township increased in numbers and wealth, the interest in education was found to keep
            pace, and schools were sustained for a greater length of time, at increased pay, which
            commanded better teachers.
          In the vote on the free school question in 1848, to decide whether the state should
            adopt a free school system, Jackson voted against the proposed change, her vote
            standing: "Free school," 101; "no school," 114. But Jackson has the honor of being more
            progressive, on this question especially, than the majority of her sister townships, as
            may be seen by comparing her vote in 1848 with that of said townships, and with her own
            in 1849, when she voted for the proposed system, her vote standing: "Free school," 108;
            "no school," 105; being one of the three that voted for free schools in the final vote
            in 1859. This township has two brick and ten frame school-houses, numbered, named, and
            supplied with teachers for the present school year, or term at least, as follows,

          These twelve houses are estimated to be worth $8,000, including the grounds, furniture
            and out-buildings. The apparatus is estimated at $100. Total value, $8,100. The above
            figures includes the Charlottesville house, which belongs to a company, and is estimated
            at $3,000. One of the serious needs of this township is more and better apparatus, and a
            fuller appreciation of the importance of the same by the school officers and teachers,
            that said apparatus may be properly cared for after it is purchased and placed in the
            buildings; that the maps may not be taken for window curtains and the globes for
            foot-balls. Charlottesville for many years, and until recently, was a separate
            corporation for school purposes.
          School Trustees.—The following are the names of the trustees
            from the time they were empowered with authority to levy local taxes, and the office
            assumed some dignity and importance to the people:
          
            Burd Lacy1859
            David Priddy1863
            Philip Stinger1867
            George W. Williams1869
            James B. Clark1871
            A. V. B. Sample1874
            Henderson McKown1878
            James F. McClarnon1880
          
          Remarks: Burd Lacy and David Priddy held the office four terms each in succession.
            James B. Clark was the first trustee under the improved school law of 1873, and the
            first in the township that voted for county superintendent of schools. A. V. B. Sample
            filled the office for two terms of two years each. Philip Stinger, George Williams and
            Henderson McKown each served two years. James F. McClarnon looks after the poor,
            educational and financial interests of the township at this date.
          Churches.—Jackson township has seven churches, representing
            five denominations, to-wit: Three Methodist Episcopal, one Protestant Methodist, a
            Missionary Baptist, a Christian, and one Friends; a fuller account of which will appear
            further on.
          Population.—An examination of the census reports of  this township for a few decades shows the following,
            to-wit: Population for 1850, 677. The population of Worth township, the greater portion
            of which is now included in Jackson, was, for the same year, 718. We therefore conclude
            that a fair estimate for the territory now included in the corporate limits of Jackson
            township would be 1,300 for the year 1850. In 1860, the reports give her 1,680; in 1870,
            1,849; in 1880, 1,928. An examination of the above shows a steady, natural growth in
            population, which speaks well for the township as a whole. Charlottesville, in 1869, had
            190 souls; in 1870, 414. Cleveland, in 1860, had 112; in 1870, 118. We have no official
            report of either of these towns for 1880 separate and distinct from the total of the
            township; but from personal knowledge would say that the former has about held her own,
            while the latter has lost, and can not compare in numbers, wealth or appearance with her
              statu quo ante bellum.
          Polls and Vote.—The polls for Jackson in 1840 were 176; in
            1860, 273; in 188o, 326; in 1881, 345. Her vote for 1840 was 178; for 1860, 331; for
            1870, 371; for 1880, 445. Her last vote for President was as follows, to-wit:
            Republican, 214; democratic, 210; independent, 21. Jackson has two voting
            precincts—one at Cleveland and the second at school-house No. 5.
          Value of Real and Personal Property.—This township reports
            22,170 acres of land assessed at $547,020; and improvements on the same valued at
            $74,505, being an average of about $28.00 per acre; the personal property in Jackson,
            exclusive of Charlottesville, is valued at $220,750; value of telegraph, $680; value of
            the P., C. and St. L. railway line in Jackson, $14,450; value of lots, $985; value of
            improvements, $3,475; making a total valuation for taxation of $861,865, exclusive of
            Charlottesville, which is assessed on eighty-three acres of land valued at $2,320, with
            improvements on the same valued at $3,280; value of lots, $7,445; improvements,
            $21,180; personal property, $55,315; telegraph, $75; railroad, $3,785; total
            valuation, $93,400. The grand total valuation  of real and
            personal property in Jackson, including Charlottesville, is $955,465 for 1881.
          Taxes.—Jackson township paid taxes to the amount of $953.97 in

          Law and Esquires.—Jackson township has always been  well supplied with justices, as the following array of
            names, with the date of election, will show:

          Remarks: The last two named persons are the present acting justices of the township.
            Basil Meek was the first justice in the township. Samuel Thompson, the date of whose
            election we have given "unknown" owing to there being no record of the matter, was most
            probably elected in 1831 or 1832. Robert McCorkle gave such general satisfaction to
            litigants and those interested, that he was five times honored with the votes of his
            constituents. Ira Bevil and G. W. Landis were each three times clothed with judicial
            powers. John A. Craft, Andrew Pauley, Cyrus Leamon and Elijah C. Reeves were each three
            times called into the forum, and invested with legal authority to hear and try all
            causes over which such courts have jurisdiction. Many of the above have been solicited
            longer to preside, but declined in favor of private life, "choosing rather to suffer
            affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season."
            Perhaps, in listening so often to the gaseous, bombastic effusions of the tyro in the
            legal fraternity, they had come to agree with Wirt, in his sentiment that "There is a
            great deal of law learning that is dry, dark, cold and revolting; an old feudal castle
            in  perfect preservation." Or it may be that they too
            often have seen the verification of the old proverb: "Laws catch flies, but let hornets
            go free."
          Ex-County Officers.—Jackson township has furnished a goodly
            number of brave men, willing to spend and be spent for their country's good. Here lived,
            in their day, the following representative men: Jacob Huntington, treasurer; James P.
            Foley, representative; Basil Meek, the third sheriff of the county; Richard Williams and
            Jordan Lacy, commissioners. Among the living we call to mind, Noble Warrum, revenue
            collector and representative; John Addison, representative and commissioner; John
            Barrett, treasurer in 1850; George W. Sample, sheriff in 1872 by appointment; John R.
            Reeves, recorder in 1870; J. H. Landis, surveyor; John S. Lewis and Jacob Slifer,
            senior, commissioners. The majority of the county officers of this township, in contrast
            with the most of her sister townships, are still living. Green has but one living
            ex-county officer.
          This is the home of several prominent families that have grown up with the township,
            and become fully identified with her interests; liberal, public spirited citizens, ever
            ready to encourage any enterprise tending to propagate truth and promote virtue. For a
            fair list of such citizens, to save, recording here, see our roll of patrons for Jackson
            township on the closing pages.
          Murders, Suicides, and Remarkable Deaths.—Under the above topic
            we have but little to add for this township, and we are glad of the fact. It is always a
            painful duty to be called upon to record such sudden, sad departures. Life is a
            treasure; to live is sweet; and that any should adopt the beautiful meter, but false
            sentiment of Campbell, is sad:
          
            
              "Count o'er the joys thine hours have seen;
              Count o'er the days from anguish free;
              And know, whatever thou hast been,
              'Tis something better not to be."
            
          
          
          Better by far to adopt the sentiment of Milton, and abide our time in patience:
          
            
              "Nor love thy life, nor hate; but whilst thou livest,
              Live well; how long, how short, permit to Heaven."
            
          
          Anthony Maxwell committed suicide by hanging, in the hollow between Cleveland and the
            railroad station, about the year 1833. He was a married man, aged thirty, very tall. He
            was buried at Gilboa.
          James Steele was killed in January, 1838, by the falling of a tree.
          In 1875, Frank Smith committed suicide by hanging, with a leather strap, in his barn.
            Cause unknown.
          William Guy, a brakeman on the P., C. and St. L. R. R., kicked a boy by the name of
            Weaver off the cars while in motion, at Charlottesville, which killed him. A trial was
            had at Greenfield, in which the brakeman came clear.
          Exports.—The chief exports of Jackson township are corn, wheat,
            hogs, cattle, horses, oats, potatoes, flaxseed, lumber, fruits, and the products of the
            hennery and dairy.
          Synopsis.—Jackson township, a namesake of Andrew Jackson, the
            seventh president, organized in 1831, contains thirty-six sections, has four border
            townships and two border counties, one mill stream, three smaller streams, two

          CHAPTER XVI.
            JACKSON TOWNSHIP—Continued.
          
            CHARLOTTESVILLE
            is located on the National road, eight miles east of Greenfield, on the east bank of
              Six Mile Creek. It is pleasantly located in a beautiful country. It has about four
              hundred and fifty inhabitants. It has a good school-house, built by a company at a
              cost of $3,500; a daily mail, telegraph and express offices, and other conveniences
              suitable to a town of its size. It was laid out by David Templeton, and filed of
              record the first of June, 1830, with fifty-six lots.
            The first addition was made by James P. Foley, on the 21st of February, 1854, * and consisted of four blocks and
              fifty-eight lots, located south of the old plat.
            The second addition was made on the 8th of February, 1869, by F. Smith, and consisted
              of twenty-eight lots, located north of the old plat.
            The third addition was made by Frank Smith, on the 8th day of February, 1869, known
              as his second addition, and consisted of five lots, located south of the National road
              and east of the old plat.
            *The dates given of the
              making of the various additions are the dates of recording, which completes the legal
              steps to constitute an addition.
            
            The fourth addition was made by —— Walker, on the 9th of February, 1869,
              and consisted of five lots, located in the north-west corner of the town.
            The fifth addition was made by —— Chandler, on the 8th of February, 1869,
              and consisted of four lots, located between the old town plat and the creek.
            The sixth addition was made by —— Watson, on the 8th of February, 1869,
              and consisted of nineteen lots, located east of the old plat and Foley's addition.
            The seventh addition was made by Philip Stinger, on the first of March, 1869, and
              consisted of four lots, located east of the old plat and north of the National
              road.
            The eighth addition was made by —— Earl, on the 14th of June, 1869, and
              consisted of four blocks and twenty lots, known as Earl's first addition, located east
              of the old plat and Stinger's addition, and north of the National road.
            The ninth and last addition, known as Earl's second addition, was made by Earl, on
              the 9th of February, 1870, and consisted of three blocks, fifteen lots, and a school
              block, located east and adjoining his first addition. The present brick school-house
              is on this addition.
            The land from which Charlottesville was carved was entered by Josiah Vanmeter. The
              town was laid out in the woods by David Templeton, in 1830. The first to settle in
              Charlottesville was Michael Hendricks, moved from Henry county by Lewis Davis;
              followed by Sibbetts, who kept the first tavern. Thomas Lackey kept the first saloon,
              or "grocery," as then termed. The following were among the general merchants from time
              to time: David Johnson, John Haers & Bro.; David Templeton, James P. Foley,
              Richard Probasco, William Thornburgh, Hutton & Overman, Cyrus Overman, J. A.
              Craft, and P. J. Bohn.
            The first business houses and dwellings were small pole buildings, followed by more
              stately hewed log structures, in turn superseded by small frames after the location of
              the water-power saw-mills on Six Mile. Later still better 
              
                PHILIP J. BORN.
              
               houses, in harmony with the times and means of her
              citizens.
            At present a portion of the town extends over the line into Rush county, which forms
              two miles of the southern boundary of Jackson township. The railroad is on the line,
              or about so. The saw-mill and the Friends church, though belonging to Charlottesville,
              are in Rush county.

            CLEVELAND
            is located six miles east of Greenfield, on the National road, near the P., C. and
              St. L. R. R. It was laid out on the 8th of July, 1834, by E. Wood. The original plat
              consists of sixty-four lots. It was originally called Portland, and went by that name
              till about 1855.
            Before the railroad was built, when the traveling was done by stage, and moving to
              the west and returning was by wagons, Portland was a thriving little place, which not
              only afforded accommodations for the weary traveler, but supplied a considerable scope
              of country with the staple dry goods and groceries. For a number of years the Dayton
              and Indianapolis stage passed east and west daily through this little burg. And there
              were for several years two good-sized taverns in the place, one on either side of the
              road. Remnants of the same still remain as a memento of brighter days.
            We are in favor of railroads; they are a blessing to any country as a whole, but
              their tendency is toward centralization, the building up of the cities, capitals and
              county seats, and the dwarfing of towns, taverns and travelers' inns; a verification
              of Christ's declaration that "To him that hath, more shall be given; and to him that
              hath not, shall be taken away even that which he hath."
            Cleveland now has one good frame M. E. church building, a two-room frame district
              school-house,  post-office, express and telegraph
              offices, and the following business men:

            LEAMON’S CORNER
            is the name of a post-office sustained for a number of years in the central western
              portion of Jackson township. The office was discontinued in the summer of 1881. The
              name took its origin from the Leamon family, on whose lands the Leamon school-house,
              the first in the township, and the post-office were built. There was never a plat, and
              consequently no additions to the place. For a few years past, and until recently,
              there was a small store, a saw-mill, a post-office and a blacksmith shop at Leamon's
              Corner; but they all served their day, and in time were moved away.
          
          
          
            JACKSON TOWNSHIP SCHOOLS
            The first school taught in this township, was by Robert Sanford, in a log house on
              the old State road, on the land now owned by Noble Warrum. James Loehr taught the
              second school in the township, in a house near the National road, on the land now
              owned by Noble Warrum. The third school was taught by Robert Sanford, in a house on or
              near the National road on the land now owned by John Thompson. A school was taught in
              this same house by a man by the name of Goldsmith.
            The first house built in the township for school purposes was the Leamon
              school-house, which took its name from the fact of its being built on the lands of
              William Leamon. Edward R. Sample taught the first school that was taught in the house.
              As a compensation for his services, he received thirty-six dollars for a term of
              thirteen weeks, he boarding himself. The house was a log structure, about eighteen by
              twenty-four feet, heated by a huge fire-place, and lighted by a flight of oiled paper
              that extended along the entire south side of the building. The ceiling and roof were
              made of clapboards, and the scholars using for seats the soft side of a lind sapling,
              split open, into which four pins were driven for legs. Several terms of school were
              taught in this house by Burd Lacy, A. T. Hatfield, George W. Sample, William Sager and
              others, the wages never being more than from thirty to thirty-six dollars for a term
              of thirteen weeks, the teacher either boarding himself or boarding around among the
              scholars, which practice was very common in those days.
            The next house built in the township for school purposes was on the south-east corner
              of the lands of Andrew Jackson, north of Charlottesville, on the banks of Six Mile
              creek. Jesse Leonard was one of the principal teachers at that point.
            The next house built in the township was about one mile north and one-fourth of a
              mile east of Cleveland, on the land now owned by Elisha Earl. This house was  called " Backwoods College," being built right in a thick
              woods. Those most prominent in the building of this house were John Parkhurst, Abraham
              Craft and John Sample. It was a hewed log house, about twenty-four by twenty-eight
              feet, well lighted, and nicely ceiled overhead. This school was largely attended. John
              A. Craft taught the first school in the house, and was succeeded by James Sample,
              Thompson Allen, C. G. Sample, H. H. Ayres, and a man by the name of Miller, who, by
              the way, was quite a poet.
            The next school-house built in the township was in the town of Charlottesville, in
              the south-west part of the town, right on the steep banks of Six Mile Creek. I know
              but little of the early pedagogues at this place.
            Before the free school law was passed, schools were taught in different parts of the
              township by Nathan Fish, Dr. Nichols, John McIntire, H. H. Ayres, John H. Scott,
              George W. Sample, Burd Lacy, George W. Hatfield, Milton Heath, Catharine Stephens,
              Penelope Heath and William Sager.
            When the free school law went into effect, David P. Priddy, George W. Sample and
              William Leamon were elected first trustees, and they, together with Allen T. Hatfield
              as clerk, constituted the first board of township trustees.
            Under their administration the first nine houses were located. Soon after the
              location had been decided upon, George W. Sample was appointed route agent on the P.,
              C. and St. L. R. R., and resigned the office of trustee to enter upon the duties of
              route agent. Elisha Earl was appointed to fill the vacancy, and the houses were built
              as the first board had located them. At the expiration of William Leamon's term of
              office, Daniel Crane was elected a member of the board of trustees. When the law was
              amended so as to have but one trustee, instead of three, Burd Lacy
              was elected and served one or two terms. David P. Priddy was next elected for several
              terms in succession. He was in office when the county treasurer's  office was robbed, and had deposited in the safe a considerable amount of
              the common school and township funds, and this was also taken. Mr. Priddy made good
              the loss to the township. Right here I cannot forbear saying that, in my opinion, this
              was wrong. His successors in office, in their regular order, were Philip Stinger,
              George W. Williams, James B. Clark, A. V. B. Sample, J. H. McKown and James F.
              McClarnon.
            School-house number ten, or extra, was built on the lands of George W. Sample, in the
              year 1859. A. V. B. Sample taught the first school in the house, and it was here that
              some of the best teachers in the township received their start. The Addison
              school-house was built a few years later, and was numbered seven, it taking the number
              of the Charlottesville school, Charlottesville having become an incorporated town,
              managing its own school fund.
            Number eleven, or the first brick house built in the township, was on the farm of
              Burd Lacy, and was erected by A. V. B. Sample during his term of office as
              trustee.
            The second brick, or Leamon's Corner school-house, was built by James F. McClarnon.
              J. H. McKown was the contractor on both houses, and they are an honor to the township,
              and reflect much credit on the contractor.
            Among those who have figured largely as teachers in the common schools of this
              township are T. W. Hatfield, William M. Lewis, A. V. B. Sample, J. H. Landis, Dr. A.
              B. Bundy, J. N. Sample, A. E. Sample, E. W. Smith, Ancil Clark, E. A. Lewis, George
              Burnett, Channing Staley, Eva Brosius, George W. Williams, R. H. Warrum, Vint. A.
              Smith, Ed. Scott, Edwin Braddock, Wallace A. Simmons and John E. Leamon. A. V. B.
              Sample is the veteran teacher of the township, he having taught a little more than one
              hundred months, and served three years as school examiner of the county.
            The educational interest of the township is good, and our home teachers will compare
              favorably with those of any other township in the county or state.

            PLEASANT HILL CHURCH (M. E.)
            In 1835, Moses Braddock opened the doors of his. dwelling to receive the itinerant
              ministry. During this year Benjamin Cooper, a superannuated minister of the Ohio
              conference, moved into the neighborhood and commenced preaching the gospel. In the
              same year came Alfred Thomas. In 1836, F. C. Holliday and John F. Truslow were
              preachers in charge of the Knightstown circuit, to which Pleasant Hill belonged at
              that time. In 1837, W. W. Hibben and James Hill were ministers, during which time a
              small class of twelve members was formed, viz.: Polly Burris, Margaret Braddock, Nancy
              Braddock, Barbary Braddock, Benjamin Cooper, Nancy Cooper, Alfred Thomas, Jane Thomas,
              John M. Thomas, Matilda Thomas, and David and Mary Thomas. Alfred Thomas was the first
              steward and David Thomas the first class-leader.
            In 1838, the members and neighbors, by voluntary-labor, built a log house for the
              purpose of holding worship and school. This house was a rude affair indeed. The seats
              were split poles, and the fireplace would take in wood six feet in length. Along the
              north side was a narrow window, with oiled paper for light. In 1839, L. P. Berry
              preached the first sermon in the house. Isaac Barrett taught the first school in the
              same. In 1840, George Havens and Greenley McLaughlin were on the aforesaid circuit. In
              1841, D. F. Straight and D. W. Bowls were appointed on the charge. At the close of
              this year Pleasant Hill was placed on the Greenfield circuit.
            In 1852, under the pastorate of Rev. Francis M. Richmond, a new house was erected at
              a cost of $1,000. The house was dedicated by Rev. Richmond, the preacher in charge, a
              noble man of God.
            The first trustees were John Jones, George Fisk, Elisha Earls, John M. Thomas, and
              David Thomas. The present trustees are the, said John M. and David Thomas, Robert
              McClarnon, Henry McComas, and L. B. Thomas. 
              
                 JOHN FOSTER.
              
               The present preacher is I. N. Rhoades. A Sunday-school
              was opened in this church in 1839, by David Thomas, and has been kept up in the summer
              and fall ever since.
          
          
            BAPTIST AND NEW LIGHT.
            In the early history of the township the Baptists held meetings regularly for a time
              in the north-west part of the township, at the house of Silas Huntington. The pastors
              were Revs. Dilla and Cunningham.
            About the same time the New Light society built a log meeting-house in the north-east
              part of the township, and held forth for several years.
            Both of these denominations have gone down, and we have been unable to get a full
              history thereof.
          
          
            CHARLOTTESVILLE M. E. CHURCH.
            The first meetings by this society were held in a school-house just south of town, on
              the banks of Six Mile. The first class-meeting was in 1850. The preachers in charge at
              that time were Stout and Kinman. The present building was erected in the year 1855,
              and services have been sustained ever since. The building is a good frame, and will
              seat three hundred and fifty persons. Some of the best citizens of Charlottesville
              belong to this branch of the church militant, and are willing workers in propagating
              truth and virtue. Present preacher, I. N. Rhoades. Services semi-monthly. The present
              class-leaders are John T. Hatfield and A. T. Foley.
            The Methodists at this point were enterprising in Sunday-school work, having
              organized a school about 1848, being prior to the establishment of a church. The first
              superintendent was James P. Foley, followed in succession by Edward Raymond, John A.
              Craft, Anthony Fort, Samuel Hall, Mr. Stanton, Asa Allison, Martin Fort, Henry
              Carroll, A. T. Foley, Andrew Overton, Joseph Shultz, James B. Sparks, Cyrus Overman,
              John T. Hatfield,  and Thomas W. Hatfield. The present
              superintendent is John T. Hatfield. The school is in good condition, and regular and
              prompt in attendance.
          
          
            CHARLOTTESVILLE MEETING (FRIENDS)
            was "set up" some time after the civil war. It is a branch of the Walnut Ridge
              Meeting, four miles south thereof. William Thornburgh, Joel Cox, Henry Bundy and John
              Taylor were early members, and still belong to the flock. Mrs. Amy Fulghum is the
              present preacher. The house is located in the south part of town, just across the
              railroad, and is, consequently, in Rush county; but as the membership mostly reside in
              Charlottesville, and the church is really a part thereof, we think it proper to give
              it at least a passing notice. The house is a plain frame, capable of seating two
              hundred and fifty persons. The membership is not numerous nor wealthy, but pious and
              practical, and generally found in attendance not only on First Day, but at the
              "mid-week meetings." Some of the best temperance meetings ever held in Charlottesville
              were in this meeting-house.
            A Bible school was organized in this church cotemporary with its establishment, which
              has been successfully sustained ever since. While the school does not have as much
              form as many others, it succeeds in doing solid work in a quiet way.
          
          
            SIX MILE CHURCH (M. E.)
            was organized about the year 1838, and located two miles north of Charlottesville.
              The building was a small frame, which cost about seventy dollars in money and a
              handsome donation in labor. It was dedicated by Rev. John Burt. The first preachers
              were said John Burt and Kelly, Havens, Beemer, McMahan, Statler, and Layton. The first
              members were Henry Woods and wife, Benjamin Fort and wife, Ann Probasco, William
              Oldham and wife, Rolla Ramsey and wife, James Lakin and wife, Isaac  Hill and wife, Reuben Loudenback and wife, Anthony Fort
              and wife, Andrew Jackson and James P. Foley and wives, and Miss Oldham, now Mrs. P. J.
              Bohn.
            This church has long since gone down, and the old building has been removed; but the
              old graveyard still remains to mark the place dear to many. Among the first burials
              here were Sarah Foley, daughter of John P. Foley; John Bartlow and Mary E. Bohn.
              Beneath the green grass and the encroaching wild briers of this lonely spot rest the
              mortal remains of several whose faces were once familiar to the older citizens.
            The first trustees of Six Mile church were Benjamin Fort, Rolla Ramsey, Andrew
              Jackson, Anthony Fort, and William Oldham.
            In an early day Henry Woods and James P. Foley became bitter enemies, and finally had
              a frightful fight. Shortly after which there was a protracted meeting held at a
              school-house, one mile north of Charlottesville, at which those two parties were in
              attendance, and were alike convicted and went to the mourners' bench. Neither knew
              that the other was there. At about the same time both were converted and professed
              religion. The two arose about the same time, and seeing each other, each embraced the
              other in his arms, both claiming to be in the wrong in their difficulty. From that day
              until death these parties were warm, faithful friends, and members of the M. E.
              church, and died in the faith.
          
          
            NAMELESS CREEK CHRISTIAN CHURCH
            was organized September 8, 1839, by Elders John Walker and Peter Reader, at the house
              of Daniel Priddy. Among the first members were Aaron Powell, Elizabeth Powell, Sisson
              Siddle, Lemuel Perrine, and Charlotte Tygart. The first clerk was Sisson Siddle. The
              first deacons, elected May 8, 1841, were Aaron Powell and Meredith Walker. The first
              elders, appointed in August, 1842, were Peter Furman, Jordon Lacy, and Samuel Smith.
                 The first house was erected in 1841, and known as
              Nameless Creek church. The second house was built in 1852, and was named "Union
              Meeting-house." Prior to the building of the church house, meetings were held at the
              private residences of Daniel Priddy, Peter Furman, and John Street. At this date there
              are about three hundred names on the church roll. David Franklin has been the regular
              minister ever since 1844.
            This church is located about three-fourths of a mile north of the center of the
              township, and school-house number five, known as Center.
          
          
            BROWN'S CHAPEL (M. P).
            In the year 1838, the Revs. Joseph Williams, James Bedson, and ———
              Hannafield held a camp-meeting and organized a society in the neighborhood of Wesley
              Williams's, in Jackson township. Soon after a log church was built and occupied with
              varied success till 1861, when the old log church became unfit for a place of meeting.
              Some of the members having moved away and others died, an organization was effected of
              the remaining number by the Rev. D. S. Welling, in the school-house on Robert Smith's
              farm, who, with William Leamon, James M. Clark and William Williams, were elected
              trustees. Revs. Harvey Collins, Thomas Shipp and S. M. Lowden were among the
              successive pastors. In 1868, Thomas Shipp was again pastor, and Robert Smith, J. M.
              Clark, C. G. Sample, John N. Leamon and Peter Crider were the trustees. During this
              year the house of worship, known as Brown's Chapel, was built by J. B. Clark, and
              dedicated in October by George Brown, D. D. There has been a regular succession of
              pastors ever since. Rev. J. S. Sellers is the present preacher. Robert Smith, William
              Crider, Thomas Williams, W. Slifer and C. Gibbs are the trustees. This house is
              located one mile north of the National road, and a mile east of the west line of the
              township, near school-house number nine.
          
          
          
            SARDIS LODGE, No. 253, F. A. M.
            The above-named lodge was organized under dispensation, January 25, 1860. The names
              of the charter members are as follows: John A. Craft, Richard Probasco, Joseph
              Loudenback, J. N. Chandler, Dr. A. B. Bundy, Ellison Williams, Thomas M. Bidgood,
              George W. Sample, John Shipman, John Thompson, Jr., William W. Thornburgh, Albert
              White, Joseph J. Butler, Joseph R. Hunt, John Hunt, Samuel B. Hill, Edward Butler,
              Temple Stewart, Andrew Pauley, Ambrose Miller, Thomas Conklin, S. A. Hall, C. E.
              Allison, William Cook, Joshua Moore and John Kiser.
            The dispensation authorized the foregoing Masons to meet in the town of
              Charlottesville, Indiana, in the second story of a building on the north side of Main
              street, the first story of which was occupied by John A. Craft as a dry goods store.
              John A. Craft was the first worshipful master, Samuel B. Hill was the first senior
              warden, and C. E. Allison was the first junior warden.
            The lodge continued to meet and work under this dispensation until the 29th day of
              May, 1860, when, at the annual communication of the grand lodge, a charter was
              granted, and Sardis Lodge, No. 253, was duly constituted, and took her place among the
              sister lodges of the state.
            For a number of years the lodge continued to meet and work in the room where it was
              first organized; but when John A. Craft built his new business room on the south side
              of the street, a lodge room was fitted up in the second story of it, and furnished in
              the very best of style, and the lodge changed to more comfortable quarters. Here it
              continued to meet and work until the 2nd day of June, A. D. 1878, when the building
              and everything pertaining to the lodge, except the records, was destroyed by fire.
            There being no room in the town that could be obtained, suitable for lodge purposes,
              and the membership feeling that they were unable to build, surrendered their charter
              on the 20th day of December, 1878, to the most worshipful  grand master, Robert Van Valzah, who appointed A. V. B. Sample his special deputy
              to settle up the business of the lodge, and Sardis lodge became a thing of the
              past.
            Thomas B. Wilkinson was the first who applied for and received the degree of Masonry
              in this lodge, and Elijah C. Reeves and A. V. B. Sample were the next.
            Among those who filled the station of worshipful master in the lodge are John A.
              Craft, A. V. B. Sample, Jesse Leaky and I. B. Smith.
            From the issuing of the dispensation to the surrendering of the charter, this lodge
              never lost but two members by death, to-wit: Andrew Pauley and Thomas Conklin, both of
              whom were buried with masonic honors in the Simmons cemetery, one on the anniversary
              of St. John, the Baptist, and the other on the anniversary of St. John, the
              Evangelist.
          
          
            CENTER CHURCH (FRIENDS),
            in Jackson township, was established in 1878. Meetings were first held at the
              school-house at Leamon's Corner. The building is a neat frame, erected in 1879, at a
              cost of $500. It is located in section twenty-four, in the west part of the township.
              The first trustees were Joseph O. Binford, Aaron White and John S. Lewis. Among those
              who have preached here are J. O. Binford, M. M. Binford and Winbern Kearns.
            The society is young and small. The house will seat about two hundred persons.
              Ex-county commissioner John S. Lewis is a member of this organization.
          
          
            MISSIONARY UNION BAPTIST CHURCH
            was organized July 19, 1852, at Pleasant Hill, about three miles north of Leamon's
              Corner. The first house of worship was erected about two miles east of the "corner,"
              in 1856. The present house was erected in 1878. It stands about one mile west of the
              "corner."
            
            The church is, in good condition, with a present membership of one hundred and
              twenty-six. Within the past ten years six clergymen have officiated here, and ten
              within the last twenty years. The present minister is Elder W. K. Williams, who
              preaches once a month. A weekly prayer meeting has been sustained for over three years
              without cessation.
            The first pastor of the church was Elder Michael White, who acted as moderator at the
              time of its organization. Elder A. Dana was present, Anthony C. Brammer was the first
              church clerk.
            Among the original members are the following: William and Elizabeth Brammer, Samuel
              E. and Sarah Wilson, James Brammer, John O. and Julia A. Moore. John O. Moore is still
              living, and resides within a half mile of the church.
            The members of this organization sustain an interesting Sabbath-school, with an
              average attendance of fifty. Benjamin Clift, A. C. Dudding and S. W. Felt have
              officiated as superintendents, the latter of whom is the present incumbent. The school
              is in a prosperous condition.
          
          
            HON. NOBLE WARRUM
            was born July 8, 1818, in Wayne county, Indiana. When he was but a small boy, he
              moved with his father to Hancock county, and settled on Blue River. At the early age
              of fourteen, Noble Warrum left home to embark in the busines of life, having nothing
              to rely upon but an undaunted energy, a spirit of enterprise—which he possessed
              by nature—and a resolution to practice industry and frugality. He selected
              agriculture as his pursuit, to which vocation he still adheres. His success as a
              farmer show that he must have exercised a discriminating judgment in directing his
              operations, and practiced habitual promptness in executing them.
            Mr. Warrum's educational advantages were very limited. He attended only the
              old-fashioned log school-houses, 
              
                ELIJAH TYNER.
              
               and even that assistance was afforded him only for the
              space of nine months. Having from early age an ardent desire for knowledge, he seized
              all opportunities and improved every means of mental development, and thus, by
              reading, by reflecting, and by the study of human nature, has been enabled to do much
              for the culture of a mind by nature strong and active. In the strictest sense, he may
              be said to be a self-made man. Eminently of a practical turn of mind, he has never
              made any department of literature a special study.
            During his whole life Mr. Warrum has been a resident of Hancock county. In 1839, he
              was appointed county collector, an office now substituted by that of county treasurer.
              He received this appointment from the county commissioners before he was of age, and
              entered upon its duties in 1840, when barely eligible. At the expiration of. the four
              years' term of office, he was elected county assessor by a large majority. In 1860, he
              received the unanimous nomination of his party for representative of the county to the
              legislature, and was elected by about one hundred majority over the party vote. Since
              then he has served two terms in the same responsible position. As a representative, he
              was not only watchful and attentive to the interests of his own constituents, but
              always evinced an earnest desire to promote those of the state at large. He won the
              confidence and esteem of his constituents by his fidelity; and his sound judgment,
              conservative views, and independent disposition, made him a valuable representative.
              Since 1856, Mr. W. has been connected, with the Masonic fraternity. His religious
              belief is the universal salvation. In politics he has always been a democrat of the
              Jefferson and Jackson school.
            Mr. Warrum has married three times. First, to Miss Rosa Ann, daughter of Richard
              Williams, of Hancock county, Indiana, February 16, 1842. Mrs. Warrum died August 27,
              1862, leaving one son, Richard H. Warrum, In April, 1863, he married Miss Maria A.
              Wood, daughter of Rev. Wytteel A. Wood, an emigrant from Virginia.  She died December 27, 1873, leaving three sons, Noble,
              Henry and Mack, and one daughter, Rosa Ann. On December 19, 1877, he married Miss Mary
              Jane, daughter of Abner Cory, late of Madison county.
            In stature, Mr. Warrum is a little above the medium size. He possesses a strong
              constitution, cheerful and vivacious spirits, and a kind and hospitable
              disposition.
          
          
            JOHN ADDISON,
            commissioner of Hancock county, was born in Preble county, Ohio, January 22, 1820. He
              is the son of John, and Sarah Addison, formerly of Randolph county, North Carolina.
              His father removed to Indiana in 1827, and located in Rush county, where young Addison
              labored with untiring zeal in clearing the forests and tilling the soil. During the
              winter he attended the common schools of the county, where he obtained the only
              schooling he ever enjoyed. He remained with his parents until he was twenty-one years
              of age, when he was married; and receiving the gift of a small tract of land from his
              father, he moved on it and began his exertions for an independent living. On January
              17, 1854, he removed from Rush to Hancock county, and purchased a farm in Jackson
              township, where he now resides. In the autumn of 1861 he was elected treasurer of
              Hancock county, a position in which he distinguished himself by efficient and careful
              attention to his duties. In 1868, he was again called to the duties of official life,
              being chosen a representative to the state legislature. Again, in the fall of 1874 he
              was placed on the board of county commissioners, and served as such for six years.
            Mr. Addison has always contributed liberally to the various public enterprises of his
              county. He aids and encourages county and district fairs, and takes great interest in
              improvements in stock raising and agriculture. He has been a faithful member of the
              Christian church since 
              
                JOHN ADDISON.
              
               1840. He is now, and always has been, a steadfast
              democrat, casting his first presidential vote for James K. Polk.
            He was first married to Miss Nancy Hall, daughter of Curtis Hall, of Henry county,
              Indiana, on the 13th of February, 1840. She died November 24, 1866, and he was married
              the second time to Miss Ellen Jane Coltrain, of Henry county, Indiana, on the 9th day
              of January, 1868. He is the father of ten children—nine by his first wife and
              one by his second. Mr. A. is now enjoying private life on his farm in Jackson
              township.
          
          
            WESLEY WILLIAMS
            was born in Indiana Territory, in what is now Franklin county, in 1811, May 12th. In
              the following year he removed with his parents, Joseph H. and Charity Williams, to
              Wayne county, Indiana, where he was raised. Mr. W. was converted and joined the M. E.
              Church at the early age of fifteen, and has been a faithful, consistent member ever
              since; a greater portion of which time he has been a class-leader, and always a
              faithful worker in the cause of the church and Christianity.
            He was married in the year 1834 to Catharine Harden, who is also a consistent member
              of the same religious denomination.
            In 1837, Mr. Williams, with his wife and one child, moved to Jackson township, and
              settled in the woods in a log cabin; stuck a pole in a hollow stump, to which he tied
              his horses, having no other stable for two months. Here he worked hard and lived hard
              to secure a starting point, and by patient industry and strict economy, he has gained
              a competence amply sufficient to support him and the wife of his bosom in their
              declining years; indeed, Mr. W. is one of the heavy tax-payers of the township, as a
              reference to our list will show.
            To Mr. W. were born eight children, five of whom are living, married and doing well.
              See his portrait in another part of this book.

            PHILIP J. BOHN
            was born in Adams county, Pennsylvania. His parents were of German ancestry. He came
              to Indiana in the spring of 1839, and during the following fall came to
              Charlottesville. At the age of eighteen years, he entered a shop as an apprentice in
              the carriage and wagon making business. He next engaged in carpentering for a season.
              In the year 1863, he began the dry goods business in Charlottesville, and for full
              eighteen years he occupied the same room at the same business. Sixteen years of this
              time he was sole proprietor. On the 4th of February, 1881, he sold out his stock of
              goods to Messrs. Walker & Conklin, the present proprietors. Mr. Bohn has lately
              moved out on his farm, just west of town, and erected a handsome two-story frame
              dwelling, where he proposes to look after his farming interests, and spend the
              remainder of his days in the quiet, healthful seclusion of rural pursuits.
            In 1856, Mr. Bohn was married to a daughter of William Oldham, one of the first
              settlers, with whom he is still happily living.
          
          
            CHARLOTTESVILLE LODGE, NO. 277, I. O. O F.,
            was instituted January 3, 1867, by E. H. Barry, at Charlottesville, Indiana. Among
              the charter members were: John R. Johnson, Joseph Evans, Drure Holt, W. S. Johnson,
              Abraham Miller, W. S. Hill, Thompson B. Burtch, R. B. White and George Chandler.
            The present officers are: Lee M. Rock, N. G.; John T. Hatfield, V. G.; J. E.
              Hatfield, Secretary; John Thomas, Treasurer; James Pratt, permanent Secretary; Thomas
              E. Niles, D. D. M. G.
            This lodge is financially in good circumstances, owning a hall of its own, over
              Roland's drug store, where the members meet each Saturday evening. The lodge is out of
              debt, and its property is worth $1,000. Present membership, thirty-three.
          
          
          
            MRS. MARY LANDIS
            was born in Warren county, Ohio, in 1802. She was married the first time in 1825, in
              Fayette county, and in March, 1830, came to Charlottesville, being one of the first
              settlers in the place. Mrs. Landis and her first husband kept the first "tavern" in
              Charlottesville for the accommodation of the traveling public. The moving westward at
              that time, and for several succeeding years, was so great that Mrs. Landis in one
              instance counted ninety wagons—prairie schooners—in sight at one time.
              Often hundreds passed by daily.
            In 1834, Mrs. L. was left a widow, and went to Lafayette to reside with some
              relations, where she met George W. Landis, to whom she was married in 1836. The two
              made one soon came to Charlottesville, and at once set about erecting the building for
              an inn, in which Mrs. Landis recently died.
            In 1870, Mr. Landis died, since which time, to the date of her death, she resided at
              the old stand with her only boys, Esquire George W. Landis, and J. H. Landis,
              ex-county surveyor. Mrs. Landis was for a time a member of the Lutheran church in
              Charlottesville, till it went down. She then joined the M. E. Church.
            Mrs. Landis was truly one of the pioneer women, and in her declining years took great
              pleasure in reiterating early reminiscences of Charlottesville and vicinity. Mrs. L.
              was well acquainted with David Templeton, who laid out Charlottesville; with William
              Oldham, still living, who. entered the first land in the township. Also, with Charles
              White, Andrew Jackson, William Woods et al. of the early settlers previously
              mentioned.
            Mrs. Landis's sons, G. W. and J. H., are the oldest. native-born residents in
              Charlottesville.
            On the 9th day of January, 1882, Mrs. L. was called from works to rewards, and her
              mortal remains quietly repose in the old Six Mile cemetery.
          
          
          
            JOHN A. CRAFT
            was born in Trumbull county, Ohio, September 1, 1824. At the age of twelve he came to
              Hancock county, and located in Jackson township, where he has since resided. Young
              Craft, at the age of twenty, learned the trade of plane maker of Peter Probasco,
              father of Henry Probasco, of Cincinnati, at which business he worked in said city
              during the years of 1846 and 1847, after which he came to Charlottesville and carried
              on the same business in the building which then stood on the ground now occupied by
              the Craft store. In 1857, Mr. Craft left Charlottesville and located on his farm, a
              short distance north; but not succeeding as he desired, and health failing, he
              returned in 1864 and became a member of the firm of Rock, Morris & Craft, dealers
              in dry goods and groceries. In 1849, Mr. C. was married to Miss Eliza A. Fries,
              daughter of the late Daniel Fries. During the rebellion Mr. C. entered the Union army,
              was promoted to captain, and served with credit to himself and country until his
              health failed, when he returned home, and for months was not expected to live. Mr. C.
              and wife have a family of two girls and a boy to cheer them along the journey of life.
              For several years he was justice of the peace, and has ever been a staunch republican
              and good citizen. In the fall of 1881 Mr. C. retired from business and moved on his
              farm, where he is now enjoying the quiet seclusion and healthful duties of rural
              pursuits.
          
          
            JOHN F. SHULTZ,
            postmaster in Charlottesville, was born in York county, Pennsylvania, December 25,
              1825. His ancestors were of Dutch extraction. Mr. S. came to Charlottesville in 1857,
              where he has since resided. He is a boot and shoe maker by trade, and for a number of
              years has followed that business. The building in which the post-office is  located, and in which Mr. Shultz has his shop, was built
              by him in 1859.
            Mr. S. has been twice married. First, to Margaret Dungan, in 1858, by whom he had
              three children, none of whom are living. The second time to Miss Margaret Brown, in
              1878. Mrs. Shultz is well-known in Greenfield as Miss Maggie Brown, a former teacher
              in the Greenfield graded schools under the superintendency of the writer.
            Mr. Shultz is a consistent member of the M. E. church, a Mason in good standing, and
              an unwavering republican.
          
          
            MEREDITH WALKER.
            The subject of this sketch was born in Wilkes county, North Carolina, December 10,
              1814. He moved with his father to Rush county, Indiana, at the age of fifteen, where
              he lived until the year 1837, at which time he moved to Jackson township, this county,
              where he resided until the date of his death, which occurred on the 10th day of
              January, 1882, at the age of sixty-seven. In early life Mr. W. became a member of the
              Christian Church, and continued a consistent member the remainder of his life. Having
              carried a clear conscience void of offense to God and man, he expressed his
              willingness to die, and said he had no fears of death. Mr. W. was a republican till
              the later years of his life, when he became an independent. He was an industrious,
              progressive farmer, and succeeded in amassing a handsome amount of property.
              Physically, he was a large, square built, robust, broad-shouldered man, with dark eyes
              and hair, high cheek bones, and a firm countenance, denoting a power and will to
              act.
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XVII. SUGAR-CREEK TOWNSHIP.
          
            MAP OF SUGAR-CREEK TOWNSHIP.
            SHOWING THE SECTIONS, TOWNSHIP, AND RANGES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED.
          
          Name and Organization.—This township took its name from Sugar
            Creek, the principal stream in the township.  It was
            organized in 1828, at the date of the organization of the county, being one of the three
            original townships, and at that date included all the western portion of the county that
            now constitutes the third commissioner's district, viz.: Sugar-creek, Buck-creek and
            Vernon. In 1831, it was reduced in size to thirty-six sections, its present dimensions.
            In 1838, it was still further reduced by striking off two sections from the north part,
            which constituted the south half of Jones township from 1838 to 1853. In 1853, the
            commissioners abolished Jones township, and Sugar-creek again resumed her former size of
            thirty-six sections, which size and outline she has retained to this date.
          Location, Size, Boundaries, etc.—Sugar-creek township is
            located in the south-west part of the county, and in extent is six miles square, being
            uniform in size with Jackson and Buck-creek townships. It is bounded on the north by
            Buck-creek, on the east by Center and Brandywine, on the south by Shelby county, and on
            the west by Marion county. It is located in township fifteen north, and in ranges five
            and six east. The west two tiers of sections are in range five east, and the remainder
            in range six east. The range line runs one and a half miles west of Palestine, and forms
            the east line of the Schramm farm, and the west line of Rev. W. Nichols's farm.
          Surface, Soil, Drainage and Productions.—The surface is level
            and slightly rolling, except along Sugar Creek, which is hilly and broken. The soil is
            generally black loam, exceedingly fertile and exhaustless in resources. At this date
            there is really no third-rate land in the township, and but a limited portion of
            second-rate, since it has been so thoroughly ditched. No other township in the county
            has given so much attention to drainage as Sugar-creek. Long before tile ditching was
            thought of in Hancock county, the enterprising, industrious German farmers of this
            township had elevated their farms from two to five feet by sinking blind wooden ditches
            and large open ditches through most of the low, black lands; and since the  introduction of tile, these same close calculating,
            practical farmers, have not been behind in their use. The chief productions are corn,
            wheat, hogs, cattle, barley, oats, flaxseed, horses, and Irish potatoes. Sugar-creek
            produces more barley than all the rest of the county.
          This township gives especial attention to wheat, and has a greater per cent. of its
            lands thus cultivated than any other township in the county, and her average per acre is
            equal to the best. In 1880, from 5,443 acres, she produced 97,974 bushels of wheat; from
            4,530 acres she produced 145,670 bushels of corn; from 816 acres, she produced 16,320
            bushels of oats. The same year she reports 501 tons of hay and 2,900 bushels of Irish
            potatoes, being the poorest report for hay, and the best of Irish potatoes in the
            county.
          Streams.—Sugar Creek enters the township near the north-east
            corner, on the north line, and runs west of Philadelphia and east of Palestine, passing
            out of the township near the south-west corner of section thirty-two, on the central
            southern line.
          Buck Creek enters the township a half mile east of the north-west corner, and takes a
            south by south-west course, passing out on the west line, one and one-fourth miles west
            of the north-west corner.
          First Land Entries and First Settlers.—The first land entry in
            Sugar-creek township was by George Worthington, on the 18th day of January, 1822, being
            the north half of the north-east quarter, and the north-west quarter of section three,
            in township fifteen north, in range six east. The second entry was made by Jacob Murnan,
            in 1823.
          Among the first settlers were Jacob Jones, Amos Dickison, Jonathan Evans, Samuel Cones,
            Jacob Murnan, George Williams, Thomas and Richard Leachman, George Robison, Reuben
            Barnard, father of William C. Barnard; David McNamee, Benjamin McNamee's father; Andrew
            Magahey, John Delany, William True, J. A. Leonard, John Dye, Mr. Weston, Jacob Schramm,
            Albert Lange,  Mr. Heffermeier, Andrew Fink, Anton
            Wishmeier, Anton Kirkhoff, Christian Schildmeier, A. and J. Hudson, William Brown, Mr.
            Trevis, and many others.
          The reading of the above names will call to mind in a number of our readers, many who
            have long since bid farewell to mortal scenes, and entered upon an inheritance
            "immortal, incorruptible, and that fadeth not away." Personally we knew but few of them,
            and have been unable to write a sketch of each, but we are assured upon good authority
            that all of them are worthy of the notice given, being modest, unassuming, practical
            pioneer men, seldom aspiring to office or honors, but ever industrious, hardy and
            hospitable. Others there may be equally worthy, whose names are not found here, owing to
            the frailty of the memory of man; but if such be the case, let their friends rest
            assured that in that great, unerring, unabridged history, kept by the recording angel,
            in which is recorded all the acts of mankind, their names will be found written in
            perfect order.
          A Few First Things.—The first church was the M. E.; the first
            teachers, Samuel Valentine and Eliza Barnard; first preacher, Rev. Hawes; first
            physician, Dr. Kellogg; first miller, Stephen Bellus; first merchant, John Delany; first
            grocer, Amos Dickison; first post-office, Sugar Creek, at Palestine; first postmaster,
            Amos Dickison; first blacksmith, Reuben Barnard; first school, near Palestine; first
            tanner, John E. Bailey; first roads, Brookville and old State roads; first death, Mr.
            Mattox; first railroad, the Indiana Central; first village, Philadelphia.
          Historical Anecdote: The said John Delaney sold goods in the south-west part of the
            township, on the Brookville State road. He sold his goods at a good profit. When asked
            what per cent. he made, he replied that he was not a scholar; and knew nothing about per
            cent.; but when he bought goods for one dollar and sold them for two, he didn't think he
            lost anything.
          Mills and Factories.—The first mill in the township was a small
            water mill, erected some time prior to 1828, by  Stephen
            Bellus, on Sugar Creek, about two miles north of Palestine. It was both a grist and saw
            mill in a small way, and continued in operation, passing through several hands, till
            about 1872, when the dam washed out and the mill went down. Among those who owned this
            first mill after Bellus sold out were Amos Dickison, Myron Brown, Uriah Emmons, George
            Kingery and Lewis Burke. Burke died, and his heirs run the mill for a few years, till it
            met with the fate aforesaid, and succumbed to the elements.
          In 1832, Black & Bro. erected the second water mill in the township. It was a small
            saw-mill, located on Sugar Creek, about one mile south of Philadelphia. It run for a
            number of years.
          Lewis Burke, in an early day, erected a water saw-mill on Sugar Creek, north by
            north-east of Palestine, and below the Bellus mill. The Burke mill is still in
            operation. It is a saw-mill, and unlike most early water mills, never did any
            grinding.
          In about 1850, Kelley & Bro. erected the first steam saw-mill in the township. It
            was located about a mile west of Philadelphia, and run for a few years, then moved
            away.
          In 1857, Thomas Tuttle had erected a steam flouring and saw-mill, combined, located
            about two miles south-west of Palestine, and operated for a number of years.
          In 1856, James B. Conover built a steam saw-mill about a quarter of a mile west of
            Sugar Creek, on the National road. It passed through several hands, and was moved away
            in 1859.
          In 1855 or '56, W. W. Matthews erected a steam saw-mill in the central northern part of
            the township, which was run by Matthews & Reed some four years, and then
            removed.
          In 1856, a two-story steam flouring mill was erected in Palestine, by Gates et al., at a cost of $5,000, with three run of stone. Gates operated it
            for about nine years and sold to Scott & Davis, and they to Joseph Conner. The  mill has been put in good repair by the present proprietor,
            A. P. Hogle, who has added new machinery and the modern improvements.
          Rufus Black, a few years since, put in operation a steam circular saw mill at
            Philadelphia, which is still running and doing an extensive business.
          The mills now in operation in Sugar-creek township are six in number, viz.: The Burke
            saw-mill, the Hogle flouring mill, the Black saw-mill; the Stutsman mill, near Gem; the
            Gesler steam saw-mill, in Palestine; and the steam grist-mill in Philadelphia. The
            Stutsman saw-mill was built in 1871 by Nicholas Stutsman. It burned down in 1879, but
            was immediately rebuilt, with a planer attached, and put in good running order.
          At the early date of 1832, Reuben Barnard, father of Trustee William C. Barnard,
            carried on a blacksmith shop on his farm, in the south-west corner of the township.
          In 1845, John E. Baity opened a tanyard on the McNamee farm. He did a local business,
            furnished a market for oak bark, had about twenty vats, and operated for four years.
          In 1847, Alexander Ogle started a small tannery in a log house near Philadelphia, which
            he operated for a number of years after the Baity tannery had ceased.
          Thomas Swift also carried on a tanyard near Palestine soon after the going down of the
            Baity tannery. The first tile factory was erected in 1855, on Jacob Schramm's farm, and
            was operated for about four years by Weaver.
          The next tile factory was erected on the Reasoner farm, by Wicker & Brother. It has
            changed hands a number of times, but is still in operation.
          In 1869, Shellhouse, Spurry & Armstrong erected a tile factory two miles east of
            Palestine, which is now in operation by Freeman & Reasoner.
          Roads.—Sugar-creek township in her early history, much like her
            sister townships, had no roads worthy of the name, but mere paths, pointed out by the
            blazed trees,  meandering through the thick forest. The
            first roads in the township were the Brookville and old State roads. The next was the
            National road. The Brookville road run through Palestine, diagonally through the
            township, on a bee line from Brookville to Indianapolis. The old State road crossed the
            northern part of the township, passing through Philadelphia. Prior to the late civil war
            there was not a single gravel road in the township. But since that time there has been
            sixteen and one-half miles of toll pike built by companies, besides considerable
            graveling done in working out road taxes and personal privileges.
          Railroads.—Sugar-creek township has two railroads crossing her
            territory. The P., C. and St. L. has six miles running through the northern tier of
            sections; the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Indianapolis road passes through the south-west
            part a distance of seven miles; making a total of thirteen miles in the township, valued
            at $170,025. Telegraph lines extend along each of the roads, the total valuation of
            which is $2,235. The Pan-Handle has two stations in the township—Philadelphia and
            Gem. Palestine is the only one on the Junction.
          Educational.—The first school-houses in this township were pole
            cabins, covered with clapboards, suppled with "cat and clay" chimneys and puncheon
            floors. The first three were located at nearly the same time: one near New Palestine,
            one at Philadelphia, and one in the German settlement, near the center of the township.
            The first teachers were Samuel Valentine, Richard Lindsey, Eliza Barnard and Mr.
            Barnard. These teachers, like others at this date, were employed by the quarter, of
            thirteen weeks, at from thirty to thirty-six dollars and "found"—i.
              e., they boarded around among the patrons. As the township filled up, and new
            settlements were made, additional schools were established and better houses erected, in
            accordance with the demands of the times, until at present she compares favorably with
            the older and earlier settled townships. The  following
            are the numbers and names of the houses and the teachers employed therein at this
            date:
          
            
              District No. 1
              Philadelphia
              Charles Rennecamp, Addie Wright
            
            
              District No. 2
              Brown
              Ella Bottsford.
            
            
              District No. 3
              
              J. W. Jones.
            
            
              District No. 4
              
              C. M. Carr.
            
            
              District No. 5
              Caraway's
              W. B. Bottsford.
            
            
              District No. 6
              
              N. P. Brandenburg.
            
            
              District No. 7
              Palestine
              W. A. Wood, Roscoe Anderson, Jennie Buchel.
            
            
              District No. 8
              
              B. F. Ewbank.
            
          
          These eight houses—seven frame and one brick—are valued at $4,500;
            apparatus, $150. This is exclusive of the German school, sustained by private
            enterprise, and located in the central western part of the township. The number of
            school children in the township under consideration in 1853 was 554; in 1860, 712; in
            1870, 690; in 1881, 704. An examination of which shows a fluctuating scholastic
            population not easily accounted for. Why there should be a less number of school
            children in 1870 than in 1860, let the citizens answer. More remarkable still is the
            fact that she has fewer school children to-day than she reported just prior to the civil
            war. Sugar-creek is one of the three townships in the county that, in the final vote on
            the free school question in 1849, voted for free schools, her vote standing, "free
            school," sixty-eight; "no school," forty-one. In her former vote, however, in 1848, on
            the same question, she voted against free schools, her vote standing at that time, "free
            school," forty-seven; "no school," fifty-four; being a majority of seven against the
            proposed establishment of free schools.
          School Trustees.—Below we give the names of the township
            trustees, with the date of their election, since 1859, at which time they were clothed
            with power to levy  local taxes, and the office assumed
            some dignity and worth to the people:
          
            Robert P. Brown1859
            E. H. Faut1865
            Edward P. Scott1872
            William C. Barnard1874
            David Ulrey1876
            William C. Barnard1878, 1880
          
          Remarks: Robert P. Brown, the first trustee under the new regime, held the office for
            four terms, and Ernst H. Faut for six. E. P. Scott was the first to vote for county
            superintendent. David Ulrey and William C. Barnard are the only trustees that have held
            two terms each since the change of the law, lengthening the term of office to two years.
            Said Barnard looks after the financial interests of the township, the poor, pedagogues,
            and compensates the farmers for their sheep killed by dogs, at the present date.
          Churches.—Sugar-creek township has six churches, representing
            three distinct Christian denominations, to-wit: Two M. E. churches, three German and one
            Christian, a special account of each of which will be given further on.
          Population.—An examination of the census reports for the last
            few decades develops the following facts, to-wit: Population for 1850, 793; 1860, 1,646;
            1870, 1,897; 1880, 2,099. It will be observed that the stride from 1850 to 1860 was
            remarkably great, being an increase, apparently, of over one hundred per cent.; but it
            must be remembered that in 1850 Sugar-creek township was only two-thirds its size in
            1860. Our remarks at the head of this chapter show that Jones township, from 1838 to
            1853, included part of the territory now embodied in Sugar-creek. Jones, in 1850,
            reported a population of 670, and as half her territory was added to Sugar-creek, a
            proportionate and fair estimate for the territory embodied in every census report of the
            township since 1850 would be 1128. This township far surpasses any other in the county
            in her reports of the number of foreigners. In 1870, she had 245 foreigners, while the
            highest numbers reported by other townships were ninety-four in Center and seventy-five
            in Vernon, and  a total of 420 in all the townships of the
            county save Sugar-creek. The foreigners in Sugar-creek are mostly Germans, industrious
            farmers, who have clustered around a little nucleus early planted in the township.
          Polls and Vote.—The polls for Sugar-creek in 1840 were
            eighty-six; in 1854, 219; in 1860, 259; in 1870, 385; in 1880, 509. She cast, in 1860,
            a vote of 343; in 1870, 485. In 1880 her vote for President stood as follows:
            Democratic, 308; republican, 190; independent, eleven, being a democratic majority of
            118. This township has two voting precincts: first, at New Palestine; second, at
            Philadelphia.
          Value of Real and Personal Property.—This township reports
            21,805 acres of land, valued at $503,475; value of improvements on the same, $97,215;
            value of lots, $1,985; improvements on the same, $5,395; value of personal property,
            $269,115; value of railroads and telegraph, previously given; total value of taxables,
            exclusive of Palestine, $993,590.
          Taxes.—Sugar-creek township, in 1840, paid $417.64; her
            assessment for 1881, to be paid in 1882, is $7,982.24. The levy is eighty-two cents on
            each $100 on all the taxable property in the township, excepting Palestine, which is
            ninety-two. The following men of the township pay taxes of $40 and upwards in 1882:

          Law and Justice.—Our first law-makers very wisely adopted the
            policy of our mother country, of bringing justice near the door of every man, rich or
            poor, whereby an opportunity is offered for the speedy, convenient and inexpensive
            adjustment of petty grievances, civil or criminal. The constitution of 1852 authorizes
            the election of a competent number of justices of the peace, by the voters in each
            township in the several counties in the state, who shall continue in office four years,
            and whose powers and duties shall be prescribed by law. In the prosecution of this
            contemplated township system for promoting justice, the legislature enacted laws for the
            election by the people of two officers only, a justice and constable, the latter for a
            term of two years, who is the executive officer, and corresponds with the sheriff in his
            duties. The former acts as judge, clerk and treasurer. Sugar-creek township has always
            been well supplied with these ministerial, judicial, and executive officers. The first
            of these acting in the territory under consideration were George Leachman and Charles
            Atherton, the exact date of whose election we are unable to ascertain, there being no
            record of the same in the clerk's office to our knowledge, though we have made diligent
            search. Succeeding these were the following, elected at the date set opposite their
            names, viz.:
          
            George Leachman1843, '49, '54, '58, '66,
                '70
            G. W. Robison1844
            George O'Brien1846
            
            Adam Hawk1851,
              1860
            George Barnett1856
            W. H. Dye1868
            E. S. Bottsford1872
            Henry A. Schreiber1874
            George W. Kingery1878
            John M. McKelvey1880
          
          For the fifteen years that Jones township existed, the south half of which was attached
            to Sugar-creek after her dissolution, the following ex-justices officiated, being
            elected at the dates set opposite their names, some of whom properly belonged to
            Sugar-creek, but just who and how many we cannot say with absolute certainty; hence we
            give the full list, and the good citizens of the two townships,—Sugar-creek and
            Buck-creek, which absorbed Jones,—may give honor to whom honor is due, and place
            the credit where it belongs:
          
            Charles AthertonUnknown
            Dan'l Skinner1840, 1845, 1850
            Charles Atherton1843
            Isaac Travis1846
            Joseph Marshall1849
            Abraham Stutsman1851
            John H. Hazen1852
            Allen Caylor1852
          
          Remarks: There were probably one or two justices in Jones elected prior to 1840, our
            first date given, but we have been unable to ascertain their names. The practice in this
            and other counties has been to elect one or more justices immediately after the
            organization thereof. Esquire Leachman, we are reliably informed, began his
            administration contemporary with the organization of the county, and served continuously
            till some time after the date of his election in 1870, officiating longer, perhaps, than
            any other man in the history of the county. He served at least eleven terms, or
            forty-four years, possibly longer. Adam Hawk and Charles Atherton each served two terms.
            Daniel Skinner filled the place for twelve years. None of the others, we believe, were
            re-elected. Esquires George W. Kingery and John M. McKelvey preside at the bar of
            justice at this date.
          Ex-County Officers.—Sugar-creek township has furnished a number
            of popular men willing to subject their  private interests
            to the popular good, and endure the scathing, sarcastic, criticisms always heaped upon
            our public servants by their antagonists and political opponents. Here flourished in
            their day the following chosen men, to stem the tide and oppose the current of petty
            jealousies, and paddle safely over the billowy waves the little county bark with her
            precious cargo of glittering gold and immortal souls: Samuel Shockley, commissioner and
            representative; William McCance, Enos O'Brien, John O'Brien, and William H. Dye,
            ex-commissioners. All of the above are with us no more, save in memory, records and
            history. Still living among us, and well-known to the readers of these lines, are the
            following: R. P. Brown, treasurer and sheriff; E. H. Faut, treasurer; Edward P. Scott,
            commissioner; J. V. Coyner, surveyor; and John E. Dye, present commissioner of the third
            district.
          Murders, Suicides, and Remarkable Deaths.—We will first call
            the attention of our readers to one of the most shocking, heart-rending, irrational,
            fatal family feuds that it has ever been our painful duty to record—one which
            resulted in the cold-blooded murder of an innocent wife and the suicide of an excited,
            crazed and drunken husband. The plain facts in the case, as near as we can gather from
            circumstantial evidence, are about as follows: George Knapp, a man of dissipated habits,
            lived about one mile west of Palestine in 1845, the date of the occurrence of this sad
            tragedy. It was Pentecostal Sabbath, the family had been to church in the forenoon,
            returned home and ate dinner together, when Mr. Knapp, being intoxicated, and somewhat
            quarrelsome, as usual under such circumstances, accused Mrs. Knapp of infidelity; and
            reason being dethroned by the vile destroyer and arch demon, Rum, he gathered up an ax
            and wildly menaced it before her face, and threatened to spill the life-blood of her
            whom but a few short years before he had solemnly pledged in divine presence, before
            living witnesses, to love and cherish, protect and defend, as long as life to them
            should be spared. Mrs. Knapp, fearing  fatal results, fled
            from the house, followed by her antagonist, who struck her on the head and felled her to
            the ground, where he continued his unmerciful attack, striking her twice with the edge
            of the ax, once in the shoulder and once in the breast, causing immediate death. Seeing
            her lifeless form covered with gore before him, partial consciousness returned, and with
            a sense of his awful crime realized, went into the house and, with a razor in hand,
            stood before the glass and cut his own throat, partially severing the trachea; but still
            not satisfied, he left the house and pursued the children with murderous intent, who
            escaped him by seeking refuge in a pond. Being unable to reach them, he returned to the
            house, and was found by the neighbors in the frightful condition aforesaid, breathing
            through the recently made orifice in the wind-pipe. He had two small children, a boy and
            girl. The girl afterward married, and, from what we can learn, is still living. The boy
            died a few years after the tragedy just related. Henry Meier owns the Knapp farm where
            this sad scene transpired.
          In March, 1851, a man by the name of Sellers froze to death near Philadelphia. He was
            supposed to have been intoxicated.
          In 1861, Mr. Bidgood was killed by a team at the toll-gate.
          In 1863, James Murnan was accidentally shot and killed by a friend.
          In 1871, a son of Joseph Morford was killed by being thrown from a horse. Anton
            Wishmeier, in the same year, fell from a load of straw and was killed.
          In 1868, a man by the name of Foley was instantly killed by the cars.
          In 1872, Mrs. Thomas Alexander was burned to death by using coal oil in endeavoring to
            start a fire.
          In 1880, Emerick Brock committed suicide by hanging, near Palestine. A child of Anton
            Schildmeier was burned to death by coal oil.
          In June, 1871, a man by the name of John Jacobi was 
            instantly killed by his own reaper in a harvest field. His son was driving the horses,
            when they became frightened, and started to run. Mr. Jacobi, aiming to get to the heads
            of the horses, was knocked down by the tongue of the reaper, and, falling in front of
            the sickle, was caught by the guards, one arm cut off and his head severed from the
            body. His wife, seeing the heart-rending scene, rushed to the spot, near by, gathered
            the bleeding head to her arms and bosom, and rushed in wild delirium into the house,
            scarcely conscious of what she was doing. Mr. Jacobi was about sixty-five years of
            age.
          Exports and Imports.—The chief exports of Sugar-creek township
            are wheat, corn, hogs, cattle, horses, flaxseed, potatoes, barley, oats, lumber, fruits,
            carriages, wagons, and the products of the hennery and dairy. Her imports are chiefly
            farming implements, dry goods, groceries, hardware, glass and wooden ware, hats, caps,

          CHAPTER XVIII.
            SUGAR-CREEK TOWNSHIP—Continued.
          
            PALESTINE,
            a pleasant little village, is located on the west bank of Sugar Creek. It was laid
              out by J. Evans, on the 1st of October, 1838, and consisted of fifteen blocks and
              thirty-six lots. It is now on the C., H. and I. railroad, on a bee line about thirteen
              miles south-east of Indianapolis. It has three churches, a two-story frame
              school-house, a steam flouring mill, and one saw-mill; merchants, druggists,
              physicians and mechanics suitable to a town of its size; a post-office, express
              office, daily mail, and about six hundred inhabitants.
            The land from which Palestine was carved was entered by John Weston, on the 1st day
              of May, 1824, being the west half of the south-east quarter of section twenty-nine, in
              township fifteen north, and in range six east. The first addition was made by Gundrum,
              on the 18th day of February, 1854, located west of the north part of the old plat,
              between the railroad and State road, and contained twenty-three lots. A second
              addition was laid out by Waltke, on the 7th day of August, 1867, and consisted of
              twenty-six lots, located between the railroad and the State road, and west of
              Gundrum's addition. The third addition was  made by
              Anderson, on the 10th of April, 1872, and consisted of forty-three lots, located west
              of Waltke's addition, and a part south of the State road. The fourth addition was laid
              out by Kirkhoff, on the 9th of October, 1873, and consisted of six lots, located west
              of the old plat and south of the State road. The fifth addition was made by Kirkhoff,
              known as Kirkhoff's second addition, on the 2nd day of January, 1875, and consisted of
              ten lots, located south of Waltke's addition and east of the southern part of
              Anderson's addition.
            The cemetery at New Palestine was laid out by Elizabeth Cones, on the 20th day of
              December, 1870. It consists of forty-one lots, with alleys.
            The first business done in this little burg was on a small scale, and consisted
              mainly in bartering porkers, whisky, ginseng, furs and venison hams for staple
              groceries and notions. The dry goods were mostly manufactured at home. The first
              business houses of this place were crude structures, indeed. The better ones seen at
              this early date resembled somewhat our cut of the first house in Greenfield, seen on
              page 179. Among the first merchants of Palestine in her primitive days were Amos
              Dickerson, Andrew Magahey, John Delaney, Robert King, W. and S. S. Johnson, Joseph
              Cones, and J. Evans. We cannot spare the space to trace all the business men and their
              various changes from the first to the present; but will pass over the intermediate
              merchants, and endeavor to give a pen picture of her present business and business
              men, that our sons and daughters, grandchildren and future posterity, may see us
              to-day as we are, with more clearness and certainty than we are permitted to view the
                status of our country long years since, owing to the imperfect
              records handed down to us.

            PHILADELPHIA.
            Philadelphia, named in commemoration of the city of brotherly love, is located four
              miles west of Greenfield, on the National road. The P., C. and St. L. R. R. runs by
              it. It contains a two-story public school building, one saw-mill, a flouring mill,
              post-office, express office, daily mail, druggist, grocer, merchants, mechanics,
              physicians, and other necessaries to a village of her dimensions. Philadelphia was
              laid out by the records fail to show whom, on the 11th day of April, 1838, being about
              six months prior to the laying out of New Palestine. The original plat consists of one
              hundred and two lots and six out-lots. The first and only addition was made by Clark,
              on the second day of April, 1864, and consisted of nineteen lots, located south of the
              old plat. Among the first business men of this place were: Charles Atherton, Sen.,
              general merchant and post-master; Allen McCane, Joseph Marshall, G. W. Willett, Samuel
              McConaha, J. B. Sting, J. B. Conover and O. S. Meek. First physicians, Dr. Hodson
              McCallister & Son, J. H. Hazen, W. H. Dye, G. T. Rennick and H. B. Tilson. We will
              not consume space in giving a full list of the business through her entire history,
              but will now come up to the present, and furnish for this date a

            Remarks: Prior to the construction of the old Indiana Central R. R., there was a vast
              amount of travel and moving to the west in wagons, on the National road, and for a
              number of years the Dayton and Indianapolis stage passed east and west daily through
              this little burg, at which time the chief business of the place, like others of its
              kind along this main line of travel, was inn or tavern keeping. Relics of these old
              buildings, where the westward bound, weary traveler was nightly found, still remain,
              tottering, but telling monuments of an earlier stage of civilization.
          
          
            GEM.
            Gem post-office was established in 1878, on the P., C. and St. L. R. R., in the
              central northern part of the township, and Andrew Stutsman was the first postmaster.
              The first store at this place was kept by Nicholas Stutsman, seven years prior to the
              establishment of the post-office. There never was a plat made of the place,
              consequently no additions. It has a general store, kept by J. Townsend; a boot and
              shoe shop, by Joseph Coon; a blacksmith shop, by Isaac Stutsman; a steam saw-mill, by
              Nicholas Stutsman; a daily mail, James Townsend, P. M.
          
          
            M. E. CHURCH.
            About the year 1835, the Methodists organized a class at Philadelphia. Among the
              first members were Owen Griffith, wife and two daughters; William Brown, wife and
              daughter; Mrs. Willett; Charles Atherton, Sr., and wife; Jonathan Horniday and wife,
              Thomas J. Smith and wife, and Joseph Grey and lady. The first ministers were J. B.
              Burch, Rev. Edwards and Landy Havens.
            
            The society worshiped in school-houses and private dwellings until the year 1853,
              when the present church building was finished. It was dedicated in June of the same
              year by Bishop Ames. The house is in good repair, and capable of seating three hundred
              persons. Present Minister, H. Woolpert.
            The first camp-meeting held in this vicinity, was by Rev. James Havens, in 1837.
            In connection with this church, a Sunday-school was organized in the year 185O, which
              has continued to grow in numbers and usefulness till they now have an interesting and
              prosperous school, with an average attendance of eighty. S. Burke, present
              superintendent.
          
          
            GERMAN M. E. CHURCH,
            Palestine, was organized in the spring of 1851, with the following members: J. D.
              Faut, Christina Faut, A. Kirkhoff, Mariah Kirkhoff, Conrad Gundrum and wife, John
              Lange and lady, John Manche and wife, Henry and Elizabeth Fink, and Jacob Lange and
              wife. The first ministers were Philip Deor, Rev. Wilke, and L. Heis. In 1852, the
              organization erected a house, at a cost of a thousand dollars. The first trustees were
              J. D. Faut, Conrad Gundrum, A. Kirkhoff, John Manche, and Henry Fink. The present
              trustees are Conrad Gundrum, A. Kirkhoff, J. Lantz, Jacob Kratz, and Charles Reasoner.
              Present minister, Rev. John Ficken. To this church belong some of the staid, sturdy
              German farmers and substantial men of the township.
          
          
            CHURCH OF CHRIST,
            New Palestine, was organized September 4, 1870, on the following platform: "We, the
              undersigned, members of the body of Christ, agree to congregate ourselves together for
              the worship of the true God, and the edifying of each other in love; to be governed by
              the word of the Lord,  exclusive of the doctrines and
              commandments of men." Signed by the following names of original members:
            
              Michael H. Hittle,
              Elizabeth R. Hittle,
              Sanford Furry,
              Henry Bussell,
              Malinda Bussell,
              Albert Freeman,
              Harriet Freeman,
              Ethelbert Richardson,
              Malinda Richardson,
              Margaret Kamerian,
              Rachel Kamerian,
              Minerva Wheeler,
              Lavina Pitcher,
              John R. Armstrong,
              Eliza J. Armstrong.
            
            The above organization was effected in the school-house at Palestine, under the
              pastorate of Elder W. R. Low. Being denied the privilege of longer worshiping in the
              school-house, the organization met in the railroad depot. In 1871, the society erected
              a house, large and substantial, at a cost of $1,550, exclusive of ground, which was
              donated by H. P. Anderson. The building was dedicated on the 25th day of November,
              1871, by Elder W. R. Jewel, of Danville, Indiana, and a thorough organization was
              effected by electing George B. Richardson, M. H. Hittle, John P. Armstrong, J. M.
              Pitcher, and H. P. Anderson, deacons. Elder W. T. Hough was the successor of W. R.
              Low, followed by Lockhart, John A. Navitz, W. H. Bowles and Robert Blount. There has
              never been a re-election of officers from the date of the organization till the
              present, though some have died, and others moved away. The church is in good
              condition, with a membership of over sixty. The said John A. Navitz, during his labors
              with the organization, in the winter of 1876-77, held a very interesting, largely
              attended debate with a Soul Sleeper preacher, by the name of Sanford.
          
          
            GERMAN LUTHERAN CHURCHES.
            The first German church in Sugar-creek township, known as the Albright German Church,
              was organized in the year 1836, in a block-house three miles west of  Palestine, and consisted wholly of Germans who had
              recently arrived from the principality of Hamburg, Germany. Most of them were
              financially poor, but spiritually rich; and in setting about to supply the wants of
              the body, they would fain supply the soul with food also, and hence delayed not in
              associating themselves together as one grand Godly family, made up of about
              twenty-five private families. Their spiritual wants were first supplied by a priestly
              patriarch named Kiebler, followed by Rev. Mr. Muth, a preacher of the United
              Brethren.
            Contemporary with the organization existed the German School Society, whose duties
              were to supply the children with facilities for securing a secular education, and a
              knowledge of the catechism. In 1841, the first German Lutheran minister, Rev. J. G.
              Kuntz, came to Indianapolis, took charge of the German church at that place, and
              preached for the new society, first once every four weeks, then tri-weekly. The
              society becoming more numerous and wealthy, at the special instance and request of
              their pastor, said Kuntz, they extended a call to Rev. A. Brandt to come and live
              among them to preach and teach, which call he accepted. Brandt was followed by Revs.
              Hermeon and A. Scheurmann. In 1853, said Kuntz was returned, and a new church was
              built in the central western part of the township, on the land previously owned by the
              school society, on which was situated two block houses, a dwelling and school-house.
              This society was known as the German Evangelical Lutheran Zion's congregation. The
              building was a frame, 35x50 feet, constructed by a young man named Kaiser, at a cost
              of $1,200. It was dedicated on the 27th of November, 1859, by Rev. Frick. Rev. Kuntz
              was connected with this church, as pastor and schoolmaster, for more than thirty
              years. The writer had the pleasure of calling on him in the school-room, assisted by
              his daughter, in 1874. The room was a small log structure, located on the south side
              of the road, in the north-east corner of the north-west quarter of section
              twenty-four, near said Zions church. The house was full 
              of children. Teachers and students were industriously engaged. Since which time a new
              school-house has been erected, with the modern improvements.
          
          
            M. E. CHURCH, NEW PALESTINE,
            was organized in 1830, in a school-house near where the present public school
              building stands. Among the prime movers and first members of this organization were
              David and Catharine McNamee, George H. and Mary Robison, Thomas Swift and wife, Lewis
              and Phoebe Burk, Joseph and Elizabeth Conner, John and Sophia Ashcraft, Joseph and
              Elizabeth Munger, Adam Hawk and wife, Whitfield True and wife, Dr. B. F. True and

            NEW PALESTINE CORNET BAND.
            The citizens of New Palestine, in harmony with the progressive spirit of the times
              and country, nearly two decades since organized the musical talent of the place into a
              brass band, well furnished, equipped, and supplied with a wagon, at a total cost for
              instruments, uniforms and wagon, of $1,150; in addition to which liberality, they
              expended for instruction and music, $400; for incidentals, perhaps $50, making a total
              expenditure to the boys and their friends of $1,600. The charter members, not included
              in the present membership, were Walter Waterson, James Arthur, Henry G. Mickle, Albert
              H. Dix, Charles Haynes, Thomas J. Elliott, and J. M. Freeman. The present members are:
                Smith T. Nichols, * John H. Garver, George W. Nichols, William F. Anderson, John
              Westlake, Fred Freagel, William Gundrum, John Carson, Marshall
              Waterson and Harry Garver. This band is in good working order, and
              is equaled in the county in its efficiency and ability to charm and hold spell-bound
              its audiences by the Greenfield band only, whose leader has been their main
              instructor, and it is surpassed by none, notwithstanding the acknowledged ability and
              recognized efficiency of the other good bands of the county. It has been our good
              pleasure to hear this band discourse on different occasions to enrapt audiences such
              euphonious, harmonious music as seldom wings its way to the ear of mortal man; and
              should they so direct their steps as to have the good fortune to enter the celestial
              city, they will doubtless be chosen to augment that innumerable company which
              surrounds the throne, with golden instruments and harps in their hands, ever singing,
              blowing, playing and rejoicing, as only angels can do.
            *The italicized names above
              were also charter members.
          
          
          
            BENJAMIN MCNAMEE,
            a native of the "Buckeye State," dates his earthly career from the 30th day of
              September, 1827. At the tender age of six, he moved with his father, David McNamee,
              and settled in Sugar-creek township, two and one-half miles north of Palestine, where
              he still resides on the old homestead which his father entered. At this early date,
              Mr. McNamee says he knew of but one log cabin between the Brookville and National
              road. A few scattering cabins were to be found on the bluffs of Sugar Creek and Buck
              Creek, and wild game of various kinds existed in abundance. At the age of twenty-two,
              Mr. McNamee joined his destiny with Mary Ann Irons, September 9, 1849. The fruits of
              this union have been eight children, four of whom are living. Catharine, the eldest,
              is the wife of Prof. Morgan Caraway, principal of the Fortville graded schools. The
              second, James W., and his wife reside in Fremont county, Iowa. The remaining two
              daughters, Emma and Mollie, are living with their parents. Mr. McNamee and his amiable
              wife have been consistent members of the M. E. Church for thirty-two years.
          
          
            NEW PALESTINE LODGE, F. A. M., No. 404.
            The above-named lodge was organized under a dispensation of the G. M., in January,
              1869, by which authority F. M. Hook was appointed worshipful master; J. P. Armstrong,
              senior warden, and C. H. Shellhouse, junior warden of said body. The first stated
              communication of this lodge occurred January 30, 1869, at which meeting the grand
              master appointed the rest of the officers necessary to perfect the organization, viz.:
              E. P. Scott, treasurer; B. Westlake, secretary; B. F. Stutsman, senior deacon; C.
              Bennett, junior deacon; J. P. Vernon, tylor. These, with the three appointed in the
              dispensation, constituted the officers of said lodge No. 404. On the 25th day of May
              following, a charter was received from the 
              
                BENJAMIN McNAMEE.
              
               grand lodge. The order now being firmly established,
              peace and harmony prevailing, the close of the year 1869 found the lodge with bright
              prospects before it. The present officers are J. P. Armstrong, W. M.; Eli Stout, S.
              W.; T. P. Vernon, junior warden; J. C. Vansickle, treasurer; E. P. Scott, secretary;
              W. A. Eaton, S. D.; A. P. Hogle, J. D.; O. P. Hobbs, tylor. This lodge has had several
              public installments, and public addresses by John V. R. Miller, W. H. Bowles, and
              other bright lights. Among those the death of whom the lodge has been called upon to
              mourn are F. M. Hook, its first master; B. Westlake, the first secretary; and more
              recently, Prof. Aaron Pope, the latter of whom, though young in Masonry, was twice
              master of the lodge. Gone, all gone! but not forgotten. Though the lodge mourns its
              loss, the members rejoice in a consolation of meeting them in that celestial lodge
              above, where the Supreme Architect of the universe presides, and the tylor admits none
              but the true and tried.
            [We are indebted to J. P. Armstrong for the above facts.]
          
          
            HISTORY OF THE GERMAN SETTLEMENT.
            The first German who entered land in Hancock county was Carl Julius Leopold Albert
              Von Bonge. He was born November 24, 1798, in Liegnitz, Silesia, Prussia, Germany.
              Having received a classic education, he adopted the profession of law. Owing to
              political difficulties with the Prussian government, he was compelled to leave his
              native country. He therefore selected, fled to, and adopted the United States, "the
              land of the free and the home of the brave." He first settled in Zanesville, Ohio,
              then for a time resided in Cincinnati, when in the year 1828, in company with his
              young wife, he emigrated to Hancock county, to what is now called the German
              settlement, and entered a quarter section of land. Albert Lange, a schoolmate and
              colleague in his profession, who also fled the country from the same cause, came over
              at the same time, and entered a quarter section adjoining that of Mr.  Bonge. For a number of years they cleared up, fenced, and
              made a home in the swamps. Mr. Lange sold his 160 acres eight years after, and settled
              in Terre Haute, where he was mayor of the city for a time, and auditor of Vigo county
              for a number of years. He was three times the nominee of the republican party for
              auditor of state, to which position he was elected in 1860, and filled the place of
              trust with credit to himself and honor to the people. Indeed, Mr. L. was a prominent
              citizen of the state until his death. Mr. B. sold his quarter section also about
              twelve years after entering. He then settled over the line in Cumberland, Marion
              county, where he resided and engaged in the mercantile business. Here he lived, a
              useful citizen, to a good old age, and died only a few years since; and his pioneer
              wife, the first German woman that ever located in this prosperous German settlement,
              is still living. She was born in 1813, at Heil Bron, in the kingdom of Wurtemburg,
              Germany, and was married to said Carl Julius Leopold Albert Von Bonge in the year
              1831, at Dayton, Ohio.
            By the location and influence of Mr. Bonge and Mr. Lange, a German doctor, by the
              name of Ronenberg, who came from Buckeburg, Schaumburg-Lippe, Germany, established
              himself near them. Through the influence of these three worthy, prominent men,
              numerous others were induced to follow. Among the first were Geo. Nolener, John
              Schreiber, Mr. Wolframm, Chas. Oswold, Mr. Linbricht, Anthony Wishmeier, Benj. Rothe,
              Jacob Schramm, Andrew Finck, Christian Schildmeier, Wm. Reasoner, Charles Brewer,
              Ludwig Richmann, Wilhelm Rushaubt, Anthony Kirkhoff, Anthony Meier, Daniel Faut and
              John Grene. These were a few of the pioneers who settled here from 1830 to 1840,
              followed by many of their relatives, friends and acquaintances, each of whom cast in
              his might to make the German settlement what it is to-day—the garden spot of
              Hancock county. As before stated, they have their churches and schools, and are taught
              honesty, industry and frugality. Let the young  from the
              above history learn the lesson that "it is an ill wind that blows nobody good;" that a
              kite rises against the aerial current, and not with it. The hanging of John Brown was
              the hanging of slavery; religious persecution in England planted the pilgrim fathers
              on Plymouth Rock, and political differences in Prussia, Germany, drove Carl Julius
              Leopold Albert Von Bonge and the Hon. Albert Lange to America, to form the nucleus
              around which should cluster the persecuted and poor, the young and old of their native
              countrymen, to aid in converting the marsh into the meadow, the forest into fields,
              and the deep, tangled wildwood into beds of roses and broad acres of golden grain.
              Long live their memory.
          
          
            WILLIAM C. BARNARD.
            The subject of this sketch, a native of Hancock county, was born May 31, 1843, and
              was the third son of Reuben Barnard, a prominent citizen, farmer and stock-raiser of
              Sugar-creek township.
            Educational advantages being limited at the time he was growing up, he received
              instructions from his father during the winter months, and worked on the farm in the
              summer. In the year 1862, he entered Butler University, and remained there three
              terms, gaining the esteem of the faculty and advancing rapidly. In the fall of 1863,
              he entered Bryant's Commercial College, at Indianapolis, and completed a regular
              course of book-keeping, with its collateral branches, March the 5th, 1864.
            He was married May the 29th, 1867, to Amanda Gibson, of Marion county, Indiana, since
              which time he has been actively engaged in farming and stock raising, and has been
              very successful. His thrift and industry have gained for him the admiration of the
              community.
            Mr. Barnard has been three times elected trustee of the township, and as often
              elected secretary of the county board of education, and perhaps has done as much to
              raise 
              
                WILLIAM C. BARNARD.
              
               the standard of our common schools as any person that
              has held the office of township trustee in the county.
            Mr. Barnard is a young man, of nervo-bilious temperament, medium
              height, dark complected, strong and vigorous, with black hair, a piercing eye, and an
              active mind.
          
          
            AARON POPE.
            The subject of this sketch was born in Shelby county, about five miles south of
              Palestine, on September 16, 1844. His father was in moderate circumstances, and unable
              to give his son a collegiate education; but might have given him an opportunity to
              attend the public schools of the district, had he fully appreciated the importance of
              an education. Hence young Mr. P. was compelled to live in comparative ignorance until
              large enough to labor with his own hands, and thereby obtain means to purchase books
              and enter school of his own accord. But being allowed to attend school in the winter
              only, when the weather was too bad to work on the farm, his education reached no
              farther than the elementary principles of the fundamental branches.
            At the age of twenty, Mr. P. was married to Miss Nancy J. Murnan, of his native
              neighborhood. Here, on a rented farm, he began his efforts for an independent living.
              His wife lived but little more than a year, leaving her husband the care of an infant
              child, which lived but three months after its mother's death. Mr. P. being now left
              alone in the world, and feeling unsatisfied with his preparation for life's duties, he
              resolved at once to prepare himself for teaching. Though his education was so very
              limited, yet, by close application at leisure hours, and without attending school, in
              a little more than a year he was enabled to obtain license, and began teaching. He
              first held forth at Fairview school-house, in the fall of 1867, in which, as in
              subsequent terms, he was very successful. In January, 1871, he was again married. This
              time to Miss Louisa W. Vernon, of Shelby county. In 
              1873, he moved to Palestine, and was engaged in the employ of Eaton & Gates for
              three years, and in that of Schreiber & Brother for two years, with the exception
              of two winters devoted to his favorite pursuit. In the fall of 1877, he was elected
              principal of the McCordsville graded schools, which position he filled with entire
              satisfaction to all parties interested. While residing here he was elected county
              superintendent, to fill the unexpired term occasioned by the death of W. P. Smith.
              This position he 
                PROF. AARON POPE
               held to the date of his death, being twice re-elected and twenty-seven
              months in office. During all of this time Mr. P. was in harmony with the progressive
              educational spirit of the age, faithfully and conscientiously carrying out the
              advanced movements of his predecessors and inaugurating others as necessity and the
              spirit of the times demanded.
            Mr. P. was a young man of great energy, enterprise, and considerable originality, and
              was the proprietor and chief founder of the Home and School Visitor.
              Mr. P. from the age of sixteen to the date of his death was a faithful member of the
              Methodist Protestant Church, and  for ten years was a
              devoted Mason. He was twice master of the lodge at Palestine, took the chapter degrees
              at McCordsville in the, summer of 1879, and the council degrees in May 1881. He died
              at his residence in Greenfield, Thursday, July 21, 1881, aged thirty-seven years, and
              his remains peacefully repose in the New cemetery in this city.
          
          
            BENJAMIN F. FREEMAN,
            a native of the "Buckeye State," dates his earthly career to 1827, October 12. At the
              early age of two, in company with his parents, he came to Marion county, Indiana,
              where they remained until the fall of 1855, when, at the age of twenty-eight, he came
              to Palestine, sugar-creek township, and engaged in merchandising with Burk, Espy &
              Co., at which business he continued for about nine years, being a member during this
              time of different firms. In 1864, Mr. F. moved out on his farm, adjoining the town on
              the east, where he has resided ever since, and has been engaged in farming,
              stock-raising, merchandising and stock-trading. Mr. Freeman has been constantly in the
              goods trade since entering the county—though unable, from a pressure of
              business, to give it his personal attention—but has devoted the major part of
              his time to farming and stock trading, being one of the most extensive stock dealers
              in the county and the owner of over eight hundred acres of first-class land.
            Mr. F. was married in 1855 to Mary Ann, daughter of John Maple, of Rush county. The
              fruits of this union are four children, three boys and one girl, all of whom are
              unmarried, except James A. Mr. F. has been a consistent member of the M. E. Church for
              more than forty years. Ever since the organization of the republican party, in 1856,
              Mr. F. has been a staunch member thereof. Not from policy, but from principle, though
              never in office nor aspiring in that direction, prefering the quiet seclusion of rural
              pursuits. In person, Mr. F. is tall, strong and 
              
                JAMES C. HAWK.
              
               portly, of a sanguino-nervo-bilious
              temperament, has light complexion, light hair, blue eyes, and a dignified bearing,
              nearly six feet in height, and two hundred pounds in weight.
          
          
            MISS CLARA LOUISE BOTTSFORD,
            a native of Johnson county, Indiana, removed with her parents to Sugar-creek township
              about the year 1860, when but a mere child. Here she has remained ever since. Her
              parents dying some few years ago, together with her elder sister, made her pathway
              rather a rough one for a while, but it is smoother now. Though her opportunities for
              an education were limited, being confined mainly to the public schools of the
              township, yet, by industry and close application, she has prepared herself for
              teaching, and has had some eight years' experience in the public schools of the
              county, but is now giving her attention mainly to literary work; from a small
              beginning in the county papers over a norm de plume, then in
              numerous sensational works, Frank Lesley, Chimney Corner, and New York Ledger, and not until more recently has she appeared over her
              own signature in the Indianapolis Journal and Herald, Chicago Inter Ocean, New York Sun,
              and other metropolitan papers.
            The writer is well acquainted with the subject of this sketch, having been associated
              with her in the first normal school of the county and as superintendent of the
              Greenfield graded schools, and also had the honor of licensing her to teach in the
              public schools, and can freely credit her with manifesting the will to rise under
              adverse circumstances.
            After the death of her father, E. S. Bottsford, Esq., she was appointed
              administratrix of the estate, and has taken the responsibilities of the head of the
              family. We give an extract from one of her poems, for want of space here, in a future
              chapter.

              SHOWING THE SECTIONS, TOWNSHIP, AND RANGES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED.
            
            Name and Organization.—This township, which bears the name of
              the final resting place of the mortal remains of the first President of the United
              States, was organized in 1836, and was taken from the north part of Buck-creek. In
              1838, four sections were struck off from the south-east corner to form a part of Union
              township, but in 1853 were replaced, since which time she has maintained her present
              size and boundaries.
            
            Location, Boundaries, Size, etc.—Vernon township is located
              in the north-western part of the county. It is bounded on the north by Hamilton and
              Madison counties, on the east by Green township, on the south by Center and
              Buck-creek, and on the west by Marion county. In extent it is seven miles in length
              and five miles in width, with four sections out of the north-west corner, and is,
              therefore, composed of thirty-one sections. It is one of the two townships in the
              county with an irregular outline. Its greatest length is east and west. It lies in
              township seventeen north, and is in ranges five and six east, two tiers of sections on
              the west being in range five and the remainder in range six east. The range line runs
              one mile east of McCordsville, one-third of a mile west of Woodberry, and forms the
              east line of H. Caldwell's and John McCord's farms.
            Surface, Soil, Drainage, and Productions.—The surface is
              exceedingly level throughout almost the entire township, and especially in the western
              part; indeed, it is the only township in the county in which we have been unable to
              find a few hills. Along Flat Fork, and for a short distance back therefrom, the
              surface is slightly undulating, and section nine, in which Fortville is located, and
              through which Flat Fork passes out of the county, is considerably rolling and somewhat
              hilly.
            The soil is of black or brown loam, deep, rich and exhaustless in resources, with the
              exception of three or four sections, which have more or less a clay soil.
            Prior to the use of tile, a considerable number of small wooden ditches and a few
              open ditches were sunk in the township. Since the location of a tile factory within
              her borders, a number of tile ditches have been put in by her more enterprising
              citizens. But she is still in need of vastly more. Indeed, in comparison with other
              townships as to drainage, she is behind; and we would suggest the construction, by her
              liberal citizens, of a few broad, deep outlets under the new ditch law, approved April
              8, 1881, which provides not only for the construction of a ditch,  but the keeping in repair, and, in short, is simple and complete in
              itself, and superior to any other drainage law ever placed upon our statute books, not
              excepting the act providing for the draining and reclaiming of wet lands, approved
              March 9, 1875. In drawing these comparisons between the townships in surface and
              drainage, we speak not from guess-work or hearsay, but actual observation. The writer
              has a number of times been on every public road, in many of the residences, and all of
              the school-houses in the county, and know whereof we speak.
            The chief productions are wheat, corn, hogs, cattle, flaxseed, potatoes, fruits, flax
              straw, lumber, horses, oats, and the products of the hennery and dairy. In 1880,
              Vernon township produced on 2,644 acres, 39,660 bushels of wheat; on 3,727 acres,
              77,200 bushels of corn; on 332 acres, 9,960 bushels of oats; on 509 acres, 763 tons of
              hay; being the fewest acres and fewest bushels of wheat of any township in the county,
              and also the fewest bushels of corn.
            Streams.—Sugar Creek, the largest stream in the township,
              passes through the south-east corner to the extent of about one mile, cutting off a
              small portion of section thirty-five. Buck Creek rises in the central portion of the
              township, flows south by south-west, and passes out near the south-west corner of
              section thirty-two. Flat Fork, a very small stream, rises near the south-east corner
              of section twenty-seven, meanders north about two and one-half miles; thence
              north-west, passing out of the township about three-fourths of a mile west of
              Fortville, near the south-west corner of section nine. It is ditched nearly the entire
              length, and has no banks.
            First Land Entry and First Settlers.—The first land entry in
              this township was made by George Crim, on the 16th day November, 1826, being the east
              half of the south-west quarter of section twenty-nine, in township seventeen north,
              and range six east. The second entry was made by Samuel Henry, in the same section,
              and in the same month and year.
            
            Among the first settlers were John Brooks, Joe Winn, Richard Stokes, Nathan
              Blackburn, Micajah Shull, David Fisher, the Crossley family, the John Robb family,
              Tarleton Walker, William and Sarah McCord, George Pritchet, Jacob Smith, Hiram Duncan,
              John Caudel, George Chappel, George Jackson, Jehu Denney, and Arthur Morrison. There
              are doubtless others who are entitled to a place in the above list, but their names
              have escaped our observation. The reading of the above will call to the minds of our
              readers pleasant memories of earlier days and hallowed associations with these brave
              frontier men, almost all of whom have gone. Forever gone! but not forgotten. They have
              left "foot-prints on the sands of time; foot-prints which, perhaps, another, sailing
              o'er life's sturdy main, seeing, shall take heart again."
            A Few First Things.—The first preachers in the township were
              Rev. Wyman and Thomas Jenkins; first doctors, J. W. Harvey and Hiram Duncan; first
              merchant, Perry Fort; first school-house, near McCordsville; first road, Noblesville
              road; first mill, at Fortville; first postmaster, Thomas Noel; first postmaster at
              Woodbury, David Brown; first postmaster at McCordsville, H. M. Thompson; first pike,
              Noblesville road; first land entry, by George Crim; first graded school, at
              McCordsville; first lodge, Masons; first teachers, foreigners; first railroad station,
              at Fortville; first marriage, David Caudel and wife, in 1836; first teacher, Thomas
              Sherman. The first election was in August, 1836; the ballots were thirteen in number,
              twelve democratic and one republican, all cast in a hat.
            Mills and Factories.—The first mill in Vernon township was a
              steam saw-mill, built in 1849, by Noel & Co., at Fortville. In 1853, said Noel
              & Co. erected a steam flouring mill in Fortville, and it was run for several
              years, when it met with the common fate of mills and factories in Hancock county, and
              returned to mother earth in dust and ashes.
            In 1854, E. H. McCord erected, in McCordsville, a 
              
                DR. J. G. STUART.
              
               steam flouring mill, which was successfully operated
              for a number of years, when it met with a similar fate, and succumbed to the forked
              flames of the ferocious fire fiend.
            In 1854, Hooker & Son built a steam grist and saw mill in Woodbury, which soon
              met with the like fate, being overcome with the warm embraces and enveloping sheets.
              of fiery flames.
            In 1857, John Sample built and operated a shingle factory for a time.
            There was a heading factory and woolen factory successfully operated for a time at
              Fortville, but each non est at this date.
            There is running at this time, in the suburbs of Fortville, a steam flouring mill and
              a saw-mill. There is also a steam saw-mill in operation at McCordsville.
            Aaron Littleton operated a tile factory for a number of years, using the machinery
              formerly used by Eb. Steele in Buck-creek, in a tile factory in that township.
            An extensive tile factory has been in operation for several years a short distance
              south of Fortville, which has supplied the township with almost all the tile she has
              ever used. There is also a planing mill, a flax factory and a stave factory located
              near this same town.
            Andrew Hagen, ex-county treasurer, has an extensive flax-straw factory and grain
              elevator in Fortville. There is also a heading factory at Fortville, and an extensive
              grain elevator at McCordsville, operated by T. J. Hanna.
            Roads and Railroads.—The roads in this township, like
              Buck-creek and other smaller sections of low, wet ground, were, until within the last
              few years, merely dirt and corduroy roads slightly improved, and at times almost
              impassable. During the pike fever which swept over this county, this township, like
              others, was similarly affected, which resulted in the construction of about
              twenty-five miles of toll pike, nineteen of which are now tollable, in addition to a
              few miles which have been returned to the road district. It has a line running from
              Fortville to Greenfield, one from Eden to McCordsville, and one from  Fortville to Pendleton pike, in addition to a few other
              short lines.
            This township has one railroad extending diagonally across the township a distance of
              about seven miles, known as the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis R.
              R., or "Bee Line," for short, on which the company has three stations in the territory
              under consideration, viz.: Fortville, Woodbury and McCordsville. Telegraph lines also
              extend along the track of this company.
            Educational.—The first schools in this township were
              subscription, or pay schools, taught by itinerant schoolmasters, and occasionally by a
              resident, for about three months during the winter season. The non-resident teachers
              usually taught by the term, or quarter, and boarded among the patrons, each of whom
              agreed to furnish him with board and lodging his proportionate length of time. Among
              the first school-houses, all of which at this early date were mere pole cabins, were:
              One on Robbs's farm, one-half mile south of McCordsville; one two miles east of
              McCordsville, and one in Fortville. There was no public school money at this time,
              except a small interest income from the congressional township school fund. There was
              no special school tax, and hence the state did not build the houses nor furnish fuel.
              Wood, like board, was usually furnished by the patrons, in proportion to the number of
              scholars subscribed. Teachers usually agreed only to give instruction in spelling,
              reading, writing, and arithmetic, to the single rule of three.
            This township, in the vote on the free school question in 1848-9, like her sister
              townships, was decidedly opposed to the inauguration of the proposed system. Her vote
              in 1848 stood: "Free school," forty; "no school," seventy-four. In 1849 her vote
              stood: "Free school," seventeen; "no school," one hundred and two; being a majority of
              eighty-five in favor of the old system, and, next to Buck-creek, the smallest vote in
              the county in favor of the constitutional amendment providing for a state system, in
              which tuition should be free and equally open to all. 
              Since that time, however, Vernon has brought herself up in harmony with the
              progressive spirit of the times on the subject of education, and other intellectual
              and moral enterprises for the advancement and amelioration of mankind.
            The following will show the numbers and names of the public school-houses in Vernon,
              and the present instructors:
            
              
                Dist. No. 1
                McCordsville

                  Thompson, Assistants.
              
              
                Dist. No. 2

                Dist. No. 5.
                Cook's
                Lawrence Durach.
              
              
                Dist. No. 6.
                Duzan's

                Dist. No. 7.
                Woodbury
                J. W. McCord.
              
              
                Dist. No. 8.
                Cushman's
                C. Vanlaningham.
              
              
                Fortville
                
                M. Caraway, Prin.; A. E. Cummins, Anna Chittenden, Alice
                  Cory, Assistants.
              
            
            This township has nine school-houses—seven frames and one brick-valued at,
              including ground, furniture and out-buildings, $12,000. Her maps, charts, globes and
              other school apparatus are valued at $400. Total value of school property in the
              township, including Fortville, $12,400. These buildings are mostly cheap frames of one
              room and no suitable out-buildings. Fortville and McCordsville each have commodious,
              substantial two-story bricks, well supplied with furniture, creditable alike to the
              people and trustees, under whose supervision they were erected. There has been a
              gradual increase in the scholastic population since 1853, the first enumeration. The
              returns for 1853 gave the township 469; enumeration for 1860, 636; for 1870, 712; for
              1881, 751; two hundred and twenty-six of which, in 1881, were reported for
              Fortville.
            Township Trustees.—The following list shows the  names of the trustees in Vernon .township, from the time
              of the election in 1859, at which time the law was so changed that one trustee
              performed the duties previously devolving upon three trustees and a clerk, together
              with additional duties, so that the law may be worthy of historical notice:
            
              Perry J. Brinegar1859
              Levi Thomas1861, 1865
              G. W. Stanley1863
              Andrew Hagen1866
              Stokes Jackson1876
              Samuel Arnett1880
            
            Remarks: Brinegar and Stanley each held the office two years; Thomas, three years;
              Hagen ten and Jackson four years. Hagen filled the office longer than any other man in
              the township. The financial interests of the township are now entrusted to Samuel
              Arnett.
            Churches.—This township is reasonably well supplied with
              churches: The M. E.; Christian and Catholic in Fortville; one M. E. in McCordsville;
              one Baptist in the eastern part of the township; one Dunkard society in the south-east
              part, and one M. E. at Woodbury, a special account of each of which we will give you
              further on.
            Population.—An examination of the census report of this
              township for a few decades, shows the following, to-wit: Population in 1850, 908; in
              1860, 1,637; in 1870, 2,518; in 1880, 2,306.
            Remarks: It must be borne in mind that the territory embodied in Vernon was not so
              large in 1850 as in subsequent periods. From 1850 to 1853, Union township included
              within her borders the south-east corner of Vernon. Union reports for 1850, 522
              inhabitants; hence a fair and proportionate estimate for the inhabitants in the
              territory now embodied in Vernon in 1850 would be 1,038. In our reports above of the
              population, we have included in Vernon township both Fortville and McCordsville.
              McCordsville in 1870 had 168 inhabitants; Fortville in 1870 had 387. We have no
              official reports of the number of these two places for any other dates.
            
            Polls and Votes.—A voter in Indiana, at this date, is any
              native born, or naturalized foreign born male citizen, of sound mind, twenty-one years
              of age, there being now no distinction as to color, the only bar being sex,
              non-naturalization, disfranchisement and non compos mentis. The poll
              in Indiana is any legal voter under fifty; hence, the distinction between polls and
              voters is marked and considerable, the latter being much the more numerous. The polls
              for Vernon township in 1840 were 96; 1850, 121; 1860, 254; 1870, 232; 1880, 582. Her
              vote in 1860, 309; 1870, 412; in 1880 her vote stood democratic, 318; republican, 254;
              independent, 10; democratic majority, sixty-four. We do dot give the vote prior to
              1853, for the reason that before that time voters could cast their ballots at any
              precinct in the county, and any reports prior to that time would not be a fair showing
              for the townships. This township has two voting precincts: First, at Fortville;
              second, at McCordsville.
            Value of Real and Personal Property.—This township reports
              19,936 acres of land, valued at $446,460, exclusive of Fortville; improvements on the
              same, valued at $68,840, being an average of about $26 per acre. Value of lots,
              $4,720; value of improvements, $10,800; value of personal, $150,835; value of
              telegraph, $730; railroads, $104,-115; total value of property in Vernon township,
              exclusive of Fortville, $786,800. Fortville reports 120 acres of land, valued at
              $1,920; improvements on same, $3,725; value of lots, $17,180; value of improvements,
              $39,640; personal property, $47,425; telegraph, $30; railroad, $12,850. Total value of
              taxable property in Fortville, $122,820.
            Taxes.—To obtain a correct idea of the growth in wealth of
              the township, the reader should compare the taxes of tho earlier decades with the
              present. This township paid taxes to the amount of $412.86 in 1840, on $62,711 worth
              of property; $590.89 for 1850, on $71,405 worth of property; $3,140.80 for 1860, on
              $411,910 worth of property; for 1870, $7,841.31, on $567,025 worth of property. Vernon
              pays $9,903.60 of this amount. The

            Justices of the Peace.—Vernon township, though rather young
              in years, can compare favorably with older townships in her array of ex-justices, as
              the following list of names, accompanied by date of election, will show:
            
              John S. Apple 1837, 1841
              Lewis P. Peal 1864

              Dennis Tobin 1872
              J. B, Galbreath 1872, 1876
              Lewis Chappel 1874
              Jacob Denney 1878
              O. P. Hastings 1878
              James W. McCord1880
              Cicero Vanlaningham 1880
            
            Among the ex-justices of Union township during her existence from 1838 to 1853,
              which, as we have previously remarked, included four sections now constituting the
              south-east corner of Vernon, were:
            
              James Reeves 1840
              David W. O'Dell 1841
              William B. Martin 1845
              Levi Leary 1846, 1851
              E. N. Wright 1850
              R. N. Dunn 1853
            
            James W. McCord and Cicero Vanlaningham are the present acting justices of the
              township. From 1828 to 1831, during the time that Vernon township belonged to
              Sugar-creek, her petty strifes were settled by George Leachman; and from 1831 to 1836,
              during which time Vernon was embodied in Buck-creek, Morgan Brinegar, Owen Jarrett and
              Wyatt Denney were invested with legal authority to hear and try all causes over which
              such sub-judges have jurisdiction. Esquires Brinegar and Denney, who are reported as
              the first justices in Buck-creek on page 122, always resided in the territory now
              embodied in Vernon township. Most of the above are still with us, active, prominent
              citizens, well-known in the township, and not entire strangers to most of our readers.
              John S. Apple, William Caldwell, Smith McCord, Emil Lenz and J. B. Galbreath were each
              twice clothed with judicial power. Jesse Cook gave such general satisfaction to
              litigants and others interested, that he was three times  honored with the votes of his constituents. Others of the above have been solicited
              longer to preside, but declined in favor of private life, preferring contentment in
              home duties to the labor and emoluments of office, remembering, perhaps, the
              injunction of Shakspeare—
                
                  "We must not make a scare-crow of the Law,
                  Setting it to fear the Birds of Prey,
                  And let it keep one shape, till Custom maketh
                  Their Perch, and not their terror."
                
              
            
            Ex-County Officers.—Vernon has contributed her mite in
              forming the various corps of county officials to serve the people as their agents and
              servants in local matters. Among those who were called in their day to serve the
              people, we note John Myer, auditor, and William P. Brokaw, commissioner. Among the
              living we call to mind Elias McCord, Reason Perry, and David Caudell, commissioners;
              Smith McCord, representative; Andrew Hagen, treasurer; and S. T. Yancey, senator.
            Murders, Suicides, and Fatal Accidents.—Eli Prickett was
              killed by Benjamin Copper in 1866, at Fortville.
            John Trittipo lost his life at a party, in a row, one mile south of Woodbury, on New
              Year's evening, 1857, at the house of Thomas Olvey.
            A daughter of Levi Myers was accidentally shot September 17, 1862, from which she
              died the day following.
            Sanford Cummins, a young man about thirty years of age, committed suicide in the fall
              of 1878, in his uncle's store in McCordsville. Mr. C., a young man of excellent
              parentage, had previously been a trusted clerk in the store, and had the confidence of
              his employer and the respect and esteem of the customers and all who knew him; but
              having contracted the habit of tippling and its accompanying evils, he lost respect
              for himself, and, for some reason, his position in the store; and, while under the
              influence of intoxicants and reason dethroned, he was caught one evening in the store
              abstracting money from  the vault. Being arrested, he
              begged time to shave himself before being taken to the county jail, which request was
              granted. After lathering his face, with razor in hand, he stepped to a mirror and,
              with one monstrous stroke, severed the trachea and the carotid artery, and fell a
              lifeless form. The cause of this sudden terminus to a promising life, as assigned by
              himself a short time prior, was whisky and its resultant evils. Let the young take
              warning. Shakespeare says: 
                
                  "Oh, thou invisible spirit of Wine,
                  If thou hast no name to be known by,
                  Let us call thee—Devil!
                  
                  Oh, that men should put an enemy to their mouths,
                  To steal away their brains!
                  
                  One draught above heat makes him a fool;
                  The second mads him; and a third drowns him."
                
              
            
            Recapitulation.—Vernon township, organized in 1836 with an
              irregular outline, contains thirty-one sections, one incorporated town, and two

          CHAPTER XX.
            VERNON TOWNSHIP—Continued.
          
            FORTVILLE,
            once called Walpole, in honor of Thomas D. Walpole, but now Fortville, i. e., Fort's Town, was laid out by Cephus Fort, on the 12th day of February,
              1849. It is located on the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis R. R.,
              north by north-west of Greenfield thirteen miles. It is on the banks of Flat Fork,
              within a mile of the Madison and Hamilton county lines. It is pleasantly located; in a
              rich grain growing district. The original plat consisted of forty-one lots. The first
              addition was made by Shull, on the 20th of February, 1855, and consisted of five lots,
              located on the north-east of the original plat. The second addition was laid out by
              Noel, on the 16th day of December, 1856, and consisted of fifteen lots and several
              large lots, located north-east of the old plat, between the railroad and Staats
              street. The third addition was made by Vanvelzer, on the 17th of December, 1856, and
              consisted of twelve lots, located south-west of the old plat, and on 
              
                WILLIAM J. SPARKS.
              
               the north side of the railroad. The fourth addition was
              laid out by James Merrill, the records fail to show when, and consisted of fourteen
              numbered lots, located south-east of the old town. The fifth addition was made by
              Garrison Asbury, on the 19th day of August, 1872, and consisted of nine lots, located
              on the south side of the railroad, south-west of the old plat. The sixth addition was
              laid out by Record & Voorhes, on the 17th of February, 1873, and consisted of
              twenty-six blocks, designated by the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet,
              containing 356 lots, located south of the railroad, and east of Merrill's addition and
              the old plat. The land from which it was carved was entered by Alfred Shortridge, on
              the 5th of January, 1835, being the south-east quarter of section nine, township
              seventeen north, and range six east. Staats made, perhaps, the first addition to the
              town, on the north of the old plat, but as we fail to find the proper records of the
              same, we are unable to give further reliable information relative thereto. Crouch also
              made an addition of which there is no record.
            Fortville is a thriving business point, convenient to Indianapolis, on the Bee Line;
              is a good market, has a population of 500, with a grain elevator, mills, factories,
              merchants, grocers, druggists, physicians, mechanics, a two-story brick school-house,
              U. S. express and daily mail, and other conveniences seldom possessed by a town of its
              size.
            Business and Business Men.—The first business of this place
              was very limited, and of a simple nature, and consisted mainly in bartering the few
              products of the pioneer frontier men for staple groceries and medicines, dry goods
              being mainly manufactured by themselves. Among those who first did business in this
              place were Perry Fort, Noel & Co., Joseph Chitwood and the firm of Tague &
              Chandler. Thomas R. Noel, the first and present postmaster, has served almost
              continuously since the establishment of the office. Andrew Hagen was postmaster for a
              time, during Buchanan's administration. Noel has also been  railroad. agent ever since the completion of the road, in 1853.

            MCCORDSVILLE,
            a comparatively new and thriving little town on the C., C., C. and I. R. R., fifteen
              miles north-west of Greenfield, and about the same distance north-east of
              Indianapolis, is pleasantly located, and surrounded by rich, fertile soil, in the
              central western part of the township. It was laid out on the 11th day of September,
              1865, by James W, Negley, with thirty-five lots. The first addition was made by Hiday,
              on the 11th day of February, 1869, and consisted of twenty-eight lots, located on the
              railroad, south-west of the original plat. The second addition was made by Bradley and
              McCord, on the 21st day of May, 1873, and consisted of thirty-nine lots, located south
              of the first plat. The third addition was made by Nelson Bradley, on the 31st day of
              August, 1873, and consisted of sixty-seven lots, located south of Bradley &
              McCord's addition. The fourth and last addition was made by McCord, on the 4th day of
              September, 1873, with eight lots, located east of original plat. The cemetery at this
              place was laid out by the I. O. O. F., on the 16th day of March, 1871, with one
              hundred and five lots and streets and alleys.
            McCordsville has a two-story brick township school building, grain elevator, livery
              stable, saw-mill, merchants, physicians, carpenters, a butcher, and other conveniences
              essential to the prosperity of a village of this size, numbering about three hundred
              inhabitants. It has also a U. S. express and daily mail. The land out of which
              McCordsville was carved had been entered by John H. Robb, on the 25th day of October,
              1835, being the north-east quarter of section twenty-six, in township

              now of Indianapolis, was the first resident physician. Among. the first business men
              were William Emery, Nelson Bradley, and a Mr. Littleton. Others have done business in
              the place from time to time, but we must hasten on to give a

            WOODBURY,
            a tiny burg on the C., C., C. and I. R. R., between Fortville and McCordsville,
              soventeen miles north-east of Indianapolis, was laid out on the 12th of December,
              1851, by Ellen Wood, with thirty—two lots. It has had no additions. Among the
              first business men of this place were  John Bills, Azel
              Hooker, Garrison Asbury, William and Joseph Bills, Taylor & Lockhart, Martindale,
              Taylor & Brown, P. J. Brinegar and G. W. Shultz. This place once did some
              business, but since the completion of the railroad, and the development of
              McCordsville and Fortville, it has lost somewhat its pristine glory. There was once a
              railroad agency and warehouse here for several years, with Thomas Hawkins as agent.
              The warehouse was burned down, and the agency was discontinued. Its present merchant
              is David Brown. The sick and infirm are looked after by Dr. B. B. Witham. Its
              blacksmiths are J. W. Peik, John Olvey and G. L. Morrow. Postmaster, David Brown.
              Among those that have been in the government service at this point are J. C. Bills,
              Garrison Asbury and P. J. Brinegar. Woodbury has one church, a district school, one
              store, a blacksmith shop, post-office and railroad station, a central location, and
              plenty of room for future development.
          
          
            MANITAU TRIBE, No. 53, I. O.
              R. M.,
            was organized January 8, 1875, at Fortville. The first officers of this Indian Tribe
              were J. H. Treher, sachem; Andrew Kappes, senior sachem; G. H. Jackson, junior sachem;
              C. V. Hardin, chief of records, and Garrison Asbury, keeper of wampum. The lodge
              organized under favorable circumstances, with about twenty members, and is still on
              the war path and around the camp fires with increasing numbers. Its present officers
              are: C. V. Hardin, S.; Thomas Toby, S. S.; Nat. Lake, J. S.; Andrew Kappes, keeper of
              wampum. Total membership, twenty-eight. Concil meetings and camp fires kindled
              Wednesday evening of each week.
          
          
            NATIONAL CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNION.
            There was for a number of years a temperance organization in Fortville, in addition
              to a Good Templar lodge. In February or March, 1879, D. B. Ross, of Indianapolis,  in connection with the Christian and M. E. churches,
              conducted a revival, during which six hundred persons signed the pledge. A branch of
              the National Christian Temperance Union was organized, with J. B. Anderson as
              president, S. H. McCarty vice-president, Irena Anderson secretary, Mrs. Dr. Stuart
              treasurer, and a board of five managers. A constitution was adopted, making the
              officers elective semi-annually. S. H. McCarty, J. B. Anderson and J. C. McCarty have
              been the presidents of the order. Meetings weekly or semi-monthly have been sustained
              continuously since the date of organization. The work has mainly been done by home
              talent, prominent among whom were Elder J. W. Ferrell, and Revs. J. S. McCarty and J.
              F. Rhoades. Other ministers and temperance lecturers have participated in the work.
              They have done good practical work, having succeeded in defeating applications for
              license till at this date there is not a licensed saloon in the place.
          
          
            FORTVILLE LODGE, No. 207, F.

              a comfortable, commodious hall, with the appropriate emblems of the order, in the
              second story over Bills's dry goods store. The order is in a flourishing condition,
              with a total membership of thirty-eight. The regular meetings occur on Saturday
              evening on or before the full of the moon in each month.
          
          
            EDWARDS LODGE, No. 178, I. O.
              O. F.,

              treasurer. This lodge took its name from Hon. William R. Edwards, formerly mayor of
              the city of Terre Haute. The order owns the room in which they meet, and the members
              seem to be dwelling together in friendship, love and truth. The stated meeting, occur
              Friday evenings of each week. Total membership, twenty-six.
            The Daughters of Rebecca, a branch of the Odd Fellows, composed of women, hold their
              meetings in the same room each Saturday evening. Their lodge is known as Fortville
              Lodge, No. 80, and was chartered March 29, 1872. The first and present officers
              include some of the most noble women of Fortville.
          
          
            MCCORDSVILLE LODGE, No. 338, I. 0. 0. F.,

              Bills, J. H. Helms, John Dunham, J. W. Negley, Alfred Bills, Israel Fred, William Sapp
              and Sylvester Gaskins. The lodge continued to hold its meetings in the original room,
              until an increase of numbers made it necessary to obtain a new hall, whereupon the
              lodge purchased a convenient and commodious room, in a brick building owned by
              Caldwell & Steele. Here the order, pleasantly located, in a room well furnished,
              has grown financially and numerically, until it can boast of forty-five active
              members, together  with an orphan fund of nearly $400,
              and a general fund of $2,400. The present officers are: A. J. Gale, N. G.; Frank

            MCCORDSVILLE LODGE, No. 140, F. A. M.,
            was organized under dispensation in 1852, and was granted a charter in 1853. The
              lodge held its meetings for a time in the second story of Elias McCord's house. B. G.
              Jay, W. M.; Dr. J. W. Hervey, S. W.; Nelson Bradley, J. W. This lodge was removed to
              Oakland in 1853, and, retaining its old number, was known as Oakland Lodge, No.
              140.
          
          
            MCCORDSVILLE LODGE, No. 501, F. A. M.,
            was fully organized under a charter granted May 25, 1875. Among the first officers
              were Thomas P. Hervey, W. M.; Henry Crossley, S. W.; Ebenezer Steele, J. W. The

              sturdy men of McCordsville and vicinity. The lodge is not large, but prosperous. A
              chapter (No. 44) of the Masonic order was organized at McCordsville on the 23rd day of
              May, 1860. A council was established under a dispensation granted on the 8th day of
              March, 1881. The Masonic order at McCordsville has a splendid room, well furnished,
              and the lodge is in a healthful, prosperous condition financially and otherwise.
          
          
            FORTVILLE M. E. CHURCH
            was organized in 1854, in the then little town of Fortville. 
              
                ISAIAH A. CURRY.
              
               The following named members had, for a year prior to
              the Fortville organization, constituted a class across the line in Hamilton county:
              Peter Staats and wife, Martin Shaffer and lady, Mathias Shaffer and wife, Hiram
              Rutherford and wife, R. C. Pitman and lady, Henry Humphreys, wife and mother, and Mrs.
              Stuart. They held their meetings during this time in private dwellings, barns,
              unoccupied houses, and on one occasion they had preaching in a saw-mill. Rev. L. W.
              Munson observed that he had preached in the forests, fields, and out-of-the-way
              places, but never before in a saw-mill. The society becoming more numerous, in 1856
              erected a frame church, large and substantial, which was dedicated by Rev. Thos.
              Bowman, D. D. Among the first ministers were Revs. M. Wyman, Eli, Rammel, James Black,
              J. S. McCarty, and L. W. Munson. The present minister is J. S. McCarty.
            In connection with this church is established one of the best Sunday-schools in the
              county. Below is a summary report for the year 1878: Average attendance, one hundred
              and forty-seven; smallest attendance, eighty; largest attendance, two hundred and
              twenty-four. There was donated by all of the classes for the year, $121.51. Received
              from sale of journals, $7.22. The number of papers distributed during the year were:
                Everybody's Paper, 1,200 copies; Sunday School
                Advocate, 2,400 copies; Good News, 1,200 copies; Picture Lesson Paper, 1,000 copies; Temperance Alliance,
              1,200; Berean Lesson Leaves, 1,400. We have sufficient evidence
              before us fully establishing the fact that this is one of the most live, progressive,
              well disciplined, liberal, truth-seeking, Bible-searching Sunday-schools which it is
              our privilege to notice in this history. This school was organized in 1856. The first
              superintendent was Martin Shaffer, followed by William M. Baker, the present
              superintendent, who has held this position of trust and honor for more than
              twenty-three years.
          
          
          
            ST. THOMAS' CATHOLIC CHURCH,
            in Fortville, was built in 1869, under the ministration of D. J. McMullen, who was
              followed by Revs. J. B. Crowley, Logan, Fabel, Victor, et al. Among
              the first Catholics in the place were Patrick Kelly, George Voucher, John Callahan,
              Charles Bird, Daniel Mack and Thomas Tobin. The congregation consists at this time of
              sixteen families. Services are held on the third Sunday of each month. The membership
              are in peace and harmony, and the organization is in a healthy condition, performing
              its prescribed functions with efficiency.
          
          
            GERMAN BAPTIST, OR DUNKARD CHURCH,
            was organized in the year 1852, in a log school-house, in the south-east corner of
              the township. Among the first members were Alfred Denney and wife, George and Nancy
              Kingery, William Thomas and lady, Burto W. Jackson and helpmate. Among those who have
              pointed out the way of life and salvation in this corner of the moral vineyard are E.
              Caylor, D. Harmon, B. Bowman and George Hoover. The first communion was held at the
              private residence of Alfred Denney, in the year 1854, conducted by E. Caylor and G.
              Studebaker. The organization has held its meetings for a number of years in the
              school-house on Alfred Denney's farm. The present membership is from fifty to sixty,
              including our old friend and Mexican veteran, Alfred Denney.
          
          
            M. E. CHURCH, WOODBURY,
            was built in the year 1874, at a cost of $1,100, and dedicated by Samuel Lamb. The
              first trustees were Franklin Dunham, John Sample and John Hooker. Meetings were held
              prior to the building of the house, in a school-house, one mile north. The first
              members were few but faithful, and the seciety has continued to grow to this date, The
                 first minister was J. B. Carnes; present, Rev.
              Phillips. There has been, in connection with this society, an organized Sunday school
              for several years. John S. Sample is the present superintendent, and B. A. Brown,
              secretary.
          
          
            GILLUM CHAPEL (M. E.),
            at McCordsville, dates its history back to the year 1849, when a class was formed at
              the Robb school-house. Among the first members, were J. W. Hervey the Thompsons,
              Thomases, McCords, Littletons, Crumps et al.; and among those who
              stood on the walls of Zion were Revs. Mershon, J. W. Smith, Samuel Lamb, Thomas
              Stabler, White, Maxwell and C. P. Wright. The house now occupied was built in 1854, at
              a cost of $1,300, and dedicated by N. H. Gillum, from whom it derived its name. The
              present minister is Rev. G. N. Phillips. Total membership, forty. Adjoining the church
              on the west is a cemetery, where slumber several of the faithful. The first interment
              was Oliver Robb, Sen., May 22, 1854. The Sunday school in connection with this church
              is officered by Oscar Bills, superintendent, and William E. Thompson, secretary.
          
          
            CHURCH OF CHRIST, FORTVILLE.
            A few of the members from the organizations on Lick Creek, near Alfont, and at the
              Carolina school-house, in Hamilton county, who were living in or near Fortville,
              expressed a desire to effect a church organization in the town of Fortville. J. W.
              Ferrell, a student of Kentucky University, was called to hold a meeting, which began
              on Friday night, August 3, 1871. On Saturday, the 4th, Elder N. A. Walker, of
              Indianapolis, came, and on Monday following, August 6, 1871, in a temple of God's own
              building, in the woods of Levi Thomas, while the winds were rustling the leaves above
              them, and the Holy Spirit stirred their hearts within them, a little band of
              twenty-three pledged themselves to God, the father, and Christ,  the mediator, and the "Book," as their only guide. The persons composing
              this first organization are as follows: Mary A. Ellingwood, Elizabeth Ellingwood,
              Margaret Rash, Winnie Clark, Martha A. Scott, Susan Ferrell, Mary Hiday, Jane
              Bicknell, Simmie Harter, Martha Troy, Mary Edmonds, Mary A. Cavender, Jennie Ferrell,
              Jennie Scott, Mary A. Fort, L. W. Crouch, Geo. Scott, E. Ferrell, G. W. Ferrell, S. P.
              Setters, Jno. K. Rash, Andrew Ferrell and Benjamin Cavender. Andrew Ferrell was chosen
              elder, and George Scott and Benjamin Cavender deacons. The meeting continued thirteen
              days, leaving the church forty-six in membership. They decided to build a house at
              once, and by the aid of sister churches, the M. E. Church in Fortville, many kind
              friends, and great sacrifices on the part of the members, a neat house, costing
              $1,400, was built, and on the 3rd Sunday in June, 1872, was dedicated to the worship
              of God by Elder N. A. Walker, of Indianapolis. The house was built by L. W. Crouch,
              and he, with Jno. K. Rash and George Scott, were elected trustees. They called Elder
              J. W. Ferrell, formerly of Kentucky, as their first pastor, who for seven years gave
              more or less of his time among them. The church at one time numbered nearly two
              hundred members, but death removals and other causes have reduced the number to less
              than fifty. Elder L. L. Dale and Elder Addison have served the church for indefinite
              periods, and Elders Walker, Canfield, Cutts and Blount have labored some for them. The
              church has a Sunday school, but it has been greatly reduced. The death roll has been
              large, but we hope they answer to the roll call of the redeemed. The church at present
              has no pastor.
          
          
            MT. CARMEL REGULAR BAPTIST CHURCH
            was organized in December, 1837, at the house of James Denney, with thirteen
              constituent members. To aid in the organization were present members from the sister
              churches in Brandywine and Fall Creek. The first pastors of this  society were Elders Thomas Jenkins and Morgan McQuery, followed by J. F.
              Johnson and Thomas Martin. The present pastor is David Caudell, one of the oldest
              living members, having joined the church in May, 1838. The first meetings of this body
              were held at private houses, then in a log church a little north of Fortville. In
              1863, the society built a new frame at what is known as Cushman's X roads, south-east
              of Fortville, at a cost of $700. Total membership at this date, thirty-eight.
          
          
            JOSEPH WYNN,
            a native of Fayette county, Pennsylvania, came to Hancock counnty at the very early
              date of 1822, being then a boy thirteen years of age, and is now consequently one of
              the oldest residents of the county. Mr. Wynn says at the time of his moving to the
              county the red men were thick, both the Miamies and Pottawattamies. The next year
              after Mr. Wynn's settlement, the court at Pendleton was organized for Madison county,
              including also what is now Hancock county, throughout which it had jurisdiction. The
              first fine was assessed by Judge Winsal against Dr. Hiday, he having committed an
              assault upon one John Rogers, in the court room at Pendleton, and upon being
              arraigned, plead guilty and was fined six and one-fourth cents. Mr. Wynn was present
              at the execution of the white men for the massacre of the seven Pottawattamies, on
              Lick Creek, March 4, 1824. The whites were greatly alarmed over the outrage, and Henry
              Hiday was sent to Franklin county to get the rifle corps to protect the frontier. Mr.
              Wynn says he helped to cut the first wood used at Indianapolis to burn charcoal, for
              which he received twenty-five cents per day. That after people began raising wheat, it
              was a rule to cut three forty-rod throughs before breakfast. The wheat was threshed
              with a flail, and cleaned with a sheet. After the wheat was ground, it was run through
              a hand sieve. A little later a bolting apparatus was used, something similar to a
              grindstone. Mr.  Wynn helped to roll the logs for the
              clearing where Fortville now stands. The early settlers would plant corn in the middle
              of June, and in the fall kiln-dry it for bread. The first wheat marketed was hauled to
              Brookville, Franklin county, and sold for forty cents per bushel. It took from five to
              six days to make the round trip. Mr. Wynn is a consistent member of the Christian
              Church, an industrious, well-to-do farmer, and a good citizen.
          
          
            OUR FOREFATHERS.
            
              
                Our fathers settled in this land,
                Not for wealth alone nor power;
                They came to till the fruitful soil,
                Industriously to improve each shining hour.
                Oppression deep spread through the land,
                And all their rights asunder tore,
                Hence these brave men with courage came
                To find a holier, happier home.
              
              
                But where are they we speak of now?
                Some in bright spheres immortal dwell;
                They're gone, but lo! in tender tones
                What wonders do their memory tell.
                Farewell to those whose lives were given
                To toil and labor for our good;
                Peace to their ashes; slumber on
                Beneath the pine and maple-wood.

          CHAPTER XXI.HANCOCK COUNTY IN GENERAL.
          
            INTRODUCTORY—"OUR COUNTRY."
            With what emotions of pride and affection, and often of sorrow, does every true
              American speak of "our country." Sometimes upon hearing flowery 4th of July orations,
              we are tempted to believe it all brag and conceit; but when we hear them mourning over
              its evils, we are forced to believe that their feelings arise from a different source.
              Whether it be conceit or not, it is a feeling common to mankind. The Irishman sings of
              "my aine countrie;" the German sings of "mein Deutche faterland;" the American speaks
              of "our great and glorious United States." Two thousand years ago that great old
              Grecian philosopher, Socrates, said that his country was next to his God; that it was
              his duty to work for it, and whatsoever it commanded was to be done, and when it
              demanded his life, he gave it cheerfully.
            What nation is there on all this God's footstool that does not contain some noble
              souls, who would gladly give their lives for their country? Do not imply that I
              include all soldiers in this class; a few soldiers fight and die with no other motive
              but love of country, but the motive of the majority is to gratify their own ambition
              or that of their leader.
            What then is this love of country? It is not a love for the fields, hills, mountains,
              rivers, or any other natural scenery, although they are very dear to us. It is a love
                 for and an interest in our relations, our neigbors,
              and all those of our nationality. In its broadest sense it extends to all humanity,
              the world over. To prove that natural scenery is not the object of love of country,
              take a person living in a very beautiful land, with a good government and kind
              neighbors and friends, and, if he has the right kind of a heart within him, he will
              feel that his country lies very near his heart; but let the government and his
              neighbors and friends be changed, and he will want to move away. If then a love of
              one's people and a love of humanity in general, constitutes a love of country, I trust
              that there are many of my readers who have that love, and who are willing and anxious
              to do all in their power to perform the work and advance the interests of our country.
              Hence it is our duty to-day, if we never have done so, to ascertain the part which God
              designs for us to act in the great drama of life, and act it.
            Philosophers, from Plato to our own school, both heathen and Christian, tell us that
              the history of the world forms a great drama, the subject of which is Truth, and this
              Truth is identical with God himself, so the history of the world is a development of
              man's knowledge of God.
            We may divide this drama into five acts. The first scene of the first act, from Adam
              to the flood, showed that all those who forget God shall be destroyed. The second
              scene extended from the flood to Abraham. Those great old pyramids and other remains
              show how great the Egyptians were until they turned to idolatry, when their glory
              departed. The third, from Abraham to Christ, taught the people that God is a great
              spirit, whose voice is thunder, whose messengers are flaming fire, who maketh the
              clouds his chariot, and who walketh upon the wings of the wind; that he is so terrible
              that they dare not approach him, hence the need of an intercessor, which was to come
              in the person of Christ. In the second act, including the work of the arts, sciences,
              mathematics and astronomy among the Egyptian, Caldees, Persians, Arabs and Saracens,
              and that of literature and philosophy among the  Greeks,
              and Romans, the world was taught that man by knowledge can not find out God.
            In the third act Jesus Christ, the Son of God, left the glory he had with the Father,
              took upon himself the nature of man, and did many mighty works. But few of the people
              had learned the lessons which God had been trying to teach them, so his work was
              necessarily confined to a few of the lower classes. In the second scene of this act
              the apostles and disciples preached the word and organized churches, which were
              purified by persecution.
            The fourth act, whose site was Western Europe, showed the sin of keeping science and
              religion out of the hands of the people; the need of earnest, thoughtful men, and of
              guarding against corruption, that "without charity we are as sounding brass and a
              tinkling cymbal."
            But few of the nations profited by these lessons, and it does not seem to be God's
              way to reform nations, who, after having known Him, refuse to have Him rule over them,
              so He pronounced the sentence, "Ye are weighed in the balance and found wanting."
            For sixteen centuries Christianity had been tried, and had proven itself to be no
              "cunningly devised fable," but something to satisfy the needs of man. And God in His
              wisdom seemed to say it is enough; it is time that this religion have a chance to grow
              and spread among all nations. So He chose America, whose discovery He had brought
              about shortly before, as the scene of the fifth act. Hither fled the Puritans,
              Huguenots, Methodists, Quakers, the persecuted Christians from all Europe. All the
              early settlements which were successful were made under the direction of Christian
              powers. Those who sought wealth were soon destroyed or became disheartened and
              returned home. We were planted with Christ in this new, vast and good land that we
              might rise with Him in newness of national life. Taking the philosophy of history,
              then, it would appear that God's design for us is to give Christianity a chance to
              grow and spread. That religion whose fruits are love, joy, peace, long suffering,
              gentleness,  goodness, faith, meekness and temperance
              should grow. We have every opportunity and inducement to bring forth these fruits. Are
              we, as a nation, doing so? Let us examine: First, have we brought forth the fruits of
              love? Did we love the red man as we should when we took away his lands, drove him West
              and then killed him? Did we love the African as we should, when we stole him, beat him
              and worked him to death? Do we love the Chinese as we should, when we are so
              shamefully maltreating them? Is there a spirit of love between the North and the
              South? Are we as joyful and happy a people as we might be? Certainly we fail in the
              fruits of peace. An evil spirit arises at our political campaigns, and war is
              threatened. We have fought among ourselves, we have fought with our "mother country"
              and our neighbors. We have not been gentle and long suffering, but have always been
              ready and quick to resent wrong. Oh, how far have we failed in goodness! We have used
              deception and bribery. Some of our city life, the tramps, the Tammany Ring, Boss
              Tweed, and such characters show our bad side. As a nation we are too faithless, many
              professing to have no faith in anything; and the faith of many who do profess to
              believe in a Supreme Being is very weak, and they do not give it much exercise. Last
              of all the fruits which Paul enumerates, but not least, is that which made Felix
              tremble and say: "Go thy way for this time; at a more convenient season I will call
              for thee." It is that which our nation is deficieint in, the greatest curse of our
              land. I I trust there are no souls saying to the cause, "go thy way for this time."
              Unless we awaken on this point, we will sleep the sleep of death, and be like Babylon,
              when Belshazzar and his nobles were drunk and Cyrus took the city.
            Oh, ye who love our country! how beat your hearts when you think of our drunken
              senate, when you think of all the money, time, talent and priceless souls that go to
              feed the demon, intemperance, and the wrecked homes, the broken-hearted wives, and the
              disgraced children that 
              
                HENRY WRIGHT.
              
               are left after he has dined. If we would not arouse and
              work against this evil, it would seem that the very stones themselves would cry out.
              The beasts of the field seem to laugh at the drunkard, because he is more beastly than
              they. The birds in their songs mock him. The trees lift up their heads to heaven, waft
              their arms in the breezes and praise their maker. They seem to cry out, shame upon
              man, endowed with an immortal soul, to be groveling along in the ditch, and never
              think of praising his creator. His fellow men turn their faces and pass by. The Devil
              laughs at him, prematurely cuts him off and takes him to himself. Will we not hear
              these voices and awaken? Oh, women of our country! it is time that you were working,
              praying and doing everything in your power to drive out the demon.
            Oh, ye men who feel your hearts burning with a love of country, why will you not drop
              some of your petty political quarrels, and take sides upon some of the more important
              questions of the day? Why should you always be running the Republican and Democratic
              parties? The negroes are free now, and have a right to vote; why not leave them now,
              take up new questions and form new parties? May we one and all, as we love our country
              and prize immortal souls, do all in our power to cleanse it from iniquity, and to
              establish it in virtue, that God may not pronounce against us that sentence: "Ye are
              weighed in the balance and found wanting."
          
          
            MORRIS PIERSON,
            one of the earliest settlers of Greenfield, was born April 26, 1799, in Chittenden
              county, Vermont, from whence he removed to Switzerland county, Indiana, in 1814;
              thence to Greenfield, Indiana, September 21, 1830. Mr. P. visited Hancock county in
              the fall of 1826, while she yet belonged to Madison county. Mr. P. was twice married.
              First, to Eliza Moore, May 27, 1827, who died February 6, 1844; second, to Lucena
              Silcox, who is still living, on February  15, 1846. Mr.
              P. has filled several positions of trust and profit. By reference to page thirty-nine
              and succeeding pages of this book, it will be observed that he was county treasurer
              for a number of years in the early history of the county. He was also county school
              commissioner and county surveyor for a considerable time. Mr. P. was a Mason, a
              Republican, and a liberal, enterprising, practical citizen, and did much for the
              encouragement of pikes, railroads, and other internal improvements. While employed in
              his daily duties, he died suddenly on the morning of May 22, 1879. Age, four score
              years and twenty-six days.
          
          
            R. A. SMITH,
            a native of Brandywine township, this county, dates his earthly career from January
              10, 1853. His parents were plain, practical, pious pioneers, who earned their bread by
              the sweat of their brow, and taught their children that labor is honorable, and to
              till the soil is respectable. Mr. Smith's boyhood days were spent on the farm, where
              he hoed and harrowed in the summer, attended the district schools, fed the calves and
              hunted rabbits in the winter. After arriving at majority, he taught school for a time,
              but feeling dissatisfied with his acquirements, he resolved to make an effort for a
              better education. In the fall of 1872 he entered the New Garden high school in Wayne
              county, Indiana, and for one year was under the tutorage of the writer, who was then
              principal, after which he entered the State Normal at Terre Haute, Indiana, where he
              continued for two years; after which he resumed teaching, at which profession he has
              given about nine years of his life in the district and graded schools of the county.
              He was one year at McCordsville, and two years principal of the Fortville graded
              schools. September 2, 1879, Mr. Smith was married to Miss Mary E., daughter of H. B.
              Cole, of Shelby county. This short but pleasant and promising union was terminated by
              the death of Mrs. S., March 2,  1880. About two years
              since, Mr. Smith resolved to exchange the rod for the scalpel, and after reading for a
              time with the firm of Howard, Martin & Howard, of this city, he attended lectures
              at Indianapolis, and was fast unraveling the abstruse, recondite intricacies of
              medicolegal studies, when he was called to public duties, being elected County
              Superintendent of Schools, of Hancock county, July 30, 1881, to fill the unexpired
              term of the late Aaron Pope. Mr. S., in politics; is a Democrat; in church relations,
              a Protestant Methodist, and in private and public life is above reproach.
          
          
            WILLIAM PERRY SMITH,
            was born in Brandywine township, in this county, March 2, 1842. His father was a
              farmer, and his early life was passed, like that of most farmer's boys, in assisting
              about the farm. He, however, early manifested a disposition toward educational and
              literary pursuits, in which he was indulged and encouraged by his parents, who lived
              to reap the reward of their kindness in the success and honor of their son.
            Perry, as he was familiarly called by those who knew and loved him best, received his
              first school training at district school-house No. 3, situated but a few steps from
              his father's home. Here he mastered the rudiments of an English education, and then
              attended high school at Acton, Ind., one year. After this he began teaching, in which
              profession he was very successful, winning the love of his pupils and the respect of
              their parents by his noble qualities of mind and heart. During this time he also
              learned the art of photography, in the practice of which he employed his time during
              the summer months, when not in school. Determining to fit himself still more
              thoroughly for his work of teaching he entered the State Normal School at Terre Haute
              in 1873. Here he attended two terms, doing four terms' work within the time of two. So
              thorough had been his previous training that he made the best per cent. on entering of
              any student of his class.
            
            After leaving the Normal School he taught one year, at the end of which time received
              the appointment of County Superintendent of Hancock county, which position he held for
              two terms, or until the time of his death. To this field of labor he brought the same
              scholastic skill, accurate judgment and indomitable energy which had characterized his
              previous career, and the schools under his management were efficient and prosperous.
              Much of the work begun by him has since been carried forward to success, and it will
              be long ere his influence will cease to be felt in the schools of Hancock county. He
              was married July 10, 1878, to Miss Agnes E. McDonald, an estimable young 
                PROF. W. P. SMITH.
               lady, also a teacher. He was taken sick of typhoid fever about February I,
              1879, and, after a lingering and painful illness, died March 25th of the same year. He
              was a member of the Methodist Protestant Church; also an honored member of the Masonic
              Fraternity, Knights of Pythias and the Brotherhood of United Workingmen. He was buried
              with Masonic honors at Mt. Lebanon Cemetery, near his old home, where loving hands
              have erected a monument to his memory. He was but in the morning of  his manhood, but upon the threshold of many promising
              possibilities, when death closed his eyes to all earthly things and blinded those of
              his friends with tears. Had he lived—but it is useless to speculate upon what
              might have been since now it can never be. In the hearts of those who knew him best is
              written this epitaph:
            He was a Christian who never disguised his profession; a man whose acts honored his
              race.
          
          
            JAMES C. HAWK,
            a Buckeye by birth, a Hoosier by residence and adoption, a son of Henry and Susan
              Hawk, of Highland county, Ohio, dates his earthly journeyings to September 28, 1824,
              from Brown county, Ohio. At the age of eight he came to Indiana with his parents and
              settled in Sugar-Creek township, where he has since resided. His facilities for
              education being very poor, he was compelled to rely upon his own resources for the
              little education he did receive. Mr. Hawk was married September 23, 1847, to Mary J.,
              daughter of David McNamee. After his marriage Mr. H. settled on his farm, where he
              tilled the soil in summer and taught the youth of his neighborhood in the winter for
              about four years, since which time he has devoted his energies wholly to rural
              pursuits, never having held but one public office, that of township trustee, in
              conjuction with Lewis Burk and Joseph H. Conner, in 1856. Mr. H. is an honorable
              citizen and an affable gentleman. See his portrait on another page.
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XXII.
          
            MEDICAL PROFESSION IN HANCOCK COUNTY.
            The physician is an indispensable prerequisite to civilized communities, while among
              the uncivilized tribes of men the medicine man is one of the most prominent of
              characters. When the writer first became identified with the citizenship of this
              county there were but few physicians therein. I will mention names in the proper place
              and and time.
            So far as the writer knows there is but one of the men now living who practiced
              medicine in Hancock county forty years ago, and he has retired from the profession. As
              a rule doctors are short lived. The practice of medicine then was a work of some
              magnitude. We were compelled to ride on horseback through the woods, along paths
              blazed out on the side of trees, sometimes twelve miles. I have often lost my way, and
              had to ride for miles before I came to a house to ask where I was. I was called one
              stormy night to visit a family in what was called the Big Deadening, in Vernon
              township. The messenger had a huge torch and rode before. Our path was for miles
              through "slashes," as then called. The forest was wild and gloomy. Before we reached
              the place the torch gave out, and we had to hunt a hickory tree, from which we got
              bark to renew our light. We heard the wolves howl occasionally. When we reached the
              house we found the door fastened, and the woman whom I was called to see was in bed
              with two newly-born babe twins. She was badly frightened. She said the wolves had run
              the dogs against the door. The door was nothing but shaved clap-boards, hung on wooden
              hinges. She thought the wolves smelt the corpse, for one of the babes was dead, and
              she  had heard it said that wolves would fight
              desperately for a dead body. There were no neighbors for some distance, and no one
              there to go for any one.
            Sometime after that I was belated on my return home from the Fall Creek settlement.
              It had been raining all day, and was very muddy. My horse gave out, and I had to stop
              at John Robb's, where I got my supper, and he saddled one of his horses for me to ride
              till I returned. It was dark when I started, and nothing but a path to travel until I
              struck what was called the Greenfield and Allisonville road. Mr. Robb assured me that
              old Sam, as he called the horse, would keep the path. I had gone but a few miles
              before old Sam was out of the path, and stopped to eat grass. I got down and tried to
              feel for the path. Failing to find it, I mounted, and determined to make the horse go
              some place. He soon went under a grapevine, and lifted me out of the saddle and set me
              wrong end up in the spice brush. I was, however, able for another trial. I then
              commenced to halloo, that I might find some house. I soon heard wolves, not very far
              from me I thought. I had often heard it said that wolves could smell assafetida any
              distance, and that they would fight for it. I had to carry that article with me, for
              it was out of the question to dispense with a remedy so popular at that time.
              Everything used as medicine was furnished by the doctors. I was considerably
              frightened, but I soon heard some one answer me and saw a torch coming. It was common
              for persons to get lost in the woods at that time. When I reached the man's house I
              found I had lost my pill sacks, and this necessitated me to wait till morning, as most
              of my essential outfit was in them. Though of but small value would the pill-bags be
              at this time, the loss of that utility would have been sufficiently ample at that time
              to have compelled me to suspend operations for some days.
            The Two Big Doctors.—I do not remember how long it has been
              since the occurrence here alluded to transpired. I think it was about thirty-five
              years ago. At a camp meeting near Cumberland, in the 
              eastern part of Marion county, a child was taken with a fit, and its mother made so
              much noise that divine services were suspended for a time. Dr. Berry, who afterwards
              became President of Asbury University, was preaching. As soon as he found out what was
              the matter, he told the congregation to take their seats and not crowd the child, but
              give it plenty of fresh air, wet its head with cold water, and send for a doctor; that
              there was no danger. I was at that time but little acquainted, and but few on the
              ground suspected me of any pretensions to being a doctor. Some one, however, hunted me
              up, and plucking me to one side, asked me if I could bleed, and whether or not I had
              any lancets with me. I happened to have a nice spring lancet in my pocket. I told him
              I thought I could bleed, and he asked me to follow him. When I arrived at the tent it
              was crowded desperately, and near the door, on a temporary bed, was the patient. On
              one side of it stood a large man, with a huge walking stick, about four feet long and
              as thick as a small handspike. Before him was a pair of old-fashioned saddle-bags,
              which contained something near a half bushel of roots and herbs, together with other
              implements essential to the practice. On the other side of the little sufferer stood
              another man, something over six feet high, with a blue jeans suit on. Neither of the
              gentlemen were arrayed in very fastidious costumes. Over the shoulder of this
              gentleman hung a pair of pill wallets of something more in accordance with the custom
              of the nineteenth century, and would not hold over one peck of goods. He had the arm
              of the little girl bandaged, and was prodding away with an old rusty and dull thumb
              lancet, attempting to bleed the child, but had about given up the idea when I was sent
              for. The man who hunted me up, stepped forward and fixing his eyes on me, said: "There
              is Dr. Hervey; maybe he can bleed." At this all eyes were turned toward me, and I
              could distinctly hear the whispers through the crowd, "he is nothing but a boy;" "he
              don't look much like a doctor," and other similar remarks, most of which were true,
              for I was but a  young man, and looked younger than I
              was. The theory of the doctors was that the patient had too much blood in the head,
              and that bleeding was the only remedy. The big doctors had not much faith in me, but
              asked me if I could bleed the child. They did not ask for my opinion of the case, or
              what treatment I would recommend, or intimate that they had any more use for me. I,
              however, bled the child, and asked the doctors if it would not be well to keep cold
              cloths to the head, which they had ordered removed for fear of producing a chill. The
              child got better, and I got better acquainted with the big doctors, and found them to
              be big-hearted as well as large in body. One of them was Dr. Carpenter, of Cumberland,
              a good Christian gentleman, but whose facilities for education were poor. He was a
              very useful man, and when his patients died, he often preached their funerals. He was
              a Baptist minister, and Dr. William Moore, of the same village, and a partner, was a
              Universalian preacher. Bleeding was common then in most diseases, and many persons
              were bled regularly at stated times. I knew several men who kept lancets. A man that
              could bleed was considered necessary in every settlement. The houses of these men were
              thronged every Sunday by persons, some of whom would come miles to be bled. The other
              big doctor was called McLain, I think, and he lived in or near New Palestine.
            On page seventy-four of the proceedings of the Indiana Medical Society for 1874, in a
              report on the medical history of the State, by Thad. M. Stevens, M. D., I find the
              following items, connected with the transactions of medical men in the western part of
              Hancock county, which I will quote:
            "In 1846, the congestive fever, as it was called, made its appearance. Many died;
              indeed, most of them in the hands of some physicians. Dr. Moore, of Cumberland,
              contended that blood letting, and after that calomel to ptyalism was the proper
              treatment. A meeting of physicians was called to consult upon a plan of treatment, at
              which it was agreed to use larger doses of quinine. Into  this practice all finally fell, and the disease became much less formidable. The
              only drawback to the use of this drug was the price, and the scarcity of money. It run
              up at one time to six dollars an ounce. Dr. Hervey bought up a dozen fat cattle, drove
              them to Indianapblis, and sold them, at $7.50 per head, and invested the money in
              quinine."
            In 1847 a singular epidemic of small-pox appeared in Buck-Creek township. Erysipelas,
              in the form of black tung, had been prevailing in the same locality. A healthy, stout
              man by the name of Snyder took the confluent variola. The whole surface swelled
              enormously. Dr. William Smith, who was a new brother in the profession at Cumberland,
              was called to see the case, who, being somewhat puzzled at the disease, called Dr.
              Bobbs, of Cumberland, and Dr. J. W. Hervey, of Hancock county, in consultation. Drs.
              Bobbs and Smith contended that the disease was of an active inflammatory character,
              and the only safety depended upon copious blood-letting. Dr. Hervey differed with
              them, opposed the bleeding, and left them to treat the case. They bled the man
              profusely, and he died. The neighbors flocked in to see him, and the result was
              small-pox was scattered all over the country. Dr. J. W. Hervey contended that the
              disease was some form of eruptive fever, modified by erysipelas diathesis. That was
              before the disease had developed its true character. After that he contended that it
              was small-pox, modified by the influence named. A consultation was called at the house
              of Isaac Snyder, father of the first patient, over some new cases. Dr. John S. Bobbs,
              Dr. Bullard, of Indianapolis, and Dr. Brown, of Bethel, were called in. Drs. Bobbs and
              Bullard agreed with Dr. Hervey. I think Dr. Brown did the same. The fact of the
              disease making its appearance without any one knowing how, agitated the public mind to
              the highest pitch. As Dr. Hervey had been prominent in the treatment of the disease,
              and very successful, he having treated eighty-four cases, with but the loss of three
              grown persons and two children, it was in some way whispered through the neighborhood
              that he started the disease to  get into business and
              gain notoriety. This theory was aimed to be made plausible by the fact that the Doctor
              had been in Cincinnati the winter before, and had told some one that he saw cases of
              small-pox in the hospital. It was also urged that he could not have been so well
              acquainted with the disease and have treated it so successfully if he had not made
              some special study and preparation. The rumor spread and gained force as it went out
              upon the breeze of popular rumor, until the whole country was arrayed on one or the
              other side of the question. Some one, who was ingenious in formulating theories, said
              the Doctor had brought a scab with him from Cincinnati, and started the disease with
              it. He had used tincture of iodine and nitrate of silver to prevent pitting in the
              face. One Miss Burris lost an eye, and was otherwise disfigured by the disease,
              pustules having formed in the eyes. Popular prejudice pointed this case out as a
              proper one to punish the Doctor with. He was sued for mal-practice. The bad feeling
              was so intense against him that his counsel, Oliver H. Smith, advised him to take a
              change of venue to Shelby county. The damages were set at $5,000. The depositions of
              eminent physicians were secured by the Doctor. Some of the best physicians in the
              State were subpoenaed. His defense was so fortified that before the time for the trial
              arrived the case was withdrawn. Dr. Hervey's character was vindicated, and he rose
              above the clouds that threatened him with ruin; but it cost him much of his
              hard-earned means and cheated him out of three or four of the best years of his
              life.
            This case is a valuable illustration of what injury and wrong may be done a physician
              by those who are not sufficiently informed on such subjects. It also shows what a few
              enemies may do before the tribunal of uninformed popular public sentiment and popular
              prejudice.
            A Singular Call.—At a 4th of July celebration held in the
              woods, where Mt. Comfort now stands, I was engaged to make an oration. There was to be
              a big time—a barbecue. The day brought an immense crowd. Just before  the time ,came for my part of the programme, I noticed
              some one coming with great speed, and a general stir among the people. I was informed
              that an accident had happened at the crossing of Buck Creek, and that I was wanted.
              The proceedings were delayed until my return. When I reached the scene of the
              accident, a most amusing incident was before me, and instead of resorting to surgery
              and bandages, I was overcome with fun. A family with several small children had
              undertaken to visit the celebration in an ox-wagon, not very substantially rigged. In
              attempting to cross the bridge over Buck Creek, the oxen became frightened at a party
              of young men and women coming up behind at a pretty fair speed. The red ribbons were
              flying, and the big-skirted white dresses of the girls on horseback were flapping in
              the wind, together with the clatter of the horses' feet, was too much for the cattle
              to stand. They took fright, left the pole bridge, and landed the wagon, with its
              contents, upside down in the mud and mire. The oxen had just reached the shore, and
              the family had all been safely dug out of the mud, and were seated in a line on the
              edge of the bridge, covered so completely with mud that you could only see the eyes
              and the mouth. The man with coon-skin cap was making arrangements to wash them off in
              the creek, into which he had waded and was, when I arrived, waiting for the first one
              to be handed to him to take through the operation. Every child was bawling at the top
              of its ability to make a noise. As none were hurt, no one who witnessed the incident
              could restrain a hearty laugh. They were assisted, however, and washed off, and
              reached the ground towards the close of the evening, and in time to get a full meal of
              meat and corn-pone, which were about all the eatables spread on the occasion.
            Dr. Duncan.—The first time I ever visited the office of Dr.
              Duncan he was so full of talk and big laugh that he spit all over me, not
              intentionally, for no better hearted man lived than he; but he had such a peculiar way
              of pouring out his fun that he could not keep his mouth and lips from taking a very
              prominent part in the performance.  Dr. Barnett, who is
              now yielding somewhat to the pressure of age, was then a student in his office, and a
              very industrious one at that. His long success in business is due, no doubt, to his
              earnest and intense studentship. Dr. Duncan was a good practitioner and had an
              extensive business. Had he received the advantages of modern usages he would have been
              a still more prominent member of the profession.
            Dr. Moore.—I do not remember the given name of the doctor
              here referred to. I was called to see him in his last sickness at his home in Green
              township. He was quite a large man, of very limited attainments, but was a useful man
              in the community. He died of softening of the brain and paralysis. A singular feature
              in his disease was that he could not reach any object with his hand. If he would
              undertake to place his hand upon an object he would invariably reach to another
              locality. He was much worried over his condition. He lamented his affliction very
              much. He appealed to me so piteously to devise some means for his relief that I shed
              tears in his presence. I think some of his family are living in the county, who might
              be able to give more of his history.
            Dr. N. P. Howard—Is now among the, oldest practitioners in
              the county. I do not remember how long it has been since he came to Greenfield, but he
              has always ranked among the best medical men of the country, and is perhaps the best
              operating surgeon in the county, and he has but few superiors in the State. Besides
              being a surgeon of ability, he is a whole-souled gentleman, who never violated any law
              of professional etiquette or honor.
            Dr. Lot Edwards—Is the first physician I ever knew in the
              county, and he had practiced in it several years before I came. He was one of the most
              wiry men I ever knew. His appearance would indicate that he could stand but little
              effort, yet he has done enough hard work in the practice of medicine to kill two or
              three ordinary men. He was identified with the first society of the county, and had as
              many warm friends as any man therein.
            
            
              DR. N. P. HOWARD.
            
            
            Dr. E. I. Judkins—Read medicine in Greenfield, and was raised
              in the county. He has grown old amidst the scenes of his early life, and has given the
              best of his energies to the practice of his profession. He is a sucessful, high-minded
              votary of the healing art, well posted, and has a large share of friends and
              patrons.
            Dr. A. G. Selman—Practiced medicine in Greenfield many years
              ago, and took a prominent part in politics. He had at one time as large a practice as
              any man in the county. He is the father of the rising young doctor of that name now in
              Greenfield.
            Dr. Cook—Practiced in Charlottesville thirty-five years ago,
              and was a very fine and successful practitioner. Dr. Stuart, of Fortville, was one of
              his students. Dr. Stuart and Dr. Troy must be nearly the same age, and must have
              commenced practice about the same time. I am told that Dr. Troy has always had quite a
              large business, and that Dr. Stuart, at Fortville, has an extensive practice.
            Dr. Yancey—Who is now a member of the State Senate, came to
              this county, as near as I can recollect, about sixteen years ago. He is a man of
              considerable ability, and stands high in his profession and in society as an honorable
              man.
            Dr. Hiram Duncan—Came to Hancock county over thirty years
              ago. He commenced practice near Willett's Mill, but moved to a settlement north of
              Fortville, on Fall creek, in the edge of Hamilton county, before Fortville was laid
              out. When it was made a town he moved there, and practiced there alone for ten or
              twelve years. He is a well-posted, though unassuming, man, and is one of the most
              careful practitioners I ever knew. He is now in Indianapolis.
            Dr. T. P. Hervey, of McCordsville—Is a brother of the writer.
              He is the only student I ever had. I am not ashamed of him, and I trust he is not
              ashamed of, his preceptor. Had he not been my brother he would not have been my
              student. I felt that I could, for my brother's sake go to the trouble necessary to
              train his mind to appreciate  the responsibilities
              incumbent upon a physician and the necessity of a thorough qualification to perform
              his duties. He is one of the most conscientious men at the bedside of the sick I ever
              met. No man has more or warmer friends than has he.
            Dr. Paul Espy—Is another of the old physicians of the county.
              I think he commenced business at or near Philadelphia, but soon went to his present
              locality, where he has been ever since. He could speak German fluently, and no better
              location could he found in the State for a man of his ability and social habits than
              New Palestine. The Doctor has made good use of his facilities, energies and
              surroundings, 
                DR. S. M. MARTIN.
               and is to-day one of the wealthiest men in the county. His tireless energy
              and his unceasing devotion to business, together with his good judgment and good
              management, has placed him beyond want and in possession of innumerable friends. But
              few doctors succeed as well, pecuniarily, as Dr. Paul Espy.
            The Young Physicians.—A very promising inventory of young
              doctors are springing up to take the place of the old ones. Dr. Martin and Dr. Howard,
              Jr., of Greenfield, and perhaps others of whom I have no knowledge, and Dr.  John Covey and Dr. Frank Hervey, of McCordsville, and
              others in other villages unknown to me, will soon be called to take the places of
              worthy predecessors. Dr. Martin is one of the best posted young men in the State, and
              is a most successful surgeon.
            One thing can be said to the praise of the physicians of Hancock county. They were
              mostly self-made men, and men of unusually good sense. But few men have been imported
              into Hancock county as physicians since the old stock took their place. But few
              counties in the State can boast of better doctors than Hancock county. I do not know
              one to whom I could not give the hand of fellowship. I do not know one who is my
              personal enemy, or one who has ever knowingly done me an unkind act.
            In writing this brief review of the profession in the county, if I have forgotten any
              one or said anything about any one that may be exceptionable, I ask pardon.
            The entire diathesis of the diseases of the country has changed since forty years
              ago. The plan of treatment has changed with the change in the type and character of
              disease. The forests have fallen; the sunshine has been let in upon the earth, for
              centuries covered with a thick undergrowth and magnificent forest trees; the ground,
              then covered in many places with water, has been ditched; the land, so long idle, has
              been cultivated; obstructions from streams have been removed; old rotting logs and
              decaying matter have been cleared away. It is therefore not strange that malaria
              should be less, and that the whole character of morbific causatives should undergo a
              change.
            Forty years ago blood-letting, blistering, calomel and jalep, together with a
              prolific profusion of emetics, nausients and antiphlogistics, were the sheet anchor.
              Now the aim of the physician is to save and vitalize the blood, energise and build up
              the wasting strength, and save all the power of the system, to battle disease and
              perform life's essential functions. J. W. HERVEY.
          
          
          
            HANCOCK MEDICAL SOCIETY
            was organized in Greenfield, January 6, 1874, and regularly incorporated under the
              rules and regulations of the State Medical Society, and is therefore entitled to
              representation in said organization, and in the American Medical Association, to each
              of which it sends its delegates. The following reputable physicians were the
              organizers, and constituted the charter members of said society, viz.: N. P. Howard,
              Sen.; E. I. Judkins, M. M. Adams, S. M. Martin, Hiram Duncan, J. G. Stuart, S. A.
              Troy, S. T. Yancey, J. K. Sanders, H. J. Bogart, G. T. Wrennick, J. B. Sparks, M. M.
              Hess, and G. C. Ewbank. Dr. N. P. Howard, Sen., was its first President, and Dr. E. I.
              Judkins its first Secretary. In addition to the charter members, twenty-two physicians
              have been admitted to membership since its organization. Drs. J. J. Carter and J. O.
              Espy deceased while members of the society. Some have moved from the county, and
              others ceased to be members. Drs. Troy, Yancey, J. M. Ely Sparks, and Espy have each
              served as president. It now (February 18, 1882) numbers sixteen members. The present
              officers are, Dr. E. I. Judkins, President; Dr. W. B. Ryan, Secretary. The society is
              in a prosperous condition, and most of its members appear devoted to its interest, and
              the success of their profession. The Hancock Medical Society and the medical
              profession in our county, we can safely say, will compare favorably with the same in
              her sister counties.
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XXIII.
            BIOGRAPHIES AND PERSONAL SKETCHES.
          
            JOSEPH FORT,
            a native of the "Ancient Dominion," was born in 1814. He came with his parents to
              Henry county. When about fifteen years of age, he moved Prior Brown to Brown township.
              In 1840 he was married to Miss Mary, daughter of Moses McCray. In 1846 Mr. Fort united
              with the Concord Baptist Church. He afterward became a member of the Nameless Creek
              Christian Church, of which he was an honored member until his death. Mr. F. from the
              green woods made a good farm, well improved, erected good buildings, with a brick
              house, lived an honorable, industrious life, and honestly accumulated considerable
              property. Few men were more esteemed than was Mr. Fort by those who knew him best. His
              widow, a noble Christian lady, still lives on the old farm, enjoying the fruits of
              their labor. Mr. F., politically, was a Republican, never aspiring to office. He was
              content with quiet rural duties in private life. For the last six years of his life he
              was a constant sufferer, but bore his affliction with patience and resignation, till
              he was finally taken to his long home, March 22, 1880, and his mortal remains were
              deposited in the Simmons cemetery in Jackson township, where loving hands have erected
              to his memory a stately monument.
          
          
            WILLIAM J. SPARKS
            was born March 11, 1853, in Morgan county, Indiana, where he received a common school
              education, attending school for a time at Mooresville. His father being a miller,
              young Sparks run the engine in his native county for several years, prior to 1872;
              thence to Henry county, and  worked for a time in the
              Commercial Mills on Blue River, of which mills his father was the proprietor; thence
              to Greenfield, where he engaged in the sewing machine trade till 1879, when he was
              elected clerk of the city of Greenfield, which position he finally resigned to become
              a candidate for mayor, to which office he was elected by a handsome majority. This
              position he still fills. Mayor Sparks is a young man, unmarried, a Republican, a
              member of the Christian Church, and is superintendent of the Sunday School connected
              therewith. He is fully identified with the interest of the city, and is putting forth
              his best efforts to bring it up to his ideal of a model municipality.
          
          
            ANDREW T. HART,
            senior member of the mercantile firm of Hart & Thayer, of this city, a native of
              the "Ancient Dominion," was born July 7, 1811. His father, a son of Erin, was a
              soldier under General St. Clair at the time of his memorable defeat, near the
              head-waters of the Wabash, in 1791. Andrew T. Hart, while a boy, endured the
              privations of pioneer life in his native State. At the age of eleven he removed from
              the home of his earlier youth to Centerville, Wayne county, where he attended such
              public and private schools as the country then afforded, and acquired a common English
              education. His opportunities, however, were limited, and the success that has attended
              his career has been mainly the result of his own exertions, and it may be properly
              said that he is the architect of his own fortune. At the age of eighteen, he was
              apprenticed as a saddler with his brother, James B. Hart, of Liberty, Indiana, which
              trade he faithfully followed for three years, or until 1833, when he removed to
              Greenfield, where he has since resided. He at once opened a grocery store, in which
              business he continued for two years; then as a clerk for Nicholas & McCarty for
              one year, followed by a mercantile partnership with Nathan Crawford for two years,
              when he purchased Crawford's interest, and has 
              
                CHARLES DOWNING
              
               continued in the same business ever since, alone and
              otherwise. Mr. H. has filled a number of positions of public trust, and always with
              honor. In 1839 he was appointed agent of Indiana for the distribution of surplus
              revenue. He was the first treasurer elected in Hancock county, the prior treasurers
              being appointed by the commissioners. This was in 1841. In 1843 he was re-elected, and
              served for six consecutive years. In 1869 he was commissioned by Salmon P. Chase as U.
              S. assistant assessor for this county. Mr. H. has been prominently connected with
              almost all public enterprises in the county during his residence therein. In 1878 he
              was President of the Hancock Agricultural Society. He become a Mason in 1859, and an
              Odd Fellow in 1865. In religion he is of orthodox faith. In politics he was first a
              Whig, and since a Republican. His first vote was cast for Henry Clay. He has been
              twice married. First, to Miss Louisa Forelander, in June, 1835, who lived but two
              years. In November, 1838, he was married to Miss Gabriella Sebastian, daughter of
              William and Elizabeth Sebastian. Mr. Hart has had five children. William E. was a
              soldier in the 18th Indiana Volunteers, and served for three years. After his
              discharge he joined and served in Capt. A. K. Branham's company of State troops in the
              pursuit of John Morgan, in his celebrated raid in Indiana and Ohio, and was killed in
              that unfortunate disaster at Lawrenceburg, Indiana, in 1863. Mr. H. is a man much
              respected and highly esteemed by all who know him. He is of genial nature, kind and
              hospitable, steadfast in his friendship, and upright in his dealings, and by his good
              qualities of head and heart has endeared himself to every citizen of the county.
          
          
            CHARLES DOWNING,
            was born in New York City, August 7, 1857, came to Hancock county February 28, 1867,
              made his home with the late lamented William S. Wood, attended the public schools,
              received a fair English education and, being an 
              excellent scribe, was, on the 4th day of November, 1874, appointed Deputy Clerk of the
              Hancock Circuit Court, by Ephraim Marsh, Clerk, which position he holds to this day.
              October 8, 1879, at Bradford Junction, Ohio, he was married to Miss Angie B., only
              daughter of Arthur P. and Emily H. Williams, formerly of this city. Mr. D. is a member
              of the Christian Church, and has always contributed liberally to the support thereof.
              He is also an honored member of the I. O. O. F. Mr. D. is a young man of rare business
              tact and talent, and just upon the threshold of many rare possibilities.
          
          
            LEE O. HARRIS.
            Leo O. Harris was born in Chester county, Pennsylvania, January 30, 1839. While yet
              quite young, his parents removed to Washington county, in the western part of
              Pennsylvania, where his early youth was passed. Here he was given the advantages of
              first the common school and then an academic course of study.
            He came to Hancock county, Indiana, in 1858, and taught his first school in
              Fountaintown, in the edge of Shelby county.
            In the fall of 1859 he went to Illinois, and taught in what was then Coles (now
              Douglass) county. Returning to Indiana, he again began teaching in Hancock county, and
              has been more or less identified with her schools ever since, except for the five
              years succeeding 1874, during which time he was principal of the school at Lewisville,
              Indiana.
            Mr. Harris is well known throughout the State as a journalist and poet, having been
              for a number of years a contributor to most of the leading papers of the State. He is
              also the author of a book, The Man Who Tramps, published in
              1878.
            The first of January, 1880, Mr. Harris, in connection with Aaron Pope, then County
              Superintendent, began the publication of The Home and School
              Visitor, of which  paper he is still the editor. In
              the spring of 1881 he took editorial charge of The Greenfeld
                Republican, and continued with that paper until January, 1882, when, The Home and School Visitor demanding his entire attention, he
              withdrew from the Republican.
            Mr. Harris has been identified with the school interests of Hancock county for
              twenty-two years, and has in that 
                PROF. LEE O. HARRIS
               time taught more schools than any man now living in the county, yet all this
              teaching, with the exceptions before mentioned, has been done in Greenfield and within
              a radius of five miles of that city.
          
          
            DR. NOBLE P. HOWARD,
            senior member of the medical firm of this city of Howard, Martin & Howard, was
              born in Warren county, Ohio, September 11, 1822. His father was one of the first
              settlers of Cincinnati, and during the war of 1812 was a soldier in the American army.
              In 1836, while the subject of this sketch was a mere boy, he came with his mother and
              settled in Indiana, where he received an English education at Brookville, Franklin
              county. In 1840 he began the study of medicine with the eminent doctor, H. G.  Sexton, of Rushville, Indiana, where he read for three
              years. In 1843 he moved to this city, and began the practice of medicine and surgery.
              In 1877 he was Vice-President of the Indiana State Medical Society. He has served as
              President of the Union Medical Society of Hancock and Henry counties, and also as
              President of the Hancock Medical Society. He holds diplomas from the Indiana Medical
              College, and from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, both of Indianapolis, and is
              also a member of the American Medical Society. In 1862 he was commissioned as
              assistant surgeon in the 12th regiment of Indiana volunteers, and served during its
              term of enlistment. For about eight years he was deputy collector of internal revenue.
              He has ever manifested a public spirit, and has taken stock in most of the gravel
              roads centering in Greenfield. Since 1856 he has been an honored member of the Odd
              Fellows, and has filled all the offices of the subordinate lodge and encampment. In
              1861 he was elected Most Worthy Grand Patriarch of the Grand Encampment of the State
              of Indiana. He is a member of the M. E. Church, was a Whig in the days of that party,
              and an earnest Union man during the civil war. In 1856 he was a candidate on the
              Republican ticket for representative, but the county being Democratic, he was defeated
              by the Hon. Thomas D. Walpole. He was a Republican until the nomination of Horace
              Greeley, since which time he has acted with the Democratic party. He was married April
              23, 1844, to Miss Cinderilla J. Gooding, daughter of Asa and Matilda Gooding, and a
              sister of Judge D. S., Gen. O. P. and Hon. H. C. Gooding. Dr. Howard is a genial
              gentleman, and a man of firm convictions and uncompromising integrity, and stands well
              both in his profession an as a man.
          
          
            EPHRAIM MARSH,
            present Clerk of the Hancock Circuit Court, was born in Brown township, this county,
              June 2, 1845. He is a son of Jonas and Catharine Marsh, honest, respectable people,
                 in good standing in the community. By industry and
              close application to his studies, Ephraim soon acquired a fair English education at
              the public schools of the county, and at the age of twenty entered Asbury University
              at Greencastle, Indiana, where he graduated with honors in 1870. During his collegiate
              course he spent one year at Washington City as clerk in the Third Auditor's office of
              the Treasury Department, receiving his appointment through the recommendation of
              ex-Governor Hendricks and Judge D. S. Gooding. After serving for a time as deputy
              clerk of the Circuit Court under Henry A. Swope, during which time he applied himself
              assiduously to the study of law, he was, in the autumn of 1874, elected Clerk of the
              Circuit Court, and re-elected in 1878. Mr. Marsh, on February 29, 1872, joined the
              Knights of Pythias; in 1873, the Free and Accepted Masons; in 1874, the Independent
              Order of Odd Fellows; in 1878, the Ancient Order of Workingmen. He has been Master in
              the Masonic and Past Chancellor in the Pythias. He is also a thirty-second Indiana
              Consistory, S. P. R., and a member of Keystone Chapter of the Masons of Indianapolis
              and Raper Commandery. He was married February 5, 1875, to Miss Matilda J. Brewer, of
              Franklin county, an estimable lady of great merit and financial means, the fruits of
              which union is one child, Ella, a favorite of all who know her, and in the public
              school, which she is now attending.
            Mr. M. is a steadfast Democrat, a fine conversationalist, and a courteous gentleman.
              As an officer he has been attentive and efficient, and has won the confidence of his
              constituents. Mr. M. is still a young man, and is looking forward to the legal
              profession after the expiration of his office, and is bending his energies in that
              direction.
          
          
            NELSON BRADLEY,
            President of the Greenfield Banking Company, was born in Clermont county, Ohio, May
              19, 1822. His father was an Englishman, and served in the American army in the  war of 1812. Mr. Bradley's opportunities for an education
              were limited, his time being chiefly employed in helping his father on the farm, and
              his schooling was restricted to a few months' attendance at the log school-houses of
              his neighborhood. Mr. B. in early life manifested a taste for and aptness in business
              pursuits, and while yet a boy made frequent visits to the markets at Cincinnati with
              produce purchased at the farm-houses in the various settlements. In 1852 he visited
              Indiana, and purchased a small tract of land on the newly-constructed Bellefontaine
              railroad, at the site of the present town of McCordsville. In September he located
              there and opened a store. In 1863 he was elected Treasurer of Hancock county, which
              position he held for two consecutive terms. In 1866 he moved to Greenfield, and
              engaged in the grocery business, at which he continued till 1871, when, with other
              gentlemen, he established the Greenfield Banking Company, of which he is still
              president. He is also a partner in the Hancock Flouring Mills, and a stockholder in
              nearly all the gravel roads centering in Greenfield. Mr. B. has contributed liberally
              towards the erection of churches and other public buildings, and has ever manifested a
              liberal public-spirited disposition. He has been an honored member of the Free and
              Accepted Masons since 1845, at which time he joined the order in Georgetown, Ohio. He
              took the Chapter degrees in Felicity, Ohio, in 1848, and the Council and Scottish Rite
              degrees at Indianapolis at a later date. He assisted in organizing Oakland Lodge, No.
              140, and McCordsville Chapter, No. 44, of which he was the first High Priest. He is
              now a member of Hancock Lodge, No. 101, of which he has been treasurer and trustee for
              a number of years. He has been a liberal, consistent member of the M. E. Church since
              1845, and is now and has been for many years superintendent of the large and
              prosperous Sunday-school in connection therewith. He was first a Whig, but, since the
              organization of the party, an enthusiastic Republican. He was married September 29,
              1844, to Elizabeth Gray, a noble, Christian woman, who 
              has been his faithful companion, shared his joys and aided in his prosperity for
              nearly forty years. Mr. B. is of a genial disposition, enjoys a good joke and a hearty
              laugh, and has a host of warm friends.
          
          
            JONATHAN SMITH
            was born in Preston county, West Virginia, August 29, 1818, and moved to Hancock
              county, Indiana, during the winter of 1836-7. Was married to Mary T. Watson December
              17, 1840, who died December 4, 1841. His second marriage was to Susannah Lakin,
              October 16, 1845, who has been an invalid for the past twenty-six years. Mr. S. has
              raised four children (all boys), all of whom are still living, the oldest being
              thirty-five years of age. Mr. Smith's religious views are strictly old school Baptist.
              He established a store at what is now known as Willow Branch in 1853, and a
              post-office at the same place in 1854. He continued in this occupation about twenty
              years. Also, at the same time Mr. S. continued in farming, which was his former
              occupation. Mr. S. was a staunch Democrat, an industrious man, and served one term as
              county commissioner. See his portrait on another page.
          
          
            JAMES JUDKINS,
            a native of Virginia, began his earthly pilgrimage in 1803. Was married to Elizabeth
              Wales in North Carolina, September 1, 1825, and emigrated to Newport, Wayne county,
              Indiana, in 1826. Moved to Hancock county in 1833, and entered land about one mile
              west of Eden. Among his neighbors at that time were Robert Walker, Jas. and Jehu
              Denney, Jacob and William Amick, and Enoch Olvey. Others soon followed. Here he
              experienced the hardships and privations of pioneer life. Fruits were then almost
              unknown; corn was $1 per bushel, and other eatables proportionately high. In 1836 he
              moved to the Pierson farm and mill on Sugar Creek, five or six miles north-west of
              Greenfield, which mill he run for about four  years, and
              did much of the grinding and sawing for the citizens of *Greenfield. The old mill pond was then supplied with fine
              fish, the catching of which afforded royal sport for some of the early settlers of
              Greenfield, among whom were Cornwell and Joshua Meek, Nathan Crawford, Ferdinand
              Keiffer, the Piersons and others. In 1840 he sold the mill, purchased an adjoining
              farm, and worked thereon for two years; then back to the Pierson farm and mill again,
              which he rented for six years, Pierson having died in the meantime. In 1848 he
              returned to his adjoining farm, where he remained till his death, December 24, 1874.
              Mr. J. was the father of eight children, his widow and three of whom survive him, Dr.
              E. I., Miss Irene and the widow, of this city, and James M., of Iowa. Mr. J. was a
              devoted member of Hancock Lodge, No. 101, F. A. M. His mortal remains now slumber in
              the Sugar Creek cemetery, near his old home.
          
          
            HON. MORGAN CHANDLER,
            cashier of the Greenfield Banking Company, of this city, was born on a farm in Owen
              county, Kentucky, September 30, 1827. His grandfather was a soldier in the revolution.
              His early opportunities for education were exceedingly limited, so that at the age of
              twenty-one he could neither read nor write his own name. He now, however, resolved to
              educate himself, and within eighteen months was teaching school in his own county.
              This occupation he followed for fifteen months. In 1851 he came to Hancock county,
              Indiana, and engaged in teaching. In 1854 he engaged as clerk in the store of G. G.
              Tague at $10 per month. April 22, 1855, he was married to Miss Nancy M. Galbreath,
              formerly of Kentucky. In the fall of the same year he was elected Sheriff of this
              county. After the expiration of his term of office, he engaged in farming until 1861,
              when he was elected Clerk of the Hancock Circuit Court, *This was the first mill in Center township.
                See page 145.
              which office he held for four years. The summer of
              1867-68 he spent in the Western States and Territories, and the winters of the same
              years in Washington City. In 1869-70 he was engaged in the store of Walker &
              Edwards. In 1871 he, with four other gentlemen, established the Greenfield Banking
              Company, of which he is cashier. Referring back to his earlier history, we may remark
              that at the age of fifteen he united with the Baptist Church, and still leans in that
              direction. At the age of twenty-two he was chosen Lieutenant-Colonel of the State
              troops of his native county. Mr. C. has been a life-long Democrat, an advocate of
              improvements, and has always taken a lively interest in agricultural pursuits, being
              President of the District Fair Association, composed of the counties of Rush, Henry
              and Hancock. Mr. C. is kind and hospitable, and has thereby made an extensive
              acquaintance. He is also a good judge of human nature, and has rare business tact and
              talent, which eminently fit him for his present position. In the fall of 1880 he
              represented his adopted county in the lower house of the Legislature.
          
          
            CAPT. I. A. CURRY
            was born in Center township, Hancock county, Indiana, July 16, 1835. At the age of
              sixteen his father died, leaving his mother with several small children. Mr. Curry
              being the oldest, much of the care of the family consequently fell upon his shoulders.
              He grumbled not, however, but performed his duties well. His opportunities for
              education were limited, but he made the most of them. In December, 1857, he was
              married to Miss Mary Thomas, with whom he is still happily living. In August, 1862, he
              enlisted as a private in Company B, 99th Indiana Regiment, and was soon promoted to
              1st Sergeant, which position he held till January, 1863, when he was again promoted,
              this time to 2nd Lieutenant, and in March, 1864, to 1st Lieutenant, and finally, in
              April, 1865, he was mustered in as Captain. His regiment followed Gen. Sherman in his
                 memorable march through Georgia to the sea. Mr. C.,
              through these tedious years of soldier life, was ever recognized as a faithful soldier
              and dutiful officer. In the fall of 1880 he was elected Treasurer of Hancock county,
              which position he is still filling.
          
          
            DR. ELAM I. JUDKINS,
            a resident physician of this city, and second son of the late James Judkins, was born
              in Wayne county, Indiana, 
                DR. E. I. JUDKINS
               in 1830. He remained with his father, working on a farm and in a mill, till
              he attained his majority. His opportunities for education being limited, his thirst
              for knowledge led him to Greenfield in January, 1852, where he attended school for a
              time, then at Shelbyville for one year. He afterwards engaged in teaching and manual
              labor until the autumn of 1854, when he went into the drug trade and study of
              medicine. In the spring of 1865, after having attended a course of lectures in the
              Ohio Medical College at Cincinnati, he began the practice, and has since been actively
              and successfully engaged in his chosen profession. Dr. J. is a graduate of the Indiana
              Medical College and of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Indiana. He has  been an active insurance agent since 1863, and perhaps is
              the oldest agent in the county. He has been a member of and
              zealously devoted to the order of Masons since 1853. In May, 1857,
              he was married in Rensselaer, Jasper county, Indiana, to Miss Emma L. Martin, daughter
              of the late Dr. William H. Martin, formerly of Rushville, and at one time Secretary of
              the Board of Examiners of the Indiana Medical Institute. (See page 110.) In February, 1880, Mrs. J. died, leaving no
              children. The only child born unto them died in 1863, at the age of five years. In
              1862, the doctor was appointed enrolling and draft commissioner, by Gov. Morton, for
              this county. In 1868-69, Dr. J. served as President of the Board of Town Trustees, and
              to him is mainly due the credit of originating and negotiating the bonds for the
              erection of the public school building, which is a credit to our city. He also served
              four years as treasurer of the town. In 1881 Dr. J. was appointed by the Commissioner
              of Pensions as a U. S. Examining Surgeon for this vicinity, which position he still
              holds. The Doctor's mother and sister are living with him at the old home, where he
              set up to himself in 1857. The Doctor is an unswerving Republican, inclines to the
              Presbyterian faith, and is an enterprising, public-spirited man.
          
          
            HON. WILLIAM R. HOUGH,
            senior member of the law firm of Hough & Cook, of the city of Greenfield, was
              born at Williamsburgh, Wayne county, in this State, October 9, 1833. He is the oldest
              son of Alfred and Anna Hough, whose parents were among the pioneers of that county.
              His paternal ancestors were among the early settlers of Pennsylvania, having emigrated
              from England and located in that State in 1683. At the age of eight years, the subject
              of our sketch removed with his parents from his native village to Hagerstown, in the
              same county, and in the fall of 1842 from Hagerstown to Northern Indiana, locating at
              Middlebury, Elkhart county. 
              
                JAMES A. NEW
              
              In this village Mr. Hough grew to manhood, receiving
              such educational advantages as were afforded by the public schools, the Middlebury
              Seminary, and a supplemental course of study at the LaGrange Collegiate Institute, of
              LaGrange county. During his twentieth and twenty-second years he taught school in the
              last named county. In the fall of 1856, having determined to enter the legal
              profession, he located in Greenfield, and began the study of the law in the office of
              Capt. Reuben A. Riley, one of the leading lawyers of the county. He made rapid
              progress with his studies, and was soon admitted to the bar, and began practice as
              partner of his preceptor. While prosecuting his legal studies he was twice appointed
              by the commissioners of this county to the office of school examiner, and for two
              successive years performed the duties thereof. In 1860 he was elected district
              attorney for the district composed of the counties of Hancock, Madison, Henry, Rush
              and Decatur, and for two years prosecuted the pleas of the State to the satisfaction
              of the law-abiding people of the district.
            In 1862 Mr. Hough was married to Miss Tillie C. McDowell, a native of Scotland, and
              settled down to the earnest pursuit of his profession, and for ten or twelve years did
              an immense amount of professional labor, both in his office and at the bar, where he
              was recognized as an able advocate and a tenacious, strong opponent. In the year 1872
              he was nominated and elected State Senator for the district composed of Hancock and
              Henry counties, which position he filled for four years, serving during two regular
              and two special sessions in the Legislature. As a legislator, Mr. H. was recognized as
              an able debater, and as a man of acknowledged executive ability, evidenced by the
              large amount of work which he performed as a member of several of the most important
              committees.
            Mr. H. has been an earnest Republican since the organization of the party, and cast
              his first vote for President for John C. Fremont. Since 1865 he has been an honored
              member of the I. O. O. F.
            
            Mrs. Hough, who has been his companion and help-mate indeed, is a lady of refined
              tastes and accomplishments, and is in every way fitted to preside over her elegant and
              hospitable home. They have two boys, William A. and Clarence A., aged respectively
              seventeen and fifteen. Their only daughter, Mabel, a beautiful, brilliant little girl,
              dearly loved by all her friends and schoolmates, and idolized by her parents, was, at
              the age of seven years, suddenly and unexpectedly called from her pleasant home,
              surrounded by birds, music, flowers and ferns, to enter her long home in the celestial
              city, where the streets are paved with gold, and music is never ceasing, and sickness,
              death and darkness never enter.
            Mr. H. is a public-spirited citizen, and is a prominent promoter and supporter of the
              public school system, which he has defended as a citizen, lecturer and legislator.
              That his services to the cause of education as a member of the Senate were highly
              appreciated by the leading educators of the State, may be inferred from the following
              incident: In the year 1874, the late Hon. Milton B. Hopkins, then Superintendent of
              Public Instruction, in a public lecture in Greenfield, in speaking of the acts of the
              Legislature of 1873, among other things said: "The last Legislature was the best
              Legislature on the question of education that ever sat in Indiana; and I take pleasure
              in saying now, and saying it here in his presence (Mr. H. being in the audience), that
              no county was more faithfully represented in that body, on that question, than was
              Hancock county, on the floor of the Senate, in the person of your honored
              Senator."
            Mr. Hough has been remarkably successful financially, having achieved a handsome
              competence, and is one of the largest tax-payers in the county.
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XXIV.
          
            COURTS, JAILS, EXEMPTION LAWS, ETC.
            The First Court—Of any kind or character in Hancock county
              was a commissioners' court, held early in the year 1828, and composed of three
              commissioners, viz: Elisha Chapman, Samuel Vangilder and John Hunter. This court is
              still in existence, having met four times a year ever since, and never having
              undergone any great or material change, except that its duties have been enlarged and
              its jurisdiction somewhat extended, as the State has advanced in years and laws have
              multiplied on the statute books.
            The First Circuit Court—In Hancock county was organized in
              March, 1828, at the private residence of Samuel B. Jackson, in a log house east of
              Greenfield, in the bottom on Brandywine, south of the National road, near the flax
              factory. This county was then in the Fifth Judicial Circuit.
            The First Officers—Of said court were Bethuel F. Morris,
              Presiding Judge; Jacob Jones and James Stevens, Associate Judges;* James Whitcomb, Prosecuting Attorney; Lewis
              Tyner, Clerk, and John Foster, Sheriff.
            The First Attorneys—Admitted to the bar in Hancock county
              were Calvin Fletcher, Henry Gregg, Marinus Willett and Charles H. Verder. There being
              no business before the court, it adjourned with the following entry: "The court adjourned sine die. March 24, A.
                  D., 1828. "A. F. MORRIS,
                Judge."
            *For about twenty-four
              years of the first history of Hancock county the Circuit Court was presided over by
              three Judges, a Presiding Judge and two Associate Judges. The functions of the
              Presiding Judge were similar to those of the Judge of the Circuit Court in Indiana at
              this date. He had his circuit prescribed by law, and traveled from county to county.
              The Associate Judges were county officers, each county having her own. Instead of one
              Judge, as at present, three then sat upon the bench at the same time, the Presiding
              Judge being the center man.
            
            "September* Term,
                1828.—At a Circuit Court, began and held at the house of Samuel B.
              Jackson, in the county of Hancock, on the 22d of September, 1828, it being the fourth
              Monday of September, Hiram Brown and James F. Brown were admitted attorneys."
            The First Grand Jurors—Were George W. Hinton, James McKinsey,
              Benjamin Gordon, Meredith Gosney, Jeremiah Meek, Samuel Thompson, Robert Snodgrass,
              David Templeton, Ladock Stephenson, Richard Guymon, Jacob Tague, Moses McCall, Samuel
              Martin, Basil Meek, Owen Griffith and John Osborn; twelve sturdy men, of good judgment
              and clean characters. Meredith Gosney was appointed foreman.
            The First Bill Found—By said grand jury was against
              Washington Williams, for assault and battery. He was arraigned, tried and found
              guilty, and a fine of $1 assessed against him. Several other bills were found by said
              grand jury, most of which resulted in $1 fines. The most singular and unexpected bill,
              however, was against Lewis Tyner, Clerk of the aforesaid Circuit Court, for neglecting
              to post up, in accordance with the requirements of law, a list of his legal fees,
              which resulted in his being fined $1 and costs.
            The First Petit Jury—Empanneled in this county was composed
              of the following twelve reputable men and prominent citizens at that date, viz.: Henry
              Watts, John Kauble, Peter Bellery, Benjamin Miller, George Baity, William Chapman,
              William Booth, David Smith, John Henley, James Goodwin, Samuel Vangilder and Elihu
              Chapman.
            The First Commissioners' Court in Greenfield.—In May, 1829,
              the Commissioners of the county adjourned to the town of Greenfield, the seat of
              justice, from the house of Samuel B. Jackson to the place appointed by the Legislature
              of Indiana in which the courts of said county should *It will be observed that the first term of
                court was held in March and the second in September, being six months apart, which
                is accounted for by the fact that in the early history of the county and until 1872
                there were but two terms of the Circuit Court per annum.
               be held. It was a rude log house, belonging to Jeremiah
              Meek.
            The First Court House.—In the winter of 1829-30 the
              Commissioners contracted with Amos Dickerson and John Hays to build a two-story brick
              Court House on the public square, at a cost of about $3,000. This building was
              promptly erected, in accordance with contract, and courts were held therein, in the
              lower rooms, until 1851, at which time it was torn down.
            Courts in Churches and Seminary.—In December, 1851, the
              Trustees of the M. E. Church, on South State street, rented their church building to
              the County Commissioners, to be used as a place for holding the courts. Said building
              was a roomy one-story frame, still standing, located in the south part of the city on
              the west side of South State street. Early in 1853 the court was moved to the old
              Seminary, and remained there until the June term, 1855, when the court was ordered to
              be moved to the Christian Church building, still standing, and located just north of
              our present jail and east of the public square. The conditions of said renting were
              that the house should not be damaged, and if not injured it should be free to the
              county until the new Court House should be completed.
            The Present Court House.*—In 1854, Nathan Crawford, father of Freeman H.
              Crawford, druggist in our city, contracted to erect a new brick Court House, two
              stories high, commodious and substantial, on the public square, at a cost of $14,400,
              which contract he filled promptly and fully, in accordance with the plans and
              specifications. This contract did not include the bell and irons for suspending
              thereof; but for these he was allowed the sum of $268. Said Crawford was ordered to
              buy ten stoves and different locks and keys for said Court House; and it was further
              ordered by the Commissioners that the county officers receive their rooms unfinished,
              and that they have their respective rooms finished to suit themselves by the *See cut of house on page
                36.
              carpenter or carpenters employed by the county. The
              courts were to occupy the upper rooms, and the county officers the lower. The house
              was completed and brought into use early in 1856. There has been, from time to time,
              several changes made in the court rooms above, and in the arrangement of the officers'
              rooms below.
            Circuit Court Twice a Year.—Prior to 1872, Circuit Court was
              held in this county twice a year. Since that time quarter sessions have been regularly
              held.
            Circuit and Associate Judges.—From the organization of the
              county, in 1828 until 1852, the date of the adoption of the Constitution, there was
              one Circuit Judge and two Associate Judges (one on either side) on the bench. In 1852
              the law providing for Associate Judges was abolished, since which time we have had but
              the one Judge.
            The Names of the Circuit Judges—In Hancock county, from the
              date of the organization thereof to the present, with the date of their appointment or
              election, are as follows, to-wit: 
                Bethuel F. Morris
                  1828
                William W. Wick
                  1835
                James Morrison
                  1840
                William J. Peasley
                  1843
                William W. Wick
                  1850
                Stephen Major
                  1853
                Joseph S. Buckles
                  1859
                Joshua H. Mellett
                  1870
                Robert L. Polk
                  1876
                Mark E. Forkner
                  1881
              
            Remarks: It will be observed that Bethuel F. Morris was the first Circuit Judge in
              the county. William W. Wick, who came on the bench in 1835, was one of the early
              judges in Indiana. It was he that presided at Pendleton, in Madison county, in 1824,
              at the trial of the whites for the murder of the Indians on Fall creek. He also
              presided at the organization of the first court in Rush county, in April, 1822. He was
              the Judge on the bench in  the Fifth District at the
              time when Sheriff John Hays, of Rush county, became insane and wandered out to this
              place, and was burned up in the old jail, as heretofore mentioned. Judges Morrison,
              Peasley and Major were in office respectively three, seven and six years, and were
              known to our older attorneys, David M. C. Lane, David S. Gooding, J. H. Williams, T.
              D. Walpole, George W. Julian, et al. Judges Buckles and Mellett have
              exchanged the bench for the bar, and are holding forth respectively at Anderson and
              New Castle. Robert L. Polk, Judge of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit for five years,
              died at his home in New Castle, Saturday, May 7, 1881, at the early age of
              thirty-nine. Hon. Mark E. Forkner was appointed by Governor Porter to fill the
              unexpired term of the late lamented Judge Polk, and is the presiding Judge at this
              date.
            The Names of the Associate Judges—In Hancock county from 1828
              to 1852 were as follows, to-wit: 
                Jacob Jones,
                James Stevens,
                John Ogg,
                Robert McCorkhill,
                Nathan Crawford,
                George Henry,
                Hector H. Hall,
                George Tague,
                Owen Jarrett,
                Andrew F. Hatfield,
                P. H. Foy.
              
            Remarks: Jacob Jones and James Stevens, it will be observed, were the first Associate
              Judges in the county. John Ogg, father of A. L. Ogg, and Robert McCorkhill, a
              prominent citizen, came next; then followed in order Nathan Crawford, contractor of
              the court-house, George Henry, father of Attorney Charles Henry, of Anderson, Hector
              H. Hall, now of Indianapolis, from whom we have a letter on page 139, George Tague,
              father of G. G. and Jonathan Tague, Owen Jarrett, ancestor of the Green township
              Jarretts, Andrew F. Hatfield and P. H. Foy, the last two of whom were on the bench at
              the time of the adoption of the new Constitution.
            
            The Probate Court.—In 1829 there was a Probate Court
              organized in the county, with power to adjust estates of deceased persons, or, as the
              name indicates, adjudicate probate business only. This court continued until 1852,
              when the law providing for it was abolished, and the business was turned over to the
              Common Pleas Court, which was then provided for. The first Probate Judge was Jeremiah
              Meek, who served till 1836. The second was 
                GEORGE L. KNOX.
               John Ogg, who presided till 1850. The third and last was Samuel Hottle, who
              held forth till 1852. The Probate Court, during the time it was sustained as a
              separate and distinct court, set twice a year only. After the probate business was
              turned over to the Common Pleas Court, probate matters could be adjudicated four times
              a year.
            
            Remarks: The first will recorded in the county was that of Samuel Pierson on the 24th
              of September, 1829. The first inventory of personal property was on the 10th of
              October, 1829.
            The Common Pleas Court—Was organized by an act approved May
              14, 1852, to be presided over by one Judge, elected by the voters of the district, at
              the annual election in October, 1852, and every four years thereafter, who should hold
              his office for the term of four years, if he should so long behave well, and until his
              successor should be elected and qualified. And in case of a vacancy by death or
              otherwise, the Governor was to fill the vacancy by appointment until the next general
              election. The Common Pleas Court, as to jurisdiction, was virtually a probate court,
              at least as to all matters in which it had exclusive jurisdiction;
              but there were certain matters in which it had concurrent
              jurisdiction with the Circuit Court. Section five of the act of May 14, 1852,
              providing for the establishment of Courts of Common Pleas, and defining the duties and
              jurisdiction thereof, read as follows, to-wit: "The Circuit and Common Pleas Courts
              shall have concurrent jurisdiction in all actions against heirs, devisees and sureties
              of executors, administrators and guardians, in the partition of real estate,
              assignment of dowers, and the appointment of a commissioner to execute a deed on any
              title bond given by deceased." Although it would seem from the section just quoted,
              that the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts had concurrent jurisdiction in all actions
              against the sureties of executors, administrators and guardians, yet the Supreme Court
              held in 10th Indiana, page 411, that Courts of Common Pleas have no jurisdiction of
              suits on the bonds of administrators, when the damages are laid at $1,000 or upward.
              But to be brief, without entering into details, the Common Pleas Courts, which were
              sustained for twenty years in this and other counties of Indiana, were virtually
              probate courts, presided over by judges elected quadrennially, and did the business,
              slightly modified, of the old probate courts, which met semi-annually. It was an  inferior court to the Circuit Court. The Judges of the
              Common Pleas Court of Hancock county, for the time aforesaid, and the dates of their
              election were as follows, to-wit: 
                David S. Gooding
                  1852
                Richard Lake
                  1856
                William Grose
                  1860
                David S. Gooding
                  1861
                William R. West
                  1864
                Robert L. Polk
                  1872
              
            
            This court was abolished by an act of the Legislature approved March 6, 1873, which
              act also provided for the redistricting of the State for judicial purposes into
                thirty-eight* circuits, and
              fixed the time of holding courts therein, and transferred the business of the Common
              Pleas to the Circuit Courts. Under this act all matters and business pending in the
              Courts of Common Pleas were to be transferred and disposed of by the new Circuit
              Court.
            The Present Circuit Court.—The new Circuit Court, by the act
              of March 6, 1873, had her jurisdiction greatly extended, and in addition to the
              jurisdiction previously exercised, was to have jurisdiction over all matters which had
              been previously considered by the Common Pleas Courts, and all laws and parts of laws
              concerning said Courts of Common Pleas were to be construed to mean and apply to said
              Circuit Courts, and the old offices of Common Pleas Judge and District Attorney were
              abolished. This act also provided for the election of Judges and Prosecuting
              Attorneys, on the second Tuesday of October, 1873, to fill the places of such Judges
              and Prosecuting Attorneys as were then holding their office by virtue of an
              appointment by the Governor, since which time we have had a Prosecuting Attorney, and
              the counties of Henry and Hancock have constituted the 18th Judicial Circuit. The
              courts in this county convene on the Monday following the close of the term of the
              Henry county court. The courts in Henry are held on the first Monday in February,
              fourth Monday in April, first Monday in September, and third Monday of *Three additional circuits
                have since been added. The 41st and last circuit is composed of Marshall and Fulton
                counties, as provided for by the acts of 1875, page 47.
               November in each year. The courts in Henry continue six
              weeks, and in Hancock four weeks, if the business require it. And there has since been
              but two courts in the county, viz.: The Commissioners Court, which was the first in
              the county, and the Circuit Court, which now has jurisdiction of all probate matters,
              civil and criminal business, and consequently performs the duties heretofore devolving
              upon the Probate, Common Pleas and Circuit Courts.
            Courts of Conciliation.—There was still another court, though
              little resorted to, termed a Court of Conciliation, which was provided for by an act
              entitled an act to establish courts of conciliation; to prescribe rules and
              proceedings therein, and compensation of Judges thereof, approved June 11, 1852. This
              court might take cognizance of all cases in which any person claimed to have a cause
              of action against another for libel, slander, malicious prosecution, assault and
              battery, or false imprisonment. This law was, in many respects, similar to our present
              law relative to arbitrations and umpirages, approved February 3, 1875. In case a
              reconciliation between the parties was had, a memorandum thereof stating the nature of
              the controversy, or the alleged cause of action, the appearance of the parties, and
              the fact of the reconciliation, without specifying the terms thereof, unless it be
              agreed by the parties to do so, was to be entered upon a book of record, kept by the
              Judge, and signed by the respective parties. The reconciliation thus effected was a
              complete bar to any future action in reference to either party in respect thereto. In
              case of a final adjustment of the matter in controversy, the Judge was entitled to a
              fee of $5, to be paid half by each party; but in case of no reconciliation, no fee
              whatever could be received by the Judge for any services rendered. This court was a
              kind of equity criminal court, and the act specially provided that every controversy
              submitted to it for settlement was to be decided according to conscience and right, without regard to technical rules.
              These courts of conciliation should have been considered useful to the people in
              saving costs and the bitter feelings  resulting from
              long and tedious lawsuits, but an examination of the records of our courts develops
              the fact that the people did not seem to take kindly to its pacific provisions, being
              considered by them of little importance.
          
          
            JAILS.
            The first jail in Hancock county was a wooden structure, erected soon after the
              organization of the county, located on the south part of the public square, and burned
              down in 1833 by John Hays, the only inmate at the time.* In 1835 Cornwell Meek erected, at a cost of $2,200, a
              hewed log jail building, two stories high, with two rooms below for the jailer's
              residence and two above for the convicts. The east one was called the debtor's room,
              and was provided with two windows, and used for the confinement of lawfully adjudged
              debtors, under the law of Indiana providing for imprisonment for debt, which prevailed
              prior to 1838. The west room was less attractive, having but one small window, and was
              used for the confinement of the regular criminals. This building remained and was used
              by the county until the erection of the present jail, in the year 1871, at a contract
              price of $32,900,† located on
              the south-east corner of the public square.
          
          
            EXEMPTION LAWS.
            The old Constitution of the State of Indiana declared that "the privilege of the
              debtor to enjoy the necessary comforts of life shall be recognized by wholesome laws,
              exempting a reasonable amount of property from seizure or sale for the payment of any
              debt or liability hereafter contracted." Observe that the constitutional provision for
              an exemption is restricted to contracts alone. Under an act of 1843,
              an execution defendant could claim an *For a fuller account of this matter see page 161, where the subject is fully
                developed.
              †For a description of the
                present jail and the cost thereof see page 37.
               exemption from execution, at any time before the sale,
              any personal property levied on, not exceeding in value $125. The Constitution of 1852
              retains the old exemption section of the original Constitution, with an additional
              clause prohibiting imprisonment for debt, except in case of fraud. Under this
              constitutional provision, an act to exempt property from sale in certain cases,
              approved February 15, 1852, provided that an amount of property not exceeding in value
              $300, owned by any resident householder, should not be liable to sale on execution, or
              any other final process from a court, for any debt growing out of or founded upon a
              contract, express or implied, after the 4th day of July, 1852. This law exempting $300
              remained in full force and effect until it was superseded by the act of March 29,
              1879, which provides for the exemption of an amount of property not exceeding in value
              $600, owned by any resident householder, such exemption being for any debt growing out
              of or founded upon a contract, express or implied, after the taking effect of said
              act. The same Legislature, in an act concerning married women, approved March 25,
              1879, exempts from execution wearing apparel and articles of personal adornment
              purchased by her, to the amount of $200; and exempts all presents of jewelry, books,
              works of art, &c., and provides that she shall further hold as exempt, except for
              the purchase money therefor, other property to the amount of $300, making a total
              exemption to married women of $500 in addition to her presents.
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XXV.
            SEQUEL TO BLUE-RIVER TOWNSHIP.
          Wolf's Mill.—The first mill in Hancock county was built in 1824
            by Joshua Wilson, on Blue river, in the south-west part of Blue-River township. It was a
            very small building, partially weather-boarded, and did both sawing and grinding. It run
            one set of burrs, and, if well attended to, would grind from ten to fifteen bushels per
            day, and the saw-mill, under favorable circumstances, would cut from two to three
            hundred feet per day, with the assistance of two or three men to help start it
            occasionally. In cutting the race, there was a bayou that formed all its course but
            about ten rods, but Wilson was unable, physically and financially, to cut this short
            distance, hence his few neighbors gratuitously volunteered their services, and cut the
            short distance which nature had left unfinished. Among those hospitable neighbors were
            Solomon Tyner, John Osborn, George Penwell, G. Smith, Thomas Phillips, Abram Johns,
            Harmon Warrum, et al. In 1826 Henry Watts purchased the mill of
            Wilson, and attached a bolt to run by hand. When this mill first started, all the white
            people for miles around gathered in to witness the grand scene. Wolf purchased the mill
            about 1840, and attached a carding and spinning machine. The mill at this point has
            changed hands a number of times, as noted elsewhere in this book, and has been variously
            known as the Wilson, Watts, Wolf and Bacon Mill, and, while owned by Bacon, was
            denominated the "Blue River Mills." The mill has recently changed hands, and is now
            owned by Jacob Wolf, son of John Wolf, the old proprietor.
          The Blue-River Temperance Association—Was brought about by a
            few earnest workers attending a convention of  the W. C.
            T. U., at Knightstown, and becoming enthused in the work, and obtaining a copy of their
            constitution and pledge to assist in organizing. A few of the citizens of Blue-River
            township met at Friends' meeting-house, Westland, May 26, 1877, and organized an
            association, known as the "Blue-River Township Temperance Association," at which time
            forty-five persons signed the pledge and became members.
          The following constitution has been adopted, being better suited to our work than the
            constitution of the W. C. T. U.: ARTICLE
                I.—This society shall be known as the Blue-River Township Temperance
                Association.
              ART. II.—It shall be the duty of this society to plan and
                carry forward measures which, with the blessings of God, will result in the
                suppression of intemperance.
              ART. III.—Any person may become a member of this
                association by signing the following pledge: "We, the undersigned, men, women and
                children of Blue-River township, feeling that the use of intoxicating liquors has
                reached a point no longer to be endured, do, by the help of God, promise to use our
                utmost endeavors to banish this evil from among us; and in order to strengthen our
                influence in this regard, we hereby agree to abstain from the use of all
                intoxicating beverages, and we will discourage their use in all possible ways."
              ART. IV.—The officers of this association shall be a
                President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and an executive committee of
                three.
              ART. V.—The President, Vice-President, Secretary and
                Treasurer shall perform the duties usually incumbent upon that office.
              ART. VI.—It shall be the duty of the executive committee to
                decide upon the time and place of meeting; to produce a programme to each meeting
                for the one following; to see that those on duty are informed thereof, and to give
                them such assistance as is necessary in the preparation of their duties.
              ART. VII.—This constitution may be altered or amended by a
                two-thirds vote, at any regular meeting.
          
          
              JOHN WOLF.
            
          
          Meetings have been held every two, three, or four weeks, as circumstances will admit,
            since its organization, circulating to all the school districts in the township; at each
            meeting soliciting signers to the pledge, which now numbers three hundred and
            seventy-five, of ages from five to seventy-seven years.
          It is conducted principally as a literary association, aiming to instill into the minds
            of all classes the need of moral reform and true temperance principles.
          Pleasant View Meeting, Friends—Was established under the
            authority of Spiceland quarterly meeting in the eleventh month, 1850. Meetings were held
            for a time, perhaps a year, in a frame school-house near by; then in the frame
            meeting-house, occupied as a place of worship at this date. Among the first members were
            William and Charity Hill, Libni Hunt and wife, Samuel Brown and wife, Phineas White,
            Matthew Hodson, Daniel Hastings, Alfred and John Hunt, Eli and Robert Brown, Daniel and
            John Reece, Albert White, Enoch Pierson, and Amos H., Samuel B. and John Hill. Among
            those who have preached at this place are Melissa Hill and Jared P. Binford. A Bible
            School, in connection with this meeting, is sustained the year round. Average
            attendance, thirty; Cynthia White, Superintendent. Samuel B. Hill was one of the first
            teachers, and has been connected therewith for more than thirty years. Alfred Hunt, one
            of the most prompt and punctual in attendance at both the Sabbath and week day meetings,
            faithfully times the sittings thereof.
          Additional Suicides and Sudden Deaths in Blue-River
            Township.—In 1839, Robert Marsh was killed by the falling of a tree, while
            "coon hunting" one dark night.
          Mrs. T. Ballenger, October 26, 1875, stepped on a piece of pumpkin rind, slipped and
            fell with her neck across the edge of a bucket, which dislocated the upper cervical
            vertebræ, producing sudden death.
          John Kinder committed suicide by hanging, in his own stable, about 1870.
          On May 29, 1875, Miss Mary A. Anderson, daughter of 
            James Anderson, of Blue-River township, while fishing in company with her sister, fell
            into Blue river, and was drowned. Mrs. Reed committed suicide by hanging, at Allentown,
            in 1870.
          Farmers' Insurance Association—Of Hancock county was organized
            June 12, 1876, with William Marsh as President; B. F. Luse, Vice-President; Samuel B.
            Hill, Secretary and Treasurer, and one Director for each township. It was reorganized
            under the statutes of Indiana, August 31, 1878. The present officers are John H. White,
            President; T. E. Bentley, Vice-President; S. B. Hill, Secretary and Treasurer, and one
            Director for each township. The association has met with but three losses, amounting to
            $1,103, since its organization. It paid to officers for printing, postage, &c., last
            year, $154.75. Losses have been promptly paid, and the association is in good standing
            where its workings are understood.
          Westland Meeting, Friends.—Among the first Friends that settled
            in the vicinity of Westland were Joseph Andrews, in 1832; John Brown, in 1833; Elias
            Marsh, Elisha Butler, Nathan Perisha, William and Frederick Brown, et
              al., at different times until the year 1839, when the propriety of a meeting and
            school-house was discussed by these friends of education, and they agreed on a day to
            meet, in which they constructed a log school-house, 16x20 feet, soon after which they
            employed a teacher for the small children of the neighborhood. In 1840 a meeting was
            regularly organized, with about fifteen families. Among the early ministers were Mary
            Hodson and Melissa Hill. A First-day school was soon organized and conducted by Abigail
            Hubbard. After a few years, the society desired a separate house in which to hold their
            meetings, and all hands and friends of the cause joined in and built a small frame,
            without any estimate as to cost. About 1871, the present neat and commodious frame
            building was erected, at a cost of $1,500. Present minister, Winbern Kerns; total
            membership, 102; average attendance on the Sabbath, fifty-seven.
          
          Samuel B. Hill—Was born February 22, 1832, in Randolph county,
            Indiana. When one year old his parents, William and Charity Hill, moved to a farm in
            Rush county, two and a half miles south-west of Charlottesville, where he lived until
            his marriage, in 1852, to Mary M. Henley. In the following year he removed to the farm
            in Blue-River township, where he still resides. The years from sixteen to twenty-one
            were spent in teaching and attending school at Friends' Boarding School, near Richmond,
            Indiana, afterward Earlham College, of which institution he has been a member of the
            Board of Managers for some years. He served as Trustee of Blue-River township six years.
            He is a farmer, and engages in raising grain and stock for a livelihood. In 1875 he was
            married to his second wife, Mary R. Hadley. He has five children living, two of whom are
            married and settled in Blue-River township. He is interested in education, holding that
            it is largely a means of preventing crime and pauperism.
          In person Mr. H. is large, square built, dignified in bearing, with black hair, an
            expressive eye, of a bilious temperament, nearly six feet in height, and two hundred
            pounds in weight.
          Gilboa Church, M. E.—About the year 1830 a few persons, who had
            been members of the M. E. Church in other places, settled in the vicinity of Gilboa, and
            soon began holding religious meetings at private dwellings. Occasionally a preacher
            would come into the neighborhood, a runner would be sent out announcing the fact, and
            thus meetings were held until the year 1832, when the society had so increased in
            numbers and interest that they decided on building a church. James Sample and Benjamin
            Miller, who then owned the land now comprised in the grave-yard, offered to give a half
            acre each if the society would erect a church building thereon, which proposition was
            accepted, and a small log house, twenty by twenty-four feet, made of hewed popular logs,
            was erected about three rods east of the present grave-yard gate. It stood, as the
            present one does, with the end fronting the  road, and had
            a door in either side and a fire-place in each end, and had one twelve-light window,
            with panes eight by ten inches. The floor was made of slabs and the benches of split
            poles, with the splinter side up. This building, like other pioneer public buildings,
            was erected by voluntary labor, each contributing as his conscience dictated his duty.
            Rev. Amos Sparks was the first preacher in this building. Among the first members were
            James and Polly Sample, John Sample and wife, Elizabeth Wood, Sarah Sample, Polly Meek,
            Arthur Lewis and wife, Adam Allen and wife, Benjamin Miller and wife, Johnson McGinnis,
            James Lamay and wife and James and Margaret McGinnis. All the above, with the exception
            of Mother Sample, are with us no more, but have changed their membership from the church
            militant to the church triumphant. The first revival of any note was under the
            ministration of John B. Burk in 1841. The next revival was under the preaching of John
            T. McMullen in 1848-9. In the summer of 1852 the present house, a frame, thirty by
            fifty, was completed. The next and greatest revival in the history of the church was in
            186 or 1861, under the preaching of Rev. Layton. In the spring of 1871 the church was
            repaired, and the old box pulpit was replaced by one of more modern style, after which
            it was dedicated by Rev. Bowman, of Ohio, on the 13th day of August, 1871. The church is
            in a healthy, prosperous condition, with a membership of forty-five. In connection with
            this church is a large and prosperous Sunday-school, with an average attendance of
            forty-seven.
          John Wolf—Was of German parentage, born in Center county,
            Pennsylvania, September 29, 1813. He came to Indiana with his father's family in the
            fall of 1835, and settled in Wayne county. In the spring of 1840 he was married to
            Charity Commons, with whom he lived hapily till the date of his death. Soon after his
            marriage he, with his older brother, Henry Wolf, moved to Blue-River township, and
            purchased the Watts Mill, where the brothers carried on an extensive business, their
            customers coming  from fifteen to eighteen miles, and
            sometimes staying two or three days waiting their turn. In 1849 they began preparations
            for the erection of a new mill, which is now run by his son, as noted elsewhere. This is
            the only water flouring mill now in the county. John Wolf was a very 
            industrious, energetic man, and equally as successful in his business. No one labored
            more for the development and progress of the country. He was always ready with a helping
            hand for public improvements, and made his influence felt in religious, moral and
            educational matters. He was a consistent and exemplary member of the M. E. Church, and
            very strict in his religious duties. Owing to  exposure in
            building a dam he contracted typhoid pneumonia, from which he died February 21, 1854, in
            the prime of life.
          Robison Johns—Was born January 19, 1813, in Scott county,
            Kentucky, and at the age of four came with his parents to the New Purchase in October,
            1823, and settled in what is now Blue-River township, Hancock county, Indiana. Abram
            Johns, father of the subject of this sketch, had made a trip to the new site in March,
            and entered eighty acres at the land-office at Brookville, Franklin county. The Johns
            family, which were twelve in number, resided for a time in a bark shed, then in a pole
            cabin, eighteen by twenty, rude in its every part. Mr. Johns remembers well the building
            of the first school-house, in the fall of 1823, and the first teacher therein, Lewis
            Tyner, son of Solomon Tyner, who agreed to teach a short term, and take his pay in work
            on his father's farm. Light was admitted to the room through greased paper. Webster's
            blue-back speller was the chief book. Mr. Johns says at that date they went to Freeport
            for meal and Connersville for flour, being the nearest points at which they could be
            accommodated.
          The first death in the township was that of John Smith, who was killed at a cabin
              raising* by the falling of a
            log which had slipped from a skid in nearing the gable, from which he died that night,
            in March, 1824. Harmon Warrum, Thomas Phillips, Solomon Tyner, John Osborn, George
            Penwell and George Smith, the remaining settlers at that date; were part or all
            present.
          Abram and Elizabeth Johns, the father and mother of this sketch, died respectively in
            1834 and 1863, the latter at the ripe age of ninety-five. If any of our readers wish to
            spend an hour or two pleasantly with some of the oldest living residents of Hancock
            county, let them call on Robison or Wilson Johns.

          CHAPTER XXVI.
            SEQUEL TO BRANDYWINE TOWNSHIP.
          
            INTRODUCTORY.
            In the eastern part of Brandywine township settled James Smith, who built a mill on
              Brandywine creek, four miles south of Greenfield. This mill ground about two bushels
              of grain every twelve hours. He run it day and night, and furnished the meal for a
              large scope of country. If a customer came in the evening with a grist, it was put in
              the hopper, and he was told to come back next morning and get his grinding. The miller
              in the meantime went to bed and left the mill faithfully at work all night while he
              slept. Said Smith was a member of the Protestant Methodist Church, and gave the ground
              for the old Mt. Lebanon Church, besides giving more money than any other member. East
              of him, on what was called Hominy Ridge, lived old man Porter, father of the late
              Harry Porter. He started a tan-yard, which supplied the neighborhood with leather. His
              nearest neighbor was Mark Whitaker, a Justice of the Peace for a great many years.
              There also lived on the Ridge George Dillard, J. and Henry Duncan and William
              Marts.
            In the south part of the township settled John Arnett, who built the first
              still-house in the township. Soon after, John Trent built another distillery on an
              adjoining eighty acres, and at this place was made the last whisky ever manufactured
              in the township. John P. Banks was the pioneer preacher for the Christian Church.
              James Baker preached both for the Protestant Methodist and Christian Churches. The men
              used to meet to muster at James Gooding's, the place now occupied by John Richie. The
              first meeting-house was built at Mt. Lebanon, and was  a
              Protestant Methodist Church. The next was a Christian Church, built on the land of
              James Baker. Eleazar Snodgrass was the preacher in charge. Mr. Snodgrass did great
              good as a minister, and as the fruits of his labor there now stands a nice
              church-house, where congregate for worship Wellington Collyer, George Furry, John S.
              Thomas, Smith Hutchinson, Hiram Thomas, the Lows, and other prominent citizens of this
              township. The first school teachers were Peter Newhouse, Jackson Porter and William
              Whitaker. Jackson Porter was arrested and tried in the Hancock Circuit Court on a
              charge of murder for severely whipping one of his pupils one evening, from which he
              died on the following day. James Brown was the first colored man that ever lived in
              the township. He was a blacksmith by trade, and lived on the Harry Porter place.
          
          
            JOHN P. BANKS,
            now residing in Brandywine township, in his seventy-third year, moved from Boone
              county, and settled in Greenfield in 1830, and followed teaming for two years, hauling
              produce to Cincinnati and goods in return. He afterwards purchased a farm, and moved
              to Brandywine township, and engaged in agriculture, which business he has followed
              ever since. Mr. B. has been failing very rapidly for the past few years, yet we are
              still permitted to look into his honest face occasionally upon our streets. Mr. B. was
              a preacher in good standing for a number of years, and is ever recognized as an
              honest, conscientious man.
          
          
            EPHRAIM BENTLEY
            was born November 15, 1829, in Ripley township, Rush county, Indiana, where he
              received his early education, attending the Friends' school at Walnut Ridge. His
              father living on a farm, young Ephraim's time was occupied in working thereon, and
              aiding in the support of a  large family. Mr. B. was
              married September 26, 1855, to Pheriba Mundon, with whom he is still happily living.
              Mr. B. has spent most of his life farming, stock raising, and milling. For a time he
              run a saw-mill, and for ten years was the proprietor of what is now known as the
              Blue-River Flouring Mills. Mr. B. became a member of the I. O. O. F. in 1857, and is
              still an honored member thereof. In October, 1878, he was elected County Commissioner
              for the middle, or second, commissioner's district, which position he is still
              holding.
          
          
            JAMES TYNER
            was born in Aberville District, South Carolina, September 19, 1807. His father moved
              to Indiana Territory in 1808, and settled where Franklin county is now located. Here
              they resided until 1813, when they moved to the territory now embodied in Fayette
              county. In 1829 the subject of this sketch was married to Lucinda Caldwell, with whom
              he is still happily living. In 1835 Mr. T., with his small family, moved to Hancock
              county, and settled in the green woods in Brandywine township, cleared an extensive
              farm, on which he still resides, and is enjoying the fruits of his labors at this
              date. Although Mr. T. is now past his three-score and ten, he truthfully says what
              probably few can say at his age, that he never was under the necessity of having a
              doctor to attend him except through one "spell of sickness." Mr. T. is a member of the
              orthodox Baptist Church, known as Shiloh, a substantial Democrat, and has served a
              number of terms as County Commissioner of the second commissioner's district, being
              elected in 1849, 1861, 1866 and 1872. During his official life he was recognized as a
              safe custodian of the county's best interests.
          
          
            JOHN H. POPE
            was born in Brandywine township, July 11, 1852. He was the son of Elijah Pope, one of
              the early settlers in the township. His early education he received at the common  schools of his neighborhood, after which he took a course
              in the business college of Hannibal, Missouri, from which he graduated in 1873. Mr. P.
              traveled, taught school, and worked on the farm for a few years, when he was married,
              March 25, 1879, to Miss Almedia Moore, daughter of the late Roland Moore, of Green
              township, with whom he lived happily until the date of her death, which occurred
              February 2, 1880. Referring to his early life, his father died when he was but about
              four years of age, and, notwithstanding he was left without paternal care, he grew up
              an exemplary, modest, unassuming young man. After a short sickness, Mr. P. was called
              from works to rewards, January 26, 1882, leaving surviving him a mother and Coleman,
              an only brother, and his remains were followed by a large concourse of weeping friends
              to their last resting place, in Mt. Lebanon cemetery.
          
          
            JAMES ALYEA
            was born in New Jersey in 1797, moved to Hamilton county, Ohio, in 1812, thence to
              Hancock county in 1835, and entered land in Brandywine township, upon which he now
              resides. He is now in his eighty-fifth year, is a well-to-do farmer, a good citizen,
              and was one of the early blacksmiths in the township.
          
          
            HIRAM THOMAS
            was born in Knox county, Kentucky, in 1810. His parents moved to Franklin county,
              Indiana, in 1811. There he resided until eighteen years of age. He came with his
              parents to Hancock county in the year 1829, and settled on Little Sugar creek, three
              miles north of the Brookville road. His nearest neighbors were John Baker on the
              south, James Gooding on the east, and Joseph Bellis on the west. Hiram Thomas is the
              father of ex-Sheriff Thomas, as has been noticed elsewhere.
          
          
          
            GEORGE MUTH,
            now residing in Brandywine township, emigrated to this country from Europe in 1819,
              and located in Baltimore, where he engaged in the mercantile business for a time, and
              afterwards in manufacturing cloth, but not liking the latter business, he soon came to
              Indiana, and settled in Brandywine township, where he still resides. Here he began
              farming through the week and preaching on Sunday. Mr. M., as noted elsewhere, was the
              second preacher for the Albright Church, in Sugar-Creek township, and is still
              standing on the walls of Zion. He served as captain of a company in the late civil war
              at the advanced age of sixty-six years, and did his duty well, and was honorably
              discharged. About two years since a few remaining members of his company made him an
              agreeable surprise in the presentation of a gold-headed cane as a token of their high
              regard for his faithful services.
          
          
            WELLINGTON COLLYER
            was born in the State of Ohio in the year 1816, and can therefore compare ages with
              the State of Indiana, and lose nothing by such comparison. In 1836 he came to Hancock
              county, and entered land, on which he now resides. Mr. Collyer is a strict, exemplary
              member of the Christian Church, in good standing, and has given freely of his means
              for its support. He is a staunch Democrat from education and principle rather than
              policy. Though firm in his convictions of right, he is not dogmatic in his views, but
              accords to others what he reserves for himself, the privilege of independent
              thought.
            Mr. C. is one of our most industrious, pains-taking farmers, is in hearty sympathy
              with the poor and oppressed everywhere, and is one of the representative men of the
              township.
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XXVII.
            BIOGRAPHIES AND SKETCHES.
          
            NATHANIEL H. ROBERTS
            was born in East Virginia, September 30, 1818. When quite young he moved with his
              parents to West Virginia, and settled in Nicols county, where he resided until
              eighteen years of age, when he moved to Union, the county seat of Monroe county, and
              engaged as clerk in the general store of Carpenter & Alexander, in which he
              remained until 1845, at which time he became a partner. He was also the proprietor of
              an extensive tobacco manufactory until the late civil war. In 1852 he was married to
              Mary J. Campbell, who died in 1880. In 1869 he emigrated to Indiana, and settled in
              Hancock county, where he farmed for one year, after which he became proprietor of the
              Guymon House hotel of this city. In the spring of 1873 he was appointed Recorder of
              Hancock county. In 1874 he was elected Recorder, and re-elected in 1878, which
              position he filled till the date of his death, which occurred July 7, 1881. Mr. R. was
              a liberal, consistent member of the Presbyterian faith, having joined the church when
              but a boy, and also an honored member of the F. and A. M., according to the rites and
              ceremonies of which he was decently and respectfully interred in the new cemetery in
              Greenfield.
            "Colonel" R., as he was usually called, had been declining in health for sometime,
              and had therefore, like a wise man, arranged his business and set his house in order
              for the anticipated call, and, in order that his children might have a means of
              support, he had, a short time prior to his death, purchased and presented to Mary the
              only abstract of titles in the county.  Mr. R. was a
              very kind-hearted, accommodating man, who would suffer himself imposed upon rather
              than not seem courteous and obliging. In official life he was ever faithful and efficient, as the many neat and complete
              records of his own making are competent, unimpeached witnesses, ever ready to testify
              in his behalf.
          
          
            MRS. ELIZABETH BRADLEY, NEE GRAY,
            was born in Clermont county, Ohio, July 27, 1826. Her education was received at the
              common schools of her neighborhood. Being of a pious turn of mind, she joined the M.
              E. Church in July, 1842, at the early age of sixteen, and has since been an earnest,
              consistent and faithful member, always contributing liberally with her means and
              influence for the promotion of truth and the advancement of the church. At the age of
              eighteen she was married to Nelson Bradley, a poor but promising young man of her
              native county. In 1852 she came with her husband to McCordsville, and was there a
              useful member in society and one of the sisters in the church from whom many received
              counsel and encouragement. In 1866 she moved to Greenfield, where she has since
              resided. Mrs. Bradley having no children of her own, has kindly furnished a home,
              educated and given a mother's care to two orphan children. Mrs. B. is naturally of a
              charitable, philanthropic turn of mind, and, having the means at her command, has done
              much to alleviate the wants of the worthy poor of our city. She has been an earnest
              worker in the M. E. Sunday-school for a great many years, and has done much for its
              advancement by a liberal support thereof. She was President of the W. C. T. U. for two
              years.
          
          
            JOHN FOSTER
            was born in South Carolina in the year 1796. When quite young his parents moved to
              Tennessee, where he was reared. He emigrated to Indiana in 1816, and first located  at or near the present town of Bloomington. He was
              employed as an assistant to the Government surveyors for several years. He removed to
              Shelby county, near Wolf's Mill, in 1821. In 1824 he was married to Miss Aberilla
              Tyner. In the year 1829 he came to Hancock county, and settled in Greenfield. He
              afterward removed to the country, and engaged in farming, which occupation he followed
              until the time of his death, which occurred April 7, 1867.
            Mr. Foster filled many places of honor and trust in the county and State, among which
              were the following: He was the first Sheriff of the county, being elected in 1828 and
              1836. He represented the lower house in the Legislature in 1838 and 1851, and was
              Treasurer of the county in 1854.
            The portrait which we present of him on page 255 was cut from a daguerreotype taken
              while he was a member of the Legislature. He belonged to the Presbyterian Church in
              this city, and was one of the earliest members thereof.
          
          
            GEORGE L. KNOX,
            the son of a free mulatto woman and a colored Baptist preacher, was born September
              16, 1841, and, though legally born free, was held in bondage and treated as a slave
              until the taking effect of the emancipation proclamation, in 1863, when, by quietly
              leaving between two days, traveling at night and hiding in the bushes and under old
              houses in the day, he finally reached the land of freedom, arriving at Indianapolis in
              1864. At the age of four, young Knox was sold to one of the heirs of his master's
              estate for $300. Being a portly, promising "darkey," his new master was offered for
              him, at the age of sixteen, the neat sum of $1,600 in gold, cash down, but, being a
              kind of favorite in the family, the offer was promptly rejected. He worked on a farm
              until eighteen years of age, when he went to the town of Statesville, Wilson county,
              Tennessee, and engaged in shoemaking for two years, after which he entered the Union
              army for a year as a teamster.
            
            October 2, 1865, Mr. K. was married to Miss Arilla Harvey; of Marion county, with
              whom he is still living. He at once moved to Greenfield, and opened a barber shop in
              the Gooding Corner, where he is still holding forth.
            Mr. K. has been a faithful member of the A. M. E. Church for several years, and has
              contributed liberally for 
                CALVIN B. GILLIAM.
               its support. He became a Mason in 1868 and an Odd Fellow in 1879, is an
              enthusiastic Republican and a good citizen, honored and respected by all.
          
          
            CALVIN B. GILLIAM,
            the first colored teacher in Hancock county, was a Christmas present, in 1853, to
              Moody and Julia A. Gilliam, early settlers of Boone county. He attended a district
              school  for six months; was two terms in Union High
              School at Westfield, but the principal part of his education was received at
              Spiceland, Henry county. He contemplated entering Wilmington College, Ohio, but was
              not admitted on account of color. His early life was spent on a farm, and in the
              school room. In the spring of 1873 Mr. G. joined the Grangers, and was elected
              chaplain. In politics he is a Republican, and though not a member of any religious
              denomination, he leans toward the Methodists. Mr. G. is a modest young man, and is
              well liked as a teacher by his pupils and patrons, with whose interest he seems fully
              identified.
          
          
            HON. THOMAS D. WALPOLE,
            was born in Zanesville, Ohio, March 20, 1816, and removed with his parents to
              Indianapolis in 1822. There his boyhood days were passed and his early education
              received. In 1834 he settled at Greenfield, Hancock county, and soon entered upon an
              entensive and profitable practice. At that time he was a Whig in politics. Young,
              talented and ardent and a partisan in temperament, he entered zealously into the
              political discussions of the day. In 1836 he was elected to the Legislature when
              barely of the requisite age, and he was also a member of the twenty-second session,
              which convened in the year 1837. In the excited canvass of 1840 he took an active
              part, and was elected to the Senate from the district composed of the counties of
              Hancock and Madison; in the twenty-sixth session, 1841-2, the twenty-seventh session,
              1842-3, and the twenty-eighth session, 1843-4. In the twenty-seventh session, Hon.
              Samuel Hall, who had been elected Lieutenant Governor, having resigned, Mr. Walpole
              was elected President of the Senate, and filled the position with dignity and
              impartiality during that and the subsequent session. Mr. Walpole was also elected to
              the Senate in 1847, and served in 1848, 1849 and 1850 in the thirty-second,
              thirty-third and thirty-fourth sessions of the General Assembly.  In 1848 he was Presidential Elector, and canvassed the eastern part of the
              State for Taylor and Fillmore. In 1850 he was elected to the Constitutional Convention
              from his Senatorial district from the counties of Hancock and Madison. He was a
              statesman as well as a politician, and thoroughly understood our theory of government.
              Although a member of the Whig party, he was watchful of the rights of the people, and
              any attempt to circumscribe the liberty of the citizens was sure to rouse to fierce
              invective the fiery eloquence which burned on his lips. He was an active, influential
              member of the convention, and left his impress upon its proceedings.
            In 1852 Mr. Walpole joined the Democratic party, and entered zealously into the
              canvass for Franklin Pierce. He bitterly opposed the Know-Nothing party, and labored
              as earnestly to uphold the Democratic banner as he had formerly done to sustain the
              measures advocated by Clay and Webster and other great lights of the old Whig party.
              Mr. Walpole afterward represented Hancock county in the lower branch of the
              Legislature, being in the thirty-eighth session in 1855 and in the thirty-ninth
              session in 1857. The people demanded his services, for as a legislator he was watchful
              and careful of their interests, and he really accepted the trust and honor at a
              pecuniary sacrifice.
            Mr. Walpole was never defeated in his county. Men of all parties acknowledged his
              worth and integrity as a legislator, and, whether as a Whig or Democrat, he received
              the suffrage of the people among whom he lived whenever his name was presented.
            As a lawyer Mr. Walpole stood high in his profession. He was quick and clear in his
              perceptions, fertile in resources and ingenious in his management of points in his
              case. As an advocate before a jury he was very successful. His knowledge of human
              nature enabled him to read his auditory at a glance, and few could withstand the charm
              of his eloquent periods.
            In November, 1840, Mr. Walpole was married to Miss Esther Bryan, of Centerville,
              Wayne county, Indiana. In  1860 he removed with his
              family to Indianapolis, where he continued in the active practice of his profession up
              to his death, in October, 1863. He left a wife and four children, two sons and two
              daughters.
          
          
            DR. N. P. HOWARD, JR.,
            youngest son of Dr. N. P. Howard, Sr., was born in Greenfield, February 6, 1856. His
              early literary education was received at the Greenfield public schools, after 
                DR. N. P. HOWARD, JR.
               which he was a student of Asbury University for a considerable time, during
              all of which training he had in view the medical profession, and on leaving college at
              once entered the office of the well-known medical firm of Howard & Martin, where
              he took a course of reading preparatory to a course of lectures in a medical college
              of Indiana, from which he graduated in 1879, soon after which he was married to Miss
              Elizabeth E., youngest daughter of John W. Ryon, of Greenfield, and at once began the
              practice of medicine, forming a partnership with his preceptors, and is now the junior
              member of the firm of Howard, Martin & Howard. He was recently appointed  Secretary of the County Board of Health, and entered at
              once upon his duties. Probably no young physician of the county ever entered upon the
              practice under more favorable circumstances and auspicious surroundings.
          
          
            HENRY WRIGHT,
            son of Joseph Wright, was born in Buck-Creek township, Hancock county, Ind., November
              28, 1838. His education was principally received at the public schools of his
              neigborhood, attending one term at Oakland Graded School, after which he began
              teaching, and followed this occupation through twenty terms. He was deputy Auditor
              under Hon. A. C. Handy for a time. In October, 1875, he was elected Auditor of Hancock
              county, and entered upon his official duties November 2, 1876. In October, 1879, he
              was re-elected, and entered upon his second term November 2, 1880. He was married
              March 13, 1877, to Miss Dora E. Davis, a native of Kentucky. Mr. W. has been a member
              of the orders of Red Men, Patrons of Husbandry and Workingmen, and has been an honored
              member of the Masonic order since 1860. Mr. W., through his official life, has been a
              kind and accommodating officer.
          
          
            JAMES A. NEW
            was born in Hancock county, Indiana, on the 18th day of October, 1850. His early
              education was received at the common district schools, attending in the winter and
              working on the farm in the summer. His father, William New, one of the county's
              industrious farmers, endeavored to teach his children that farming and manual labor
              were the prerequisites to success; but "Jim," being of a different
              opinion, early began to prepare himself for his chosen course in life. His last days
              as a pupil in the country schools were spent under the tutorage of the writer. Here he
              was fitted for college, having completed the common branches, algebra, geometry,
              trigonometry, philosophy, and other branches of equal grade. At the age of sixteen  he entered Bainbridge Academy, in Putnam county, Indiana,
              for one year, and the following year entered Asbury University, at Greencastle,
              Indiana, where he continued his studies for a similar time, when he was compelled, on
              account of failing health, to take a year's rest, after which he entered the State
              University at Bloomington, Indiana, where he finished his collegiate studies in the
              year 1872. Mr. New had early in life formed the desire of becoming a lawyer, and, much
              against the wishes of his parents, began study with that view. After the close of his
              college training, he entered the law office of Hamilton J. Dunbar. Here he made rapid
              progress, and on the 1st day of June, 1873, was admitted to the bar of the Hancock
              Circuit Court, and began the practice as a partner of his preceptor, and continued as
              such until the 5th of September, 1876, the date of Mr. Dunbar's death. In 1869 Mr. New
              was elected County Examiner for this county, and discharged the duties of said office
              with credit to himself and honor to the people. Feeling that his professional duties
              needed his entire attention, he declined to become a candidate for a second term, and
              has since been wholly engaged in the law.
            On the 8th day of November, 1876, Mr. New was married to Miss Emma Swope, of this
              city, the fruits of which union are two sprightly children—a boy and a girl. Mr.
              N. is a member of the M. E. Church, and contributes liberally to the support thereof.
              He has been a life-long Democrat, though never aspiring to office, believing that law
              and politics cannot be successfully wedded. He has an excellent library, stands high
              in the profession, and is recognized as an able debater and a tenacious opponent. He
              is a genial gentleman, always ready for a good joke and a hearty laugh, and by
              industry and close application has achieved a handsome competence.
          
          
            JOHN E. DYE
            dates his earthly journeyings on terra firma from June 25, 1845,
              Sugar-Creek township, this county. He is a son of  the
              late John Dye, who came to Indiana in 1809 from Kentucky, where he was born in 1803.
              He came to Wayne county in 1836, where he resided for a short time; thence to
              Sugar-Creek township, his future home to the date of his death. John E. received a
              fair English education at home and at Knightstown. He taught two terms of school in
              Sugar-Creek and Buck-Creek townships, and was five years in the drug store at
              Philadelphia, Indiana, terminating in 1877. He was married in IS864 to Miss Henrietta,
              daughter of Dr. M. M. VanLaningham. He is a 
                WM. WRIGHT
               farmer, a staunch Democrat, and a social gentleman. In person, he is of a
              bilious temperament, dark hair and eyes, six feet two inches in height, and one
              hundred and eighty-five pounds in weight. Mr. D. was elected Commissioner of the Third
              Commissioner's District in 1886, which position he is still holding.
          
          
            WILLIAM M. WRIGHT,
            youngest son of Joseph and Elizabeth Wright, was born June 19, 1850; attended the
              common schools of the district three months in the year, until he began teaching in
              1871, which he followed during the winter season for eight  or nine terms, mostly in his native township. He was married April 20,
              1873, to Miss Mary C., daughter of Hamilton Welling, of Buck-Creek township. He was
              elected Trustee of Buck-Creek township in 1876, and re-elected in 1878. He is an
              honored member of the F. and A. M.; was appointed Deputy Auditor in 1880, which
              position he still holds. Mr. W. is a young man, a good Democrat and an affable
              gentleman.
          
          
            DR. SAMUEL M. MARTIN,
            son of Dr. William H. Martin, of Rush county, was born in Rushville, Indiana, March
              7, 1842. His father being a physician and literary man, and at one time, as previously
              stated, Secretary of the Board of Examiners of the Indiana Medical Institute,
              endeavored to give his children favorable opportunities for an education. Young Martin
              early espoused the idea of following in his father's footsteps, and embracing the
              medical profession, but while in the midst of his study of medics, the thrilling
              accounts of the civil war enthused his mind, fired his patriotism, and carried him to
              the scene of carnage, where he remained until discharged for a gun-shot wound through
              the left side of the body, at the battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, March 1, 1862. He now
              turned his thoughts in his chosen channel, and had the honor, in 1865, of graduating
              in the Cincinnnati College of Physicians and Surgeons. The following year he was
              married to Miss Florence F., only daughter of Dr. N. P. Howard, with whom he formed a
              partnership, and at once entered upon the practice of his chosen profession.
            Dr. M., though scarcely in the prime of life, stands high in the profession; has a
              lucrative practice, and is much of a gentleman.
          
          
            MISS MARY N. ROBERTS,
            a native of West Virginia, and daughter of the late Nathaniel H. Roberts, came to
              this city with her parents in  1869, where she received
              a common school education. She learned readily, and in 1876 entered the County
              Recorder's office as deputy under her father, where she has since been employed. On
              the death of her father, by unanimous consent, it was agreed that she should have the
              emoluments of the office for the unexpired term, and at a public meeting of citizens
              of the county a non-partisan committee was appointed, who agreed on John Ryon as 
                MISS MAY ROBERTS
               nominally Recorder, in whose name she should act. In addition to her work as
              deputy, she has devoted much of her time in furnishing abstracts of titles, in all of
              which duties she has ever been recognized as accommodating, faithful and
              efficient.
          
          
            AMOS C. BEESON
            was born in Randolph county, Indiana, July 29, 1842; moved to Blue-River township,
              Hancock county, Indiana, October, 1856, and remained on the farm with his father until
              1861, when he became an apprentice in the office of The Hancock
                Democrat. He remained there one year, when he enlisted as a private soldier in
              Company G, 79th Regiment of Indiana Volunteer Infantry. He served with his regiment,
              participating in the battles of Chicamauga,  Lookout
              Mountain, Knoxville, the East Tennessee campaign, Tunnel Hill, Dalton, Resaca,
              Cassville, Lost Mountain, and Kenesaw Mountain, being so severely wounded in the
              latter, June 23, 1864, that he was discharged February 5, 1865. In March, 1865, he was
              appointed Deputy Recorder of Hancock county, and elected Recorder in 1865, being the
              only Republican ever elected to that position. He resigned August 1, 1879, having
              purchased an interest in the Winchester Journal, one of the oldest
              and leading local papers in Eastern Indiana, of which paper he is still the editor and
              sole proprietor. In March, 1881, he was elected, by the Legislature of Indiana, as one
              of the Directors of the Prison North, and on the organization of the Board of
              Directors was elected its President, which position he still holds. Was married in
              1867 to Miss Maggie Marsh, of Blue-River township, and his family consists of two
              little boys, Masters Willie and Charlie.
          
          
            COLORED M. E. CHURCH
            was organized about 1874 in the upper story of the frame building on North State
              street, opposite Morgan's livery stable, by Rev. J. H. James. The first members were
              G. L. Knox, Jane and Martha Hunt, Eliza Brazelton, Daniel Jenkins et
                al. Their next meetings were held in the new room of the two-story frame
              building on South State street, owned by L. W. Gooding. Thence to the present place of

            A BIT OF SCHOOL HISTORY.
            It was in the summer of 1874 that New Palestine, a place then noted for "running out"
              teachers before their terms had expired, in selecting a principal for the coming year,
              decided to make a change and elect a lady for the position, the like of which had
              never been done in that place. As the result of their choice they decided on Mattie J.
              Binford, a graduate of Earlham College, who had served as principal at Walnut Ridge,
              Rush county, the preceding year, with such success that they would have raised her
              wages considerably rather than to have lost her services. There were some of the
              employers at New Palestine prejudiced from the beginning. They said no lady could govern their boys. The new principal knew but very little of the
              circumstances until she was engaged. Then she was determined there should be no
              "backing out" on her part, but that she would strive to do them all the good in her
              power. With these pure motives she began her school, a term of a little over six
              months. She visited the school-house two or three days before school was to open in
              order to get fully ready. The walls had been newly whitewashed, the floor scrubbed,
              and the stoves blackened; so when the new eight-day clock, several pictures, mottoes,
              surrounded by wreaths of evergreen and corner bouquets, all had suitable positions on
              the walls,  the room looked real cozy. Several visitors
              were present at the opening, and expressed themselves as well pleased with the rules
              and regulations given by the principal. School progressed finely, and all seemed to
              work with a will. Quite a large number visted the school, especially on Friday
              afternoons, when there were literary exercises, and they nearly always expressed
              themselves in the Visitor's Record as well pleased. Still there was opposition, and
              fault-finders were not scarce. They said there was no sense in her trying to keep the
              house so neat, that the "big boys" might as well spit on the floor all they wished,
              that so many ornaments in a school-room was a useless expenditure of money (just as
              though the teacher had not borne all the expense), and that she had so many new methods of instruction, &c. However, things moved along until
              after the holidays without more than has been mentioned. Two weeks of holidays were
              granted, and when the principal returned to her duties she treated the school on
              candy, raisins and wedding cake as a token of her good will to all; but it was not
              many weeks until it was manifest that trouble was brewing. The first case occurred one
              morning not long after the opening exercises, when a tall young man, whom the
              principal had temporarily suspended the preceding day for positively refusing to do as
              she bade him, came at her with clenched fist, and threatened to knock her brains out.
              Doubtless he thought that he could scare her out of the room, but he was mistaken this
              time. She said not a word, but stood her ground. He soon quieted down and took his
              seat. It was not many minutes until the trustee came in, and she informed him of her
              trouble. He ordered this pupil to take his books at once and go home, but instead of
              obeying he came at the trustee with a large iron poker. The latter swerved not an
              inch, however he was not struck. At recess the teacher and trustee stepped over to the
              'Squire's office, and the former filed an affidavit against this young man for abusing
              her in the presence of her school, &c. Accordingly he was fined near twenty
              dollars.
            
            In the afternoon of the same day the school was very unexpectedly visited by the
              mother of one of the pupils, a little boy about seven years of age. The teacher had
              been obliged to correct this pupil, so his little sister slipped home at recess and
              informed his mother of it. So in a few minutes, while a class was on the floor
              reciting, in she came, quite a large woman, shaking her fists at the principal, and
              bemeaning her before the school. When asked by the teacher to take a seat and be
              quiet, she heeded not, but said she had as much right in there as she had. On being
              told that there was a section in the school law forbidding such conduct, she said she
              was not afraid of the school law, of the teacher, or of all Palestine. She even
              assumed authority, and went to changing her children's seats to suit herself. The
              teacher seeing no other alternative to rid the school from the annoyance, asked one of
              the grown pupils to take charge, and stepped over to the 'Squire's office for
              assistance, as the director would not act in former cases; but before she got back
              this woman was out and gone. The teacher at once changed her children's seats as they
              were before her visit, and recitation went on as usual until the common time for
              closing.
            After school, the teacher, seeing that her school would be broken up if such an
              offense should go unpunished, went again to the 'Squire's office, and laid in
              complaint against this woman for visiting the school with the avowed purpose of
              insulting and upbraiding her in the presence of her pupils. A lawyer was employed on
              each side, and a jury called. The verdict rendered was against this woman, and of
              course she was thrown into the costs. A dear visit it proved to her. Then she and her
              husband had the principal arrested for "assault and battery," but the verdict rendered
              was not guilty. The people of that district then saw that a teacher
              had some rights which they were bound to respect, and they have had good schools there
              ever since. The principal taught her term out, and also taught a subscription term of
              two months. The next year she had the opportunity of teaching grammar and geography
                 at Earlham College, and has been engaged in teaching
              in other places every year since, until one year ago last August she accepted a school
              of one scholar, viz: Clarkson Elliott, of Fountain City, Wayne county, and is now
              located eight miles north of Richmond.
          
          
            WILLIAM H. THOMPSON,
            Sheriff of Hancock county, was born in Hamilton county, Ohio, April 14, 1842. His
              early education was received in his native State, after which he attended the common
              schools of Indiana for a time, and was six months in the graded schools of Lafayette.
              At the age of eighteen he removed with his parents to Brandywine township, this
              county, where he resided until his appointment as deputy Sheriff under William Thomas,
              in 1875, which position he filled for two terms. In 1878 he was elected Sheriff of the
              county and re-elected in 1880.
            Mr. T.'s parents were at one time in good financial circumstances, but lost their all
              by indorsement. Thus early in life he was thrown upon his own resources and brought
              face to face with the stern realities of life, and, aside from supporting himself, he
              was ever ready to lend a helping hand to his parents in their declining years. His
              father died in 1876 and his mother in 1878. May 8, 1881, he was married to Miss
              Malinda E., daughter of the late Robert Smith, of Brandywine township. As an officer,
              Mr. Thompson is recognized as impartial, faithful and efficient.
          
          
            HON. JOSEPH CHAPMAN,
            one of the most prominent men in the early history of Hancock county, who had filled
              the various positions of farmer, county officer, legislator and soldier, died in the
              service of his country April 3, 1848, in Mexico, at the age of fifty-seven. He was a
              native of the Buckeye State, lived for a number of years in Rush county, and came to
              Hancock county in 1829. He was twice married, first to 
              Miss Jane Curry, by whom he had six children; the second time to Miss Matilda Agnes,
              by whom he had five children. His first wife was buried in the old cemetery in
              Greenfield.
            Mr. Chapman was elected Clerk of the county in 1832, and represented the county in
              the lower house of the Legislature in 1837, 1839, 1841, 1842 and 1843. In person he
              was square built, dark hair and eyes, of a bilious temperament, medium in height, and
              about one hundred and seventy pounds in weight. In politics he was a Democrat, and was
              often pitted against Thomas D. Walpole, a prominent Whig at that date. He was a member
              of the Methodist Church, and died in the faith.
            We give below a letter written by Mr. C. while in Mexico, which is of interest as
              showing the style and character of its author: 
                
                  
                    JALAPA, MEXICO,
                        December 3, 1847.
                      MY DEAR WIFE
                          AND CHILDREN:
                    Again I am placed in my tent, very tired, but cheerful and happy as ever I
                      was in my life, and I suppose that I need not say that I hope that these few
                      lines may find you enjoying the same state of health, as I do think you will
                      be ready to acknowledge and believe that my very soul has always been wrapped
                      up in the love of my family.
                    We have traveled six hard days' march towards the City of Mexico, and will
                      have some ten or twelve more before we get there, as it is very laborious
                      moving a large army. The whole country through which we have passed is hilly,
                      mountainous and rocky, but looks romantic, and in some places very pretty, as
                      the trees are now covered with blossoms, but there is but little fruit. There
                      is but little danger here, or indeed do I think there is but little danger any
                      place in this country, as we can hear of no army any place in the government.
                      There are a few guerrillas along the road, but dare not appear or show fight.
                      I saw one who had just been killed, and some of the boys say that they saw six
                      or eight more. I was out hunting and saw a few black fellows, but they run
                      like devils, and I got no shot. There was but two of us, A. Pauley and myself,
                      but it appears as though one can chase a dozen. There is still no immediate
                      prospect of peace.
                    
                    On the ascent from Vera Cruz to Mexico the climates succeed each other as it
                      were by stories; and in our travel we have passed through every variety of
                      vegetation. The tropical plants are succeeded by the oak, and the salubrious
                      air of Jalapa replaces the deadly air of Vera Cruz. The sky is generally
                      cloudless, and but very little rain, and a succession of hills, seemingly at
                      some day the boundary of lakes, are now the limits of extensive plains or
                      rolling prairies, but the rocks or stones all very near the surface. The
                      country is barren because it is very dry and stony, but every stream is
                      accompanied with some fertile land. The snow is in sight on the mountains, and
                      contributes much to cool the air now, as it is cloudy; and it is said to be
                      the coldest day ever experienced in this country. It would be called cold in
                      our country in May. The coffee bush grows here. The berries are now ripe, and
                      is a small red berry, very juicy, and as poisonous as can be.
                    The timber is low and crooked. I have seen no tree in the country that would
                      have made a rail cut. Everything, weed, bush and tree, except the scrubby oak
                      and orange bush and coffee bush, has thorns on. The thorns resemble the thorn
                      on the honey locust, but they are more crooked, and as thick as they can grow
                      from top to bottom, leaf and all.
                    JOSEPH CHAPMAN.
                  
                
              
          
          
            ROBERT SMITH
            was born near Abbington, Virginia, January 26, 1808. In 1818 he moved with his
              parents to Indiana, first settling in Clark county, afterwards in Rush, and in about
              1830 came to Hancock, entering the farm on which he lived and now owned by the family.
              With his own hands he cleared away the dense forests, the home of the deer, wild
              turkey, and wild hog that at that early day could be found on almost every farm in our
              county. His father coming with him to this county, entered land, and was one of the
              early pioneers of the county, and served at one time as County Commissioner.
            Mr. Smith's opportunities for acquiring an education were limited, as school-houses
              were then few and terms of school short, yet he was ever a firm friend of schools, and
                 always sought to give his children "a better bringing
              up than he had had," and he lived to see most of them receive a good education. He was
              married March 9, 1840, to Mary Power, with whom he lived pleasantly until his death,
              which occurred July 22, 1877, at his residence.
            Mrs. Smith, his widow, still lives, and is enjoying fair health. Her teachings and
              her Christian example had much to do in directing both husband and children in the
              right way, and to that mother is due, in a large degree at least, the present standing
              of her children in society.
            Mr. Smith in politics was a Democrat and in religion a Methodist. In Mt. Lebanon
              Cemetery a suitable monument is found marking the last resting place of Mr. S., a
              devoted Christian and a good citizen.
          
          
            CEMETERIES OF THE COUNTY.
            It has been said: "The past has taught its lesson, the present has its duty, and the
              future its hope."
            We often hear of the sad and neglected condition of the cemeteries of the different
              sections of our country, but nowhere could this painful fact be illustrated better and
              in all its most repelling features than in this county, the home of intelligent,
              liberty-loving American people. I need not say, as Anthony said, "Ye who have tears
              prepare to shed them now," but you who have yourselves seen the shameful condition in
              which the last resting places of friends who are loved by you, can you not but reflect
              a moment and say to yourself, this must be changed. I must pay more respect to those
              who were near and dear to me. When you pass along and behold the fences decaying,
              rotten and falling down; when you see the bushes and briers which are covering the
              graves; when you see the beasts of the field treading unmercifully through the
              inclosure; when you see what were once tombstones broken and scattered into fragments
              upon the ground, can you feel anything but a shudder come over you, and that you have
              not done your duty or shown any more respect to dear departed kindred  than you would show to the beasts of the field and the
              fowls of the air?
            Our cemeteries, like our office-seekers, are too numerous, and some must be
              neglected. One of the worst features in the case is the many private burial grounds.
              What think you, dear husband, of burying your wife where the cows and sheep will be
              pastured in years to come? What think you, noble, kind-hearted mother, of burying your
              dear children where the plow will hereafter turn up the soil from over their heads,
              and leave nothing to show where was their resting place? Yet this is done, and has
              been done frequently, in our county. Everything must change, and lands must change
              owners. Do you think that a man, knowing nothing of the parties buried on his place,
              no difference how near and dear they may be to others, will show them any respect? He
              will not, and he will not hesitate to desecrate them. Then, my dear friends, as the
              past has taught its lesson, profit by it; as the present has its duty, come forward
              and do it. You are not all expected to erect monuments, but lessen the number of your
              cemeteries, and give what few that remain more attention. Think that if you were
              there, would it not be better to show some mark of attention and respect. "We are all
              swiftly gliding down the stream of time, and the places which now know us will know us
              no more, but our bodies will be consigned to similar abodes to those of dear friends
              who have passed before."
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XXVIII.
            GENERAL TOPICS.
          
            PROGRESS OF OUR SCHOOLS.
            Among the things most noteworthy which distinguish modern from ancient civilization
              is the progress which all classes have made in regard to education. Our intelligent
              and energetic forefathers early saw that a system of education must be established to
              protect freedom, to create enterprise and to establish institutions, of which the
              world may well feel proud, but we must observe that the progress has been slow, and we
              notice as it has passed along it has gained a steadfast footing at every step.
            In Hancock county the first school-house was erected in 1823 in Blue-River township.
              A similar building was established in Greenfield in 1824. School buildings were
              erected in Jackson, Sugar Creek and Harrison (now Center) in 1830, and in 1836 in
              Green and Brown, and in Vernon a little later. And what kind of buildings do you think
              they were? Structures which, in dimensions, were sometimes twenty feet square,
              constructed of logs and poles, cracks daubed with mud, but not excluding the cutting
              blasts of wind; a fire-place of huge dimensions occupied a prominent position, which
              admitted logs that required the muscular power of the large boys to be brought into
              action; desks without backs, and seats made out of split saplings, which ever now and
              then precipitated the occupants to the floor, to the delight of the rest of the
              school; oiled paper for lights and a puncheon floor. Two pins over the teacher's desk
              held the only needful apparatus (at least so they thought at that time) to make a good
              school. The supply of switches was always abundant,  and
              the master improved every opportunity to use them. The saying was, "Spare the rod and
              you spoil the child."
            The schools were then organized by subscription, lasting through a period of thirteen
              weeks, the teacher receiving $25 or $30 for the term. Then the light of science had
              not dawned upon the people, and school was held from early in the morning until late
              in the evening, allowing five minutes in the morning and evening for recess and one
              hour at noon. Oh, how these energetic "lads and lasses" longed to breathe the fresh
              and pure air without such a dilapidated inclosure. Think of the idea of sitting on
              backless poles for ten hours a day.
            The men who came forward to instruct and cultivate the minds of the rising generatien
              were not always men of culture themselves, coming from England, Ireland and other
              countries and engaging in the profession until they could find a more suitable
              calling. Then another class of unsuccessful business men came forward to instruct the
              most brilliant minds in our country. How could it be possible to have a competent
              corps of teachers when the examinations and qualifications was a matter of minor
              importance, the great requisite being the ability to use the "rod" unsparingly on all
              occasions. But we can not but admire their feeling in regard to morality; strict in
              morals and of unquestionable integrity, spurning an insult, and not afraid to stand by
              what they considered their rights and privileges. Frequent fights on this account
              often occurred, and it was hard to tell who was the innocent party.
            "Loud schools" were held throughout the country, and it would be interesting to hear
              a school preparing their lessons; and this plan, although having its defects, probably
              had some advantages. Examine their methods of instruction, teaching what they called
              the three R's, "Readin', Ritin' and Rithmetic," giving very little instruction on any
              branch, but allowing their pupils to use their own energy if they desired to succeed.
              Books of all kinds and in every condition were used, and classes were  numerous and very small until 1857, when all were
              required to obtain a certain class of books suitable for their instruction, and they
              were ready to engage in a more methodical and orderly way of learning, and it has
              truly been said that "Order is the first law of God."
            Our county seminary was established in 1842 at Greenfield, and continued to flourish
              until 1852, when the law effecting all similar buildings was passed and abolished the
              institution.
            The public policy of our nation has always been for the advancement of the interest
              of her people, and in this she has been followed by the States. Virginia, although she
              has probably in after times made blunders, came nobly and majestically to the front
              and donated to the General Government the vast domain of which our State is a part.
              The people of Indiana should ever feel grateful to Virginia for her unexcelled
              patriotism and devotion. The ordinance made in regard to this vast domain, in 1787,
              showed on its face that this section was destined to have a happy and glorious triumph
              in the future; for in the third article it was declared that "Religion, morality and
              knowledge being necessary to the good government and happiness of mankind, schools and
              the means of education shall forever be encouraged." Section sixteen in each
              Congressional township was reserved for school purposes, and this has assisted greatly
              in establishing our grand school fund.
            In 1816 superintendents were appointed to lease the lands, but not for more than
              seven years. In 1824 a new law took effect, and established three trustees to look
              after the educational interests of each township. In 1836 the county school
              commissioner was created, and in 1843 the State Treasurer performed the duty of
              Superintendent of Public Instruction, but how different were their powers from what
              they are at present. Like the articles of confederation, a great many things might be
              suggested, but very few enforced.
            Up to this time very little had been done in the way of advancing education. Now a
              new light seemed to appear  before the minds of a
              portion of our honored citizens. The schools had mostly been carried on by private
              means, and in a rude manner. The system of free schools was beginning to be discussed,
              but public sentiment seemed to be against it. The people had not yet been brought up
              to view education in its proper light. The voters of Hancock county, in convention,
              advanced fearlessly to the front and denounced a system of free schools, with all of
              its proposed advantages, yet it had its supporters, and in 1852 the law establishing
              the free schools triumphed over its foes, and soon won most of them to its support.
              How great the progress in education. Schools and colleges were established and
              comfortable buildings supplied the places of the worthless and neglected log pens.
            In 1852 the Superintendent of Public Instruction and State Board were established. In
              1865 teachers' institutes were established in all the counties of Indiana, and at the
              same time the State Normal at Terre Haute. Both of these have been of great advantage
              to our teachers. Previous to this time, in 1834, our State University was established
              at Bloomington. Thus we have the advantage of learning in all its branches of
              knowledge. In 1873 the county superintendency was established, and at the same time
              the county board and township institute, all of which tend to better prepare the
              educators of our county.
            Our common school fund, which exceeds that of any other State by $2,000,000, is from
              the following sources: Congressional township fund, which, as has already been
              described, from the sale of lands; the bank tax fund, said bank being established in
              1834. Twelve and one-half cents was deducted from the dividends of each share of
              stock, to be set apart for the school fund, amounting to $80,000. During Jackson's
              administration all debts were paid, and left a large surplus in the treasury, which
              was distributed among the several States, Indiana's portion being $860,254. Our
              Legislature set apart from this amount $573,502.96 for school purposes. This is known
              as the Surplus Revenue. At the same time that the bank 
              was established, in 1834, the act also provided that after the indebtedness, principal
              and interest, had been paid, the remainder, to the amount of $5,000,000, passed into
              our school revenue. This is known as the Sinking Fund. The Saline Fund, arising from
              the sale of the lands in salt districts, not exceeding thirty-six sections, obtaining
              for educational purposes $85,000. Deriving also from the sale of swamp lands, which
              were not otherwise set apart by our Government, what is known as the Swamp Land Fund.
              In 1852 all of our county seminaries were disposed of, and the remainder, after
              deducting expenses, is known as the Seminary Fund. Then last we have our Contingent
              Fund, under which we have the fines of courts, forfeitures, escheats, &c. These
              immediately increased the school fund of the noble State of Indiana, of which Hancock
              is a part, and whose people are directly benefited thereby. These several funds
              swelled our school revenue to the sum of $9,000,000, which may be increased, but never
              diminished.
            Now, my dear readers, let us for a moment look at the condition of things to-day as
              compared with the schools of thirty years ago, when our present school system was
              established. Pass through our townships and you will see substantial buildings instead
              of mere huts. In those buildings you will find competent and energetic men and women,
              for women are now standing side by side with men in the profession, and indeed
              surpassing him in many cases, a thing supposed to be impossible thirty years ago, for
              then within that structure of learning must be kept a vast amount of "beech tea,"
              which was issued in liberal doses to the applicants, the quantity being beyond the
              intellect or judgment of woman to determine. Now we have comfortable seats and desks;
              not split poles. Then we were able to have a goose-quill pen; now the skill of man
              presents us with a better and more useful instrument. Then our only apparatus was the
              rod; now we have suitable maps, charts, globes, &c., for the explanation of things
              necessary for every boy and girl in our land. Now teaching is a 
                JOHN POPE.
              
              profession, and the man deserving honor receives it. Our
              teachers thirty years ago were few in numbers, and their literary attainments were
              very questionable; now they are numerous, and some of them educated men. School
              buildings are now within a convenient distance of every child in the State; then our
              children walked two or three miles, through sleet and snow, rain and mud, to attend a
              school, where they scarcely received any instruction. Then we had but a handful of
              children; now we have a grand army of nearly a million young warriors, ready to engage
              in the great battle with ignorance and superstition. Now a uniform system of grading
              and examination exists, and many applicants fail in passing through the trying ordeal;
              then the answer to one or two simple questions was all that was required to qualify a
              man to give instruction. Our progress in this respect has been so great that it is
              almost beyond our power of comprehension, and still we are advancing, and will
              continue to advance in time to come, until the American people will lead the world in
              the number and importance of her institutions, in religion, morality and
              education.
          
          
            GROWTH AND EARLY INCIDENTS.
            In going back to our early history it almost seems as if it would be impossible to
              have made such progress and now to rank among the leading counties of Indiana. Go back
              to sixty years ago and you will find a wilderness, a dense forest of undergrowth so
              thick that it was almost impossible for man to pierce, water covering a great portion
              of our now fertile and productive soil. See the pioneer wading and struggling to find
              his way through the depths of the forest, surrounded on all sides by the savage red
              men, who were ever eager to take his scalp or destroy his property. We who live in the
              midst of civilized life, surrounded by everything which man could desire, can it be
              possible for us to imagine their sufferings, their privations and trials, the Indians
              harassing their journey at every  step, some of our
              noble forefathers falling by the tomahawk of the merciless savages and enduring every
              privation. When we think of their hardships we must feel a thrill of admiration run
              through our veins for their heroism, a sincere regard for their patriotism and a
              feeling of sympathy for their suffering. Those who were successful in passing through
              the many privations now began the construction of their rude cabins, not palatial
              residences, where wealth was exhibited in any of its forms, but just something to
              protect the brave pioneer from the howling winds and storms, the fierce animals which
              were prowling in the forest, and the treachery of the original inhabitant of this now
              glorious country, "the home of the brave and the land of the free." Examine his
              household utensils and you will find nothing but a rude bed, pots, skillet and some
              minor things of less importance. What a contrast with the present, when we have
              everything that art and skill can invent. They were men of energy and determination,
              having very little to subsist upon but hominy and the meat of wild beasts, going
              twenty and thirty miles to get their corn or wheat ground in a rude way by machinery
              which would now be of little benefit to mankind. Tree after tree has been felled and
              log after log has been rolled, piled and burnt, and the farmers, by great difficulty,
              prepared the soil. At that time there were no idlers, and the daughter of the sturdy
              pioneer came forward and engaged nobly in the work of raising the crops for their
              sustenance, thinking nothing of fine dress, the piano being something heard of, but
              not seen. How different from the girl of to-day. What does the dear old grandmother
              think of her grand-daughter as she sits in the grand parlor of her father, and, with
              nimble fingers, passes over the keys of the piano-forte, sending forth sweet and
              melodious music that calls for praises from the attentive listeners? What does the
              old, gray-headed man, bending under his many years of life and privations, think of
              the man of to-day with his many machines and inventions to assist him in his work? And
              stop and think for yourself, when the soil was turned, not  by a steam or an Oliver Chilled Plow, but by a wooden mould-board,
              attached to which were horses or oxen, having on harness constructed of ropes and the
              roots of trees, not having any particle of leather or iron in their composition. Some
              of these were known as the famous "kicking plows," which, in coming in contact with an
              obstruction, rebounded with such force that they were "said to kick a boy over the
              fence." Year after year in our history, the improvement in our plows having continued
              to advance, until we now have them in almost a perfect condition.
            Wheat in early times was cultivated with great difficulty, and carried or hauled long
              distances to market, very often bringing to the seller twenty-five to forty cents per
              bushel. Then appeared no self-binders to save to the producer a vast amount of time
              and labor; then the sickle was the prominent machine by which to reap the waving
              fields of grain. Afterwards the scythe and cradle came forward, saving to our sturdy
              farmers time and labor. Improvements in this respect, like in the plow, have continued
              from time to time. Hundreds of acres may be slain now while one was cut in former
              times. Then the flail was in use to thrash the grain; then also horses were used to
              tramp it out. In 1856 the first thrashing-machine was introduced into this county, not
              a machine to thrash twelve or fifteen hundred bushels of grain in a day, as may now be
              done by our magnificent thrashers, but a machine which was a great improvement on the
              older methods.
            As we now look around us and behold the giant iron horse running at the rate of forty
              to sixty miles per hour; when we see our beautiful fields of grain placed in a
              condition for thrashing in a few hours, which before would require as many days; when
              we see that agriculture is now studied as a science, and the great improvement in all
              our lands; when we see the railroads all over our country ready to carry our
              productions to market; when we observe along these lines of railway telegraph poles
              and wires ready to convey messages as quick as lightning to all  sections of the country, we can not help but acknowledge that our
              advancement since the brave old pioneers settled this country has been marvelous, and
              we can also say, "Truly we are a happy people."
            In 1850 this county was still almost a wilderness, and since that period our
              improvement has been almost as rapid as a current of our swiftly-flowing streams.
              Eminent men have arisen from among us who, by their own exertions, have gained
              distinction and success. Our educational interests have sprung up like the trees in
              the forest, and we have sent forth men to the field of action whose fame shall ever
              live and be cherished by the American people.
            
              "If we could but live as of old,
              For a thousand long years,
              What things might we know,
              What things might we do,
              And all without hurry and care."
            
          
          
            HANCOCK COUNTY FAIR.
            The first fair in this county was held in 1856, east of Greenfield, on the north side
              of the National road, near the present flax tactory. A. T. Hart was the first
              president. This was a successful agricultural meeting, but the next year the place of
              display was changed, and the fair held east of Brandywine and south of the railroad,
              on the land of Samuel Milroy. Here it continued to be held annually until the fall of
              1860, when the proprietors reorganized and formed a society of stockholders, dividing
              the stock into shares of $10 each, when the name of the organization was changed to
              the Agricultural Society, differing in name but not in character. So far the fairs
              were well attended, and held an equal rank with similar corporations in the
              surrounding counties. Thus the holders of stock in the new organization looked forward
              to bright prospects in the future. New officers had been elected and a new
              constitution and by-laws had been formed which differed materially from the old
              method. At the  annual meeting of the Hancock Joint
              Stock Association, held in Greenfield, at the court-house, on the 10th of November,
              1860, the following persons were chosen as officers for the ensuing year: Robert E.
              Barnett, President; John Hinchman, John P. Banks, Vice Presidents; James L. Mason,
              Secretary; John H. White, Treasurer.
            On motion, Henry Newby, Samuel Heavenridge and Joshua Meek were appointed as the
              committee to examine and report upon suitable grounds for the association, and to
              receive proposals for the sale of the land. A unanimous report of the committee
              appeared December 8, 1860, and on April 5, 1861, the society purchased eight acres of
              land of Samuel M. Milroy for the sum of $500. Here for years was held the fair of our
              county; here appeared the best blooded horses, the best sheep, the best cattle, hogs
              and live stock of all kinds which our section of the country was capable of producing;
              here were people from all parts of our county to see the stock of other sections, and
              thereby improve their own. In 1871 the floral hall was destroyed by fire, and never
              rebuilt. The society flourished until 1879, when debt, jealousies and lack of
              enterprise caused its natural demise.
          
          
            PAPERS OF HANCOCK COUNTY.
            It has been well said that there are three great educational motive powers, viz: the
              press, pulpit and school; and indeed it would be useless in this highly enlightened
              age to waste words upon the power and influence of the press.
            While the pulpit may furnish a higher grade of moral instruction, the press reaches a
              far greater number, and does more towards forming the opinions of the masses of
              mankind.
            Bacon says that "Reading makes a full man." Schuyler Colfax says of reading, that "It
              is one of the great sources of information."
            In about 1844 to 1846, James H. Hunt started a 
              newspaper in Greenfield called "The Reveille," the first paper
              published in the county. In 1847, Mitchell Vaugh established "The
                Investigator," which he edited for about six months, when he failed, and R. A.
              Riley became the editor for another six months, after which Thomas D. Walpole started
                "The Sentinel," a weekly paper, which was published for about four
              or five years, being edited for a time by William Mitchell. In the year 1859, Noble
              Warrum, David S. Gooding, William R. West, and George Y. Atkison started "The Hancock Democrat," which was edited for a time by D. S. Gooding, followed
              by William Mitchell, who soon became and is still the editor and sole proprietor.
              About the year 1864, one Wright started a native American paper, the "Family Visitor," which, after running for a time, was transferred to Mr.
              Hinshaw. In 1867 "The Greenfield Commercial" was started and edited
              for a while by Amos C. Beeson, afterwards by L. E. Rumrill. The next paper that made
              its appearance was "The Greenfield News," edited by Will T. Walker,
              succeeded by Walter Hartpence. "The Greenfield Republican," by T. B.
              Deem, next made its appearance, but ceased after twelve issues. In July, 1878, R. J.
              Strickland started "The Hancock Jeffersonian," a weekly paper which
              is still published. He also continued the publication of "The Odd
                Fellows' Chronicle," which he had been publishing at Centerville for a number
              of years. In August, 1880, "The Greenfield Republican" was started
              by Robison & Cooper, and after running for a time was transferred to the
              Republican Company, by which it is still published. In the fall of 1879, Drs. Boots
              and Marsh commenced the publication of "The Independent Medical
                Investigator." In 1881, "The Home and School Visitor" was
              started by Aaron Pope as publisher and Lee O. Harris as editor. The present
              proprietors are Harris and Goble.
            Recapitulation.—The first paper published in Hancock county
              was in 1844. The numbers published from time to time are numerous. The kinds
              published, medical, miscellaneous, educational, lodge, literary and news. The papers
                 now published in Greenfield are four in number, three
              news and one educational. The proprietors are William Mitchell, R. J. Strickland, The
              Republican Company, and Harris and Goble.
          
          
          
            TABLE OF DISTANCES.
            KEY TO ABOVE TABLE.—To
              find the distance between any two points in the county or from any village or
              post-office therein to Indianapolis follow the columns of each to where they
              intersect, and note the numbers at said point of intersection, which is the required
              distance. To illustrate, for instance: To find the distance between Greenfield and
              Junction, follow the vertical column beginning below Greenfield to the lateral column
              beginning opposite Junction, and the distance is found to be only five miles. The
              distance from New Palestine to Westland is ascertained by the same method to be twelve
              miles; Gem to Junction, twelve miles; Westland to Willow Branch, nine miles, and thus
              the distance from any two points is readily learned. It is proper here to remark,
              however, that the above distances are such as are necessarily traveled in taking the
              most direct wogon route. For example, the distance given above from Indianapolis to
              Warrington is thirty-one and a half miles, while to travel the distance with the
              cardinal points of the compass, passing through Greenfield, would be thirty-six miles,
              but by taking the most direct wagon route, passing through Eden and McCordsville,
              thence south-west on the pike direct to Indianapolis, the distance necessarily
              traveled is, as above stated, thirty-one and a half miles.
          
          
          
            POST-OFFICES IN THE COUNTY.
            On the preceding page will be seen a full list of the post-offices in the county,
              commencing with Greenfield, the first, and closing with Binwood, the last established,
              being seventeen in number. Indianapolis is not in the county, but, being our State
              capital, and one of our chief business points, and so intimately connected with our
              interests and history, that it properly appears on the table of distances. Junction is
              only a tiny village, and not yet a post-office. It is a new place, at the junction of
              the Pendleton pike and I., B. and W. railroad, five miles north of Greenfield.*
            We contemplated another table of post-offices alone, arranged alphabetically, with
              names of postmasters, salaries or pay received, when supplied with mail, whether
              daily, weekly, semi-weekly or tri-weekly, number of papers and periodicals passing
              through the office, the money-order offices designated, and various other matters of
              interest, all the facts of which are of record in the Post-office Department at
              Washington, and the writer once had the pleasure of seeing the whole plan, but on
              writing for the desired information we received the following reply, which is
              self-explanatory: 
                
                  
                    POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT,
              OFFICE OF FIRST ASSISTANT POSTMASTER GENERAL,
              WASHINGTON,
                        October 10, 1881.
                      SIRS:
                    In reply to your communication of the 5th October, requesting to be furnished
                      with information as regards, post-offices, postmasters, &c., in Hancock
                      county, Indiana, you are informed that, in consequence of the insufficiency of
                      the present clerical force in this office, it will be impossible to comply
                      with your request.
                    Many of the clerks are now and have been compelled to work extra hours in the
                      discharge of their regular duties, and the Postmaster General considers that
                      to impose additional labor upon them, under such circumstances, would be
                      inexpedient.
                    While such information as you request has been heretofore *All of the post-offices and
                        villages are definitely located and described in their proper places, as
                        shown by the index and table of contents. given when practicable, the Department is now under the necessity of
                      declining all such applications.
                    Very respectfully,
                      JAMES A. MAN, Acting First
                        Ass't P. M. General.
                    To KING & BINFORD,
                      Greenfield, Hancock Co., Ind.
                  
                
              
          
          
            TO GRANTEES AND MORTGAGEES OF REAL ESTATE.
            Many persons who have not given the subject special attention suppose that in buying
              real estate or accepting a loan on the same that all the precaution necessary is to
              see that there is a perfect chain of title, and that there are no mortgages, judgments
              nor delinquent taxes, but such is not the case. These are a few of
              the important things to be looked after, but not all by any means. It would be wise
              and only an indication of business tact on the part of those interested not to
              purchase or make a loan upon real estate until they are certain that the records show
              the title to be without a flaw, and free from liens of any kind or character whatever;
              and it is not always safe in so important matters in dealing with all classes of
              mankind to trust to "friendship," "honor," or anything outside the official records.
              To avoid any risks in the matter, have the title tested and the liens examined by a
              competent attorney, or better require an abstract by experienced, responsible parties;
              and do not for a moment suppose that simply an abstract gives you a good title, as
              some have erroneously thought, but, on the contrary, a good and complete abstract
              shows the kind of title, whether good or bad, and the liens, if any, on the realty.
              Then, to be more specific, we would caution parties as a general rule before buying or
              loaning not to fail to see: 
                That the grantor or mortgageor has an unbroken chain of title from the United
                  States down.
                That there are no unsatisfied mortgages of any kind or amount that would be a
                  lien on the same.
                That there are no mechanic's or vendor's liens.
                Nor liens from judgments, decrees or transcripts of record in the county
                  clerk's office.
                
                That there are no judgments nor decrees from the District or Circuit Court of
                  the United States in and for the district wherein the land is situate.
                See that there are no liens from tax sales, ditch, gravel road or street
                  assessments, nor from delinquent taxes.
                That there are no life estates nor dower interests outstanding.
                If the property has ever been sold at sheriff's, executor's, administrator's,
                  commissioner's or guardian's sale, see that the proceedings were regular, for
                  there is no warranty in any of these sales, and such conveyances are only
                  equivalent to quit claims.
                If ever devised by will, see that the same was duly probated.
                Provide against any unrecorded deeds, mortgages or leases for or upon the
                  lands.
                See that the owner is neither principal nor surety upon any recognizance or
                  official bond, which, by the law of Indiana and consequently of Hancock county, is
                  a lien upon the premises. Our statutes provide that every recognizance shall bind
                  the real estate of the principal from the time it is taken, but shall only bind
                  the real estate of the surety from the time judgment of forfeiture is
                  rendered.
                See that the deed, which may be regular and absolute upon its face, is not
                  counteracted and changed in nature by outstanding cotemporaneous
                  defeasances.
                Ascertain whether the deed is for a legal consideration or simply as a
                  security for a debt. If for the latter, it is in effect and reality only a
                  mortgage, and may be foreclosed as such. Our courts hold that where a deed of
                  conveyance of real estate, though absolute on its face, is executed and intended
                  simply as security for the payment of a debt owing from the grantor to the
                  grantee, it amounts to a mortgage only, and confers no title upon a person who,
                  having notice of such fact, obtains a conveyance of such real estate from such
                  grantee.
                
                See that there are no other liens or defects (of which there may be several)
                  of any kind or character whatever.
                Lastly, know that the instrument of conveyance or security contains a definite
                  and correct description of the lands, and is properly executed, signed, sealed,
                  acknowledged and timely recorded.
              
            Remarks.—It will be seen from the above that instead of there
              being but three or four points for grantees and mortgagees to look after, there are
              nearly forty, all essential and of vital importance.
            By the statutes of 1852, dower is abolished, except such rights as had already
              vested, but the section of the statutes of 1843, providing for the assignment of
              dower, was continued in force in the statutes of 1852, and is still in force.
            Our Supreme Court has held that "a surety upon an official bond, as well as the
              principal, is a debtor, within the meaning of the statute," which provides that
              "judgments on official bonds, payable to the State of Indiana, shall bind the real
              estate of the debtor from the commencement of the action."
            Under the Statutes of Indiana now in force, every conveyance, mortgage and lease for
              more than three years must be recorded in forty-five days from the execution thereof
              in order to be good as against any subsequent purchaser, lessee or mortgagee, "in good
              faith and for a valuable consideration."*
            Many persons very erroneously suppose that the "warrant" in deeds and mortgages to be
              ample security for any overlooked liens that in the future may be discovered, but the
              warranty, like any other security, is available and valuable after the purchase money
              is paid, only in case of responsible parties. Again, the grantor may be good and *The main facts in the above
                article I have heretofore furnished some of the papers over my full name, but,
                considering the subject of such vital importance to the common reader, I have
                revised and rewritten the entire article, and trust it will not be considered out of
                place in a county history as the law of Indiana, and consequently of Hancock county.
                  J. H. BINFORD.
               perfectly responsible at the time of the conveyance,
              but perhaps in a few years, when some defect is observed or lien is to be enforced, he
              is dead, moved away or insolvent, hence it is not always advisable to rely on the
              warranty, however good at the time.
          
          
            COUNTY BIBLE SOCIETY.
            An auxiliary of the American Bible Society was organized in this county in the year
              1837 by Rev. Richmond, the prime mover in the charitable enterprise, and the first
              president thereof. Among those who have since filled that office we may note Joseph
              Mathews, John Rarden, H. B. Wilson, D. S. Gooding, George Barnett, F. M. Gilchrist and
              G. W. Dove, the latter of whom is the present chief officer. The object of this
              organization is to promote the circulation of the Holy Scriptures, without note or
              comment, among all classes, and especially the poor and neglected. The recipients are
              expected to pay a part of the price of the sacred volume, where they are able and can
              be induced to do so, in order that they may be more highly appreciated, and secondly,
              that the finances of the society may be the most advantageously and economically used,
              yet none are to be denied on account of their poverty. There being no money
              consideration for the keeping of the records of the society, we are unable to find any
              reliable account of its sales, donations and doings, but for these facts have to rely
              on the memory of the older citizens.
          
          
            CHRISTIAN CHURCH, GREENFIELD.
            About the year 1850 several families moved from Kentucky, chief among which were the
              Sebastians, Branhams, Offutts and Rainses. Most of these were members of the Christian
              Church, or had been indoctrinated before leaving Kentucky. As early as 1840, ministers
              of the Christian Church occasionally visited this place, and held meetings in private
              houses, county seminary and the old M. E. Church, and sometimes at the court-house.
              Soon the  court-house was sold and torn down, and the
              members accepted an invitation from the Methodists to again occupy their house. After
              the new court-house was erected, the society occupied it for a time. In the spring of
              1854, April 4th, an organization was affected in the M. E. Church, at which time
              thirteen names were enrolled as original members, viz: William and Elizabeth
              Sebastian, 
                JONATHAN SMITH.
               Joseph Clayton, Humphrey and Eliza Offutt, Benjamin and Hannah Porter,
              Elizabeth Phillips, Stephen Dickerson, Amanda Branham, Lewis Sebastian and Mrs. Amos.
              After the organization, the meeting was continued for several days, increasing the
              membership to about forty, when the necessity of a house of worship was felt by all.
                 A. K. Branham, though not a member at that time, soon
              secured a six-hundred-dollar subscription, donated himself thirty-five feet of the lot
              on which the church now stands, and induced Col. Tague to donate ten more. He and
              Lewis Sebastian then bought the old court-house for two hundred and fifty dollars, and
              when it was torn down he ordered the masons to begin work, agreeing to pay them three
              dollars and a half per thousand to put the brick in the wall. When the work was begun
              there was yet not a dollar collected, but he succeeded in paying the workmen every
              Saturday night, not knowing on Monday morning where the money was to come from for
              that week. With the same persistent effort with which he started out he continued,
              until it was under roof, expending about six hundred dollars more. In about two years
              the building was completed, except the wash-boards, with a cost of two thousand
              dollars. The church was organized in the spring of 1854 by Mr. Thornbury. Among those
              who pointed out the way of life and salvation to the little flock are Elders
              Thornbury, Littleton, Raines, New, Edmonson, Hobbs, J. C. McCollough, George Campbell,
              Thomas Lockhart, James Sloan, Dr. Thomas and William Anderson. The pastoral work of
              the church has been mainly done by four men, Raines, Hobbs, Sloan and Thomas. The
              numbers added by these men were respectively one hundred, one hundred and nine,
              seventy-five and fifty-seven. About $11,000 have been paid out for preaching and
              $6,000 for other expenses. Resident membership, one hundred and seventy-five;
              non-resident members, fifty. William J. Sparks is superintendent of the interesting
              Sunday-school in connection therewith.
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XXIX.
            PERSONAL SKETCHES AND BRIEF BIOGRAPHIES.
          
            JUDGE DAVID S. GOODING,
            son of Asa and Matilda Gooding, and grandson of Col. David Gooding, a captain in the
              war of 1812, was born in Fleming county, Kentucky, January 20, 1824. In the fall of
              1826 or 1827 he came with his parents to Indiana, and settled in the green woods of
              Rush county. In 1836 they moved to Hancock county and settled in Greenfield.
            Mr. Gooding's early education was received in Rush and Hancock counties, after which
              he entered Asbury University at Greencastle, where he continued his studies for about
              two years, but his finances being very limited, health poor, and finally the death of
              his father, compelled him to leave college before graduation. At the age of fifteen he
              united with the M. E. Church, and was afterwards licensed an exhorter, which license
              was renewed for five consecutive years. He was several years superintendent of the M.
              E. Sunday-school, and also for five years president of the County Bible Society.
            In 1847 he represented the county in the lower house of the Legislature, being
              elected by a majority of forty-two votes over Dr. J. W. Hervey, now of Indianapolis.
              In 1848 he was elected County Prosecuting Attorney. In 1851 he was Circuit Court
              Prosecuting Attorney in the Indianapolis Judicial Circuit, composed of Marion, Boone,
              Hendricks, Johnson, Shelby and Hancock counties. In 1852 he was elected Common Pleas
              Judge, and in 1856 State Senator. In 1861 he was again elected Common Pleas Judge.
            In the year 1863 he volunteered in the pursuit of the 
              rebel forces under Gen. John Morgan in their raid through Indiana, and was severely
              wounded, while marching in line of duty, near Lawrenceburg, which ended his career as
              a Union soldier.
            In 1864 he resigned his office as Judge of the Common Pleas Court and accepted the
              position assigned him by the Union State Convention at the head of the Lincoln and
              Johnson Presidential Electoral ticket as Elector at Large. He thoroughly canvassed the
              State, was elected, and cast his electorial vote for Lincoln and Johnson.
            In 1864 President Lincoln nominated Judge Gooding to the Senate of the United States
              for a United States Judgeship in New Mexico, which (at the request of said Gooding)
              the President withdrew, but not until after the proper committee had directed a report
              recommending his confirmation.
            In June, 1865, President Johnson, without recommendation or solicitation and on his
              own option, telegraphed Mr. Gooding asking his acceptance of the United States
              Marshalship for the District of Columbia, which position he accepetd, and entered at
              once upon his duties. He soon become the only executive officer of the Supreme Court
              of the District of Columbia; also of the Supreme Court of the United States.
            In January, 1866, Mr. Gooding was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate
              as such Marshal. He held the full confidence of President Johnson to the end of his
              term, and immediately after the inauguration of President Grant he personally tendered
              his resignation, which was accepted, though not to take effect until a successor was
              duly appointed and qualified. He soon after returned to his old home, and resumed the
              practice of law in Greenfield in 1869.
            Referring to his early history, he was licensed to practice law in the year 1845. In
              1867 he was admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States on the
              motion of Hon. Henry Stansburry, Attorney General of the United States. He was reared
              a Whig, and was a  great admirer of Henry Clay, adhering
              to the principles of the Whigs until 1850, when he withdrew from his old party and
              united with the Democracy. Differing from the leaders of his party, he opposed the
              repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and in 1860 was for Douglas and Popular
              Sovereignty. When the Great Rebellion threatened this country with destruction Mr.
              Gooding came forward for the defense of the Union. His war speeches aroused enthusiasm
              among the people, and in co-operation with Wright, Douglas, Johnson and many other war
              Democrats he continued to stir the people to action.
            Since 1866 he has been in full sympathy with the principles of his party, and has had
              great influence in conducting its campaigns. He is strongly opposed to the national
              banking system, and is in accord with the rights and interests of the people. His
              extensive work for the people and in politics has made him one of the leading
              political men of Indiana. He prides himself on the canvass of 1880 for General
              Hancock, and seems inclined to close his political life with that campaign.
            Mr. Gooding's success as an editor was marked, having the management of The Hancock Democrat for several years.
            Judge Gooding is the first Democrat of this county ever elected State Senator, County
              Prosecuting Attorney, Circuit Court Prosecuting Attorney, Common Pleas Judge, and the
              only citizen of the county ever a Presidential Elector for the State at large or a
              United States Marshal for the District of Columbia.
          
          
            JAMES SAMPLE
            was born in Greenbrier county, in what is now known as West Virginia, on the 17th day
              of April, 1794. In 1815 he was married to Miss Mary Barrett, a sister of the Revs.
              Joseph and Samuel Barrett. In 1827 he came on horseback to the wilds of Indiana
              prospecting for a more suitable place of abode. Blue-River township attracted  his attention, and in 1828 he and family came over the
              seldom-traveled route and settled in the green woods of this county. Soon a rude
              cabin, without chimney or floor, was erected to shelter them from the inclemency of
              the weather. Their furniture was of the rudest kind, and their prospects not very
              bright, still they bore their trials bravely, hoping for better times in the future.
              The sound of the loom and ax could be heard early and late for years. Churches had not
              yet been erected, but the rude cabins furnished a place to worship God and sing His
              praises. James Sample was always an energetic worker at these meetings.
            Mr. S.'s mother came to this county, and lived to the remarkable age of one hundred
              and two, being the oldest person buried in the old Gilboa Cemetery. "Grandmother
              Sample," as she was usually called, could read fine print without glasses for sometime
              before she died, and the most remarkable circumstance occurred just three or four
              months before her death. As perfect a set of teeth as ever filled the mouth of any
              person came through her gums. Strange but true this rare circumstance.
          
          
            ROBERT BINFORD,
            an extensive farmer and stock-raiser, now of Rush county, but for more than fifty
              years a citizen of Blue-River township, and consequently one of the first settlers
              thereof, is a native of North Carolina, Northampton county, born July 2, 1813. In
              1826, at the age of thirteen, he came with his parents and other Binford families to
              the new free State of Indiana, and settled in the green woods of what is now
              Blue-River township, but then Madison county, in the "New Purchase."
            The Binfords had once been well off, and owned large plantations and numerous slaves,
              but becoming convinced that the trafficing in human souls was a sin against Heaven,
              and that slavery and the bondage of either blacks or whites  was contrary to the principies of our free institutions, which in spirit
              declare that all men are born free and equal, with certain
              inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, they
              voluntarily freed them, one and all, and endeavored to reinstate them in their
              primitive moral rights by dividing with them what property they had helped to
              accumulate. Selling their lands at a sacrifice, they determined to seek a home in a
              free State, free from the blighting influences of human slavery, and hence sought an
              asylum in Hancock county, where they could begin life's battles anew.
            March 30, 1837, the subject of this sketch was married to Martha, daughter of John
              Hill, one of the prominent pioneers of Rush county. A little cabin was soon erected in
              the green woods, and the two, made one, set about in earnest to make an honest living
              by the sweat of the brow. Although Mr. B. had plenty of land for a biginner, having
              received one hundred and sixty acres by his wife and a similar amount from his
              parents, yet there was not an acre cleared, and he was really poor, too poor to buy a
              second horse, hence had to tend the first crop with a single team. His first crop
              consisted of two and a half acres of corn, which was worth twelve and a half cents a
              bushel, but he had none to sell. His first wheat crop was on the same two and a half
              acres, but it was "sick wheat," so called by the early settlers, because it made them
              sick to eat it in any manner whatever, even in limited quantities, hence it was
              worthless, and he received nothing for it. His first hogs were sold at a dollar per
              hundred, which brought him eighty-seven dollars, the most money he had ever had. Farm
              hands were worth seven to eight dollars per month; calico, forty cents per yard;
              coffee and tea too expensive to buy, hence used rye and other substitutes.
            By great industry and rigid economy Mr. B. has succeeded in accumulating considerable
              property. He has given most of his children, nine in number, a college education and
              eighty acres of land each, and has done much for educational and charitable
              institutions, and

               always contributed liberally of his means for
              the support of the church.
            In politics Mr. B. is a Republican; in church relations an orthodox Friend or Quaker.
              Naturally timid, modest and unassuming, he avoids publicity, never aspiring to office,
              preferring the quiet walks of life. Though one of the early settlers of the county, of
              unblemished character, one of the heavy tax-payers, a charitable, Christian gentleman,
              and a good citizen, nevertheless he would never have consented to the notice herein,
              and this entire sketch and the accompanying portrait are wholly without his knowledge
              or consent.
          
          
            JACOB SLIFER
            was born in Elos, Germany, on the 13th day of October, 1811. His father and family
              embarked on a ship for America in 1817. After sailing one week, a severe storm came up
              and drove the vessel, a total wreck, into the English Channel. The captain of the
              unfortunate ship was ruined, and the father of Mr. Slifer lost the amount which he had
              paid for their passage, and being in limited circumstances, his two oldest children
              were sold to pay their fare. After seventeen weeks at sea they landed in America,
              where young Slifer attended school for a short time, was then bound to a farmer until
              eighteen years of age, after which he worked at the shoe-maker's trade for three
              years, clerked in a store in Philadelphia for twelve months, and came to Hancock
              county in 1834; was married to Miss Jane Lewis and settled in the wilds of this county
              in very limited circumstances, where he endured the privations of pioneer life. He has
              served two terms as County Commissioner, and is now bountifully supplied with this
              world's goods.
          
          
            JOHN H. WHITE
            was born in Preble county, Ohio, December 3, 1824. His father was a soldier in the
              war of 1812. His early  education was received in the
              common schools of his native county, during the winter terms, when he could not be
              profitably employed on the farm. He came to Shelby county, Indiana, in 1843; served an
              apprenticeship as tanner and currier in Franklin county. At the close of his
              apprenticeship, he began teaching school in connection with farming, which he has
              followed ever since. In 1853 he moved to Center township, Hancock county, where he now
              resides. In 1860 he was elected Township Trustee. In 1864 he represented the county in
              the lower house of the Legislature. In 1866 he was re-elected. He has been President
              of the Hancock Agricultural Society. He was formerly a Whig, but has been a Democrat
              since 1854. In 1862 he became a member of the Christian Church. He was married
              December 23, 1845, to Miss Sarah Potts, of Franklin county. He is the father of nine
              children, all of whom are useful members of society.
          
          
            JAMES L. MASON
            dates his nativity April 3, 1834, Union county, Indiana, where he received a primary
              education in the common schools. At the age of fourteen he entered Farmer's College,
              near Cincinnati. Here he pursued his studies for a time, but finally went to
              Bloomington, Indiana, and became a student in the State University. Returning to
              Brownsville, his native town, he taught school for two terms, and acted in the
              capacity of county surveyor at the same time. He studied law with Hon. John S. Reid,
              of Connersville, Indiana, for a short period, and then returned to Bloomington, and
              studied for one term in the law department. He subsequently taught school in Wayne
              county and Greenfield, after which he read law with the Hon. Thomas D. Walpole, of
              this place, and soon entered upon the active practice of his chosen profession.
            In 1862 he was elected Joint Representative for Hancock and Shelby counties to the
              State Legislature. In 1864 he was elected State Senator. In 1862 he was  married to Miss Emma R. Millikan, who lived but six weeks
              thereafter. In 1867 he was married to Miss Rebecca Julian,* daughter of Judge Jacob B. Julian, of
              Indianapolis, who died October 22, 1877.
            Mr. Mason joined the Masonic fraternity in 1853. He is a steadfast Democrat, the
              owner of two thousand acres of land, and one of the wealthiest men in the county.
          
          
            HAMILTON J. DUNBAR,
            a native of Hancock county, was born September 13, 1846. His parents were Jonathan
              and Mary Dunbar, who were respectively of Scotch and Irish descent. The early life of
              young Dunbar was characterized by love of amusement and fondness for athletic sports.
              He availed himself of the educational advantages of the Greenfield schools in his
              youth; but his ambition reaching beyond these, he entered Asbury University at
              Greencastle, where he graduated with high and special honors in the class of 1866, and
              immediately thereafter began the practice and study of law in this city. March 31,
              1868, he was married to Miss Florence M. Jones, of Greencastle. Mr. D. died September
              5, 1876, leaving to mourn him a widow and one child, in whose hearts he is enshrined,
              not only as a prominent lawyer and polished debater, but as an affectionate husband
              and kind father.
            His wife, a niece of the Hon. D. W. Voorhees, has since returned to her native town,
              where she now resides.
            As an evidence of the high esteem in which Mr. D. was held by the legal fraternity of
              the State, we quote briefly from the resolutions of the Marion county bar on his
              demise.
            "It is seldom that one so young as he had won so extended a
              practice at the bar, and yet more seldom that one so young had won so deep a hold upon
              the hearts of those about him, and *Miss Julian was a relative of the Hon. George W. Julian,
                who was once a citizen and practicing attorney of Greenfield.
               wielded such an influence in the community in which he
              lived. As a bar, we will remember his talents and success with pride, and seek to
              emulate his many virtues. In his early death we see but another illustration of the
              sad results of over labor, of the straining beyond their utmost tension the nerves of
              the practicing lawyer."
          
          
            CHARLES E. BARRETT,
            a practicing attorney of Sullivan, Indiana, but formerly of this county, was born in
              Indianapolis, November 28, 1858. 
                CHARLES E. BARRETT.
               His opportunities for a literary education were limited, but making the most
              of them, and being apt and of a practical business turn of mind, he has, while
              employed in the various departments of mercantile life, acquired a good, practical
              business education. Mr. B. began the study of law  at
              odd times, and looked forward to it as a profession as early as at the age of sixteen,
              and on quitting the store he entered the law office of Messrs. New & Poulson, and
              took a course of reading, after which he bought out Mr. Poulson and formed a
              partnership with Mr. James A. New, one of the leading attorneys of the city. Here he
              enjoyed a lucrative practice for three years. During all this time he was also a hard
              student. This we say from personal knowledge as to two years of the time, being a
              student in the office. Mr. B. was admitted to the bar of the Hancock Circuit Court
              December 31, 1879, being the first opportunity after having arrived at his majority
              and becoming admissible.
            In the fall of 1881 the firm of New & Barrett was by mutual consent dissolved,
              and Mr. B. removed to Sullivan, supplied himself with an excellent library, and put
              out his shingle. He shortly, however, formed a co-partnership with Senator Briggs, and
              is now consequently the junior member of the law firm of Briggs & Barrett. The cut
              accompanying this will be recognized and acknowledged by those acquainted with him as
              a good portrait.
            Mr. B. is a Democrat in politics, and, though a member of no church, leans toward the
              Methodists.
          
          
            MATILDA GOODING,
            a daughter of Lemuel Hunt and wife of Asa Gooding, was born in Nicholas county, in
              the State of Kentucky, and was married to Asa Gooding on the 31st day of August, 1822.
              They removed to Rush county, in the State of Indiana, in the fall of 1826, where they
              settled in the green woods, after building a log cabin in which to reside, Asa Gooding
              having entered forty acres of land at the price of $1 25 per acre. They were both
              industrious and happy. In 1836 they removed to Greenfield, Hancock county, and for a
              time kept hotel. Asa Gooding died in 1842, leaving surviving him Matilda Gooding, his
              widow, who, though absent for a few years at Greencastle, Indiana, for the  purpose of educating some of her children, still resides
              in the same dwelling-house, long known as the Gooding Corner. She is the mother of
              seven surviving children, five sons and two daughters, to-wit: David S., Lemuel W.,
              Oliver P., Henry C., and William H. and Elvira M. Gooding and Cindrella J. Howard,
              wife of Dr. Noble P. Howard, Sen. For one of her age she is in fair health, reasonably
              comfortable and happy, with a consciousness of having been a good wife and mother and
              useful in her day and generation, respected by all who know her and loved and honored
              by her relatives and friends. She is patiently and contentedly awaiting the Master's
              call.
          
          
            ERNST H. FAUT
            was born October 30, 1835, in the county of Buckeburg and Duchy of Schaumburg-Lippe,
              Germany. His father was a Prussian subject, and named after Frederick Wilhelm the
              Third. Being a blacksmith by trade, all the boys had to work in the shop as soon as
              they could take hold of the bellows-pole, as it is well known in Germany that all the
              children have to attend school from the age of seven to fourteen.
            In the year 1848 the revolution broke out in that country, and the people clamored
              for liberty, and thought everything oppressive, even the compulsory school system. His
              father had the idea that his son Ernst would be of more benefit to him in the
              blacksmith shop than in the school-room. An application was gotten up to the highest
              school authority for his release, which had to be approved by the subordinates before
              it was presented to the supreme authority. This approval read as follows: "His knowledge will do, and his father needs him badly." This
              application was presented, and in a few days after granted. The cause of this was that
              the official authorities of the Government were scared about the revolution in the
              country at this time, and they were willing to grant almost anything at that  critical moment, but Ernst was cheated out of his proper
              schooling. From that time he had to work in the blacksmith shop with his father.
              Several of the neighbors who had emigrated to this country wrote letters home to their
              friends, relating the great advantages of this country over their native home for poor
              and laboring people. This impressed him favorably, and he solicited his father to give
              him the privilege and means to come to America, but his father hesitated on account of
              his age. Finally, after a few years of continued solicitation, he consented, and on
              April 29, 1854, at the age of eighteen years, he left the parental roof, and embarked
              at Bremen on a sailing vessel, as ocean steamers were rare at that time. After a
              voyage of sixty-six days he arrived in New York city on August 4th. Having an uncle
              living in New Palestine whom he had never seen, his attention was directed that way,
              and he concluded to pay him a visit. Here he arrived August 14th, and got employment
              at his trade, and he remained there until April, 1856, when he went to Indianapolis,
              and, finding no work at his trade, he took a job as a hod-carrier. Soon after this he
              succeeded in finding employment at his regular business.
            In the fall of 1857 he made a set of horse-shoes for the State Fair, on which he took
              the first premium. In November he returned to New Palestine, and formed a partnership
              with his cousin, Ernst W. Faut. They carried on the blacksmithing business for several
              years.
            In the spring of 1860 he was married to Miss Mary E. Eickman, the fruits of which
              union are eight sprightly children, two boys and six girls, who are all living.
            In the fall of 1860 the partnership with his cousin was dissolved, and he continued
              the business at the old stand.
            In the winter of 1861 and 1862, Mr. Lysander Sparks, then Auditor of this county,
              appointed him Assessor for Sugar-Creek township. In the fall of 1862 he was elected to
              the same position for two years. In the spring of 1866 he was elected Township
              Trustee, and was subsequently re-elected for six consecutive terms, as the elections
              were  then held annually. In the fall of 1872 he was
              elected Treasurer of Hancock county, which position he held for two consecutive
              terms.
            After the expiration of his term as Treasurer he formed a partnership with his
              brother Charles in the manufacture of carriages, buggies, wagons, &c. Their
              establishment is doing an extensive, thriving business, and gives employment to a
              large number of hands. Mr. F. is one of the most enterprising citizens of the country,
              sociable, hospitable and generous.
          
          
            GENERAL OLIVER PAUL GOODING.
            Oliver Paul Gooding was born the 29th day of January, 1835, in the village of Moscow,
              Rush county, Indiana. In 1837 he moved with his parents to Greenfield, Hancock county,
              Indiana. At the age of eighteen, he entered the United States Military Academy at West
              Point, New York, where he graduated in 1858. He was attached to the Fourth United
              States Infantry as Brevet Second Lieutenant, serving as such at Fort Columbus, New
              York Harbor. The 5th day of February, 1859, he was promoted to a Second Lieutenancy in
              the Tenth United States Infantry, and joined that regiment at Fort Bridges, Utah
              Territory, in August of that year, and served on the expedition against the Mormons in
              1859 and 1860. In 1861 he was ordered to the defense of Washington, D. C., and served
              in the war for the suppression of the great rebellion from 1861 till 1865.
            During the war he held several important commands, among which was the Thirty-first
              Massachusetts Volunteers (converted into the Sixth Massachusetts Cavalry), which
              regiment he led as the advanced guard of the Union army at the capture of New Orleans,
              the first day of May, 1862. On the Teche campaign and the Port Hudson campaign, in
              1863, he commanded the third brigade of the third division, nineteenth army corps. In
              the battle of Fort Bisland, or battle of the Teche, as it is sometimes  called, he commanded the Union forces on the north bank
              of Bayou Teche, and captured an outwork of the enemy and some prisoners. The loss of
              life in his command was heavier and its success greater than that of all the rest of
              the army, the brunt of the battle falling on his command. The battle was stopped by
              darkness, and the enemy abandoned his works and retreated during the night, and was
              pursued in the morning. At Port Hudson, General Gooding gallantly led his brigade in
              the terrible and bloody assaults made on the enemy's works on the 27th day of May,
              1863, and the 14th day of June, 1863. His brigade suffered heavily. On the Red River
              campaign, in 1864, he commanded the Fifth Brigade, Cavalry Division, Department of the
              Gulf, and at the end of that campaign was assigned to the command of the division. In
              command of the Union troops at Campti, on the north bank of Red River, the 4th day of
              April, 1864, General Gooding, in a hotly contested cavalry action, defeated the enemy
              under General Siddell. At the battle of Pleasant Hill, Louisiana, in command of his
              brigade, the 9th day of April, 1864, General Gooding gallantly fought and held the
              enemy in check till the Union army came into position, his hat being shot off his
              head, the bullet grazing his scalp.
            At the battle of Kane River Crossing he commanded the advanced cavalry, and was
              highly complimented on the field by Major-General William H. Emory, commanding
              Nineteenth Army Corps, for the able manner in which he handled his command and
              developed the enemy's position. On the retreat of the Union army, he was constantly
              under fire with his brigade, covering either the flank or rear of the army. While
              serving in the volunteer service, his promotion in the regular army went on to the
              rank of Captain, the 27th day of June, 1862, which regular rank he resigned on
              entering civil life in 1865. Entering the war as a Second Lieutenant of Regulars, by
              his own merits he rose to the rank of Major-General by brevet of United States
              Volunteers, which last rank was conferred on him the 13th day of March, 1865, for, as
              his commission  recites: "Gallant conduct
                in the assaults on the enemy's works at Port Hudson, Louisiana, in 1863, and gallant
                and distinguished conduct throughout the Red River campaign, in 1864."
            In the fall of 1865, he located in Washington, D. C., and resumed the study of the
              law, which he had commenced in the regular army before the war. He was admitted to the
              bar of the District of Columbia, the 4th day of January, 1866, and practiced law there
              till 1869, having in the meantime taken a trip to California, when he returned to his
              old home at Greenfield, Indiana, where he lived in retirement till February, 1874,
              when he located in St. Louis, Missouri, in the practice of the law. In 1881 he was
              appointed General Attorney of the Insurance Department of Missouri. General Gooding is
              the author of the new national anthem, America, the chorus of which
              is: "Wave on, wave on! The old flag forever!"
          
          
            AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JOHN H. BINFORD.
            According to the records in the old family Bible, I am the fourth son, second living,
              of Robert and Martha Binford, now of Rush county, but formerly of Blue-River township,
              this county, where I was born, April 13, 1844, and am consequently in my thirty-eighth
              year.
            The first impressions made on my mind of which I have any recollection were of a
              serious nature, occasioned by the death of my grandfather, John Hill, in 1847, while I
              was yet not three years old. I remember the circumstance distinctly, the scene at the
              funeral and how sad my parents were.
            At five my mother began to teach me to spell, read and write. The first writing
              consisted in making "straight marks," followed by patient practicing on the
              "pot-hooks." At six I entered school, and continued therein for about six months in
              the year till I was large enough to plow and do light work on the farm, after which I
              had school privileges for a short term in the winter only until the fall of 1862,  when I entered Earlham College at Richmond, Indiana, for
              a five-months term.
            The following winter of 1863 and 1864 I taught my first school at Hopewell,
              Blue-River towship, a four months' term of eighty-seven days, for $100, or $25 a
              month, and boarded myself. The school was large and the classes advanced; history,
              physiology, philosophy, algebra, rhetoric and a few other extra branches being
              studied, hence my time was fully yet pleasantly employed. I have taught about forty
              terms since then in graded and ungraded 
                PROF. J. H. BINFORD
               schools, in normals and colleges, in this and other States; but never did I
              teach another term around the memory of which there clusters dearer and more vivid
              recollections. Among my students that winter were boys and girls that have since
              become useful men and women, and are now filling positions of trust and profit with
              credit to themselves and honor to their instructor.
            After teaching a few terms in the district schools and attending school in the
              meantime at home, at Walnut Ridge and Spiceland, I finally entered the National Normal
              School in Ohio for two years, but, owing to declining health, quit school, went South,
              and was for two years principal of the Third-Ward graded schools of Little  Rock, Arkansas. While here, during the first year, I had
              the honor of aiding in organizing the first County and State Teachers' Association of
              the State, acted as secretary of the same, and was sent as a delegate to the National
              Teachers' Association at Trenton, New Jersey, and also the State Teachers' Association
              at Ithica, New York, both of which I had the pleasure of attending. In going and
              returning I visited Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, Niagara Falls, Saratoga and Ballston
              Springs, New York City, Philadelphia and numerous other points of interest. Returning
              to Little Rock, I entered upon my second year's superintendency at $133⅓ per month,
              and also engaged in merchandising, but, not being able to give the latter business my
              personal attention, I abandoned it after less than a year's useful experience.
            Being now fully recovered in health, I determined on completing my prospective normal
              course, and therefore declined further employment, though earnestly solicited, at
              $1,500 a year or $8⅓ per day for time employed.
            In 1871 I had the honor of graduating from said Ohio Normal, and among my classmates
              and co-graduates in this school were H. B. Brown, now Principal of Valparaiso Normal,
              F. P. Adams, Principal of the Central Normal at Danville, and Prof. John Burke, of
              Covington, Kentucky.
            The following year, while Principal of the New Garden High School, I was elected by
              the township trustees, on the first Monday in June, as County Superintendent of my
              native county under the new school law providing for County Superintendent,
              Institutes, &c., and abolishing the office of County Examiner. I at once gave
              bond, took charge of the office, and on the close of my school entered upon the active
              duties of my new field of labor. This position I filled as best I could for two years,
              without fear or favor, endeavoring to raise the standard of education, and by every
              available means to make our teachers and schools more efficient and effectual and the
              instruction more practical and profitable.
            
            August 26, 1874, while County Superintendent, I was appointed by J. C. Denny,
              Attorney General, as his assistant in and for this county, under the act of March 10,
              1873.
            In the summer of 1875 I organized and with the aid of competent assistants held and
              conducted in the Greenfield Graded School building "The Hancock County Normal," the
              first normal school ever held in the county.
            During the long summer vacation of 1875, May 27th I was appointed deputy Treasurer,
              or tax collector, by County Treasurer E. H. Faut for the townships of Blue-River,
              Brandywine and Center, including Greenfield.
            The following summer, 1876, with increasing advantages and a larger corps of
              instructors, including Prof. W. A. Yohn, of Valparaiso, I conducted the largest normal
              ever held in the county, though several very interesting and well attended ones have
              since been held in different parts thereof.
            In the fall of 1875 I was elected Principal of the Greenfield Graded Schools, which
              position I held for two years. In the meantime occurred the Centennial year, and all
              educational men were called upon to aid in "Indiana's Educational Exhibit at
              Philadelphia." I laid the matter before our teachers and schools, and suggested a
              series of exhibitions, with a reasonable admittance fee, which was promptly responded
              to in such a liberal manner as to give the school and city the credit of doing more
              than all others in the county and of placing herself in the front rank of cities of
              her size in the State. Our exhibit at the Centennial was also respectable, and I speak
              from personal knowledge, being in attendance thereat for a few weeks.
            In the spring of 1875, while County Superintendent, after the per diem was reduced by
              the Legislature and the work was not crowding, I employed Lee O. Harris to do the
              necessary work of the office, and started on a tour through the Southern States,
              determined to learn by observation something of the method of conducting schools. On
              this trip of a few weeks I visited the best schools of 
              Nashville, Memphis, Vicksburg, New Orleans, Montgomery, Tallahassee, Jacksonville,
              Florida; Charleston, South Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia, and other points, a full
              account of which I gave in the Indiana School Journal, which I
              represented.
            On the 26th of June, 1873, I was married to Miss Lucy Coggeshall, youngest daughter
              of John Coggeshall, of Wayne county.
            The little family of two has since grown to six—Gertrude, Edgar A., Robert J.
              and Paul F. being the younger members.
            In 1877, for various reasons, I resolved on abandoning my chosen profession for the
              more healthful, equally honorable and more remunerative profession of law. The first
              year I read at home, on the farm, while rusticating and rejuvinating. I then returned
              to Greenfield, read in the office of New & Barrett for the succeeding two years,
              was admitted to the bar of the Hancock Circuit Court in the meantime, and had entered
              upon the practice of my new profession, when I received a call from the Central
              Indiana Normal College, of Montgomery county, to take charge of the Law Department,
              and teach Theory and Practice, Zoology and Civil Government, which offer I accepted
              for one year. Returning for the third time to Greenfield, I opened up an office, put
              out my shingle, and while patiently awaiting for a client, contracted to write this
              "History of Hancock County" for King & Harden; accepting a proposition to buy out
              the interest of Mr. Harden, I became fully identified with the interest of the work,
              and have given it my spare moments from my legal duties for the past six months.
          
          
            HON. CHARLES G. OFFUTT,
            one of the leading attorneys of this city, was born in Georgetown, Kentucky, October
              4, 1845. He is the son of Lloyd and Elizabeth Offutt, respectively of Maryland and
              Kentucky. His early education was confined to the 
              common schools of his adopted State, whither he had removed with his parents when
              quite small. At the early age of seventeen he entered the dry goods store of Samuel
              Heavenridge, then a merchant in the town of Greenfield, where he remained for about
              two years. He then taught one term in the county district schools, after which he
              engaged in the employ of Towsey & Byram, merchants of Indianapolis, where he
              continued for the following two years.
            About this time Mr. Offutt conceived the idea of adopting the legal profession, in
              pursuance of which he returned to Greenfield and entered upon a course of reading with
              the Hon. James L. Mason, which he faithfully continued for about three years. He then
              formed a partnership with Judge Joseph S. Buckles, and continued that relation until
              the fall of 1873, when, by mutual consent, the firm was dissolved. Thenceforward he
              continued the practice alone until 1876, at which time the law firm of Offutt &
              Martin was established, of which Mr. Offutt was the senior member. This partnership
              was continued until 1880, since which he has been alone. In 1872 he represented the
              county in the Lower House of the Legislature. Though one of the younger members of
              that august body, he did credit to himself and his constituents. In 1876 he was
              elected Democratic Elector for the Sixth Congressional District of Indiana.
            Mr. Offutt was married July 15, 1874, to Miss Anna, oldest daughter of Frederick
              Hammel, late of this city, the fruits of which union are two sprightly children, a boy
              and girl.
            Mr. Offutt is a man of rare native ability, portly and promising, of pleasing
              address, and stands high in his profession both as a counselor and practitioner.
          
          
            LEONIDAS P. NEWBY
            was born near Lewisville, Hendricks county, Indiana, April 9, 1856. He came with his
              parents, when quite young, to Greensborough, where he remained till the year  1862, thence to Brown township, this county, where he
              resided till 1872. But desiring better facilities for an education, he went to
              Knightstown, entered the High School, from which he graduated in 1874, being the first
              graduate from the Knightstown Academy, after which he took two year's private
              instruction under Prof. Charles Hewitt, completing the catalouge course of Asbury
              University. He then taught one year at Fortville, two years at Warrington and a
              similar time in the Knightstown Academy. In 1873 he began the study of law with
              Charles M. Butler, then Prosecutor of this district. He continued to study and teach
              till 1877, when he entered into a partnership with Walter B. Swaim for one year, since
              which he has been alone. At the fall election of 1880 he was elected Prosecuting
              Attorney for the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit, and on the resignation of Charles M.
              Butler, Prosecutor, he was appointed to fill his unexpired term.
            Mr. N. was married December 21, 1876, to Miss Mary, daughter of R. B. Breckenridge,
              one of the first families of Knightstown. He has two sprightly children, a pleasant
              home, and a splendid new brick residence in Knightstown, his present abode.
          
          
            ANDREW M. PATTERSON,
            a native of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, came to Greenfield in 1832 and was one of the
              most energetic public spirited men of the county. He was ever making improvements, and
              urging others to do likewise. By trade he was a hatter, and carried on business for a
              number of years in the house which he built for the purpose, on the north-west corner
              of Main and Pennsylvania streets. About this time he erected a handsome brick
              residence, at the time the best in the county; the same is now occupied as the
              dwelling of A. J. Banks. He then beautified the grounds with trees, shrubbery and
              flowers till it equalled the finest grounds in the cities at that time. On the
              breaking out of the Mexican war he entered the service; was elected  First Lieutenant of a company raised in this county, as
              seen from our list of Mexican soldiers further on. He remained in the army till the
              close of the war, when he returned, broken down in health. As soon as he recruited
              somewhat he sold out, being discouraged with the slow progress of the town and county
              during his absence, and determined to go West, which resolution located him in
              Davenport, Iowa, where he amassed a fortune, and was honored and respected by all,
              irrespective of party. He represented his county in both Houses of the Legislature.
              From there he went to Carthage, Missouri, where he now resides, an honored member of
              society, and surrounded by all that tends to make life pleasant.
            Mr. P. and our much esteemed friend, A. T. Hart, are perhaps the oldest business men
              of Greenfield now living. To the latter we are indebted for the above facts.
          
          
            JUDGE MARK E. FORKNER,
            a native of Henry county, was born January 26, 1846. His early education was received
              in the common schools of his neighborhood, after which he attended, for a time, the
              New Castle Academy.
            He was raised, principally, in the rural districts, during which he spent two years
              in his father's store at Millville, Henry county. He early conceived the idea of
              adopting the legal profession as his life calling, and, in accordance therewith, began
              reading law with Lewis Dale, of New Castle, May 10, 1864. In the spring of 1865 he
              came to Greenfield and continued his legal studies for a time, when he returned to New
              Castle, and still employed his golden moments in the prosecution of his chosen
              profession, with Joshua H. Mellett, till the fall of 1866, supporting himself in the
              meantime by teaching school in the winter. In the fall of that year he was appointed
              Deputy District Attorney for Henry county, by Calvin D. Thompson. On the resignation
              of Mr. T., R. A. Riley was appointed to fill the vacancy, who continued Mr. F. as
              Deputy.
            
            In the spring of 1867 he formed a partnership with Judge Mellett, which continued
              till 1870, the date of Mr. M.'s election to the bench. Mr. Forkner next associated
              himself with Senator Eugene H. Bundy, with whom he remained till the fall of 1876,
              since which time he has been alone. He represented his native county in the Lower
              House of the Legislature in 1874 with credit to himself and honor to his constituents,
              being a member of the Judiciary and other important committees.
            May 11, 1881, he was appointed Judge of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit, to fill the
              vacancy occasioned by the death of the late Robert L. Polk. This appointment was made
              just seventeen years and one day from the date on which he began his legal
              studies.
            He was married June 22, 1869, to Miss Rebecca A. Donahue, the fruits of which union
              are two promising children—a boy and a girl. Judge Forkner is an able lawyer, an
              efficient judge; fearless and impartial in his decisions.
          
          
            JAMES K. KING
            was born October 17, 1818, in Jefferson county, Indiana, within four miles of an
              Indian camp, and was called by the red men "a pale-face pappoose." The Indians often
              visited at his father's house, and invariably slept with their knives and tomahawks
              under their heads.
            When the subject of this sketch was six years old his father moved to Garrard county,
              Kentucky; here he learned his A, B, C's, and remained four years, then returned to
              Jefferson for two years; thence to Decatur county, in the green woods with his father,
              where he attended school in the winter until his seventeenth year; he then taught for
              a time, and attended school for three terms at the Greensburg Seminary. In 1839 he was
              joined in wedlock with Miss Irene Wilson, in Decatur county, sister of H. B. Wilson,
              of Green township. In 1840 he moved to Hancock county and settled in the native
              forests. In 1847 he located in Warrington and engaged in the goods and stock  trade until 1857, when he failed. In 1852 he joined the
              Masons. In 1860 he was elected County Surveyor, and re-elected in 1862. In 1861 he
              located in Greenfield, since which he has acted as Deputy Sheriff for about four years
              and Assessor for eleven years. In 1875 he published "King's Map of Hancock County." In
              1881 he associated himself with Samuel Harden, of Madison county, under the firm name
              of King & Harden, for the purpose of publishing the History of Hancock County.
          
          
            SAFE ROBBERY.
            During the late civil war and for a time thereafter there was more larceny, burglary,
              robbery, arson and other violations of the criminal code than during any other period
              in the history of our county and country. It was a favorable time for the development
              of the worst elements of society, and evil cropped out occasionally, even where it was
              least expected; political prejudices, sectional feelings and party strifes were
              current. Tramps, tricksters, traitors and treacherous villains flourished during those
              perilous years, and escaped unhurt, and their sins were heaped on the shoulders of
              innocent parties; but in the case under consideration, though the guilty parties were
              never discovered to a moral and legal certainty, yet the innocent were fully able to
              sustain themselves. No one occurrence of this period seemed to interest the people of
              the county more than this one. All felt an interest in this matter, and every effort
              was made to discover the perpetrators, but in vain.
            We quote from the record: "Whereas, It has
                  been shown to the full satisfaction of the County Commissioners of Hancock county,
                  Indiana, by competent and sufficient evidence, that on the night of the 12th of
                  January, 1866, the Treasurer's office of this, Hancock county, was feloniously
                  entered, the iron safe broken open and a large sum of money stolen therefrom, of
                  which five thousand dollars was money belonging to Hancock county, the same having
                  been  collected by Nelson Bradley, Treasurer of said
                  county for 1865, and delinquencies for former years; and,
                "Whereas, It further appears that said loss occurred without
                  the acquiescence, negligence or fault of said Nelson Bradley aforesaid.
                "THEREFORE, Be it ordered by the board aforesaid that said
                  Nelson Bradley, Treasurer of Hancock county, be and is hereby released and
                  discharged from the payment of said sum of five thousand dollars so feloniously
                  taken from the county safe as aforesaid in 1866."
          
        
        
        
          CHAPTER XXX.
            CHARTS AND MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS.
          
            KEY TO THE FOLLOWING CHARTS.
            The following two charts we have carefully prepared and introduced here for the
              purpose of giving a bird's-eye view of the dates, chief officers and principal events
              of our National and County History, from the date of their organization down to the
              present time, and, in the case of the county, the important data from the first
              settlement thereof by the whites.
            The first chart is more of a general nature, showing the name and date of our
              Presidents, Governors, State Senators and Representatives, and our Circuit Judges;
              and, in the last column, the important events of the respective years.
            Chart number two is more of a local nature, but to accomplish the object intended,
              should be examined and studied in connection with the first. Like the first, it is
              ruled into seven columns. In the first is found the date, opposite which in regular
              order follow the names of the county officers, Clerk, Recorder, Auditor, Treasurer and
              Sheriff; and, in the last column, one or more of the chief events in the county
              history.
            Notice on chart number one, that in 1789 George Washington became the first President
              of the United States; that the principal event of that year was the adoption of  the ten amendments to the Federal Constitution; that as
              Indiana and Hancock county were yet unorganized, the intervening columns are blank. In
              1828, John Q. Adams was President; James B. Ray, Governor of Indiana; Calvin Fletcher,
              our State Senator; Bethuel F. Morris, our Circuit Judge, and the principal national
              events the organization of the present Democratic party, and the increase of duties on
              imports. Chart number two shows Lewis Tyner the first County Clerk; Henry Watts, first
              Treasurer, and John Foster, first Sheriff; Greenfield and the Courts organized. An
              examination of 1881 and 1882 shows an equally advantageous condensed history of
              cotemporaneous dates and events in the National, State, and County History. We think
              the chart sufficiently clear without further explanation. Its chief advantage to the
              student is in the association of dates and events of a local and National character,
              and thereby facilitating the memory and increasing the interest:

            UNITED STATES RECTANGULAR SURVEY.
            When and Why Adopted.—Prior to the year 1802 no uniform
              system of surveying had been adopted by law in the United States, and consequently no
              uniformity prevailed, and no little amount of confusion, disputing and litigation
              resulted therefrom. Congress soon saw that it was just as necessary to have a fixed
              system of surveying as to have a standard of weights, measures and values;
              accordingly, in 1802, Jared Mansfield, Surveyor-General of the North-West Territory,
              presented to Congress a plan which was at once adopted, and put into use in the survey
              of all the public lands then owned and since acquired by the United States. This
              system is the most simple, satisfactory and convenient of any yet known.
            
              PRINCIPAL MERIDIAN AND BASE LINES.
              This plan is substantially as follows: Through the State or territory to be
                surveyed a line is run due north and south with great care and accuracy, by careful
                measurements and astronomical observations, called the Principal
                  Meridian, and another at right angles with this, called the Base
                  Line (see diagram No. 1). These two lines are the initial or starting points,
                and may be established wherever deemed most convenient. There are about twenty-five
                principal meridians, and an equal number of base lines in the various surveys of the
                United States and her territories.  The Principal Meridian in Indiana is located about twenty miles west of
                Indianapolis; runs through Lebanon, Boone county, and extends from the Ohio river to
                the northern boundary of the State. The Base Line governing our
                townships in this portion, and most of Indiana, is located fifty miles south of
                Columbus, in Bartholomew county, and ninety miles south of the court-house in
                Greenfield. It extends from the French surveys in Knox county and
                vicinity to Clark's Military Survey in Clark and adjoining
                  counties.*
            
            
              RANGE AND TOWNSHIP LINES.
              On either side of the Principal Meridian extend other meridians called Range Lines, six miles apart, and the first six miles from the Principal
                Meridian. This divides the district into strips six miles wide, extending north and
                south, called Ranges, and numbered in regular order from the
                Principal Meridian east or west, as the case may be. On either side of the base line
                extend township lines, which divide the territory to be surveyed into strips six
                miles wide, extending east and west, called Townships. By the
                intersection of these township and range lines the territory is divided into
                rectangles, approximately six miles square, called Congressional
                  Townships, which contain thirty-six square miles each.
              Remark—Note the distinction between townships and and
                Congressional townships, the former are strips six miles wide, through the whole
                survey, east and west, while the latter are rectangles six miles square.
              The following diagram will show the method of locating townships: *With the exception of
                  these two early surveys, located in the south-east and south-west parts of the
                  State, Indiana was surveyed under the government system. The government surveys
                  were nearly all made from the second Principal Meridian, running through Lebanon.
                  The south-eastern portion of the State was surveyed from the first Principal
                  Meridian, which runs due north from the mouth of the Miami river, forming the
                  eastern boundary of the State, and a base line fifteen miles north of the base
                  line before described, hence the south-eastern portion of Indiana is in range west
                  instead of east, as the uninformed would suppose.
                  DIAGRAM NO. 1.
                
              We may here remark that at the time of running the principal meridian base line,
                township and range lines, corners are marked by the Government survey, or on each
                line for every half mile, to facilitate the further division of the land.
              Sections.—After the territory to be surveyed is divided
                into townships, as shown by explanations and diagrams above, the townships are then
                divided into sections by running lines east and west and north and south, a mile
                apart, thus dividing them into smaller rectangles a mile square, called sections,
                containing six hundred and forty acres each when full.
            
            
              MANNER OF SURVEYING SECTIONS.
              The modus operandi in laying off these sections is as follows:
                The surveyor begins at a point one mile west of the south-east corner of a
                Congressional township on the southern boundary line of the same, and from this
                point runs one mile north, then east on what surveyors call a random line to the
                eastern boundary of the township. Now  should this
                random line intersect the eastern boundary line at the first section or mile corner,
                he measures the line back, establishing a corner midway on the same; if not, he
                finds the proper mile corner, corrects the line, and then marks the quarter section
                corner midway on the corrected line, and thus he continues till he runs off the
                first tier of sections on the east, when he begins again, on the south line this
                time, two miles west of the south-east corner or one mile west of the former
                beginning point, when he runs through in a similar manner, except that he does not
                run to the eastern boundary line but to the former line established.
              The figures in the following diagram indicate the course of the surveyor and the
                order in which the lines are run: 
                  DIAGRAM NO. 2.
                
              It will be seen that the first four tier of sections on the east are all surveyed
                in a like manner, while the last two are established on the same, run north; thus
                the surveyor goes from 69 to 70, then east to 71, then west two miles to 72, and so
                on to the north two sections in the west two  tiers,
                which are completed by the surveyor intersecting the northern boundary at 90, which
                completes the survey of the township. The United States Surveyor has now completed
                his work; any further sub-division is the work of the County Surveyor. The division
                of the section into quarters is indicated by the corners marked midway on all
                section lines. The county or local surveyor, when called upon to do so, connects
                these corners by lines intersecting in the center of the section, thus actually
                dividing the section into quarters, which may now readily be still further divided
                into forty or eighty acre tracts.
            
            
              FRACTIONAL SECTIONS.
              Owing to the rotundy of the earth, townships seldom contain thirty-six square
                miles, but generally less. The townships being divided into sections in the above
                manner, it is evident that the deficiency or excess, i. e., the
                amount of land, more or less than six miles square in the township, must fall in the
                north and west tiers of sections, and in the west half of the west tier and north
                half of the north tier. From this fact the sections on the north and west sides of a
                Congressional township are called fractional sections, because they contain more or
                less than six hundred and forty acres. Section six in the north-west corner, from
                having the excess or deficiency thrown into it from both east and south, is called a
                  Double Fractional Section, and seldom contains more than one
                exact quarter.
            
            
              CORRECTION LINES.
              The meridians run by the compass are not parallel, but converge toward the magnetic
                north pole, located in the Boothnia Peninsula, north-east of Hudson Bay. Thus the
                north side of the townships are narrower than the south, and the northern townships
                smaller than the southern. If these lines were continued for a great distance, the
                disparity in the size of the township would be great, but this is obviated by making
                every fifth line north and every fourth line south of the base line a secondary base
                or a  correction line, and remeasuring the distance on
                the lines and starting anew from the prime base.
              Then, again, to counteract and correct discrepancies that may arise from
                obstructions, such as underbrush, ravines, hills, trees, etc., every eighth line
                east and west of the principal meridian is taken as a secondary or correction
                meridian, and the distances remeasured.
              In the following diagram, No. 3, the figures indicate the course of the surveyor in
                running off the Congressional townships, containing, approximately, twenty-three
                thousand and forty acres each: 
                  DIAGRAM NO. 3.
                
              In order to make this article more practical to the young and others not acquainted
                with land descriptions, we introduce diagram No. 4, which, with the explanations
                following, will enable any one to read ordinary descriptions.
              
              
                DIAGRAM NO. 4.
              
              Remarks.—A land description to be good, our Supreme Court
                has held, must so describe the realty that a competent surveyor can locate it, hence
                a middle division  containing so many acres is not
                sufficiently definite without being described by "metes and bounds." The position of
                a section is known by its number, and the location of a township by the town and
                range.
              Teachers in the district schools should thoroughly master this subject, and then
                aid their advanced pupils in doing the same.
            
          
          
            OUR POETS AND POETESES.
            Hancock county may justly boast of her poetic talent, and claim the right to head the
              list of rythmic counties in Indiana. Marion may boast of her Sarah T. Bolton, Henry of
              her Ben. Parker, Wayne of her Mrs. Jordon, but none of them can furnish a Riley or a
              Harris. Parker writes for pastime, Riley writes as a profession; Mrs. Bolton is
              spontaneous, Harris is perpetual; other poets of the State write for pleasure, ours
              for pay.
            This history would be incomplete without some account of our poets and their
              pennings. For want of space we shall not stop to give a personal sketch of each, nor a
              critique on their writings, but will be content with sample extracts from their
              numerous productions.
            
              FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
                BY J. W. RILEY.
              
                Of all the pleasing faces
                That remembrance can recall,
                The old school day romances
                Are the dearest after all!
                Where some sweet thought revises
                The half-forgotten time
                That opened "exercises"
                On "Friday afternoon."
              
              
                I seem to hear the clicking
                Of the pencil and the pen,
                And the solemn, ceaseless ticking
                
                Of the time-piece ticking then!
                And to note the watchful master,
                And the deprecating nod
                That made the heart beat faster
                For the boy that threw the wad.
              
              
              
                Some little hand uplifted,
                And the creaking of a shoe;
                A problem left unsifted
                For the teacher's hand to do.
                
                The murmured hum of learning,
                The flutter of a book—
                The smell of something burning
                And the school's inquiring look.
              
              
                A bashful boy in blushes,
                And the girl with glancing eyes,
                Who hides her smiles, and hushes
                The laugh about to rise;
                And with a quick invention
                Assumes a solemn face
                To meet the words "attention!
                Every scholar in his place!"
              
              
                The opening song, page 20,—
                Ah! dear old "Golden Wreath,"
                You willed your sweets in plenty
                And some who look beneath
                The leaves of Time will linger,
                And loving tears will start
                As fancy trails her finger
                Over the index of her heart.
              
              
                An "Essay on the Science
                Of Trigonometry,"
                And "Cataline's Defiance,"
                And may be two or three
                Short dialogues, and punny,
                And a little boy in blue
                Winds up with something funny
                Like "Cock—a—doodle—doo!"
              
              
                So the exercises taken
                Thro' gradations of delight
                To the reading of "The Paper,"
                Which is entertaining—quite!
                For it goes ahead and mentions
                "If a certain Mr. O.
                Has serious intentions
                That he ought to tell her so."
              
              
              
                It also asks permission
                "To intimate to John
                The coquettish condition
                Of the ground he's walking on;"
                And dropping the suggestion,
                To "mind what he's about,"
                It stabs him with the question:
                "Does his mother know he's out?"
              
              
                When all has been recited,
                And the teacher's bell is heard;
                And visitors invited,
                Have dropped a kindly word,
                A hush of holy feeling
                Falls down upon us here,
                As tho' the day were kneeling,
                And the twilight was a prayer.
              
              
                O! happy hearts and faces,
                On that great day's review,
                Will you all be in the places
                That were assigned to you?
                Will you conquer life's disasters,
                And with golden harps atune,
                Wait the signal of the Master
                On that endless afternoon?
              
            
            
              THE HARVEST DAYS OF THE OLDEN TIME.
                BY LEE O. HARRIS.
              
                O! the harvest days of the olden time!
                The ring of the sickles in merry rhyme;
                The wealth that fell at the reaper's feet,
                With the tinkling sound of a music sweet;
                My soul is wrapt in a dream to-day,
                And over my senses, from far away,
                There comes a rustle of grain, combined
                With the drowsy voice of the summer wind,
                
                And my heart o'erflows with a song of praise
                For the days—the days!
                The harvest time of my boyhood days.
              
              
                I stand again where the breezes toy
                With the tangled locks of the farmer boy;
                I hear the chorus of tuneful birds,
                The tinkling bells of the grazing herds,
                The happy shout and the joyous song,
                And the gladsome laugh of the reaping throng,
                
                  PROF. R. A. SMITH
                
                The shout, the song, and the merry peal—
                Attend to the ring of the flashing steel—
                They come to me now through the dreamy maze
                From the days—the days!
                The harvest time of my boyhood days.
              
              
                Again I walk in the joyous train
                That follows after the loaded wain;
                Again to my heart, like an echo, come
                The gladsome shouts of the harvest home,
                When the merry, sun-browned lasses greet
                The reaper lads with the golden wheat.
                There was one, with hair of a sunnier hue
                Than the ripened grain of the harvest knew,
                
                Grew rosy as dawn at my ardent gaze,
                In the days—the days!
                The harvest time of my boyhood days.
              
              
                Alas! alas! how the years go by!
                How the young grow old and the lovely die!
                How sad the music, how marred the rhyme,
                Of the harvest songs of the olden time!
                For the rattling cog and the grinding wheel
                Rise over the ring of the reaper's steel,
                And death, the harvester, low hath laid
                The golden hair of the sun-browned maid,
                And I sigh like one who vainly prays
                For the days—the days!
                The vanished dream of my boyhood days.
              
            
            
              OLD SETTLER'S SONG.
                BY SAMUEL BROOKS.
              
                I lived in Jefferson before I came here,
                My father, a hunter, killed turkeys and deer;
                Then women were known to scutch out the flax,
                From which they made linen to put on their backs.
              
              
                It was then very common, I'd have you understand,
                For women to card wool and spin it by hand;
                While the girls at the wheel were careful and gay,
                My mother at the loom kept banging away.
              
              
                The people in common in home-made were dressed,
                When the Sabbath came 'round they put on their best;
                I came to Hancock in the year thirty-two,
                The houses were scarce and the people were few.
              
              
                The country was new when I first settled here,
                I hunted wild turkeys and killed of the deer;
                Then pea-vines, nettles, and plenty of frogs,
                And snakes and big turtles were seen in the bogs.
              
              
              
                Then porcupines and 'possums were caught in their dens,
                And the wolves were taken in steel-traps and pens;
                There were few of our men that ever wore boots,
                Though they cleared in the green and plowed among roots.
              
              
                Then women were known to work on the farm,
                Or at the spinning-wheel, and thought it no harm;
                They oft' did up their work so very late at night,
                And breakfasted next morning before it was light.
              
              
                They wrapped up their babies so snug and so soft,
                Then rocked them to sleep in an old sugar trough;
                The children went ragged, in their little bare feet,
                Their mothers still kissed them and said they were sweet.
              
              
                We now have railroads and telegraphs too,
                The churches and school-houses are never a few;
                We now have plenty, and something to spare,
                Fine boots on our feet and good clothes to wear.
              
              
                We men can drink coffee and women drink tea,
                And are all living happy as happy can be;
                While the children grow fat on butter and milk,
                The ladies go dressed in their satin and silk.
              
              
                While people are passing from day unto day,
                We see them in buggies along the highway;
                We hear the cars whistle, we hear the bells ring,
                While the people collect to pray and to sing.
              
              
                We now have fine carpets and big feather beds,
                With extra big pillows to put under our heads;
                And plenty of good books and papers to read,
                Among the great nations we're taking the lead.
              
            
            
            
              CHRIST THE WAY.
                BY MRS. R. P. HILL,
              formerly a resident of Blue-River township, and youngest daughter of Joel Pusey, a
                merchant, taken from a little volume, entitled "Musings," published in 1871:
              
                Although religion is professed
                By many in this day;
                How few there are will stand the test
                Of Christ, the living way.
                If in fine carriages or car,
                They can to meeting go,
                And there smooth words and doctrine hear,
                Religion then will do.
                The clergy they may thus engage,
                Just taught in human school,
                Can take his text from gilted page,
                Or kneel on cushioned stool;
                But if the gospel, called to spread,
                In Jesus' humble way,
                How few that lowly path would tread,
                To everlasting day.
                Salvation's terms remain the same,
                Though ages have gone by,
                As when from Jesus' lips they came;
                And if we don't comply,
                We need not think He'll change his plan,
                To suit our stubborn will;
                For creeds gotten up by man,
                Will not with Him prevail;
                But we must love with all our mind,
                And soul, and strength, the Lord,
                Yea, more than any earthly friend,
                Or treasures here acquired,
                And do His will from day to day,
                And on His name believe.
                If thus His precepts we'll obey,
                Salvation we'll receive.
              
            
            
            
              AN APOSTROPHE TO DEATH.*
                BY SINNER AND SAINT.
              
                SINNER.
                
                  Oh, Death! thou king of terrors,
                  Thou cruel, hideous monster!
                  Uninvited into our dwellings enterest
                  And tak'st the fairest, sweetest, best!
                
                
                  We've heard of thee by tongue and pen,
                  Through holy prophets and pious men,
                  Thou art no stranger, grave, grim Death,
                  And yet thou art no friend.
                
                
                  The fields are naked and the meadows bare,
                  The winds are howling and the woods are sighing
                  And all nature oft' weeping and crying
                  Because, Oh, Death, they say thou wert there.
                
                
                  Thou art cold, Oh, Death, so cold,
                  Thy presence so chilling we dread;
                  E'en our blood runs cold as thy presence we behold,
                  And all hope and joy forever is fled.
                
                
                  Then approach not our dwellings
                  Now and for aye we implore thee—
                  But depart, depart unwelcome Death,
                  We would bid thee a final adieu.
                
              
              
                SAINT.
                
                  Nay, but stop one moment, Death, delay—
                  A sadder thought has filled our breast;
                  The words of a song we learned so young,
                  "We would not live always, no we would not live always."
                
                
                  In the world we are in there's sorrow and sin
                  But there is a brighter, brighter above,
                  And the door to that world
                  As we often have heard, is Death, cold death.

                  Editor.
                
                
                  And if from sin we are free,
                  No sting there will be at thoughts of thee,
                  As thou call'st at our homes
                  To set us free from this world of sin and pain.
                
                
                  Then call when thou may
                  To take us away to bright mansions above,
                  We hope we can say
                  "Oh, Death, where is thy sting?"
                
                
                  "The sting of death is sin,"
                  And if from sin we are free—
                  Then come Death, welcome Death
                  Thy mission we'll not deny.
                
              
            
            
              STORM.
                BY CLARA LOUISE BOTTSFORD.
              
                Is it deep midnight on the raging sea?
                Is the world all black? Do the mad winds moan,
                And the rain beat down all pitilessly
                On the up-turned face? Have the waters grown
                So cold and the beacon light so dim?
                And the surging waves so wild and high?
                Do lurid flames of lightning flash
                In the purple face of an angry sky?
                Bend lower! Lower! Let the writhing mass
                Of darkness pour! The storm will pass.
              
            
            
              THE CRUCIFICTION.
                BY R. A. RILEY.
              
                'Tis evening, at the supper now,
                The Savior breaks the sacred bread,
                And pours the wine; with solemn vow
                Proclaims Himself the Church's Head.
              
              
              
                'Tis night, on Olive's somber brow
                The stars are hid that twinkled there;
                Alone the suffering Savior bows,
                With none His agony to share.
              
              
                'Tis midnight, and with sorrow riven,
                His sweat and blood flows freely down;
                He ope's the way from earth to Heaven—
                For all His saints prepares a crown.
              
              
                'Tis midnight, and the trial past,
                The Savior to the Jews betrayed,
                A pris'ner in their hands at last
                To smite, imprison, and degrade.
              
              
                'Tis morning, and among the great,
                Their spite, and jealous anger burns;
                They mock Him with a robe of state,
                And crown Him with a crown of thorns.
              
              
                'Tis noonday, and the Christ condemned
                To bleed and perish on the tree;
                Yet angels do their Lord attend—
                Sinner, He died for you and me!
              
              
                While on the cross the Savior hung,
                The pall of night at noonday spread,
                The quaking earth with anguish wrung,
                The bursting tombs gave up their dead.
              
              
                The veil was rent, the lightnings fell,
                From out the darkness hear the cry
                Of Him who conquered Death and Hell,
                "Eloi Lama Sabachthani."
              
              
                The tomb receives His mangled corse—
                They set the seals, and Roman guard;
                With taunting jeer, and muttered curse,
                The tomb is sealed, and watched, and barred.
              
              
                Yet at the promised morning's dawn,
                The seals were loosed, the guardsmen fell;
                
                He 'rose, triumphant marching on,
                In chains led captive Death and Hell.
              
              
                The trembling earth, the bursting tomb,
                And songs of saints and seraphim
                Proclaim the risen Lord has come;
                The world shall bow and worship Him.
              
              
                As He ascends from earth above
                To Heaven, our promised home,
                In trusting faith we live, and love,
                Our risen Lord again will come.
              
            
            
              UNFORGIVEN.

                If you—when I lie cold and dead,
                And can not move nor breathe nor speak—
                Should lay your hand upon my head,
                Or press your warm lips to my cheek,
                Or let one tear from your dim eyes
                Fall on my face—I swear to you
                That I will live, and you shall stand
                Before me mute and white—the blue
                Of Heaven turn to black—the sun
                Be smothered from your sight—and I—
                Whom you have wronged—although you might
                Drop down with lifted hands and cry
                For mercy—I will feel no throb
                Of pity—nay, though you should die!
              
            
          
          
          
            DR. J. G. STUART
            was born in Guilford county, North Carolina, September 18, 1826. His parents
              emigrated to Indiana in 1829, and settled one mile west of Richmond, Wayne county,
              where they remained for a time; thence to Knightstown, where they continued until
              1835. From there they came to Hancock county, and settled in the wild woods, where the
              subject of this sketch resided with his parents until 1843, when he left home with
              what blue jeans clothes he could tie up in a kerchief and fifty cents in his pocket.
              He walked to Randolph county, and began the study of medicine with Dr. J. W. Randell,
              with whom he continued until 1844, when he went to Knightstown, Henry county, and
              studied one year with Dr. John Weaver; thence to Charlottsville, and completed his
              studies with Dr. Henry T. Cook. He commenced the practice of medicine in June, 1846.
              His first medical effort was to adjust a fractured arm for Andrew Pauley. He continued
              the practice until 1863, when he took a course of lectures at Ann Arbor, Michigan.
              Again he resumed his chosen profession. He graduated at the College of Physicians and
              Surgeons in 1874.
            Dr. Stuart resides in Fortville, has a paying practice, is a married man, and the
              senior member of the medical firm of J. G. Stuart & Son.

          CHAPTER XXXI.
            PATRIOTISM OF HANCOCK COUNTY.
          
            INTRODUCTORY.
            In our prospectus of this work we promised to give a list of the soldiers of the
              county, besides we would be remiss in our duty to the brave defenders of our country,
              the Mexican and Civil War soldiers, if we did not give their names a place on these
              pages. We would gladly insert a more extended notice of each, but our limited space
              forbids, and hence shall be content in placing before our readers the name, rank,
              company, regiment, date of muster, and such brief general remarks as we think
              appropriate and most interesting to our patrons. Of course there will be some mistakes
              in so long a list, about 1,300 in number, most of whom were strangers to us; and
              possibly some names have been overlooked, but none
              intentionally.
            We have given much time and labor in preparing this list, having turned page by page
              the eight large volumes of the Adjutant General's reports, nearly 8,000 pages in all,
              to collect the facts herein contained.
            In looking over these reports we see some of our soldier boys charged with desertion,
              which, in some cases, are doubtless correct, but in many others they are not deserving
              of this grave charge, hence for fear of doing injustice none will be thus reported in
              this work.
          
          
            THE MEXICAN SOLDIERS.
            More than a third of a century has winged its flight into the mighty past since the
              brave boys that composed  Company "D" of the "Fifth
              Indiana Volunteers" of foot soldiers, under Captain James R. Bracken, commanded by
              Colonel James H. Lane, bid a final adieu to Mexican soil and scenes and the hardships
              of war and started for their homes in the distant North, and yet there still lives
              among us a number who bear the names found on the following roll, while the greater
              part, however, are with us only in memory, their spirits having flown to fairer lands,
              and their bodies lie mouldering in the dust.
            Thirty-five years ago, during the month of September, in the little town (now city)
              of Greenfield, there was organized by Captain James R. Bracken, in compliance with the
              call of the President, a company of brave boys; strong men who dared to leave all at
              their country's call and risk their lives upon Mexican soil.
            Hancock has since sent many companies to her country's defense, but perhaps she will
              never have the honor of furnishing a braver, stronger, taller, nobler, grander company
              of men to fight her battles than Company "D" of the Fifth Indiana Infantry.
            In order that there might be no mistakes in the roll, and no injustice done, the
              writer took a day to visit the office of James R. Carnahan, Adjutant General, at
              Indianapolis, and through the kindness of John P. Patterson, Esq., was enabled to find
              the original records and muster-out rolls of the company, from which the following
              facts were carefully gleaned:
            The company was called into the service of the United States by
                the President, James K. Polk, under the act of Congress, approved May 13, 1846, at
                Madison, Indiana, the place of general rendezvous, on the 8th day of October, 1847,
                to serve during the war with Mexico, unless sooner discharged.
              The company after its organization in Greenfield, during the month of September,
                went to Indianapolis, Indiana, in wagons, thence on flat cars, on the first railroad
                in the State, to Madison, Indiana, a distance of one hundred and ten miles.

            Let the reader remember that the above list is as copied from the muster-out roll at
              Indianapolis, which of course is not so full as the muster-in roll, which seems to
              have been lost. We have been able, however, by careful inquiry, to add the following
              names to the above list: 
                Black, William.
                Chapman, Joseph.

            Remarks.—There are perhaps a few names still omitted, but
              when the "General Roll is Called" they will all be there.
            Pay-Roll.—The records show that the first and foregoing list
              of soldiers received more or less pay, except the 
              following: John Arnold, Samuel Chapman, James Huntington, Jesse Shoate and Eli Marsh,
              each of whom is marked "pay due from enlistment."
            Died.—James Montgomery, at Encero, June 15, 1848; Eli Marsh,
              at Pueblo, Feb. 28, 1848; Daniel Goodwin, at sea, July 4, 1848; James Parks, on
              Mississippi river, July 14, 1848; William Black, on Mississippi river, July 14,
              1848.
            Mustered-In.—All of Company "D," except one, were mustered in
              October 8, 1847, at Madison, Indiana, by Lieutenant Rodman. John Chapman was mustered
              in June 15, 1847, at Fort Clark, by Colonel Churchill.
            Mustered-Out.—Company "D" was mustered out as a company July
              28, 1848, and honorably discharged from the services of the United States.
          
          
            THREE MONTHS MEN.
            Trouble had been brewing some time between the Northern and the Southern sections of
              our country, but each hesitated to strike the first blow; finally, however, the South,
              having the advantage in preparation, opened the conflict by firing on Fort Sumter,
              April 14, 1861. On the following day President Lincoln issued a proclamation
              commanding all in arms against the Government to disperse in twenty days, and calling
              seventy-five thousand volunteers to defend Washington, and also called an extra
              session of Congress to meet July 4, following. Each section now hastened belligerent
              preparations with vigor. The news of the downfall of Fort Sumter spread like
              wild-fire; the people everywhere were wild with excitement, yet neither section
              foresaw the magnitude of the coming crisis, and neither anticipated a long, deadly
              struggle that would involve three million men; cost the life-blood of more than half a
              million of her best citizens, and an expenditure by the National Government of
              $4,000,000,000. Consequently the first call by the Federal Government was but for
              seventy-five thousand men for  three months, and the
              following day, April 16th, the Confederate Government called for thirty-two thousand.
              Hancock county responded promptly to the various calls, and on April 22, 1861, just
              one week from the date of the first demand, the following list of three months men
              were mustered in, and served till August 6, 1861, when they were regularly mustered
