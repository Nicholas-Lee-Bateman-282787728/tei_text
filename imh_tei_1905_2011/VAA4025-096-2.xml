            <p>The recent publication of a comprehensive collection of the papers of William Henry Harrison for the
                    years 1800 to 1815 will make possible a new evaluation of his career in the period of his longest
                    tenure of political office and most important military service. The papers should also pave the way
                    for a much-needed biography.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Although Harrison served very briefly as president
                    of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, he has always held more interest for historians of Indiana and the Old Northwest than
                    for those interested in the national scene. Even his election to the presidency has usually been
                    examined more in regard to the methods the Whigs used to secure this success than in terms of
                    Harrison's fitness for office. While his successes and failures as territorial governor of
                    Indiana, as superintendent of Indian affairs, and as the general at <placeName>

                    politician remains a shadowy figure.</p>
            <p>There is no modern comprehensive biography of this man who was important enough to be elected
                        president.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The best biography, by Dorothy Burne Goebel, is over seventy
                    years old. The work has kept its usefulness because Goebel was a sound historian who presents a
                    balanced view of Harrison's public career. She indicates some of the problems in writing a
                    full-scale biography of Harrison with the subtitle <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi> one reason for the absence of a modern biography of Harrison has
                            been the lack of any comprehensive collection of his papers. Many of them were lost when his
                            home in North Bend, <placeName>

                            Library of Congress consists of less than a thousand items. Most of them are from the period
                            of the War of 1812, although there are some earlier items and some material relating to the
                            presidential campaign of 1840. See <hi rend="i">Index to the William Henry Harrison

                    work with this subtitle, Goebel reaches the conclusion that Harrison was at his best in his private
                    life—affectionate with his family, genial, with a capacity for friendship. In public
                    life, Goebel argues, Harrison was a politician, not a statesman, but she tempers this assessment
                    with the comment that this was also true of almost all his public associates. He eagerly sought
                    public office and "did his best, but he lacked the powers of a Calhoun, a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, or a Webster." Goebel finds that Harrison seldom initiated ideas or programs,
                    although he advanced an idealistic image of the republic. As a general, she concludes that he was
                    brave and alert to danger but unwilling to press on after a victory.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two main biographies of Harrison written since Goebel, by Freeman Cleaves and James A. Green,
                    were both published some sixty years ago.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Both of these lack the balance and
                    critical acumen of Goebel, although Cleaves's account is less sycophantic than
                    Green's. Cleaves uses a lively narrative style, avoids extensive analysis, and generally
                    interprets Harrison's actions favorably. Green, a collector of Harrison materials, was
                    quite open about his admiration for his subject and acknowledged help from Harrison's
                    grandchildren. Writing of Harrison in his foreword, he states, "I greatly admire him as a
                    man who did things worth while." This was a laudatory history, written in the tone of some
                    of the nineteenth-century biographies of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It succeeds reasonably well in conjuring up Harrison's era, provides useful
                    details on Harrison's family, his farm, and private life, but makes no attempt to provide a
                    balanced account of Harrison's career. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> says of Harrison's biographers that all of them had been "generous
                    and appreciative" except Goebel. Her book, he writes, "in many
                    ways…falls far short." She had done "a marvelous job of
                    research" but had written her book "without sympathy."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the major biographies of Harrison were written so long ago, they are all traditional in their
                    approach. Discussions that place Harrison in the context of modern historical writing have to be
                    sought in studies other than biographies. Some of the shift in historical trends is revealed in
                    Andrew R. L. Cayton's excellent book on frontier Indiana. Cayton approaches the history of
                    early Indiana through chapters devoted to figures prominent in the early history of the state. For
                    his chapter on the early nineteenth century, Cayton focuses on Harrison's wife rather than
                    Harrison in a chapter entitled "The World of Anna Tuthill Symmes Harrison,
                    1795-1810." He considers Harrison both in the setting of his family and in the context of
                    other immigrants <list type="footnotes">

                    years. In his desire to acquire the land that would provide him with prosperity, Cayton argues,
                    Harrison was typical of the white males moving into the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>. He is
                    depicted as a man prepared to use the existing system, eagerly seeking patrons who would help him
                    secure positions in government. He married the daughter of an important man in frontier <placeName>

                    </placeName> and grasped at every opportunity. As a member of a prominent but declining Virginia
                    family, Harrison knew that he had to shape his own personal and political future and sought to do
                    this in every way. "It is hardly surprising," Cayton writes, "that he
                    made it to the very top, serving as president of his country for one month in the winter of 1841,
                    without anybody being exactly sure of what his principles were."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">The Emerging Midwest</hi>, Nicole Etcheson places Harrison in the context of concerns
                    about republicanism in the early republic. Etcheson argues that in the years from 1790 to 1818
                    upland southern midwesterners feared that an oligarchy was using its wealth and political power to
                    threaten republican principles. In Indiana Territory, Harrison's opponents argued that he
                    thwarted the popular will, influenced elections, speculated in land, and encouraged slavery.
                    Etcheson points out that many of these complaints originated with Harrison's political
                    opponents and that he used similar republican rhetoric in his own defense. He attacked his critics
                    as self-interested men and claimed that he had used his wide powers to defend the liberties of the
                        people.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lack of modern biographies of Harrison and the failure of earlier biographers to catch the
                    essence of the man have meant that it is difficult to obtain any overall sense of his strengths and
                    weaknesses or of what moved him as an individual. Historians of Indiana have depicted him as an
                    influential but controversial territorial governor, yet on the national level it is difficult to see
                    beyond the cardboard image erected by the Whigs to win their "Log-Cabin and Hard Cider
                    Campaign" in 1840. In the piece on Harrison in the recent <hi rend="i">American National
                        Biography</hi>, K. R. Constantine Gutzman states that his "significance is not
                    great" and that "his career in federal political office was a relatively
                    undistinguished one." Even Harrison's record as governor of Indiana Territory is
                    minimized. "His record as a territorial governor was solid," writes Gutzman,
                    "but its social basis—the dominance of the 'Virginians' in the
                    Old Northwest—did not survive him." As a general he is characterized as
                    "less incompetent" than most of the civil and military leaders responsible for
                    American actions in the War of 1812.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> This is not the stuff of heroes. Even

                    more recent historical understanding of the period through which he lived, nor has his career been
                    placed in the context of the new understanding of the changes in America's political
                    culture in the postrevolutionary years. Harrison was born into <placeName>

                    politics of deference had been succeeded by a new, tumultuous republicanism. By 1840 the <placeName>

                    sturdy western farmer and a true representative of the common man. Harrison was presented as a man
                    of the people in contrast to his opponent, who was portrayed as a representative of an eastern
                    elite. Clearly, Harrison's career is revealing of the changing nature of political life in
                    early republican America as well as of changes in individual motivations and expectations.</p>

            <p>In 1791 the tiny American regular army was absorbed in the struggle for the acquisition of Indian

                    culminated in the American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. He became aide-de-camp to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and, by the time he left the army in 1798, had risen to the rank of captain. In

            <p>With this move into territorial government, Harrison began a rapid regional political rise. In 1799
                    the Northwest Territory advanced to the second territorial stage. It received a local assembly and
                    the privilege of sending a delegate to Congress. Harrison was the candidate of those territorial
                    leaders who were in opposition to Governor Arthur St. Clair. As St. Clair was a Federalist, Harrison
                    was later to use this in defending himself against attacks that he had elitist, Federalist leanings,
                    but he was involved at least as much in a power struggle amongst the leaders of the Northwest
                    Territory as he was in any popular resistance to St. Clair's Federalist rule. The
                    legislative election of the territorial delegate was narrowly fought and bitter. St.
                    Clair's candidate was his son, Arthur St. Clair, Jr. The vote resulted in an eleven to ten
                    victory for Harrison. It was an important victory. It sent him to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, D. C., put him in direct contact with others who could help him, and gave him the
                    opportunity to revise the procedure for land sales that became the most popular act of his political
                        career.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The system for the survey and sale of the public lands that had been created by the Ordinance of 1785
                    had initially proved of far more advantage to land speculators than to actual settlers. Although one
                    dollar an acre seemed a reasonable price, the stipulation that the smallest area that could be
                    purchased was 640 acres meant that government land was well beyond the reach of the average settler.
                    The situation had been made worse in 1796, when the price of land was raised to two dollars an acre.
                    In his brief stay in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Harrison took the lead in pressing for a revision of the land law to make it possible
                    for many pioneers to buy land from the federal government. As chairman of the Committee on Public
                    Lands, he reported and urged passage of the bill that became the Land Law of 1800. The new act
                    provided for land west of the <geogName>Muskingum River</geogName> to be sold in lots of 320 acres,
                    for additional land offices to be established in the Old Northwest, and, most important of all, for
                    settlers to be given the chance to buy land over a period of time. The price remained at two dollars
                    an acre, but the settler only had to pay a quarter of the price within forty days of the sale. The
                    rest was due in equal payments at the end of the second, third, and fourth years. This measure led
                    to a great increase in land sales to actual settlers. The credit system was ultimately to be
                    abandoned, but for the rest of his career Harrison reaped benefits from his sponsorship of a bill
                    that was designed to help the small farmers of the West.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>As territorial delegate, Harrison was also the promoter of a measure that was of more immediate
                    importance to his political career. A major fight had erupted in the Northwest Territory over the
                    question of how and when the eastern portion of this vast governmental region would proceed to
                    statehood. Governor St. Clair was maneuvering to have the territory divided in a way that would
                    delay statehood and thus help the Federalist party. His opponents—the '<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> group' to which Harrison belonged—were pressing for a division into
                    two units in such a way that Federalist influence would be lessened in the eastern portion that
                    would become a new state. Harrison used his position as territorial delegate to promote the cause of
                    the anti Clair group, and in 1800 the Northwest Territory was divided into two units: the eastern

            <p>In his later career when the Federalists lost power and ultimately collapsed as a party, Harrison
                    consistently used his election as territorial delegate over St. Clair's son and his major
                    contribution to the passage of the 1800 land law as evidence of his unremitting opposition to
                    elitism and the Federalist party, but his actual record is less clear. During his stay in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Harrison was well received by a Congress that was still controlled by the Federalists.
                    If he had been known as an active Democratic-Republican supporter of Thomas Jefferson, he could
                    hardly have received the appointment as governor of Indiana Territory that was given to him by
                    President John Adams in the spring of 1800. Goebel's opinion is that Harrison was selected
                    through the influence of Federalist leaders, particularly the <placeName>

            <p>Although Harrison had a general faith in the republican society brought into being by the Revolution,
                    he subordinated ardent political commitment to opportunity. He always tried to avoid committing
                    himself to positions that would become irreversible. He was a cautious man, a characteristic that
                    was also to influence his career as a general. That Adams was willing to appoint him as the first
                    governor of Indiana Territory demonstrated that Harrison was quite acceptable to the Federalist
                    party, but before accepting the appointment Harrison made sure that, should Adams lose the 1800

                    </placeName> early in 1801. He was to serve as governor of the territory for twelve years. The
                    position of territorial governor was an anomalous one in an age when republicanism was the American
                    political creed. When the Northwest Ordinance was enacted in 1787, many in the East were fearful
                    that the distant, disorganized settlements beyond the Alleghenies were in danger of breaking away
                    from eastern control. Jefferson's earlier ordinance of 1784, which had granted considerable
                    local powers, was sharply modified to insure that in the early stages of settlement western regions
                    could be tightly controlled by appointees of the central government. In the first stage of
                    settlement all power was given to the governor, three judges, and a secretary. Even in the second
                    stage, the newly created local legislature was to be under the control of the governor. He could
                    dissolve it or prorogue it at will and had a power of absolute veto.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> In the
                    years before the War of 1812 disgruntled settlers in the trans-Allegheny West objected to their lack
                    of powers in the territorial government. Conservative easterners defended the system with the
                    argument that the ordinance provided for full equality as a state of the union when the population
                    of a territory reached 60,000.</p>
            <p>Yet, settlers who had been raised on revolutionary rhetoric and republican ideals objected bitterly
                    to a system that left them with no local rights in the first stage of government and extremely
                    limited local rights in the second stage. In the Northwest Territory the governorship of St. Clair
                    was a source of constant bickering. His authoritarian tendencies were seen by many settlers as a
                    betrayal of what had been fought for in 1776. In the early stages of government, the disputes were
                    heightened by the narrow, parochial nature of territorial politics. There was a village or
                    small-town atmosphere in which cliques formed to support the governor and gain his patronage or to
                    oppose him, his policies, and his friends. This was the pattern with St. Clair in Marietta; the

            <p>Harrison's record as governor of Indiana Territory has generally been viewed favorably by
                    historians. Freeman Cleaves ignores a good deal of evidence in arguing that "Harrison had
                    governed Indiana for nearly eight years with but few evidences of internal turmoil except on the
                    part of the Federalist faction, which naturally had been passed over, in large part, in the matter
                    of appointments." Even Goebel, who depicts far more internal dissension than Cleaves,
                    decides that while Harrison used the spoils system to manipulate territorial politics, much of the
                    dissension probably arose from the outs objecting to the ins. Writing more recently, James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> concludes that Harrison avoided much of the arbitrary conduct that caused St. Clair so
                    much trouble in the Northwest Territory but that "he never enjoyed the full and unqualified
                    support of all the people."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fundamental problem for Harrison in Indiana Territory was that the territorial system gave so
                    much power to territorial governors that they could not avoid extensive resentment. Although the
                    system had abandoned traditional imperial expansion by providing for the admission of new states
                    into the Union as equals, the territorial governor had been given imperial powers in the first two
                    stages of government. The republican rhetoric of the Revolution and the new republican practice in
                    eastern states made this situation unacceptable to many western settlers. They protested against a
                    system that gave them less real power than they had possessed as colonial subjects of the British
                    Crown.</p>
            <p>To the problems inherent in the system, Harrison added the additional difficulty that he had been
                    raised as a member of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> gentry, which was accustomed to the deference and support of the governed. The
                    territorial system denied political power to local citizens at the very moment when the political
                    culture of deference was coming under increased attack. Richard Beeman and Albert Till-son have
                    shown that in newer areas of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, with new conditions and the new credo of republicanism, traditional patterns of
                    deference began to break down.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> In Indiana, Harrison had the additional problem

                    of the state. Also, Harrison's lack of wealth meant that he was eager to better himself
                    through land speculation while serving as governor. This eagerness led to unproved accusations of
                    corruption. While even the well-entrenched gentry of old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> had difficulty coming to terms with the new republican political culture, Harrison had
                    to contend with the problems of political transition while serving in the autocratic position of
                    territorial governor of Indiana Territory.</p>
            <p>Northern settlers who attacked Harrison as an elitist included in their charges his support of
                    slavery, an issue that caused bitter controversy in Indiana Territory. Although the Northwest
                    Ordinance had banned slavery in the Old Northwest, Harrison supported its introduction, arguing that
                    this would encourage the more rapid development of the region. As a youth Harrison had joined an
                    abolition society, but throughout his political career he opposed interference with the rights of
                    slaveowners. During his early years in Indiana he had considerable support for his position. As
                    early as 1796, inhabitants in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> district had petitioned Congress in favor of slavery, and, in spite of the Northwest
                    Ordinance, the French in the region continued to hold slaves. Harrison took up the cause of those
                    who wanted to bring slaves into the region and called for a convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1802. This resulted in a petition asking Congress to suspend the prohibition of
                    slavery for ten years and to provide that slaves brought in during that ten-year period should
                    remain as slaves. The petitioners, including Harrison, placed their request in the context of
                    attracting settlers to Indiana and furthering its development. They also asked for the acquisition
                    of Indian territory, cheaper lands, the encouragement of roads and educational institutions, and
                    voting rights for all free adult males at the time Indiana obtained an assembly.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Congress did not approve this change, but slavery was allowed into Indiana in spite of the Northwest
                    Ordinance. This evasion was encouraged by Harrison and the judges who ruled the territory. In 1803
                    they adopted a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> law that provided for African Americans to work under contract; in practice this meant
                    working as slaves. When Indiana moved to the second stage of territorial government, the assembly
                    cooperated with Harrison in evading the Northwest Ordinance. At first Harrison had resisted the move
                    to the second stage, giving more ammunition to those who were accusing him of autocracy and elitism,
                    but in 1804 he changed his position and called for a vote on the subject. It passed, and the first
                    Indiana territorial assembly met in <placeName>

                    territory. Owners were permitted to bring slaves into the territory for sixty days and during that
                    time either to sign indentures or to sell the slaves back into a state where slavery was allowed. In
                    effect, the indentures provided for slavery under the guise of "servants." In 1810
                    there were over six hundred African Americans in Indiana Territory. Whatever their technical status,
                    many of them were in reality slaves. Harrison himself owned slaves while governor of the

            <p>After 1805 the position of Harrison and the proslavery group weakened as more settlers opposed to
                    slavery moved into the territory. Newcomers argued that Harrison's support of slavery was
                    part of his general desire to retain power in the hands of a small "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> elite" and to resist popular participation in government. Harrison was also
                    plagued by charges of corruption. In 1805 the <hi rend="i">Letters of Decius</hi> accused him of
                    misusing his office for personal gain and of maintaining power by extensive use of the patronage
                    system. For the rest of his time as governor of Indiana, Harrison faced virulent attacks on his
                    conduct. In general, however, historians have acquitted Harrison of the charges of malfeasance in
                    office and have emphasized that none of the accusations of illicit speculation in lands have been
                    proved. Even Jacob P. Dunn, who filled his book with a discussion of the attempts to establish
                    slavery in Indiana, clears Harrison of personal and political misconduct. He comments that
                    "no man in public life ever had so many serious charges preferred against his honesty, and
                    came forth from his trials so fully vindicated by his judges and by the people, as did William Henry
                    Harrison. His private life had its blots, but his public record was remarkably clean."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the years directly preceding the War of 1812 the opponents of slavery gained strength from the
                    increasing tide of settlers from northern states. In 1810 the assembly repealed the 1805 indenture
                    law, although it did not change the status of those already serving indentures. For Harrison this
                    represented a stage in the decline of his personal power in Indiana. Increasingly the attack on the
                    proslavery position was combined with an advocacy of "popular" republican
                    government against what was perceived as a narrow clique led by Harrison. Anti-Harrison forces
                    persuaded Congress to expand voting rights and permit the election of the legislative council. When
                    the second stage of territorial government came into effect, Harrison had been able to arrange for a
                    friend, Benjamin Parke, to be sent as Indiana's delegate to Congress, but in 1809
                    Harrison's candidate, Virginian Thomas <placeName>

                    Harrison's power weakened in his last years as territorial governor.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As governor of Indiana Territory, Harrison also served as superintendent of Indian affairs, and in
                    this capacity he pursued American aims with relentless vigor. In his two terms as president,
                    Jefferson had very clear objectives in his Indian policy. He maintained that the cession of large
                    areas of their lands was in the best interest of both the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the Indians. In this way the U.S. could obtain the lands necessary for a growing
                    population to create an "Empire for Liberty" while the Indians would be persuaded
                    to give up their way of life and become farmers in the American mold. Neither Jefferson nor
                    Secretary of War Henry Dearborn had qualms about urging Harrison to obtain Indian lands rapidly and
                    by all possible means.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Harrison could have no doubt about the policies he was
                    expected to pursue. It was in his interest to seek Indian lands with all possible speed.</p>
            <p>Beginning in 1802 Harrison set about achieving Jefferson's objectives through a series of
                    negotiations with the Indians of the Old Northwest. By 1809 he had obtained most of southern
                    Indiana, much of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and lands in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. Negotiations culminated at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> in September 1809 when, ignoring Indian dissatisfaction about the lands they had been
                    pressured to yield in the previous seven years, Harrison forced the Indians into additional
                    cessions. There are few signs in Harrison's correspondence or speeches that he was deeply
                    moved by the ardent Jeffersonian belief that denying Indians access to hunting lands and
                    "civilizing" them would be means of saving the Indians from destruction in the
                    path of the white advance. Harrison was carrying out policies that Jefferson had ordered; he was
                    obtaining lands that he thought were essential for the development of Indiana Territory; and he was
                    pursuing Indian policies that undoubtedly had the support of most of the new settlers in Indiana
                    Territory.</p>
            <p>In his relentless drive for Indian lands, Harrison became the primary instigator of the Tecumseh
                    confederacy. In response both to land loss and to American efforts to persuade the Indians to
                    abandon their way of life, the Shawnee Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa, the Shawnee Prophet,
                    shaped an alliance of Indians, first at Greenville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and from 1808 at <placeName>

                    </placeName> in northern Indiana. Harrison refused to acknowledge that the Jeffersonian Indian
                    policies he was vigorously pursuing were the basic cause of Indian resistance, and in the years
                    preceding the War of 1812 he repeatedly told <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Harrison was ready to pursue all possible means to secure an expanding and prosperous Indiana
                    territory, and he believed that removing the Indians and bringing in slaves would help. In obtaining
                    Indian lands Harrison could please both the new settlers and the president he depended on for his
                    position. It is not surprising that he proved willing to ride roughshod over Indian objections to
                    the cessions of their lands.</p>
            <p>The land acquisition policies that culminated in the treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> also returned Harrison to the military career that he had left in 1798. After <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indian discontent at American policies began to peak, incidents multiplied, and

                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> that there was a danger of more general hostilities. Harrison had begun his career in
                    the West in the military campaign culminating in General Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s decisive victory over the Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, and he
                    was attracted to the idea of another display of military power to quell Indian resistance and pave
                    the way for further cessions. He was to be less successful than <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, and his actions raised questions regarding his military abilities that were to beset
                    him for the rest of his career.</p>
            <p>In October 1811 Harrison led a force north from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the vicinity of Prophetstown. Tecumseh was away visiting southern tribes, but his
                    brother, the Prophet, decided to forestall any American move against the village with a surprise
                    dawn attack on the American encampment. The Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, which took place on November 7, resulted in the dispersal of the Indians and the
                    destruction of Prophetstown, but it was hardly the great victory later claimed by Harrison and his
                    supporters. In the 1840 election there was an attempt to equate Harrison's clash at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> with Andrew Jackson's victory at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1814, but the two engagements were very different. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> Jackson decisively defeated the British force that attacked him; the total British
                    casualties were about two thousand and American casualties less than one hundred. At <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, Harrison scattered the Indians and destroyed Prophetstown, but Indian hostilities
                    increased rather than lessened in the months after the battle. In the following year they were to
                    merge into the War of 1812. Moreover, Harrison's losses were heavy; about one-fifth of his
                    men were killed or wounded. Indian losses were uncertain but probably did not exceed those of the
                        Americans.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>When Harrison and his men returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> a major controversy ensued. Dismayed at the American casualties, critics said that
                    Harrison had been surprised by the Indians, his preparations had been inadequate, and he had been
                    saved only by the presence of regulars. Harrison's opponents in the Indiana legislature and
                    John Jennings, the Indiana congressional delegate, were happy to use the criticisms to lambaste the
                    governor. In late November and early December discussions in the Indiana assembly were acrimonious.
                    The first resolutions adopted by the assembly singled out the regulars for praise while neglecting
                    Harrison and the militia. Ultimately, after a protest from Harrison, the assembly and the
                    legislative council agreed on a wording that included the governor in the thanks. For Harrison this
                    was hardly a triumphal return to <placeName>

                    little from his costly campaign. Harrison's efforts do not quite amount to the
                    "great victory" that Green describes or the "memorable campaign"
                    that Cleaves judges it.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    Eustis appointed Brigadier General James Winchester to the command of the Northwestern forces.
                    Harrison persevered. At first, he had to be content with a position as major general in the <placeName>

            <p>Harrison's War of 1812 career lasted from the fall of 1812 to the early months of 1814. As

                    acclaim. Like all other commanding officers in the War of 1812, Harrison worked under severe
                    limitations. The command structure was flawed, the supply system was inefficient, and the relations
                    between federal regular troops and state militia were a frequent cause of disagreement and delay.
                    American military preparations for the conflict had been totally inadequate. For Harrison there were
                    other problems. In the fall of 1812 he inherited a disastrous situation in the Northwest. Hull had

                    in the hope of regaining some of the lands they had lost to the Americans in the prewar years.
                    Harrison's only advantage was that the West was generally enthusiastic in support of the
                    war and willing to supply militia and volunteers.</p>
            <p>In a war in which numerous commanding officers were dismissed and ruined, Harrison managed to survive
                    and achieve reasonable success. This in itself was a major achievement for which neither his
                    contemporaries nor many later historians were willing to give him sufficient credit. Harrison was
                    able to gain the confidence of the ordinary soldiers under his command but frequently received
                    criticism from officers who found him too cautious. He was reluctant to move without extensive
                    preparations, and when he won a victory he did not vigorously press his advantage. The forces under
                    his direct command were unlikely to find themselves in hopeless positions, but he was unwilling to
                    take the risks necessary to achieve striking success.</p>
            <p>Harrison's efforts in the Northwest began with a bad defeat caused primarily by an
                    ill-advised move by the disgruntled General Winchester, who had lost command of the Northwestern
                    army to Harrison. Winchester, forming the left wing of Harrison's army, was situated along
                    the <geogName>Maumee River</geogName> in northwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. In January 1813 he rashly advanced with a large part of his force to occupy Frenchtown
                    on the River Raisin within twenty miles of what was now the British post of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There he was surprised and defeated by a British force from Fort Malden. The fault was
                    Winchester's rather than Harrison's, but some argued that Harrison had exposed
                    part of his main army before adequate preparations had been made to regain control of the <placeName>

                    indecisive action on land, Commander Oliver Hazard Perry's victory at the Battle of
                    Put-in-Bay in September 1813 gave Harrison the chance for his most successful battle. With Lake Erie
                    in American hands, the British could not supply their western army and their Indian allies. The
                    British commander, Colonel Henry Procter, decided to retreat to the head of Lake <placeName>

                    </placeName>. When Harrison received news of Perry's victory, he moved his forces to the

                    incompetence of Procter as on his own actions. As the British retreated eastward, Procter's
                    troops and his Indian allies, led by Tecumseh, lost confidence in him. Harrison's own
                    opinion when he arrived near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> was that he had no chance of overtaking the retreating British, and he took several
                    days to move eastwards.</p>

            <p>Fortunately for Harrison, the British retreat was ill-conducted. Procter often failed to give the
                    necessary orders, bridges were left intact, and confusion reigned. On October 5 Harrison's
                    force overtook the British at Moraviantown on the Thames River. Procter had failed to fortify his
                    position and had put himself in the position of facing Harrison's advancing army of over
                    3,000 men with a total force (including some 500 Indians) of about 1,000. He hoped the wooded area
                    would prevent the American use of their <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> horsemen against the British position. There was little resistance. Demoralized by
                    Procter's lack of leadership on the retreat, the British broke and fled. Some of the main
                    American fighting was against the Indians who held the right of the British line. In hand-to-hand
                    fighting Tecumseh was killed, the Indians finally fled, and Harrison had won a far clearer victory
                    at the Battle of the Thames than he had at <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Even this victory did not succeed in giving Harrison a great military reputation. Some criticized the
                    caution with which he had begun the pursuit of Procter, and while the victory had ensured the safety
                    of the <placeName>

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. As it was late in the campaigning season, Harrison decided to take no further action.
                    He faced the fundamental problem that he was far from the areas in which a successful invasion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> could be launched. To advance farther east toward Lake <placeName>

                    </placeName> would bring risks without the chance of any great accomplishment. He was accused,
                    however, of being too ready to rest on the laurels of a single victory. Ultimately, the commander of

                    the Thames than Harrison. When Johnson was elected as Martin <placeName>

                    in the battle and the claim that he had killed the great chief Tecumseh. In both the elections of
                    1836 and 1840 Harrison appealed to army veterans, but the indecisive Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> rather than the clear victory at the Thames was invoked as a rallying cry.</p>
            <p>Harrison ended his military career in anticlimax. Serving in the Niagara theater, he soon found
                    himself in conflict with John Armstrong, the secretary of war who had succeeded Eustis. Armstrong
                    had an extremely difficult job, and he made it worse by his habit of interfering in details that
                    should have been left to subordinates. In the winter of 1813-1814 relations between Harrison and
                    Armstrong worsened, and in May Harrison resigned.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> After helping to negotiate

            <p>In the following years Harrison found himself at the center of considerable controversy concerning
                    his military record. This controversy and the writings it generated have had a permanent effect on
                    depictions of Harrison. The major argument began in 1816 with the publication of Robert B.
                    McAfee's <hi rend="i">History of the Late War in the Western Country.</hi> McAfee, who had
                    served in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Mounted Infantry under Harrison, submitted his manuscript to Harrison before it was
                    published. Unsurprisingly, the book praised Harrison, but it criticized Winchester. In the following
                    year, Winchester defended himself in several articles in the <hi rend="i">National
                    Intelligencer.</hi> His articles cast doubt on Harrison's competence and raised charges
                    that he would never have pursued Procter and won the Battle of the Thames without considerable
                    pressure from others. Also, Harrison's integrity was questioned in regard to the purchase
                    and distribution of supplies for the Northwestern army. The Senate caused Harrison considerable
                    offense by striking his name from a resolution that was to award him a medal along with Governor
                    Isaac <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. A full investigation cleared Harrison, and in 1818 the Senate reversed itself in
                    granting him a medal. However, some of the mud stuck.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the time <hi rend="i">of The Letters of Decius</hi> in 1805 there had been few years when
                    Harrison had been free from attack. He had managed to clear himself of the charges of corruption,
                    but he remained extremely sensitive to criticism of his record as a soldier. He continually found it
                    necessary to justify his actions. After the controversy produced by McAfee's <hi rend="i">History of the Late War in the Western Country</hi>, Harrison's war record was badly
                    in need of refurbishing. In 1824 this was attempted in Moses Dawson's <hi rend="i">A
                        Historical Narrative of the Civil and Military Services of Major-General William Henry Harrison,
                        and a Vindication of His Character and Conduct as a Statesman, a Citizen, and a Soldier</hi> (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1824). Although Dawson was later to break with Harrison, at that time he was a good
                    friend. As editor of the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Advertiser</hi> he was in regular contact with the old general. As with
                    McAfee's book, Harrison vetted it before publication, and Harrison's friendly
                    biographer Green says that it is very likely that Harrison wrote parts of the book. In spite of its
                    provenance as a defense of Harrison's record against attack, it has been much used by later
                    biographers. Green comments that though it was the earliest of the Harrison biographies, it remains
                    the best. Certainly it provides much detail that is difficult to find elsewhere, but equally it has
                    to be used with caution as it reflects Harrison's record as viewed by the Harrison circle
                    and by Harrison himself.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

                    showed sympathy for the internal improvement policies of Henry Clay and became one of <placeName>

            <p>Since the death of his father in the early 1790s, Harrison's actions had frequently been
                    dictated by his desire to recoup his fortunes. From the very beginning of his career he had eagerly
                    sought patrons. His speculations in land and his various commercial ventures did not give him the
                    comfortable financial security that he so desired. Even his marriage to the daughter of major land
                    speculator John Cleves Symmes was not the source of support that he might have expected, for Symmes
                    encountered severe financial problems in his later years.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>In the 1820s, Harrison's continued quest for financial security led him to seek positions
                    that paid better than service in the House or Senate. His persistence annoyed President John Quincy
                    Adams, who in 1828 commented in his diary that Harrison's "thirst for lucrative
                    office is absolutely rabid." Harrison, he wrote, was a man with "a lively and

                        <country reg="ck">Colombia</country>
                    </placeName> early in 1829 the country was in a state of crisis. Simon Bolivar's dreams of
                    unity had collapsed, and he was facing both internal dissension and a war with Peru. Exasperated at
                    the divisions, Bolivar was taking more power into his own hands. Harrison, who had no diplomatic
                    experience except in dictating treaties to a variety of Indian tribes, was ill-suited for the
                    position of representative to a volatile and sensitive Latin American nation. Soon after his arrival
                    he became convinced that Bolivar was using the army to run <placeName>
                        <country reg="ck">Colombia</country>
                    </placeName> and that he intended to abandon republican principles, expand his nation, and assume
                    the position of emperor. Although Harrison had proved capable of adapting his political convictions
                    to suit the time or situation, he took pride in the republicanism of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He became indiscreet in his sympathy for those in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ck">Colombia</country>
                    </placeName> who were plotting against Bolívar.</p>
            <p>Bolívar abandoned any plan to create a monarchy, but in his brief stay as minister
                    Harrison completely alienated the Colombian government. His stay was brief, because by the time he
                    reached his post Adams had lost the 1828 election to Jackson. The new president quickly recalled
                    Harrison, a man he viewed as an old enemy. Harrison, however, stayed in his position until the new
                    American minister arrived in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ck">Colombia</country>
                    </placeName> in September 1829. Within a week of being replaced Harrison took a last and most
                    undiplomatic step. He wrote a long letter to Bolivar criticizing the militarism of his rule, holding
                    out to him the example of the restraint of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and urging him to adhere to principles of republicanism. The letter was a ardent
                    avowal of republican principles that Harrison's opponents had frequently accused him of
                    lacking, but it was totally inappropriate as a gesture by a recent American minister. In his last
                    days in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ck">Colombia</country>
                    </placeName>, Harrison came close to arrest. One biographer of Bolivar commented of
                    Harrison's letter that "Diplomatic history does not record a more flagrant case of
                    the violation of the duties of neutrality and diplomatic convention."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    </placeName>, and the success of Jacksonianism, it might well have seemed that Harrison's
                    career was at an end. He was so strapped financially that in 1834 he was happy to obtain the job of
                    clerk of courts of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. He was pleased with the position because the fees connected with it brought in a
                    substantial income.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What finally gave Harrison the chance for his greatest victory was the emergence in the late 1830s of
                    the Whig party. He was further helped by the party's internal divisions. Southern and
                    northern opponents of Jackson held very different views of how the country should be run, and in the
                    latter half of the 1830s the Whigs had neither a tightly-knit organization nor a coherent set of
                    principles. Although Harrison lacked the unchallenged military credentials of Jackson, he had won
                    victories over both the Indians and the British and could be put forward as a military hero. Another
                    advantage was his reluctance to take strong positions on the most divisive political issues of the
                    day. He had straddled many fences. His most striking defense of any particular position had been his
                    statement of the principles of republicanism to Bolivar. While this had gravely offended the
                    Colombian government, it helped him with the American people.</p>
            <p>In the mid-1830s the Whig party had not yet fully crystallized, and various names were floated as
                    possible presidential candidates. Harrison's name began to appear in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers came out strongly for him. Although Harrison did not have the stature of
                    Whig leaders such as Henry Clay or Daniel Webster, he was helped by the feeling that this would be a
                    very difficult year for a Whig to win. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> was waiting for a better opportunity. The Whigs were happy to place several candidates
                    in the field, both to satisfy different wings of the emerging party and in the hope of throwing the
                    election into the House of Representatives. Out of the various state conventions, legislative
                    nominations, and local meetings Harrison emerged as one of three candidates, together with Webster
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>

                    </placeName>. Adams characterized Harrison and White as "men of moderate capacity"
                    but of long and varied public service. His additional comment that they were at least as competent
                    for the presidency as Andrew Jackson was probably more a criticism of Jackson than it was praise for
                    Harrison and White.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>The Whigs wanted to cut into Jackson's base of popular support and were anxious to counter

                    was by far the most successful. He obtained almost 25 percent of the vote, while no one of the other
                    Whigs could muster 10 percent.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Harrison had proved attractive as an old
                    general, and, like Andrew Jackson in 1824, he had no unpopular political stands at the national
                    level.</p>
            <p>The panic of 1837 and the subsequent decline in the fortunes of the Democratic party meant that
                    candidates sought the 1840 Whig nomination with far more eagerness. With his 1836 showing, Harrison
                    immediately emerged as the leading challenger to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and Webster. Historians have traditionally placed great emphasis on the Whigs'
                    "Log-Cabin and Hard-Cider" campaign, which sold Harrison as a man of the people
                    who would better represent them than the "aristocratic" <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren. However, recent political historians have emphasized the degree to which the
                    Whig victory was not only dependent on image-making. Michael Holt points out that the key element in
                    the 1840 election was voter belief that the Democrats had brought on a depression that they were
                    then unwilling to tackle. The Whigs had shown at the state level that they were willing to take
                    vigorous action to change the prevailing economic conditions, and this proved extremely attractive
                    to the voters. A remarkable 80.2 percent of the electorate voted in 1840, and 37.5 percent of the
                    ballots in the 1840 election were cast by new voters.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Holt argues that Harrison's image was of greatest assistance not for his election victory
                    but for his nomination. This was not simply a matter of his characterization as the honest
                    farmer-patriarch of North Bend and the hero of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>; it was also that Harrison's political caution had made him less vulnerable to
                    attack than other candidates. It was far easier to defend his controversial record as a general than
                    it would have been to explain away any strongly-argued <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Although it seems quite possible that any Whig nominee could have won in 1840, the
                    "Log-Cabin and Hard-Cider Campaign" under which Harrison ran began a new era in
                    election image-making. At the age of sixty-seven Harrison showed great enthusiasm in playing his
                    role. The Whig strategy was remarkably successful in creating the kind of candidate they wished to
                    place before the people. Although southern Whig supporters were wooed by reference to
                    Harrison's long record of noninterference with the rights of slaveowners, the primary image
                    was of a simple, noble character. Nearly fifty years after the election, one of Harrison's
                    old supporters wrote in his preface to a collection of 1840 election materials that "It was
                    remarkable as the first campaign in which the candidate was emphatically one of the
                    people—a poor and honorable farmer." He remembered it as the first campaign in
                    which women were generally engaged and the first in which the lines were clearly drawn between the
                    people and the officeholders. The old Harrison supporter wrote that "honest men felt a just
                    pride in the plain old farmer of North Bend." That a younger son of a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> governor born at Berkeley plantation, who had been a proslavery territorial governor of
                    Indiana could be remembered in such terms is an indication of how successful the Whigs and Harrison
                    had been in creating the image they desired.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> A question that needs answering
                    is the degree to which Harrison himself had been transformed in his four decades in politics. By
                    1840, Harrison proved willing to present himself to the people by actively campaigning. Ironically,
                    his campaign was helped by the reasonably simple life style that had resulted from his lack of
                    success in acquiring the wealth he had sought.</p>

            <p>Harrison was a tireless campaigner, and for the first time a presidential candidate actually took to
                    the hustings. He talked in generalities and avoided issues, except for opposing the excessive use of
                    presidential power. He argued for serving a single term and the limited use of the presidential
                    veto. Harrison stressed his military service to the country and his life as a practical farmer. He
                    was vague on issues such as the bank, the tariff, and slavery. His opponents attacked his military
                    career, stressed that he was no simple farmer, and accused him of being a Federalist because he had
                    served under John Adams. The campaign literature that supported Harrison reiterated the themes of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> and the honest farmer of North Bend. Songs heralded "The hero plowman of North
                    Bend" and the "hero of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>" with "no ruffed shirt, no silken hose." Harrison was made
                    to represent an earlier, a more heroic America of yeoman farmers instead of eastern monied
                        elites.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> The popular vote was very close, but Harrison won by a decisive
                    234 to 60 electoral votes. He carried nineteen states to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Buren's seven.</p>
            <p>Once in office, Harrison had very little time to enjoy his triumph. He lived for only a month after
                    his inaugural in March 1841. He showed signs in his brief tenure that he would have shaped his own
                    course. His inaugural was extremely long. It emphasized a limited role for the presidency, with
                    little use of the veto and service for a single term. Webster read it in advance and removed an
                    excessive number of classical references. From the time of his arrival in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in February, Harrison had distanced himself from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and showed a willingness to turn to Webster. How he would have fared in dealing with
                    Congress is unknown, because by April 4 Harrison was dead from a cold that turned to pneumonia and
                        pleurisy.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an obvious need for a modern, balanced biography of Harrison, and the new microfilm
                    collection from the Indiana Historical Society will greatly ease this task. Over seventy years ago,
                    Goebel did a good job of researching Harrison's public life and assessing his contribution,
                    but much more needs to be done. Harrison's role as a politician needs to be placed in the
                    context of the abundant research carried out in the past half century on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> gentry, the transition from the political culture of deference to that of
                    republicanism, and the origins of the second party system. His military contribution also needs a
                    general reassessment. Perhaps most of all, an attempt needs to be made to understand Harrison the
                    man. Goebel largely avoided this task. He is not an easy figure to depict or understand. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>No fact about the Shawnee chieftain Tecumseh is more notorious than his journeys through the Indian
                    country in the years before the War of 1812 arguing the need for intertribal peace and unity to

                    </placeName>. His principal opponent, the governor of Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison,
                    paid him a much-quoted tribute on August 7, 1811. Tecumseh, said Harrison, was <quote rend="blockquote">

                            letters. For four years he has been in constant motion. You see him today on the shores of

            <p>This "constant motion" has given rise to many stories of Tecumseh visiting Indian
                    communities that have resembled, at times, an aboriginal version of the "George <placeName>

                    grossly exaggerated or reflected a reality known to him but since lost to us remain. In a biography
                    published in 1956, Glenn Tucker offers a reconstruction of Tecumseh's travels
                    indiscriminately extracted from history, hearsay, and folklore. His assertions that Tecumseh was on

                    factual footing. On the basis of his information, Goltz accepts that there was satisfactory evidence
                    to establish a few of Tecumseh's journeys out of Indiana Territory, but he protests that
                    writers had "added literally thousands of miles" to the chiefs known travels by
                    utilizing apocryphal material.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> A careful historian, he emphasizes the
                    importance of keying events to credible historical sources.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Tecumseh's career presents the scholar with unusual difficulties. Neither
                    Tecumseh nor his Indian associates left personal papers, and for the most part notice of their
                    activities in the remote areas of the frontier comes to us through chance or brief remarks in the
                    correspondence of "outsiders": traders, military officers, and government Indian
                    agents and officials. Since his mission after 1809 was hostile to the Americans, Tecumseh also
                    shrouded his councils in secrecy when talking to whites. In such circumstances it is not surprising
                    that most of the details of the chiefs life, including his travels, have been lost.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the primary materials are so incomplete and variable in quality that the serious historian is
                    in danger of becoming prematurely defeatist. Tecumseh has also suffered from partisan writing. He
                    has been the subject of much adulation, some denigration, and attempts to exaggerate or minimize his
                    importance. Material has occasionally been accepted or dismissed with less than evenhanded-ness. It
                    is necessary not only to sift the evidence diligently, but as far as possible to do so with an open
                    mind. At the same time, to attempt a "definitive" statement of Tecumseh's
                    travels is unrealistic. The work of every scholar must necessarily reflect individual judgments of
                    Tecumseh, his historical circumstances, and the provenance of evidence.</p>
            <p>This article is not a detailed investigation of Tecumseh's journeys during the years he and
                    his brother, the Prophet Lalawethika (later Tenskwatawa), attempted to build an Indian
                        confederacy.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Instead what follows is a summary of what is known about these

            <p>When Ward reported all the chiefs missing, we can be pretty sure he meant what he said. Tecumseh was
                    an important leader in the town, and had he been present the Indians would surely have directed the
                    visitors to him. Thus, when some Shakers visited Greenville a few months before and asked for the
                    "chiefs" they were told that "one is Lallawasheka &amp; [the other]
                    his brother Tekumsaw."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Not only that, but both Ward and Kenton knew
                    Tecumseh well because they had negotiated with him at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> the previous June. Ward's inability to find the chiefs and the information
                    that they were either with the Shakers or at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> are then reasonable pieces of evidence that Tecumseh was away on business.</p>

                    </placeName>, between August 28 and September 3 visiting the Shaker community. Their
                    "spokesman" was Nancy (probably Nancy Blue-Jacket), but the Shakers made no
                    reference to either the Prophet or Tecumseh being with the party. Since they knew and appreciated
                    them both, the omission suggests the brothers were not present.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    </placeName> was a more likely destination for Tecumseh. Blue Jacket represented the band in
                    discussions with William Hull, governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Territory, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> about the end of August. On his way home, Blue Jacket visited the important Wyandot
                    settlement of Brownstown on the <geogName>Detroit River</geogName>. Brownstown had symbolic
                    significance as the "council fire" of the old pan-Indian confederacy of the 1790s,
                    and the Wyandots were the keepers of the great wampum belt that had represented that union. In his
                    council with the Wyandots, Blue Jacket agreed that if war between the U.S. and Britain broke out,
                    the Indians should stay united and neutral.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tecumseh was unknown to Hull at this time and could have passed unnoticed in Blue Jacket's
                    entourage, although if he was there it is surprising that he never stood forward to refute charges
                    that the Indians at Greenville were hostile to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, as he would do in <placeName>

                    </placeName> a few weeks later. Evidently Blue Jacket alone shouldered that responsibility. Blue
                    Jacket was at Brownstown about September 3 and ten days later returned to Greenville.</p>
            <p>Since the Ward-Kenton party were told that the chiefs had gone to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there is a good chance that Tecumseh was with Blue Jacket. This is the first evidence

                    A party of Indians, "Shawanoes and others, "visited the headquarters of the once
                    powerful Iroquois League at Buffalo Creek near Niagara, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. They stayed for thirty-five days, attended a large meeting at which representatives of
                    all six member tribes of the league were present, and left shortly before August 18. Details are
                    scanty, but the Indians reaffirmed their solidarity, whether war broke out or not, and the western
                    Indians showed a great interest in the leading Iroquois prophet, Handsome Lake, a Seneca Indian.
                    They even requested that he return with them, but he refused.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The probability is that this delegation came from Greenville rather than from Wapakoneta, and if
                    Tecumseh led it his absence from Greenville would be explained. If he left Greenville soon after his
                    return from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he could have been at Buffalo Creek about the middle of July. Leaving Niagara about
                    mid-August would have given him time to reach Greenville by September 12. At the moment, however,
                    the matter simply cannot be clarified. Tecumseh clearly had gone somewhere in August 1807, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Niagara are likely destinations, but this falls far short of clinching a case.
                    Therefore Harrison's implication that Tecumseh began his recruiting in 1807 seems
                    unsupported.</p>
            <p>During the winter the band moved from Greenville to the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> where they
                    founded Prophetstown below the mouth of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1808. From here Tecumseh certainly did make a journey to speak to possible allies,
                    in June and July of 1808. The chief visited the British post of Fort Malden at Amherstburg on the
                    Canadian side of the <geogName>Detroit River</geogName>. Responding to British invitations, he
                    renewed his friendship with their agents without committing himself to supporting the king if
                    another war with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> occurred. On the same trip Tecumseh visited the Shawnees and the Wyandots of the
                        <geogName>Detroit River</geogName>, Blue Jacket's former band, and at Fort Malden spoke
                    to local Ottawas, Ojibwas and Potawatomis, Mohawks from the <geogName>Grand River</geogName> in <placeName>

                    game upon which the Indians depended. In 1808 Meriwether Lewis, governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Territory, was also attempting to impose a one-sided justice upon the Indians. While
                    crimes against Indians generally went unpunished, he pressed the Sacs and Iowas to deliver murderers
                    of whites to <placeName>

                    </placeName> for trial and threatened to embargo their trade and drive them from their lands if they
                    refused. Because of an insufficiency of American trade goods in the region, Indian tribesmen turned
                    to British traders and probably imbibed further anti-American feeling. By April 1809 the Sacs and
                    Winnebagoes planned to attack the American forts and appealed to neighboring Indians for help.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    reformers to take part in their plan to attack the garrisons. Yet, Tecumseh seems to have spoken
                    openly of the Winnebago plans. Although Harrison indulged in a good deal of propaganda, opinion

                    a brother of the Prophet's, who acts as his ambassador. The Prophet says that nine tribes
                    had confederated to make war upon us, and he claims the merit of having prevailed upon them to give
                    up the design."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>Tecumseh was a self-assured, commanding figure, very much his own man, as records of the
                    relationships between the brothers show, but throughout his journeys he presented himself as the
                    representative of the Prophet. Although the most active of the party and increasingly its director,
                    Tecumseh undoubtedly accepted many of his brother's doctrines and understood the importance
                    of the Prophet as a figurehead. After all it was he, not Tecumseh, who spoke for the ultimate
                    authority, Waashaa Monetoo himself. On this occasion Tecumseh likely reinforced his
                    brother's invitations to the <placeName>

                        Prophet.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> As for the Winnebagoes, they were already closely involved with

                    Tecumseh's next trip may have had a grimmer purpose. In the autumn of 1809 he traveled east

            <p>Tecumseh returned from his northern journey in June 1810 and two months later had a famous
                    confrontation with Harrison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He planned a summer trip to the Creek country in present-day <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>. However, Tecumseh postponed that mission.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> By 1810
                    Tecumseh's plans to unite the tribes were in full swing. If Tecumseh delayed his journey
                    south it seems unlikely that he would have done so merely to spend the most reasonable traveling
                    season in relative idleness while the crisis grew around him. Nothing in the meeting with Harrison
                    engendered complacency. It would have been clear to Tecumseh that the governor fully intended to see
                    the land acquired at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> settled and that conflict was brewing. The most probable reason for the postponement of
                    the southern trip is that Tecumseh found more urgent work elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, at this point our best primary sources let us down, for so far no contemporary
                    references to the chiefs activities during the late summer and the fall of 1810 have been
                    discovered. During his visit to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in August, Tecumseh had eagerly anticipated an important intertribal conference at
                    Brownstown on the <geogName>Detroit River</geogName>. "I am a warrior," he said,
                    "and all the warriors will meet together in two or three moons from this. Then I will call
                    for those chiefs that sold you [Harrison] the land &amp; shall know what to do with
                    them." He reminded his Wea and Potawatomi followers that "in two moons we shall
                    assemble at the Huron village [Brownstown]…where the great belts of all the tribes are
                    kept &amp; there settle our differences."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> This would seem to be
                    one reason why Tecumseh canceled a southern trip, but when the council took place in September 1810,
                    Tecumseh was not there to raise the land issue. In fact, the Indians who attended had to send a
                    speech to Prophetstown to inform "our younger brethren the Shawanoese" of their
                        deliberations.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A likely scenario is that Tecumseh went west again to persuade Indian communities on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and upper <geogName>Mississippi Rivers</geogName> to either move to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> or at least to support a union. No clear contemporary reference to an 1810 western trip
                    has yet been discovered. Harrison's letter of August 7, 1811, indicates that the chief

            <p>Shabeni was one of Tecumseh's allies, the headman of a small Potawatomi village on the
                        <geogName>Fox River</geogName> (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>). Evidently he recounted a journey undertaken in the summer of 1810 to Nehemiah Mat-son
                    in 1836. This narrative takes up the trip where Tecumseh and his entourage called upon Shabeni at
                    his village and recruited him for a tour of Potawatomi villages on the <geogName>Illinois
                    River</geogName>. The party then ascended the <geogName>Rock River</geogName> into the country of
                    the Winnebagoes as far as Green Bay, crossed to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, and followed it down river visiting the Foxes and Sacs along the way. At the mouth of
                    the <geogName>Rock River</geogName> Shabeni parted with Tecumseh. The Shawnee went south to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, whereas Shabeni turned towards home, and his story accordingly ends.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shabeni's account finds some support in independent traditions. The Menominees of Green Bay
                    had a tradition of Tecumseh's visiting them, and there are indications that Tecumseh
                    visited the <placeName>

                    and ran into 1810. Lesieur's dating is faulty, but his assertion that Tecumseh intervened
                    with the witchcraft trials a year after they began clearly locates the incident in summer 1810.
                    Then, too, a visit in 1810 makes sense of a remark Tecumseh made to Harrison the following year. He
                    told the governor "the Osage [murdered] one of his relations, and yet he had forborne to
                    revenge them. That he had even taken the tomahawks out of the hands of those who were ready to march
                    against the Osages." Almost certainly Tecumseh was referring to a dispute that occurred
                    between the Osages and <placeName>

                    Witnesses also tend to rationalize past behavior or to remold memories of events according to what
                    happened afterwards. In this instance Shabeni was not a young man at the time he knew Matson, and

            <p>We are on firmer ground for a journey made by Tecumseh at the end of the year. He visited the British
                    at Fort Malden with Potawatomis, Ottawas, Winnebagoes, and Sacs in his entourage. On November 15
                    Tecumseh gave Indian agent Matthew Elliott the impression that "the confederacy is almost
                    general" and requested supplies for a defensive war against the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He also announced his intention to complete the confederacy by making a trip south to
                    "the Mid Day."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tecumseh again abandoned his plan to travel south in the spring and found himself cultivating old

                    there is no record of it, and he had to appoint a separate delegation to complete his original

                    until the following year that one of Tecumseh's agents incited the Seminoles.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Nor is it known whether Tecumseh visited any Cherokee villages, although there was time
                    for him to have done so in October and November 1811 when the records are silent about his progress.
                    In the late-nineteenth century Lyman C. Draper inquired among the Cherokees, but it was already too
                    late to collect eyewitness testimony. J. T. Adair informed Draper that he had "often heard
                    the old folks speak of his [Tecumseh's] visit in the old Cherokee nation." Another
                    correspondent explained that "the rememberance [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of his visit to the
                    Cherokees is general among the people, but almost all the older members of the tribe having passed
                    away, it is exceedingly difficult to gather up any particular further than the fact of his
                    visit." But no specific details from credible witnesses appear to have survived.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    </placeName> to fulfill the remainder of his itinerary. In August he had told Harrison that he
                    intended to visit the Osages. This plan must have been made in the knowledge that the Osages had
                    still not resolved their differences with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> officials. However, they may have been eager to close the incident, and an intertribal
                    delegation such as Tecumseh's, composed of Shawnees, Kickapoos, Winnebagoes, and Creeks,
                    would have been difficult for the Osages to injure without incurring serious consequences. Still, a
                    question must remain about whether Tecumseh managed to visit the Osages. He planned to do so, and
                    the famous narrative of John Dunn Hunter places him among the Osages. But no contemporary report of
                    such a visit was made, and the veracity of Hunter's account is uncertain.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> about the end of January 1812. During his six-month odyssey he had experienced
                    failures, but Tecumseh had planted the seeds of the Prophet's religion in the South and
                    drawn substantial numbers of Creeks to his message.</p>
            <p>In February 1812 Tecumseh tried to put his affairs in Indiana Territory in order by sending one
                    delegation to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to appease Harrison and another to Fort Malden for supplies. By the end of the month he
                    may have returned to recruiting. William Wells, a <placeName>

                    </placeName> Indians, heard that the chief "has gone himself to hurry on the aid he was
                    promised by the Cherokees and Creeks." Shortly rumor placed him on the <geogName>Tennessee

            <p>In May 1812 the last intertribal council occurred in which Tecumseh is known to have participated
                    before the War of 1812. Meeting on the <geogName>Mississinewa River</geogName> in Indiana Territory,
                    representatives of the Delawares, Ottawas, Potawatomis, Ojibwas, Eel Rivers, Miamis, Piankeshaws,
                    Weas, Shawnees, Kickapoos, Winnebagoes, and Wyan-dots attempted to restore order after a spring
                    which had seen several raids by Indians bent on revenging losses sustained at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. On this occasion Tecumseh was more interested in defending himself from charges of
                    fomenting the hostilities than with winning adherents, but he indicted corrupt chiefs for selling
                    tribal land.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>A tradition that Tecumseh visited the Delawares of the White River, a few miles south, about this
                    time has sometimes been accepted as fact, but actually it rests upon unconfirmed second-hand
                    sources. According to this tradition Tecumseh spoke to four or five hundred Delawares at the mouth
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName>. A detachment of soldiers under Lieutenant Zachary Taylor forded the White River at the
                    same time, and William Conner, a trader and interpreter at the Indian council, advised Taylor to
                    camp across the river from the Indians in case Tecumseh incited them to hostilities. During the
                    proceedings that evening Conner and Chief Anderson opposed Tecumseh's plans, and only two
                    chiefs were disposed to support the Shawnee. This story was supposed to have been acquired from
                    Taylor, Conner, Indian agent Abel C. Pepper, and John Tipton by J. H. B. Nowland, "a
                    conscientious chronicler."</p>
            <p>In itself this story is not improbable. Taylor, actually then a captain, crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> with a detachment of the 7th Infantry and led it through Indiana Territory to Fort
                    Harrison, which he reached about May 3, 1812. He would have crossed the White River about the end of
                    April, and Tecumseh could have been in the vicinity on his way to the Mississinewa council. Tecumseh
                    knew the White River Delawares well and may have called upon them. William Conner's son
                    also seems to have remembered that his father had some meeting with Tecumseh before the War of 1812,
                    when both had a frank exchange of views. That said, the story is second-hand at best, and it is
                    unclear whether one or all of Nowland's alleged witnesses were the source for the Tecumseh
                    component in it.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Almost a month after the Mississinewa council closed Tecumseh left a restored Prophetstown for Fort
                    Malden to gather arms, ammunition, and food and to speak to the Wyandots, Ottawas, Potawatomis, and
                    Ojibwas of the <geogName>Detroit River</geogName>. He arrived at the British post soon after the
                    outbreak of the War of 1812, which changed the course of his career. That final journey closes the
                    record of Tecumseh's prewar travels on behalf of the Indian confederacy, at least as the
                    evidence stands at the present time.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

                    he made to the British, no other trips are comprehensively recorded. In these circumstances, it is
                    entirely inappropriate for scholars to presume that our knowledge of his journeys is complete or to
                    close the mind against the possibility that others occurred that have escaped record altogether. For
                    example, Harrison's letter of 1811, with the words "you see him [Tecumseh] today
                    on the shores of Lake Erie or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>," implies that the governor had received a report of Tecumseh recruiting
                    around <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>. No record of such a report has been found, but then it
                    could have been made verbally or simply disappeared. There are references to other reports of
                    Tecumseh's visits, those to the British in 1808 and the Wyandots in 1811, which have since
                    been destroyed or misplaced, and this could have been another. Equally, Harrison may simply have
                    been mistaken or exaggerating. We simply do not know, and it becomes scholars to steer between
                    dogmatic stances one way or the other.</p>
            <p>Confining our analysis only to what can be satisfactorily established about Tecumseh's
                    journeys, it is possible to evaluate Harrison's statement of 1811. Although Harrison
                    implied that Tecumseh began canvassing widely in 1807, this is not borne out by the evidence. While
                    Tecumseh actively supported the Prophet's movement and traveled in its service, he seems to
                    have made no systematic canvass of the tribes until 1809. This reinforces the belief, articulated by
                    Reginald Horsman, R. David Edmunds, and others, that the proceedings leading to the treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1809 were an important watershed. They added urgency to an already understood
                    problem.</p>
            <p>Tecumseh and the Prophet used messengers throughout their mission from 1806 to 1812. When combined
                    with Tecumseh's personal efforts, they leave no doubt but that the brothers visited every
                    important group of Indians on the frontier of their time: the Iroquois League, which had supplied
                    Britain's most potent Indian allies during the Revolution; the Potawatomis, Ojibwas, and
                    Ottawas of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> region; the Shawnees, Delawares, Mingoes, Miamis, and Wyandots, who had formed the
                    nucleus of the Indian confederacy that defended <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in the 1780s and 1790s; western peoples such as the Sac, Fox, Potawatomi, Kickapoo,
                    Winnebago, and Dakota Sioux, who had flirted with pan-tribalism in the early years of the nineteenth
                    century; and the populous tribes of the South.</p>
            <p>Tecumseh's own journeys, though not invariably successful, were one of the impressive
                    features of the reform movement and justify Harrison's claim that he was in
                    "constant motion." He made at least four trips to the <geogName>Detroit
                    River</geogName> region, in 1808, twice in 1810, and 1812. He was on the upper <placeName>

                    </placeName> at least twice, in 1809 and 1811. He recruited eastwards into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, made several local trips such as the Mississinewa visit in 1812, and at least once
                    visited the South.</p>
            <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-096-2-050"/>
            <p>The ideas and strategies employed by Tecumseh and the Prophet were not original. Rather,
                    Tecumseh's plan of traveling afield to rally intertribal support for the defense of the Old
                    Northwest was part of a long tradition. The Shawnees in particular had been sending envoys urging
                    unity among the tribes for decades, and Tecumseh had many predecessors, including Charlot Kaske,
                    Blue Jacket, Red Pole, and Black-beard. He cultivated few new areas. For example, Shawnee
                    delegations had lobbied the Iroquois Confederacy several times, including 1771, 1774, 1789, and
                    1791. They had been to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and <geogName>Mississippi Rivers</geogName> before in 1763-1765, 1792, and 1801-1802.
                    They had also tried to mobilize the southern Indians as far back as 1746 and more recently in
                    1792–1793. Other tribes had also been involved in pan-Indian diplomacy, and even in
                    Tecumseh's day there were others so employed, including the Potawatomi chief Main POC, who
                    traveled several times between the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>But for all that Tecumseh still stands out. No single leader, as far as we know, applied such
                    concentrated and comprehensive effort. It was this single-minded pursuit of his goal and the energy
                    and commitment he displayed that distinguished Tecumseh and helps to explain the vitality and
                    endurance of the pan-tribal movement led by the Shawnee brothers.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>The American odyssey of Nicholas Cresswell of Derbyshire, <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, began with bright promise. On March 1, 1774, just weeks after his twenty-fourth
                    birthday, as the fitting christening and accompaniment for the commencement of his venture, he began
                    a journal. He had come "to a determined resolution to go into America." He counted
                    on his fortunate place in a Derbyshire gentry family for assurances of financial support as well as
                    useful social and business connections. Cresswell emphasized that this decision was neither
                    superficial nor novel. Since "almost from my infancy" he had thought much about
                    "going to America." After serious "studying and deliberating,"
                    he decided that no time was "more suitable than the present" for a journey to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, for "I like the situation of that Colony the best."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However well conceived these private plans were, Cresswell could not anticipate the accidents of time
                    and place. Unintentionally, his quest for personal economic independence away from home ran headlong
                    into the onset of the American Revolution. Cresswell's journal, originally intended to
                    serve as an enduring reminder of a successful business venture, instead became a bitter narrative of
                    an outsider trapped in the American march toward independence.</p>
            <p>For years after he stopped his note taking, Cresswell's journal lay dormant. Then in 1928
                    one of his descendants, Samuel Thornely, published an unannotated version that had softened
                    Cresswell's opinions and actions. During its seventy-five-year lifetime, the printed
                    journal has served as a popular source for historians of the American Revolution. No one has yet

                    and unpublished. Useful as these intimate sources have been for the commentary that they yield for
                    historians, the stories themselves remain largely untold, and so the narrators have remained
                    invisible.</p>

            <p>Cresswell's history offers a scintillating window into the complex world of the American
                    Revolution. Furthermore, given the significance of Cresswell's 1775 travels west to
                    present-day Harrodsburg, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, his journal proves a fitting addition to the literature of the <geogName>Ohio
                    Valley</geogName> on the eve of the first American settlement of Indiana. It is the vibrant and
                    multilayered story of a complex and energetic man caught up in powerful events that threatened to
                    overwhelm him and defeat his most cherished hopes and dreams. His view of the times continues to
                    stand in defiance of much of what historians have said about the course of events, for Cresswell,
                    even after all these years, steadfastly fails to fit easily into historical pigeonholes. He was not
                    a Loyalist in the accepted understanding of this word, for he was technically an English visitor,
                    not an American colonist. He most certainly was not an apologist for the British ministry as his
                    actions in the American West clearly attest and his commentary upon the occasion of his departing
                    from America confirms. More important than all of this was his growing affection for certain parts
                    of America, particularly the West. Throughout his three years in America, save for periods of
                    illness or intemperance driven by despair, Cresswell wrote with vividness of the new people, the
                    remarkable country, and the disarray of empire. The journal reveals that he struggled with the
                    challenge of American liberty that these new people and new places presented to him. As much as he
                    yearned to stay, he could not bring himself to accept the Patriot cause. Feisty and argumentative to
                    a fault, he laced his journal with an ironic dismissal of political passion American style. All in
                    all, Cresswell's history was not a story of accomplishment. The journal that he started
                    with such a flourish of confidence in 1774 became a sad and troubled record of failures, one
                    Cresswell venture after another spoiled by what he viewed as an almost tragic American descent into
                    chaos.</p>
            <p>Cresswell's original plan possessed the virtues of uncomplicated ambition and candor.
                    Although his decision faced determined opposition from his family and friends, he was
                    "resolved to brave them all and follow my own inclination for once." This was not
                    to be a normal grand tour for the sake of cultural gratification. Instead, Cresswell viewed his
                    American experience as a "voyage," a mission with specific objectives. He was
                    seeking a future where he could "live much better and make greater improvement in
                    America" than he believed was likely if he remained at home. In his opening journal entry,
                    Cresswell made it clear that he would maintain in America the style of life that he had enjoyed in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. He intended to remain "in the farming way as that is the business I have been
                    brought up to." He was confident that he knew the business well, and his initial plan was a
                    straightforward reflection of it. Once his parents granted him their reluctant permission, Cresswell
                    expected that his father would extend sufficient credit to finance his trip. If, after a careful
                    survey of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> country, he believed the conditions suitable, the venturer <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-096-2-053"/> planned "to return immediately and endeavour to prevail upon
                    my Friends to give me something to begin the world with." Thus armed with development
                    credit, he would start up his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> agricultural business.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Unknown to Cresswell, during the month he
                    was preparing to set out for America, Parliament was putting the final touches on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Port Act, the first of five legislative assertions of imperial authority soon to earn
                    the American sobriquet of the Intolerable Acts. Taken as a group, these acts of Parliament would
                    have an impact upon nearly everything Cresswell did, the irony of which would not be entirely lost
                    on him during his darkest hours of disappointment.</p>
            <p>Cresswell sailed from Liverpool on Saturday, April 9, 1774, as one of several passengers aboard the
                        <hi rend="i">Molly.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
               </hi> After thirty-six days with several stretches of
                    foul weather, stormy enough to wreak havoc with the rigging on two different occasions, the ship
                    came abreast of Cape Henry. Cresswell first set foot ashore in America on May 17 at the village of
                    Urbanna, situated on the lower reaches of the <geogName>Rappahannock River</geogName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. His first destination was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was here that James Kirk lived, a man who had grown up in Cress-well's
                    neighborhood and had entered into mercantile business as well as land investments in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> As so many others before him had done, Cresswell sought out
                    someone familiar, a connection that he believed was "absolutely necessary." In
                    Kirk he hoped to find someone whose knowledge of the country would benefit him in his own search.</p>
            <p>As soon as he arrived, Cresswell commenced his commentary about American agriculture, the magnet for
                    the Virginian venture in the first place. Initially, what he observed in the tidewater of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> appeared to sustain the negative views that he had learned while still in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. He arrived believing that the land was "good and the price very
                    low." From this he concluded that agriculture "must be in its infant
                    state," which his first impressions seemed to confirm. The labor-intensive nature of
                    tobacco cultivation drew his notice. Cresswell, not yet two weeks in the colonies, concluded that
                    "agriculture is in a very poor state. In short they know very little about Farming. Tobacco
                    and Indian-corn is all they make and some little wheat." He was just as dismissive of wheat
                    culture. He complained <list type="footnotes">

                    admiration for the final product, however. Having seen the flour from George <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s mill, Cresswell confessed that it was "as good flour as I ever

            </p>
            <p>Late in 1774, Cresswell finally found the land that appealed to him. From Kirk's home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Cresswell toured "the back country" of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Frederick counties</region>
                    </placeName>. "I am exceedingly pleased with these two Counties, and am determined to
                    settle in one of them, if ever these times are settled, here is every encouragement." He
                    was not drawn to the tobacco culture of the Tidewater and remarked with some sense of relief that
                    "little tobacco is made" in these counties. The country seemed perfect for
                    livestock and wheat culture. The land "will produce any sort of grain, the average of Wheat
                    is about 12 Bushels to the Acre but it is not half plowed, and manure of any sort is never
                    used." Furthermore, "meadow may be made with little trouble. And the range for
                    stock is unlimited."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> These conditions, the journal entry added, were a
                    far cry from home.</p>
            <p>Cresswell proceeded without interruption, save one. What came to be known as the American Revolution
                    intruded, incidentally at first, but more and more in time. The first mention that Cresswell entered
                    in his journal was on May 30, 1774. The occasion was a dinner at Colonel Richard Harrison's
                    in Nanjemoy, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>. Cresswell's entry was sharp: "Nothing talked of but the Blockade of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Harbor the people seem much exasperated at the proceedings of the Ministry and talk as
                    if they were determined to dispute the matter with the Sword." Despite the criticism,
                    Cresswell would return several times to Harrison's, finding him "a very
                    intelligent man." Furthermore, Harrison became a welcome guide for Cresswell, introducing
                    him to the social side of America and taking "a pleasure in communicating the Customs and
                    manner of his countrymen."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Cresswell never did reveal a critical
                    interest in politics. With neither learning nor experience in the art of government, his reactions
                    to the American Revolution represented a perspective contrary to that of the various American
                    founders.</p>

                    political and economic conflict.</p>
            <p>During this political, social, and legal maelstrom Cresswell once again took up his quest for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> land in the fall of 1774. By the end of October he had settled all of the accounts from
                    his <placeName>
                        <country reg="bb">Barbados</country>
                    </placeName> venture, concluding that he would have to make yet another call upon his
                    father's credit, electing to be debtor to his father rather than to some American. By this
                    time, Cresswell had come to the simple conclusion that "everything here is in the utmost
                    confusion." All financial transactions had become chancy since "Committees are
                    appointed to inspect into the Characters and Conduct of every tradesman to prevent them Selling Tea,
                    or buying British manufactures." Seeing only the consequences of such investigations,
                    Cresswell found committee actions offensive and dangerously destructive. He noted that some
                    merchants had been "Tared [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] and Feathered." Just as
                    frightening, Cresswell noted that others "had their property burned and destroyed by the
                    populace." In a voice that resembled the views of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> loyalists, he railed against the destructiveness of people suddenly released from the
                    law. Such behavior suggested that "everything is ripe for Rebellion."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Cresswell saw no virtue in breaking the law to sustain actions both irregular
                    in their origin and unequal in their effects.</p>
            <p>As worried as these observations left him, Cresswell concluded that "for my own part, did I
                    not think this affair wou'd be over in the spring I wou'd immediately return
                    home." This became the deciding moment for Cresswell's American voyage. His
                    initial reading of the American Revolution persuaded him to remain. He confided in his journal some
                    of the reasons behind his decision, reasons which reflected a distinctive perspective. He felt that
                    he could not return home empty-handed and be "laughed at by all my friends." More
                    importantly, "if I return now and matters are settled they [his mother and father] will
                    never consent to my leaving <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> again."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> He did not at this point, nor would he in the
                    darker days to come, ever second guess his initial resolve for independence from his own family.</p>
            <p>This resolve may explain why in October 1774 Cresswell classified the American resistance as a
                    "quarrel." In his view, the American side of the squabble lacked any real
                    substance. "The presbyterian Rascals has had address sufficient to make the other
                    Colony's come into their Scheme." If "Independence" was the
                    objective of the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, then "salutary and speedy measures" of Parliament would remedy the
                    "hubbub." Until the colonial world returned to normal, however, Cresswell faced
                    immediate financial demands. To wait out the "quarrel," he decided that he must
                    find work. Kirk, <list type="footnotes">

                    "Tour of the back country" in the interim. Cresswell accepted this offer,
                    "determined not to return til I can do it with credit without these Rascals do perswade the
                    Colonies into a Rebellion."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The English visitor attempted unsuccessfully to find his way through the colonial political culture.
                    Not only did Cresswell express disdain for Whigs, but he decried many of the king's friends
                    as well. Cresswell chose to remain an outsider, and it was not long before he realized that the
                    consequences of this could spell defeat for everything he had originally hoped to accomplish. In
                    trying to forestall the looming disaster, he opted for plans that under any other circumstances
                    would have been considered chimerical. As time went on, Cresswell's journal entries came to
                    acknowledge the central importance of a "quarrel" that had grown into a
                    "Rebellion." Throughout, Cresswell's commentaries continued to reveal a
                    person who remained a man apart, a person who neither endorsed the patriotism of a growing
                    "bulk" of Americans nor became active in the affairs of the Loyalists.</p>
            <p>This is not to suggest that Cresswell discontinued his commerce with different people. His journal
                    abounds with references that amount to a who's who of the American Revolution, including
                    major and minor players on both sides. Historically, one of the ongoing mysteries of
                    Cresswell's narrative has been this juxtaposition of adversaries. He was not averse to
                    characterizing, sometimes at considerable length, notables whom he had not met but knew by
                    reputation. Cresswell's journal entries were a mirror of his public behavior. His
                    belligerence, amply fueled by the confidence of his youth, got him into private and public trouble
                    almost immediately. For one who believed that the differences between the Americans and Parliament
                    were best understood as a passing "quarrel," he displayed little knowledge of the
                    underlying causes of the dispute and no patience for what he viewed as truculence on the part of the
                    Americans.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, Nicholas Cresswell arrived in America with a chip on his shoulder. Initially he was
                    hypercritical of Tidewater agriculture, and he was quick to characterize American political
                    opposition as beyond the pale. It is not at all surprising that the locals responded in kind.
                    Cresswell's argumentativeness was not confined to private conversation. Rather, he was
                    willing to enter into political disputes at any public tavern, where some local residents may have
                    considered him a guest in their country. The often drunken nature of these sessions promoted
                    misunderstanding and irritation in an already tumultuous political climate. In tones that suggested
                    anything but surprise, Cresswell, in a February 1775 entry, announced that a <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Cresswell's behavior was indicative of a person to all appearances hell-bent
                    on public confrontation on the most sensitive political issues.</p>
            <p>Cresswell's nonchalant reaction to the investigation of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> Committee of Safety came in part from his knowledge that he would soon be far removed
                    from its reach. In January 1775, not a month after he had first determined to weather the political
                    storm, he decided to go into the American West. On January 6, Kirk informed Cresswell of land
                    interests in "the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country." An initial business offer came with attractive options. Cresswell
                    could take over one third of Kirk's original share "at the first cost,"
                    or he could acquire 5,000 acres of his choice if he agreed to go to the place and survey it for
                    them, thus presumably firming their claim. His second option was to take a third of the whole claim
                    of Kirk and his partner, William Sidebotham of Bladensburg, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>, upon his return from the survey.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Admitting that he was "not much acquainted with the situation of this country,"
                    Cresswell set out to investigate this striking proposition. It had been his immediate good fortune
                    to meet "two Gentlemen" who had lived in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country for two years. From them he learned that at the conjunction of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <geogName>Mississippi Rivers</geogName>, "1000 Miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and 2000 Miles from this place," the land was "exceeding
                    rich." Cresswell also reported that this country possessed mineral wealth in copper and
                    lead. One further advantage was that there were "very few inhabitants and those
                    French." Cresswell accepted the offer on certain conditions. If his benefactors would
                    "use their interest to procure me Surveyors Warrant," Cresswell believed that such
                    a situation might be "worth some Hundreds a Year, exclusive of the opportunities a surveyor
                    has, of taking up lands for himself." So the promise of the 5,000 acres suddenly became
                    more than a fallback position. Knowing that he could do "nothing here till times are
                    settled," Cresswell figured to be back in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> in time to return to <placeName>

            <p>Cresswell began his venture at a most inopportune moment. After the 1763 Treaty of <placeName>

                    Gone too were the triangular approaches to and negotiations with the American Indians. This vast new
                    domain presented Great Britain with administrative and political challenges that added significantly
                    to the burdens of governing a suddenly newly expanded empire. The cost of the war to acquire it and
                    daunting prospect of governing it led the king and Parliament into new administrative
                    considerations, many of which quickly came to be viewed by Americans as materially restrictive and
                    constitutionally iniquitous. As the economic, political, and constitutional contest between Great
                    Britain and the American colonies deepened during the years following the French and Indian war, the
                    adversaries battled one another in the American West in distinctive ways. The central issue was not
                    commercial regulation or taxation as it was in the East. It was land. Specifically, it was the land
                    west of the mountains where French claims had been quieted and only American Indians stood in
                    possession. It was into this territory that Cresswell planned to venture.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Company was a departure from traditional American colonial land companies. This new
                    company, born in the years after the French and Indian War, was a child of growing imperial
                    confusion. It was part of the explosion of land companies after Great Britain secured the West.
                    People formed new corporate combinations rapidly during the postwar years in order to possess these
                    vast and potentially profitable new lands. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Company and its successor, the <placeName>

                    </placeName>-<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Company, were products of plotting on the part of a group of speculative people of
                    different political interests to create an extensive, corporate land base in what was then the far
                    Northwest, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country. But the means this group used to acquire title to the land were unique, almost
                    revolutionary.</p>
            <p>Historically, title to western lands had passed from Indians to the colonial or military
                    representatives of the crown. Following the French and Indian War, the Crown and Parliament sought
                    to bring order to the administration of their new American domain by establishing a royal monopoly
                    in Indian affairs. From the Proclamation of 1763 to the Quebec Act of 1774, Privy Council orders,
                    instructions to royal governors, and parliamentary actions articulated an intention to rationalize
                    and centralize western land purchase and settlement. The constituent elements included such features
                    as the firm establishment of territories reserved for Indians, close supervision of Indian trade,
                    surveys and sales in advance of actual settlement, regularized and centralized control of land
                    grants, and stipulations for royal revenues in the form of quitrents. These policies were intended
                    to be more than a temporary restraining order for settlement. They substantiated an imperial
                    declaration of policy towards all corporate venturers and mercantilists in land, including royal
                    governors, who might harbor large and extralegal ambitions for western lands. These policies, taken
                    all together, spelled out a new mercantilistic <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-096-2-059"/> design for the
                    American West, similar to the British designs for its commercial empire.</p>
            <p>Contrary to the spirit and letter of these western policies, certain American adventurers with their
                    English allies set about to acquire extensive grants by negotiating directly with different Indian
                    tribes, in effect sidestepping the government and the new royal interest. A special few of these new
                    adventurers in the aftermath of the settlement of 1763 were engaged in a most inventive reading of a
                    1757 legal opinion by Lord Camden and Charles Yorke regarding a petition from the East <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName> Company. Certain American merchants in confidential association with various crown
                    officials determined that they could, as private operators, proceed outside of the official orbit of
                    the Crown without any political or legal restraint, thus becoming speculators in the original sense
                    of the word.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> This, of course, was in direct violation of law and policy that
                    stated that all transfers must be in the king's name and for the king's purposes,

                    The ironic element in this claim, which the governor knew well, was that imperial policy since 1763

                    </placeName> Company's petition. On May 16, he wrote a long defense of the entire
                    enterprise to the Earl of Dartmouth, secretary of state for the American colonies. This letter would
                    earn him the strongest rebuke from the king and serve as a lasting revelation of just how out of
                    step the Crown remained regarding the fate of the American West. Cresswell could not have chosen a
                    more fateful western business enterprise. Dunmore started his letter by acknowledging that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Company petition was most unusual. It sought recognition for a tract "near
                    this Colony" that was purchased from the Indians, a transaction in violation of statutory
                    and royal precedents firmly in place for over fifteen years yet one for which there could in the
                    governor's view be "no doubt of the validity of their title." Immediately
                    Dunmore attempted to mask this disingenuous remark with the appealing promise that company partners
                    were firm in their intention to "comply with the same rules and regulations with respect to
                    Quitrents that all the other Inhabitants of the Colony are governed by."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Thus began a remarkable correspondence. Punctuated by the dissolution of the House of
                    Burgesses and Dunmore's campaign against the Shawnees, the letters between the governor and
                    the secretary of state before the end of 1774 included Dunmore's thoroughgoing analysis of
                    the crisis of the British empire and his recommendations for Crown and Parliament.
                    Dunmore's focus was on allegiance. He believed the home government was losing the loyalty
                    of the Americans in what everyone ought to realize was a battle for the future of the American West
                    and the future course of the British empire. In his lengthy December analysis of the deteriorating
                    American situation, Dunmore outlined the progress of the Revolution in <placeName>

               </placeName>, but this appeared only after an extended discussion of the West. His
                    discussion was neither framed in formal legal terms nor was it an economic interpretation. Rather,
                    Dunmore saw the dissolution of the empire reflected in the mounting unwillingness of men to attach
                    themselves to an increasingly distant Crown. He attempted in the strongest terms to disabuse

                            Department, on April 5,1774: "I receive Accounts from the Back Parts of this Colony

                    allegiance. In short, Virginians, particularly those in the West, valued their individual liberty
                    more than their connections to the Crown and any resulting control of political or economic interest
                    that such traditional mercantilist connections wrought. The bonds of empire were quickly
                        loosening.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dunmore had acquired an American vision of space. He opined that the English would either adopt this
                    new view of reality or suffer the inevitable consequences, namely the loss of its newly acquired
                    territories north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. This new vision had obliterated past realities. No longer were the traditional ways of
                    producing and controlling wealth applicable. The government, Dunmore argued, would be unable to
                    restrain Americans from moving into the West. "Nothing (so fond as the Americans are of
                    Migration) can stop the Concourse of People that actually begin to draw towards them [the western
                    lands]." Any Crown or Parliament attempts "would have the direct contrary
                    tendency, by forcing the people to adopt a form of Government of their own." Dunmore
                    proceeded to describe just such a venture where people moved west without permission "in a
                    manner tributary to the Indians," and "to all intents and purposes erected
                    themselves into though an inconsiderable yet a separate state." The precedent was clear and
                    acted as a summons to "all the dissatisfied of every other Government." More
                    important, it set a usable example "of forming Governments distinct from and independent of
                    His Majestys Authority."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In light of this crisis, Dunmore urged that Crown recognition of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Company petition would send a powerful signal, at once a remedy for the present
                    disorder and an announcement for future development. Recognition would "preserve the peace
                    and order of the back countries." Actually Dunmore was suggesting something stronger than
                    preserving the peace, for he had the temerity to assert that Crown policy had attracted
                    "all the disorderly and unruly People of the Colonies." Traditional ways of doing
                    business in the American West simply were not working. In his estimation, British directives were
                    the cause of the disarray. So Dunmore advised that the Crown endorse private development of the
                    West, a clear reversal of political policy. Dartmouth, citing the Crown's displeasure with
                    such an audacious recommendation, ordered Dunmore to adhere strictly to established plans and to
                    cease his advisories, particularly when they took on the appearance of having openly contradicted
                    the Crown.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Late in December after his western campaign, Dunmore replied,
                    unconvinced and unrepentant. He reported that he believed it his official duty to report
                    "matters as they really are." He reiterated that the <list type="footnotes">

                    The situation in the West made this reality even more critical. Dun-more believed that it was
                    imperative that the British authorities recognize that the Americans were different. Americans in
                    the West, according to Dunmore, "do not conceive that Government has any right to forbid
                    their taking possession of a vast tract of Country, either uninhabited, or which serves only as a
                    Shelter to a few Scattered Tribes of Indians." If policy makers in Great Britain refused to
                    recognize this powerful reality they would lose the country to an unrestrainable people incited by
                    "their avidity and restlessness." Dunmore believed that this was critical in
                    understanding the connection between the people and this new land. "Wandering about seems
                    engrafted in their nature," he claimed; such people would not be stopped by artificial
                    barriers imposed at some remote place by a state that the Americans viewed as irrelevant at best.
                    Dunmore conveyed with clarity the need to develop a policy of freeing up the marketplace of western
                    land to people who had already asserted a preemptive claim to it. The American Revolution, however,
                    made immaterial these recommendations for the British empire in the West.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> specifically had become deeply confused. Instead of a peaceable occupation of the West,
                    a new version of the three-sided competition for empire that so recently had engaged the Indians,
                    the English, and the French emerged with the Americans substituting for the vanquished French.
                    Whatever political alliances Dunmore had forged in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s Revolution. In the process, Virginians with important western interests
                    moved quickly to dissociate themselves from the governor. One manifestation of this development was
                    the new legislature's assertion of exclusive control of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s land claims in the West, thus eliminating critical executive prerogatives as
                    well as giving official recognition to certain land companies and excluding those that had fallen
                    out of political favor. In this way the <placeName>

                    dispute between home and colonies was soon to be resolved, did not foresee the legal and political
                    chaos that these now hollow land company pretensions would work in the West.</p>
            <p>In addition, people informed Cresswell that this western venture would present him with special

                    he understood the complexities of what faced him as he turned west. Adding to this uneasy quality
                    was Cresswell's willingness to start out almost single-handed. To start, he had to learn
                    the rudiments of surveying, a craft for which his agricultural background was most helpful. He
                    explained that he found running lines "very easy in the Woods from what it is in enclosed
                    lands." Cresswell soon learned that springtime was best for traveling down the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, timing that was confirmed early in March by a Mr. Finley, a

                    </placeName> country, who urged him to wait until the "Latter end of April, then to go down
                    the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> with the Flood." Quick to accept this advice, Cresswell
                    at last turned to the task of finding someone to go with him. Initially he was in some doubt,
                    stating as late as March 1 that "there will be some difficulty in perswadeing any one to go
                    with me in this place."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    part of the month of March and the start of April searching for a suitable guide and companion for
                    his voyage. Friends suggested that Edward Snickers was the best person for finding a suitable guide
                    and supplied Cresswell with a letter of introduction.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> On April 3, he visited
                    the Snickers home but had to content himself with discussing his situation with a relative who
                    recommended George Rice for the job. Cresswell's friend, Gibbs, confirmed this choice,
                    complimenting Rice as "an honest man and a Good hunter." As it would turn out,
                    Gibbs had supplied better than Cresswell could handle, for not only would Rice prove to be an
                    accomplished companion for this western venture, but in time he would also assert his allegiance to
                    the American cause. Their political disagreements would precipitate a terrible rift that would
                    eventually play a central role in ending Cresswell's western project. Initially, however,
                    Cresswell and Rice came to an agreement; Rice accepted an offer of "500 acres" of
                    land, presumably within the grant tract. After a few last-minute purchases and the acquisition of a
                    few more letters of introduction to "several Gentlemen in the neighborhood of Fort
                    Pitt," Cresswell departed from Winchester, <placeName>

            <p>Following the advice of his local consultants, Cresswell traveled west prepared to trade with the
                    Native Americans, all in the belief that he could "carry out some Silver trinkets and
                    Barter with the Indians for Furs and probably do something more then bear my expenses."
                    Fortunately for him, the silversmiths in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName> were adept in providing him with the "trinkets" according to the
                    advice of one already experienced in this trade. Cresswell believed that he was well prepared to set
                    out for the American West. He was armed with the permission to carry out surveys. He knew that at a
                    minimum he could "take the 5000 Acres for going to view the land at my own
                    expense." Furthermore, he held out for the right of first refusal of Kirk's and
                    Sidebotham's share.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Unschooled in the history of the western land
                    companies with their troubled legacy of political and cultural unrest and insensitive to the growing
                    political crisis of the American Revolution, Cresswell forged ahead into the wilderness.</p>
            <p>The great voyage into the American West took Cresswell into a strange new world that fascinated him,
                    eliciting journal comments different from all that had transpired in his previous American
                    adventure. From the outset, the way and pace of travel were new and demanding on him. The second day
                    out, Rice led Cresswell about thirty miles, "over barren hills and bad ways." That
                    night the temperature dropped below freezing, and Cresswell marveled at "going to sleep in
                    the open air, no other covering then the Heaven's and our blankets."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> The going continued to be rough, revealing a landscape Cresswell often found forbidding
                    and "dismal." Within a few days, Cresswell was making geographic and cartographic
                    observations, noting specific mountains, the westward flow of rivers, and the destruction caused by
                    a major tornado.</p>
            <p>By April 10 the travelers had come upon Great Meadow, and Cresswell began his observations of the
                    battle sites of the 1754 and 1755 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Braddock campaigns. Even though the <geogName>Appalachian Mountains</geogName>
                    "piled one on the top of another with some narrow valleys between them," Cresswell
                    found the land in these valleys "rich and very thinly inhabited." The road they
                    traveled was "very indifferent," but even so, "loaded waggons frequently
                    cross it in the summer." As they proceeded, they found that "every necessary of
                    life is very dear here, provisions in particular." The cause was clear; the scarcity was
                    "occasioned by the Indian War [Dunmore's War] last Summer. Grain is not to be got
                    for money."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Cresswell came to view the consequences of this war as
                    significant in his voyage. Initially it was a question of provision. Other consequences would appear
                    in time as Cresswell proceeded farther west.</p>

            <p>Captain William Douglass, who had accompanied Rice and Cresswell during the first two days before
                    separating on April 6, rejoined them on April 11 and guided Cresswell to the home of John
                        Stephenson.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Known as "a great Indian warrior,"
                    Stephenson recommended that the company stop in his neighborhood and build the canoes for the
                    journey west, arguing that provisions would be easier to obtain at his place than at Fort Pitt.
                    Rice, who had friends and family in the vicinity, agreed, and Cresswell, seeing how adept Rice was
                    at building canoes, readily accepted "his management." Rice estimated that the
                    construction begun on April 13 would take two weeks. Stephenson's home on the
                        <geogName>Youghiogheney River</geogName> served as Cress-well's launching place to the
                    West. Once the journey began, the final party took three days to reach the <geogName>Monongahela
                        River</geogName> after which it took less than two days for the final approach to Fort Pitt.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Instead of remaining at Stephenson's, Cresswell decided to accompany Douglass to Fort Pitt
                    by land, arriving on the evening of April 16. Earlier that day, he toured the battlefield where
                    General Braddock "was defeated by the French and Indians the 9th of July 1755." He
                    was impressed by the presence of "great numbers of Bones," where most of the
                    skulls were either broken or pierced in such a way as to suggest that the injuries were caused by
                    "a Pipe Tommahauk." Cresswell noted that his guide claimed that the Indians left
                    no Englishmen alive, a chilling vision of a very different kind of warfare for the newcomer. At the
                    very moment he was witnessing these scenes, Americans and the British had fired at one another in
                    anger. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Concord a new war had begun that would blast all of Cresswell's hopes and
                    plans.</p>
            <p>The three-day visit to Fort Pitt included meetings with a variety of people for whom
                    Cresswell's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> friends had written letters of introduction. principal among these people was the
                    commandant, Major John Connolly. Cresswell's characterization of Connolly suggests that the
                    interview had not proceeded in the manner that Cresswell had wished, for he found the commandant
                    "a haughty imperious man." Given Connolly's association with Governor
                    Dunmore in the frontier war of the previous summer, the commandant was a source of information vital
                    to Cresswell as he prepared for his western venture. Connolly's military and diplomatic
                    intelligence regarding the western Indians was critical for Cresswell and others who traveled with
                    him. Furthermore, Cresswell was on <placeName>

            <p>After a couple of side trips to see Indian traders, Cresswell returned to his canoes, which were in
                    the final stages of completion. During the last days before departure, Cresswell's work
                    pace quickened. He spent many hours completing his final provisioning. Most importantly he
                    negotiated a new agreement with Rice. During Cress-well's absence, Rice had
                    "joined some other people" who were building canoes for a trip of "about
                    600 miles down the river." To accommodate this new arrangement, Cresswell agreed to wait
                    "at the <geogName>Kentucky River</geogName> ten days." This adjustment to the
                    original contract was made in the presence of Douglass. Since leaving Winchester, Douglass had spent
                    more and more time with Cresswell and now proposed a bargain that Cresswell found most appealing.
                    Douglass offered to finance half of all Cresswell's expenses down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and back for one half of any Cresswell "purchase." Two days later
                    Cresswell agreed, clearly distinguishing in his journal the five- thousand-acre grant that was part
                    of the original Kirk proposition and "anything to do as a surveyor," acknowledging
                    only that he agreed that Douglass could have "one half of any land I may
                    purchase." Adding to his sense of good fortune was Douglass's willingness to grant
                    him a five-year moratorium on interest on the unpaid principal. With a certain smugness, Cresswell
                    concluded that "I have now a prospect of making money without advancing any."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> So situated, he embarked April 28 upon his western voyage.</p>
            <p>During the five days that it took to reach Fort Pitt, the company attained its final complement. The
                    newcomers were bound for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> "to take up land." Among them was James Nourse, "an English
                    gentleman," who, like so many others after 1774, was on his way to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to enter claims for military service in the French and Indian War. He immediately
                    befriended Cresswell with the offer of sharing "one half of his tent," a gesture
                    Cresswell found "very agreeable."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> On the third day out, the
                    new company was detained by rain and, taking advantage of the opportunity, "settled our
                    accounts concerning vessels and provisions."</p>
            <p>From this moment on, Cresswell became part of the new wave seeking land in the new West.

                    West. From the beginning, Cresswell acted the part. He set himself apart from most of his traveling
                    companions, save Nourse, who was not intending to settle in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and George Rogers Clark, who joined the company for almost three weeks, a man
                    Cresswell found interesting both for his knowledge of Indian medicine and for his good behavior.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same could not be said for his relations with Rice, which went steadily downhill. After three
                    weeks on the river, Cresswell was convinced that Rice had no intention of going beyond <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. For this, Cresswell labeled him "a great coward," loose words that
                    bespoke rising anger. In time, anger and confusion dominated much of the company's everyday
                    proceedings. Notices of "great quarreling" began to appear more and more
                    frequently in the journal's narrative. His association with Rice deteriorated to the point
                    that on May 27 Cresswell thought that Rice tried to pick a fight so that violence would nullify
                    their contract. Privately Cresswell vowed "not to give the first affront," a vow
                    shattered two days later when they went toe to toe. Nourse interceded and according to Cresswell
                    prevented what would have been a deadly fight. Nourse scolded both parties, claiming that
                    "neither would have discredited a Billingsgate education." Nourse noted that
                    afterwards Rice "drew in," confirming Cresswell's assessment that the
                    fight "effectually" ended their relationship.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> On such an

            <p>Once the company reached the <geogName>Kentucky River</geogName> and elected to start the arduous
                    ascent towards the landing close to Harrodsburg, unraveling accelerated. The company had floated

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. It would require fourteen hard days to pull the canoes 125 miles up the
                        <geogName>Kentucky River</geogName>. At first a few started to drift away quietly. Then as the
                    company approached its destination, the land seekers decamped more rapidly, a few stealing from the
                    much-reduced company stores as they left. By June 8, those who remained divided up the rest of the
                    stores. Cresswell realized that everyone who remained was interested in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> lands, not in some uncertain venture in the <placeName>

            <p>The loss of Rice not only put an immediate stop to Cresswell's great western land venture,
                    but it also left Cresswell with the prospect of finding a way back. He did not have to wait long.
                    That very same afternoon a company bound for Fort Pitt offered him a place. Cresswell opted to join
                    this "ragged Crewe," much as he despaired of "their <list type="footnotes">

                    chance to go with him. Cresswell declined, for Nourse "intends to go over land."
                    With his inventory of Indian trade goods still intact, Cresswell could not afford such an
                    invitation, as welcome as it was, coming from one who had treated him "with the greatest
                    civility" and whom he had come to respect.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The return to Fort Pitt, punctuated by Indian scares and bickering among the members of the company,
                    took four long weeks of hard work even though the river was now well past its time of flood. The
                    combination of time, accident, and natural conditions had taken their toll on Cresswell's
                    equipment and his patience. Interestingly, he seemed to thrive physically, never mentioning the sort
                    of complaints that had plagued him earlier in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Despite the failure of his mission, Cresswell embraced the American West. Once back at
                    Fort Pitt, he whiled away more than a month before he agreed to return to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country with an Indian trader, all in the presumptive hope of salvaging some of the
                    costs of his voyage. In desperation for a loan to tide him over, he at last turned to John Anderson,
                    a veteran of the Indian trade and the only person in town he had not approached for help. Anderson
                    did more than just offer a loan; he agreed to accompany him into the Indian country, serving as both
                    an interpreter and guide.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once west of Fort Pitt, Anderson led Cresswell through the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Indian country, visiting various sites including several Moravian missions. On August
                    29 while at the native town of Old Hundy, Cresswell took the sister of his Mohawk host as a
                    temporary wife, whom he called Nancy. She would accompany him until he left Fort Pitt for his return
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> on October 2. During this second venture into the American West, Cresswell was able to
                    sell all of his goods, receiving furs in exchange, even though in the end he believed that he was a
                    loser upon the whole. Anderson's association was altogether pleasant, a friendship
                    Cresswell hoped to sustain, promising upon his departure to keep up a correspondence. His departure
                    from Nancy was emotional. He added that, despite what "conscientious people might
                    think," a temporary wife was a necessity for facilitating travel and trade in the Indian
                        country.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> During this account of the six-week western trading venture,
                    Cresswell's journal conveyed a keen sense of interest and happiness from all that had
                    happened earlier. If he was concerned about his own financial and political future, the narrative

                    1777, during the final months of his American stay, he would recall this earlier time, wondering
                    seriously whether or not he should take up this life once again, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Only much later would Cresswell reveal some of the political reasons why he did not hurry back to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. In March 1775 he had written "to all my friends in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and freely declared my sentiments upon the present Rebellion." Those letters
                    never reached their intended destination. Instead they fell into the hands of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName> Committee of Safety. When Cresswell returned at the end of October of that year, the
                    committee was ready for him. In his estimation the committee was prepared for him to be
                    "Arraign'd, Tryed, and Condemned and the sentence nearly put in execution before I
                    knew anything about it." Until April 1777, when he made good on his second attempt to
                    escape from America, Cresswell spent much of his time and energy fending off the inquisitive
                    Americans. He complained bitterly that he was trapped between the rock of his independence and the
                    hard place of the American Revolution: "I am now in a disagreeable situation. If I enter
                    into any sort of business I must be Obliged to enter into the service of these Rascals and fight
                    against my Friends &amp; Country if called upon. On the other hand I am not permitted to depart
                    the Continent and have nothing if I am fortunate enough to escape the jail. I will live as cheap as
                    I can and hope for better times."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> In this straightforward, albeit
                    anguished, statement of what he considered to be his options, Cresswell rendered a prophetic
                    foreshadowing.</p>
            <p>The coming eighteen months became for Cresswell a trial period during which he suffered from forced
                    inactivity; considered heading back to the West; attempted to escape the country through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>; considered alternately joining the American and the British armies; and finally
                    concluded that the American Revolution had become a tragic moment. What he witnessed in the East
                    dashed his earlier hopes for a peaceful settlement between the American colonists and the British
                    authorities. As he learned more about the warfare in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and the military presence in different <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">American cities</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Cresswell concluded that "this cannot be redressing grievances, it is open
                    Rebellion and I am convinced if Great Brittain does not send more men here and subdue them soon they
                    will declare independence."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Upon rendering this conclusion, Cresswell
                    became determined to escape. From October 1775 on, Cresswell's journal became a different
                    narrative, one devoted to the story of his personal ordeal with the American Revolution. During the
                    long months of forced confinement, he turned more and more to questioning the people and events
                    around him, puzzling over the causes and consequences of these troubled times. His distress took a
                    toll on his health. Although free from <list type="footnotes">

                    him, he began to drink more heavily and more often, sometimes for days on end. During the early
                    months of 1776, the journal went silent for weeks as Cresswell lurched between self-inflicted
                    "merry" inebriation and sickness.</p>
            <p>On July 19, 1777, after a series of adventures brought him to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, Cresswell departed from America safely on board <hi rend="i">H.M.S. Edward.</hi>
                    Although relieved to be away from the terrible war, he was saddened by what he saw in "this
                    cursed Rebellion." During the weeks before he left, he took time to review his history in
                    America and to comment on the geographical, political, and economic conditions in various states.
                    This analysis served as a fitting end to an adventure launched with hope and concluded in discord.
                    To the very end he sustained his anger that "the artifices of a few designing
                    Villains" had corrupted "honest, well meaning people" so that they
                    relinquished "the invaluable blessing of Peace, the sweet enjoyment of real and happy
                    Liberty." At the same time Cresswell steadfastly refused to sing the virtues of Great
                    Britain, a tune so common in the voices of many Loyalists. During the months following his western
                    venture, he came to view much of British imperial policy as well as the military commands of such
                    people as William Howe as deeply flawed policies that neither inspired nor deserved allegiance.
                    Looking at both sides, then, Cresswell concluded that in "the short space of three years,
                    the Villainous arts of a few and the obstinacy of the many, on this side of the water added to the
                    complicated blunders, cowardice, and knavery of some of our blind Guides in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Over time, Cresswell came to believe that the American Revolution was a tragic history of legal and
                    social degredation, the ruination of individual liberty. The American people had become
                    "like the Dog in the Fable, [they had] quit the substance for an empty shadow."
                    For vain promises of unattainable freedoms, Americans had submitted themselves to "all the
                    dreadfull horrors of war, poverty, and wretchedness." Everything seemed to confirm this
                    view. From his <placeName>

                    was coming apart, including religion. By October 1776 Cresswell lamented that "religion is
                    almost forgot, or most basely neglected." Not only was religion "at a
                    stand," but "the retailers of politicks," particularly the Presbyterian
                    clergy, were active in <list type="footnotes">

                    law in contempt and were ready to use force to compel allegiance. The accused faced imprisonment,
                    loss of property, and a threat of death, all without the slightest pretense of due process of the
                    law. Cresswell asserted that this clash between political coercion and the popular will to sustain
                    traditional liberties might serve as the undoing of the American rebellion, for "these
                    unhappy wretches are as much divided as it is possible to be without actually drawing the sword
                    against one another." The Congress was largely responsible for this discord, for they
                    "under the fallacious pretence of nursing the tender plant, Liberty, which was said to
                    thrive so well in American soil, have actually tore it up by the very root." This free fall
                    into ruin pained Cresswell, who viewed the physical and moral destruction of America as a sign of
                    the depravity of unchecked human action, a Hobbesian world of ungoverned license mistaken for
                    freedom. Cresswell's only remaining hope was that Americans would somehow summon the
                    courage to "awake from their delirium and refuse further to submit to the new
                        tyranny."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, Cresswell prided himself in having learned much about the people and places south of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. These Americans he found to be "the most hospitable people on
                    Earth." Manners reflected a charitable disposition, manifest in both the education of the
                    young and the social habits of adults. He emphasized that if children possessed "any genius
                    tis not cramped in their infancy, by being overawed by their parents." This tended to
                    foster individuals who were "good-natured, familiar, and agreeable on the whole."
                    He noted as well the population explosion and asserted that both immigration and natural increase
                    were twin causes. Cresswell believed that the consequences of growth made America quite different
                    from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. In America, in part because economic prospects were so good and the availability of
                    land was so immediate, people married earlier. Nothing he saw during his stay persuaded him that his
                    first negative impressions of American agriculture were in error. Americans were certainly
                    handy—the men were universal mechanics, carpenters, saddlers, and coopers. Still
                    Americans were very indifferent farmers. In concluding his retrospective, Cresswell prayed for a
                    people and a country that he would never be able to call his own. <list type="footnotes">

                    </quote> The West was for Cresswell the heartland of this American "Paradice." But
                    political circumstances had prevented his attaining a place there. Living on the frontier for
                    several months had been an exhilarating experience for him. However, Cresswell needed more stability
                    then the West in 1775 could offer, a reality he understood even as he bemoaned his lost opportunity
                    in the land of America's future. The Revolution nullified the best-laid plans of both
                    Dunmore and Cresswell. As they departed from the American scene, their ideas of private development
                    of the West went into eclipse as well, for Americans in the Continental Congress very soon
                    replicated British policy regarding the prohibition of Indian land sales to private companies.</p>
            <p>Cresswell's voyage home was uneventful and devoid of the anticipation he expressed during
                    his voyage to America. His impending return was a cause not of delight but the occasion for
                    "such an unusual damp upon my spirits that I am more dead than alive." He confided
                    that rather than hurrying ashore, he "had rather stay on board," a most revealing
                    commentary upon his unfortunate and conflicted history in America. <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> now appeared diminished. Even the historic artery of commerce, the Thames, had become
                    "a narrow crooked river." The people he saw in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> appeared sadly uninformed about the situation in America, half of them appearing to him
                    as "Rebels in their Hearts," a sure sign that Great Britain's cause was
                    in jeopardy. Given all of the debts that he had incurred, he dreaded confronting his father,
                    controller of his credit. Failing at the last minute to secure a commission with Lord Dunmore,
                    Cresswell arrived back at Edale on September 24, 1777. His mother was "overjoyed to see
                    him; his father, who departed in what struck his son to be intentional haste for a local fair,
                    "remembered to order me to sheare or bind corn tomorrow." So on this minor note
                    his three-year odyssey to American came to a close. At the very end of his journal, he entered a vow
                    to stay on at home at least until "April next, and behave in such a manner as not to give
                    any just offence. I call this waiting the chapter of accidents-something fortunate may
                    happen." The extraordinary journal of Nicholas Cresswell ceased four years later with one
                    final entry for April 21, 1781, announcing his marriage, prompting him to conclude, "my
                    rambling is now at an end!"<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

               <hi rend="i">Harp Song for a Radical: The Life and Times of Eugene Victor Debs.</hi> By Marguerite
                    Young. Edited by Charles Ruas. (<placeName>

            <p>Contrary to the subtitle, <hi rend="i">Harp Song for a Radical</hi> is neither a biography of Eugene
                    Victor Debs nor a history of his times. The Indiana Socialist leader often fades out of the
                    narrative, replaced by a multitude of characters many of whom would not normally use up many pages
                    in a biography of Debs. Wilhelm Weitling, Thomas Jefferson, Czar Alexander I, Heinrich Heine, John
                    Jacob Astor, Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, Frederick Rapp, Mark Twain, Dr. Richard Jordan Gatling,
                    Dred Scott, Andrew Johnson, Mary Todd Lincoln, Edward A. Hannegan, Allan Pinkerton, James
                    McParlan—to name a few. None of the great events of Debs's era are either
                    described or explained in any detail. At the end of 599 pages, readers will know little more about
                    Debs and his times than when they began the book.</p>
            <p>Marguerite Young writes in a prose that is verbose, convoluted, complicated, pretentious,
                    sentimental, and hard to understand. Here is a sample from a typical paragraph-long sentence:
                    "when Debs was a stripling trying to organize his chapter and at a time when there might be
                    perhaps only one member present at a meeting and that was himself who certainly was easy to organize
                    as he was all of one piece, his head receiving the messages of his heart and his heart the messages
                    of his head and his entire arterial system at work with the dream of man's brotherhood with
                    man in a social and economic sense which was for the salvation of the species …"
                    (p. 432). More examples would rapidly use up the space allotted for this review.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Harp Song for a Radical</hi> is the late Young's last book, edited for
                    publication by her friend Charles Ruas. Born in Indiana in 1908, Young moved first to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then settled permanently in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. She also wrote <hi rend="i">Angel in the Forest</hi> (1945), a history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>; <hi rend="i">Miss MacIntosh, My Darling</hi> (1965), a novel; and two books of poetry.
                    In his helpful introduction, Ruas gives us some clues for understanding this unconventional book.
                    Young lived in Greenwich Village for some forty years where "in her long crimson dresses,
                    with a gold embroidered vest, her black Polish nursemaid boots worn with pink stockings, toes
                    peeking through, and a floor-length red woolen cape thrown over her shoulder" (p. vii) she
                    became a well-known, if somewhat eccentric, figure. During the 1960s, this aging flower child
                    sympathized with the youthful rebels and saw them as a manifestation of a tradition that had deep
                    roots in the American past. For Young, rebellion was more a matter of attitude than
                    ideology—a thing of the heart, not of the mind. The reader will therefore find no
                    explications of economic programs or political positions in her book. In <hi rend="i">Harp Song for

                    tastes in history will probably find the book challenging. This reviewer can only suggest that they
                    accept it on its own terms—a literary collage whose many characters share little more
                    than a dissatisfaction with society as it was and a capacity to dream for something better.</p>

                        </placeName>, 1750-1830</hi>, Andrew R. L. Cayton and Fredrika J. Teute comment that the twelve
                    essays in their edited volume "narrate a history of cultural convergence and conflict while
                    uncovering the complex strata of various frontiers" (p. 13). In so doing, their volume
                    represents a convergence of recent historiographical developments that have replaced the distinct
                    Turnerian frontier line with frontiers that were pluralistic and dynamic zones.</p>
            <p>With Richard White's influential middle-ground approach in the background, a number of the
                    essayists consider the possibilities for mutuality and cooperation within frontier areas but often
                    focus on conflict and cultural division as the more compelling outcome of their analyses. Gregory
                    Evans Dowd departs from the middle-ground orientation most directly in his essay on gift-giving and
                    Cherokee-British relations, in which he argues that the Cherokees and the British failed to create
                    "a shared order" during the Seven Years' War. There is more hope for
                    mutuality and cooperation in the world that James H. Merrell and Jane T. Merritt reveal in their
                    essays on the eighteenth-century <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> frontier. Merrell provides a wonderfully descriptive account of life in the multiethnic
                    and multitribal Shamokin at the forks of the Susquehanna, including ways that whites and Indians
                    developed a "shared language." Similarly, Merritt portrays struggles of Indians
                    and whites to understand each other's words as they attempted to cut through a thicket of
                    metaphors and unfamiliar tongues. In the end, however, both Merritt and Merrell assert the power of
                    the cultural divide that made the middle ground more of a hope than a sustained reality.</p>

            <p>Why did certain frontier settings allow for peaceful coexistence and cultural borrowing, while others
                    saw primarily conflict? This is a question that emerges from several essays, especially those by
                    John Mack Faragher and Lucy Eldersveld Murphy. Murphy contrasts fur trade communities with
                    lead-mining areas of the western Great Lakes region. She uses gender relations and women's
                    roles to explain why cultural syncretism characterized the Fox-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> fur trade region, while peaceful coexistence failed to take root in the lead-mining
                    country. As do other portions of this volume, Faragher's piece depicts the potential for
                    accommodation between Indians and whites but also reveals its ultimate breakdown. He explains how on
                    the lower <placeName>

                    Indians" ended in a spate of "ethnic cleansing" in the 1820s and 1830s
                    (pp. 304-305).</p>
            <p>Several authors address the question of how the dynamic, pluralistic nature of frontiers affected
                    inhabitants' identities and customs. William B. Hart's analysis of the
                    prerevolutionary <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> frontier superbly illustrates the ways in which individuals engaged in "acts
                    of creative self-transformation" as they assumed multiple identities that crossed racial
                    lines (p. 112). Similarly Elizabeth P. Perkins explores "the negotiation—and
                    essential ambiguity—of identity" in the revolutionary <geogName>Ohio
                    Valley</geogName> (p. 211). Perkins describes the formation of cross-cultural constructions in
                    dress, food, and other customs "blurring racial and ethnic distinctions" (p. 218).
                    Stephen Aron examines hunting as an area of cultural borrowing but also highlights ultimate
                    differences in Indian and white attitudes toward land and game.</p>
            <p>Two essayists focus less on Indian-white relations than on internal differences, in one case among
                    Indians (Claudio Saunt) and in another among whites (Andrew R. L. Cayton). Saunt examines internal
                    troubles among the Creeks in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. He provides a complex
                    understanding of the Creek civil violence of 1813, known as the Redstick War, by examining gender
                    conflicts that fed the dispute. Cayton's analysis of the Treaty of Greenville (1795) also
                    stands out in this volume for its close study of the thoughts and sentiments of the negotiators for
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, finding them dependent on notions of public civility that distinguished them from the
                    "brutal Indian-hating machismo" of other whites (p. 269).</p>
            <p>By relating old frontiers to new ones, Jill Lepore's essay provides a fitting ending to this
                    volume. Lepore shows how the successful play <hi rend="i">Metamora</hi> helped create a mythology
                    about the seventeenth-century Wampanoag King Philip that shaped attitudes about Indian removal among
                    both Indians and whites in the 1830s.</p>

            <p>Susan E. Gray's study is one of the few serious treatments of Yankees in the West since
                    Frederick Jackson Turner struggled with the notion over seventy years ago. The settlers from
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> brought with them a market acumen which they were eager to apply to the new
                    availability of land. In frontier <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> there was no opposition to the market, there were only different strategies for
                    engagement. Initially committed to cash crops, the settler-farmers slowly and painfully learned
                    skills of diversification and adaptation to changing market and transportation conditions. They also
                    built the institutions for which this cultural stream is so universally known: church, school, and
                    local government. The latter theme is the most important, since the trajectory that Gray describes
                    moves from localism to a much wider world in which class relationships rather than those of
                    "neighborliness" prevail.</p>
            <p>Gray has rescued from obscurity a local story that illuminates a larger process. Although the sources
                    are sometimes frustratingly silent and uneven, Gray has been imaginative in using legal records to
                    reveal working relationships. The local credit system, for example, began with settlers who borrowed
                    from local businessmen who drew upon township merchants, who in turn depended on consignment
                    merchants in more remote mercantile centers. Litigation usually involved long-distance debt; only in
                    extremity did neighbor sue neighbor. The credit system mirrored the social system.</p>
            <p>But there is nothing sentimental about this account of Yankee settlement. The farmer-settlers
                    represented a transitory system of familial capitalism in which the purpose of the family farm was
                    to generate a capital stake for sons "to venture forth in new starts in life" and
                    for the "retirement portions" due parents. Gray detects a certain <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-096-2-078"/> smugness about these people in their relentless search for the main
                    chance.</p>
            <p>This conclusion may arise in part, however, from the uneven-ness of the sources available for these
                    three townships and from the silence of much in the historical record. A good deal is inferred in
                    this highly localized world from elites who, if only by their persistence, came to dominate these
                    townships socially and politically. The legal record does not always illustrate the wider world, and
                    to suggest that the divisions among local elites represent divides among voters at large ignores
                    evidence of the "washing out" of elite preoccupations in the broader electorate.
                    Gray finds in localism an explanation for political division within a relatively homogenous Yankee
                    community. It is this localism that might speak more loudly.</p>
            <p>One of the central problems of analyses positing culture as a central metaphor is the demonstration
                    of commonality. The imaginative use of the legal record assists to a degree in this study as Gray
                    charts the transit of locally minded Yankees to bourgeois midwesterners, who were eager to show off
                    their class positions. The question remains how widely shared were these cultural identities and how
                    uniform was the self-satisfaction which came with them.</p>

            <p>It is a sad coincidence that just as this excellent book on the Pullman Strike of 1894 has become
                    available, the historic administration building of George Pullman's factory lies in ruins,
                    the victim of an arsonist. Among the many strong arguments for restoring the structure may be this
                    highly useful book, which includes nine of the thirty-six papers presented at an Indiana State
                    University conference marking the centennial of one of America's most famous strikes.</p>
            <p>After an excellent introduction, which provides a narrative of the strike and lays out a map of where
                    the articles will take the reader, the book begins to demonstrate the historiographical changes that
                    have occurred since Almont Lindsey produced his substantial narrative history in 1942. Where Lindsey
                    is focused on his subject, articles by Robert Weir and Susan Hirsch contrast the 1894 walkout with
                    two other strikes on the basis of both internal union conflicts as well as the ability to enlist
                    community support. Where Lindsey virtually ignores the role of women, two articles enlarge on the
                    importance of gender. Janice Reiff examines the influence of workers' <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-096-2-079"/> paternalistic family structure on the strike. Victoria <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in what may be the best piece in the book, explores why the strike became such an
                    agonizing experience for Jane Addams. Larry Peterson provides an engaging look at how the strike was
                    depicted in photography and popular magazine illustration, including a discussion of federal
                    attempts at news management.</p>
            <p>The remaining articles reinterpret the longer-term impact of the strike. In an innovative essay,
                    Melvin Dubofsky describes how it altered the relationship between labor and the courts. Shelton
                    Stromquist and Richard Schneirov discuss how the strike affected the relationship between organized
                    labor and national and local civic leadership, respectively. An epilogue by David <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> provides an evaluation of the meaning of the strike.</p>
            <p>It is always difficult to evaluate a work with nine authors, but the articles are of uniform high
                    quality. One significant omission is the role of the World's Columbian Exposition of the
                    previous summer. The fair increased America's demand for images of the world, including
                    Pullman's town. But most important, many of the event's 27 million visitors
                    clutched their guidebooks and rode the additional 4.5 miles south on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Central suburban line to see the town. Doubtless, this added to a sense of having been
                    "near" to the strike, which, in turn, contributed to the speed and depth with
                    which the nation reacted to the event. The fair was also responsible for attracting laborers who
                    later joined the unemployed and heightened the anxieties of Chicagoans during the Pullman turmoil,
                    which took place only seven months after the White City closed its gates.</p>
            <p>The book should not be seen as a replacement for Lindsey or for Stanley Buder's <hi rend="i">Pullman: An Experiment in Industrial Order and Community Planning, 1880-1930</hi> (1967).
                    Nonetheless, it is an admirable addition to the literature. Now let's rebuild the Pullman
                    administration building.</p>

            <p>Historians have regularly included Samuel M. Jones, mayor of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Toledo</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, from
                    1897-1904, in their lists of Progressive Era reform mayors, but unlike many of his contemporaries
                    "Golden Rule" Jones has never been the subject of a biography. Marnie
                    Jones's book does this for the man she labels "the most striking" of
                    reform mayors (pp. 11-12). But Samuel M. Jones is also her great-grandfather, and there are inherent
                    dangers in writing about one's ancestors. The <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-096-2-080"/> most
                    successful of such works, Elisabeth I. Perry's study of her grandmother Belle Moskowitz
                        (<hi rend="i">Belle Moskowitz: Feminine Politics and the Exercise of Power in the Age of Alfred
                        E. Smith</hi> [1987]) and Kristie Miller's book on her grandmother Ruth Hanna McCormick
                        (<hi rend="i">Ruth Hanna McCormick: a Life in Politics, 1880-1944</hi> [1992]), connect their
                    individual subjects to broad contributions to American society by exploring how they illuminate
                    women's political history.</p>
            <p>Moskowitz and McCormick had extensive, well-documented records of public service. On both these
                    counts, Marnie Jones is less fortunate, and this ultimately limits the significance of her book.
                    Jones's public career was confined to his years in the mayor's office. There is
                    little record of his earlier life, and he died shortly after leaving office. Marnie Jones chose,
                    therefore, to focus on his inner life— his world view based on the Christian ideal of the
                    "golden rule" and his psychological struggle to convert this ideal into
                    practice—to explain his political-historical importance. She connects Jones's
                    writings, speeches, and actions with turn-of-the-century thinkers such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Gladden to depict Jones as the product of a particular Protestant upbringing that made
                    him a secular/religious prophet preaching the twin goals of reforming both political institutions
                    and people's hearts.</p>
            <p>According to the author, these Christian ideals explain both Jones's political importance
                    and his failures. She is most successful when she locates his political ideals in his
                    "golden rule" thinking. As mayor, he wanted to achieve full employment because he
                    believed that individuals needed honest and useful work to feel good about themselves and that from
                    these good feelings would spring a "city that was a true community," where
                    "no one would make money at the expense of others" (p. 121). His failures, she
                    contends, came from predicating all his actions on such ideals, thereby failing to appreciate that
                    change might well require more attention to practical politics. His spurning of party politics for
                    independent appeals to voters produced his initial successes but helped defeat cherished goals such
                    as municipal ownership of utilities and ultimately led to his defeat as mayor.</p>
            <p>Jones was an interesting personality, and this book contributes to understanding how Protestant
                    ideals have at times motivated individual public actors; but it does little to elevate
                    Jones's historical significance. One can doubt that historians will agree with Marnie
                    Jones's assessment of Samuel M. Jones's position vis-a-vis his contemporaries. His
                    public service was short, his political impact limited, and when compared with contemporaries whose
                    reform activities were at least partially rooted in Christian ideals, his life and work did not
                    yield similarly extensive results.</p>

            <p>Harold Edward "Red Grange is generally considered one of the twenty-five best American
                    football players of the twentieth century and is often credited with popularizing professional
                    football during the roaring twenties. Red played football at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> from 1923 to 1926, so it is only fitting that the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Press series on "Sport and Society" should issue this biography of
                    the "Galloping Ghost" and his place in American cultural history.</p>
            <p>Red Grange was born in the rural hamlet of Forksville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, on June 13, 1903. He was the third child of Sadie and Lyle Grange. He became involved
                    in sports in high school, and his father took an active interest in his accomplishments. Grange
                    excelled in football, basketball, and track and was good enough to attract the attention of both the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. At his father's insistence, he attended <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1922. In 1923 he led the team to an undefeated season and earned
                    All-American honors from Walter Camp and others. His spectacular performances coincided with
                    football's evolution as one of the centerpieces of mass culture made possible by
                    low-priced, closed automobiles, improved roads, urban prosperity, and an increasingly influential
                    mass media.</p>
            <p>Amid much controversy, Grange allied himself with Charlie "Cash and Carry" Pyle and
                    signed a professional football contract before graduating from college. He proceeded to undertake
                    barnstorming tours, advertised products, and ballyhooed a variety of athletic events. College
                    coaches like Robert Zuppke, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Fielding Yost, and their allies on campuses and in
                    the press decried the corrupt world of professional football and commercialism, while personally
                    profiting from it. They vilified Grange for supporting pro football, which they considered
                    "a dirty little business run by rogues and bargain basement entrepreneurs" (p.
                    102).</p>
            <p>This book is more than the story of the life of the "Galloping Ghost." John M.
                    Carroll does a good job of placing Grange in an appropriate context. He makes good use of anecdotes
                    to reveal aspects of character. He explores the influence of World War I on the rising popularity of
                    football and examines the politically conservative environment of suburban <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and downstate <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> that shaped Grange's conservative political philosophy. His book describes the
                    subtleties and the hypocrisy associated with recruiting college football players during the first
                    two decades of the twentieth century. He touches on the role of football revenue in college sports
                    and the symbolism that is critical to the development of a sports culture. All in all, this book is
                    a significant contribution to football history.</p>
            <p>If the book has any weaknesses, they are tangential to the themes of the study. Perhaps Carroll
                    understates the popularity of and public interest in Grange's predecessor, Jim Thorpe, as
                    the star <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-096-2-082"/> attraction for pro football during the period
                    1915-1921. He does not consider as many questions regarding the management decisions made by George
                    Halas and other franchise owners in the formative years of the National Football League as might be
                    warranted. And our understanding of the role of the media in creating sports celebrities would
                    benefit from more analysis. Yet, none of these concerns diminish the value of this well-crafted,
                    interesting biography.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Over-the-Rhine neighborhood lies just north of the central business
                    district. Its name refers to the canal (popularly termed the "Rhine") that formed
                    the southern and western margins of the one-time suburb of downtown. German immigrants constituted
                    the majority of its population in the 1850s, although a variety of other people also settled there.
                    In their case study of the neighborhood, Zane L. Miller and Bruce Tucker recount a story that is
                    grimly emblematic of the history of near-downtown areas in other <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">American cities</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The multiple failures of planning and an urban politics deformed by racism insured the
                    area's steady social, economic, and infrastructural deterioration.</p>
            <p>Long term neglect turned Over-the-Rhine into a target for often conflicting schemes of urban renewal.
                    The authors, accordingly, conduct the reader through a thicket of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> politics, personalities, associations, redevelopment programs, and assorted attempts to
                    transform the social and physical environment. Often misguided, various revitalization plans sought
                    to reclaim the neighborhood from the common fate of similar core urban zones across the country.
                    Amid the intricate detail about the neighborhood and its would-be rescuers, the study at times risks
                    losing the reader's attention. Still, the story is worth the reading, particularly when it
                    demonstrates how shifting views of urban planning played out in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Miller and Tucker argue that two dominant modes of thought, each leaving its imprint on
                    Over-the-Rhine's history, have defined urban planning in the twentieth century. Before
                    1950, the emphasis lay on slum clearance, rezoning for commercial use, and building public housing.
                    In this scheme, the wishes of residents were ignored in favor of imposed social engineering. Here,
                    the city was regarded as an organic unit, subject to dominant social forces. Planners, consequently,
                    subjected the city and its residents—the poor and the powerless, <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-096-2-083"/> in particular, bore the burden—to a kind of inevitable
                    evolutionary process. After 1950, reactions to authoritarian control moved attention from slum
                    clearance to neighborhood continuity and the rights of individuals. At this point, the
                    "slum" and its negative connotations gave way in the public discourse to the more
                    neutral "inner city."</p>
            <p>The new emphasis on conservation included gentrification, rehabilitation of existing buildings, and
                    the empowerment of minority residents, the homeless, and others in the neighborhood. Some plans
                    were, however, at odds with each other. In Over-the-Rhine, an angry group suspicious of historic
                    preservation coalesced around issues of substandard housing and homelessness. Believing that
                    historic preservation would raise rents and displace the poor, this faction successfully promoted
                    racial and class separatism and local autonomy, thereby guaranteeing further neighborhood
                    deterioration. Thus, by the mid-1980s, the city council approved an urban renewal plan that
                    effectively stifled both business development and mixed-income housing in Over-the-Rhine.</p>
            <p>In concluding their valuable study, Miller and Tucker make a salutary argument for the recovery of a
                    civic consciousness that takes account of the collective welfare without losing sight of the
                    individual. There is, in other words, much to learn from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Over-the-Rhine. Without a restoration of the common good as a prominent
                    civic value, the competing and self-serving goals of narrowly defined groups can only continue to
                    inhibit reasoned planning that serves an inclusive public interest.</p>

               <hi rend="i">New Faces of the Fur Trade</hi> presents a collection of fifteen highly diverse papers
                    selected from the many presented in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Halifax</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the seventh North American Fur Trade Conference. The book's contents
                    reflect a broad North American flavor in that two-thirds of the papers are written by Canadian
                    scholars and one-third by Americans, the same ratio holding for the three editors of the volume.
                    While <hi rend="i">New Faces in the Fur Trade</hi> includes the work of a number of well-established
                    scholars, many of its authors are newcomers in this field of study. The diversity of the papers
                    stems from contributions from various disciplines and perspectives, but the editors caution the
                    reader <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-096-2-084"/> that this compilation "is not intended to be an
                    inclusive portrait of fur trade scholarship but, instead, is meant to represent new
                    directions" (p. vii).</p>
            <p>The editors add that "This volume questions the traditional focus of fur trade
                    literature," and many of the papers "raise subjects and themes that have been
                    either formerly overlooked or have been introduced and then neglected" (p. 1). The book
                    "seeks to redress some of these omissions," particularly those arising from
                    "scant attention to the rich insights revealed by the fields of social history and feminist
                    anthropology" (pp. 1, viii). The book does contribute usefully to these as well as more
                    established areas. Collectively the seemingly disparate papers provide a comprehensive view of the
                    many levels of the fur trade ranging from snaring and trapping on the trapline by Native American
                    women to a sociological analysis of symbolic and material exchange between the Iroquois and the
                    colonial French. The fur-trade business is well illustrated by studies of internal and external
                    confrontation involving the large fur-trade companies, Canadian governmental policy regulating
                    trapping and the trade, calculation of profits, impact of the trade on the Métis and
                    Native Americans, archaeological evidence on patterns of British and American artifact introduction
                    in southeastern North America, and the genesis of the fox-breeding industry.</p>
            <p>The papers themselves vary considerably not only in subject matter but also in readability and
                    quality. Both the lay reader and the student of the fur trade will find valuable material in this
                    well-crafted volume, but the variability of the collection will likely result in a mixed reaction
                    from the reader. Those interested in the history of Indiana will find nothing specifically relevant
                    here. The closest setting geographically is a somewhat disappointing study focusing on the female
                    kin network of Marie-Madeleine Réaume Larchevêque Chevalier, a <hi rend="i">métisse</hi> trader's wife who lived at Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>

                    </placeName>) in the eighteenth century. This particular paper has several errors of fact and
                    documentation concerning the French period. In sharp contrast is a carefully researched and highly
                    readable paper on fur-trade masculinity and the Beaver Club. This paper examines the nature and
                    activities of a well-known, exclusive fraternity of the Montreal fur trade, about which few details
                    and little historical context have been published.</p>
            <p>The editors included in this collection a chapter titled "Fur Trade History, Native History,
                    Public History: Communication and Miscommunication," written by ethnohistorian Laura Peers.
                    This study analyzes "the messages communicated about Native people at a number of
                    reconstructed 'living history' sites that use costumed staff to interpret period
                    buildings" (p. 101). Peers's research finds that the four reconstructed fur-trade
                    posts studied, including Colonial Michilimackinac in <placeName>

                    … tell part of the story of the European conquest of North America" (p. 104).
                    While recognizing that significant progress is being made by adding a Native American voice to the
                    interpretation, she nevertheless finds in her study of the four sites that "Interpretation
                    at all reconstructions currently depicts a social and racial gulf between Europeans and Native
                    peoples that denies the extraordinarily cross-cultural nature of the trade" (p. 108). This
                    and a number of the other chapters in <hi rend="i">New Faces of the Fur Trade</hi> will be of
                    interest to the general reader, while the book as a whole will be of particular value to the serious
                    student of the fur trade.</p>

            <p>John Singleton Mosby was one of the Civil War's most famous and most intriguing figures. He
                    gained great notoriety as a partisan fighter for the Confederacy, harassing Union commanders,
                    leading nighttime raids, and capturing thousands of horses. He captured one general in bed and
                    gained such a reputation that impatient northern parents would chastise their unruly children with
                    threats: "Hush, child, Mosby will get you" (p. 10). Despite his great success
                    during the war, Mosby's postwar life was full of controversy. His stern support of Ulysses
                    S. Grant and the Republican party alienated his fellow white southerners so much that he left the
                    South, residing abroad and in the far West. He lived until 1916, fiery and exceptional until the
                    end.</p>
            <p>James A. Ramage's biography of Mosby is exhaustive and well researched. He narrates
                    Mosby's life from childhood to death, even providing a discussion of the portrayal of Mosby
                    in film and television. Readers will find colorful portraits of many of Mosby's friends and
                    adversaries, including Robert E. Lee, Phil Sheridan, George A. Custer, J. E. B. Stuart, and James
                    Seddon. Ramage is interested in Mosby's legend, and much of his study attempts to separate
                    the myth from the reality to understand the "strengths and weaknesses of this great
                    man" (p. 10). Ramage does see Mosby as "great" and fills many pages
                    describing admirably the Virginian's successful and unconventional war-making. Mosby never
                    commanded more than 400 men and, in the larger context of the war, his efforts pale. But Ramage
                    concludes that Mosby's "small victories" helped retaliate against the
                    Yankee invasion and gave hope to the Confederacy (p. 347). Mosby <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-096-2-086"/> and his partisan rangers symbolized the core group of die-hard Confederates who would fight to
                    the bitter end.</p>
            <p>But Ramage's obvious admiration for Mosby prevents him from presenting a balanced and
                    critical portrait. Ramage repeats throughout the book that Mosby was two-sided: he had both a
                    gentle, charming side and one that was cold, cruel, and violent. Ramage explains that Mosby
                    developed this "extremely dynamic bipolar personality" because of his weak
                    physical health mixed with his family environment (p. 18). Even though Mosby suffered ill health
                    through much of his childhood and early adulthood, his mother, Ramage argues, instilled in her son a
                    powerful sense of self. Mosby was a strong individual with great empathy for the underdog. Whether
                    harassing a formidable enemy in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> or challenging pro-Lee zealots after the war, Mosby refused to waver from his objective
                    no matter what pressure was put upon him.</p>
            <p>However, Ramage's explanation of Mosby's personality and behavior seems to fall
                    short. Why did a man like Mosby so clearly enjoy war? What made someone with no military experience
                    so successful at war, especially guerilla warfare? As a member of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s slaveholding elite, Mosby found something in war that he apparently never
                    found anywhere else in his long life. His postwar politics made him extremely unpopular in his
                    native <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and after his wife died in 1876 he abandoned his children to his aging mother to live
                    in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-hk">Hong Kong</country>
                    </placeName> and on the West coast, far removed from his former Confederacy.</p>
            <p>This is a long book dense with details. But readers interested in Mosby's complicated and
                    often dark personality will have to wait for another biographer to take up the task of digging
                    deeper to understand the still elusive "Gray Ghost."</p>

               <hi rend="i">Domesticating Drink: Women, Men, and Alcohol in America, 1870-1940.</hi> By Catherine
                    Gilbert Murdock. (<placeName>

            <p>Catherine Gilbert Murdock's <hi rend="i">Domesticating Drink</hi> argues that
                    "alcohol, more than slavery or suffrage or any other single cause, effected American
                    women's politicization" (p. 9). The large and powerful Women's Christian
                    Temperance Union (WCTU), for instance, mobilized women for political activism by emphasizing both
                    that women were the victims of male alcoholics and that they only wanted the vote in order to
                    challenge alcohol, not as a symbolic demand of their rights. Murdock argues that the dominance of
                    the WCTU <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-096-2-087"/> and the stereotypes of Victorian women as
                    "abstemonious" have led many historians to assume that most respectable women did
                    not drink. Murdock disputes this notion with evidence from table-setting guides, etiquette manuals,
                    and cookbooks, all of which accepted alcohol as a necessary part of sociability and hospitality in
                    the home in the years before 1900. As proof of what she calls "women's temperate
                    drinking," Murdock finds that women consumed alcohol in medications, cooked with it, and
                    drank it within their homes during ladies' luncheons and dinner parties.</p>
            <p>Murdock suggests that concerns about a rise in women's public drinking increased popular
                    support for legal prohibition in the early twentieth century. Yet Murdock goes too far when she
                    claims that "alcohol, cocktails in particular, facilitated the evolution from Victorian to
                    modern America" (p. 88). What she does show is that the cocktail party became the preferred
                    mode of entertaining. As cocktails became associated with being modern and sophisticated, hard
                    liquor seemed less dangerous and more "domesticated."</p>
            <p>Significantly, Murdock argues that, because women had based their entry into politics on their moral
                    superiority and on temperance, the failure of national Prohibition and the increased acceptability
                    of women's drinking threatened their unified political power. As it became clear that
                    neither Prohibition nor suffrage significantly improved the morality of the public sphere,
                    "women no longer had a separate and respectable political voice" (p. 133).</p>
            <p>The creation in 1929 of a Women's Organization for National Prohibition Reform proved to
                    politicians that they no longer had to fear a women's voting bloc or gender gap. Murdock
                    claims that WCTU's "arrogant belief in women's innate dryness inspired
                    the formation of its most formidable enemy" (p. 138). The title of her book, <hi rend="i">Domesticating Drink</hi>, emphasizes the point that, as women's moderate drinking
                    became acceptable and as women and men began to drink together in public and at home, dry women
                    could no longer present drinking as something that "rendered men ungovernable" (p.
                    158). Prorepeal women specifically denied that all women were the same and advised women to vote as
                    "people" who carefully reviewed the issues and then made independent judgments.</p>
            <p>Murdock concludes that it is in the repeal of Prohibition that we can see the decline of the first
                    wave of the women's movement, a movement that had been based on a belief in fundamental
                    differences between the sexes. Without offering any solutions, Murdock suggests that the repeal of
                    Prohibition reveals more broadly that the "tenets of feminism entailed contradictions that
                    have yet to be resolved. In advising individual fulfillment, feminism refutes the concept of
                    gender-based unity among all women. In advising self-gratification, feminism negates the notion of
                    group solidarity essential to any movement" (p. 168).</p>
            <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-096-2-088"/>
            <p>Murdock's book will be of interest to those who wish to understand women's
                    political activism, changes in leisure culture, and drinking at the turn of the century.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Two Kingdoms, Two Loyalties</hi> is a fascinating social history of the American
                    Mennonite experience in the past half century with a particular focus on Mennonites'
                    shifting attitudes toward civil government. Mennonites, who share a historic peace tradition with
                    the Quakers and the Church of the Brethren, have long held to the religious principle of
                    nonresistance. In this meticulously researched volume, Perry Bush documents the shift from a
                    pre-World War II mentality of keeping careful distance from politics to an eventual embrace of
                    political activism. Bush shows how Mennonites' experiences in World War II, the Korean War,
                    the civil rights movement, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> War led to their increased engagement in governmental affairs.</p>
            <p>Since the nineteenth century, Mennonites have had a significant population in Indiana, particularly
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> College and the Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminaries continue to educate Mennonite
                    leaders. The archives of the Mennonite Church, located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, houses many of the primary source materials used for this study. Bush
                    describes three twentieth-century intellectual leaders of the Mennonite Church who spent their
                    careers in Indiana (administrator Harold S. Bender, religious scholar Guy F. Hershberger, and
                    ethicist John Howard Yoder) and demonstrates how they contributed to a Mennonite ethos that no
                    longer holds American political involvement at arm's length.</p>
            <p>This work focuses on grassroots expressions of pacifist ideology and political acculturation as well
                    as official statements and denominational leadership in times of national crisis. Bush explores the
                    theme of generational tension in Mennonite communities, highlighting the role of young radical
                    leaders in challenging traditionalist church leaders. In this interpretation, young American
                    Mennonite intellectuals played a crucial role in enlarging Mennonites' sociopolitical
                    perspectives in the 1940s as conscientious objectors in Civilian Public Service camps and during the
                    tumultuous 1960s. Bush's own sympathies clearly lie with these radicals of each generation
                        <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-096-2-089"/> who challenged authority and sought ways to communicate
                    their commitment to Christian peace and service. In the 1950s and beyond, these included some
                    Mennonites who were jailed for non-cooperation with national draft laws.</p>
            <p>Using Mennonite history as a case study, Bush argues that dissonance between theology and practice
                    can be a useful catalyst for change. He notes that in the post-World War II years,
                    "Mennonite practice in their witness to the state had begun to run substantially ahead of
                    Mennonite preaching" (p. 197) and Mennonite theology responded, in subsequent decades, to
                    individual and youthful demands for a more vocal, prophetic voice in the American landscape.</p>
            <p>Bush concludes that, perhaps more than many other religious communities, "Mennonites have
                    taken their own commitments as a people of peace seriously, interweaving them into the heart of
                    their postwar identity" (p. 270). <hi rend="i">Two Kingdoms, Two Loyalties</hi> is
                    recommended for anyone interested in American religious history and the interplay between civic
                    obligation and religious liberty.</p>

            <p>As the few scholars who have attempted to study guerrilla movements in the Philippines during World
                    War II have learned, determining the facts can be a frustrating process. The few sources that exist
                    are obscure, fragmented, and contradictory. The movement itself was born in controversy. When Bataan
                    and Corregidor fell, those American and Filipino officers who remained at liberty faced an agonizing
                    choice. Would they follow the orders of their senior commanders and surrender or wage an
                    unauthorized and perhaps illegal war? Contributing to the movement's troubles were personal
                    animosities and factions among the leaders, which were so bitter that they occasionally escalated
                    into gunfights. General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters contributed to the confusion by
                    its often capricious decisions on which of the competing guerrilla groups would be recognized as
                    legitimate. After the war some of the more effective guerrillas, such as the Hukbalahap, were
                    persecuted by the Philippine government, while some of the more suspect, such as Ferdinand Marcos,
                    were hailed as heroes. To this day the issue of who resisted and who did not continues to ignite
                    debate.</p>
            <p>To his very great credit, Bernard Norling has proved adept at negotiating this treacherous historical
                    terrain. The author of two other works on Philippine guerrillas, he has a solid command of the <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-096-2-090"/> limited archival material available and a dispassionate,
                    realistic view of the nature of guerrilla warfare. In this study of the guerrillas of Northern Luzon
                    and especially of Major Ralph Praeger's Cagayan-Apayao Forces (CAF), his task was made
                    especially difficult by the destruction of the CAF in 1943 and the deaths of all but one of its
                    leaders. Through laborious research, Norling has managed to reconstruct most of the history of this
                    gallant but doomed organization.</p>
            <p>When the Japanese invasion overwhelmed MacArthur's poorly armed and badly deployed
                    Fil-American forces, Praeger was in command of the Filipino 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Cavalry. A
                    calm, deliberate, practical officer, Praeger bore little resemblance to the dashing and romantic
                    cavalry trooper or guerrilla of legend. But adversity brought out his great strength of character
                    and a stubborn refusal to surrender. Cut off from the main army, he decided to carry on the war and
                    retreat into the forbidding mountains of Northern Luzon. For twenty months, he led one of the most
                    effective guerrilla forces on the island. Avoiding Japanese patrols, battling malaria and a host of
                    other diseases, and torn by internal feuds, the CAF gathered information on enemy dispositions and
                    conducted a series of costly hit-and-run attacks on the Japanese.</p>
            <p>Norling does an excellent job of portraying the grim realities of guerrilla war. The Japanese, as
                    they did throughout their occupied territories, behaved atrociously. Their counterguerrilla
                    campaigns were characterized by widespread looting, property destruction, rape, murder, and
                    massacre. The guerrillas themselves were prey to malaria, dysentery, and a host of other diseases.
                    They were often hungry and footsore, constantly on the move to evade enemy patrols, and disheartened
                    by the inability of the Allies to assist them.</p>
            <p>Written in a clear, dispassionate, and objective manner, this book is recommended for those
                    interested in an often-overlooked side of World War II.</p>

                        <p>Ronald Hamowy did something extraordinary in his December 1999 review of my book <hi rend="i">Jefferson's Declaration of Independence: Origins, Philosophy
                                        and Theology.</hi> In an effort to disprove one of my points, he unwittingly
                                    proved it. Arguing that property rights are inalienable he stated, "While a
                                    specific instance of property over which one has ownership can be sold, traded,
                                    transferred, or even destroyed, in sum 'alienated,' the
                                    'right to property' remains as 'inalienable' as
                                    rights to life and liberty." The problem with this illogic is all
                                    particular pieces or "specific instances" of property are
                                    alienable in the ways Hamowy mentions and you cannot have an inalienable right to
                                    what is alienable.</p>
                        <p>Much of Hamowy's confused thinking in his review, however, is due to not
                                    reading my book carefully. With a thorough read, he <hi rend="i">would have
                                    seen</hi> substantial reasons why Jefferson placed John Locke's never
                                    completely obtainable "pursuit of happiness" from <hi rend="i">An
                                        Essay concerning Human Understanding</hi> in the Declaration rather than, as
                                    Hamowy speculates, George Mason's very different "pursuing and <hi rend="i">obtaining</hi> happiness" idea that happiness can actually be
                                    obtained. He <hi rend="i">would have also seen</hi> that I did not omit the
                                    "most significant attribute" of John Pocock's classical
                                    republicanism although I expressed it differently than Hamowy's inadequate
                                    "distrust of wealth unsecured by real property" by contrasting
                                    "Court" with "Country" and emphasizing its
                                    stress on economic independence "through property ownership." In
                                    addition, he <hi rend="i">would have seen</hi> the ludicrousness of his claim that I
                                    described "classical republicanism in terms perfectly consistent with
                                    Lockean theory." Moreover, with a thorough read, he <hi rend="i">would have
                                        seen</hi> that I did cite historical evidence that Jefferson got his idea that
                                    property rights are alienable from reading Lord Kames's <hi rend="i">Historical Law Tracts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally he <hi rend="i">would have seen</hi> why I did not append
                                    "Jefferson's draft" rather than the final
                                    Congress-approved copy in a book on the philosophical ideas Jefferson placed in the
                                    Declaration. I explained in the text my method of demonstrating it was
                                    Jefferson's ideas that were in the numerous passages I quoted from the
                                    final approved copy. I annotated each quote to show that it was as Jefferson wrote
                                        <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-096-2-092"/> it or that changes made were his or that
                                    changes made by Congress did not alter the meaning of his language. If Hamowy had
                                    read the text and notes <hi rend="i">he would have seen</hi> that the principal
                                    philosophical ideas that remain in the final approved copy are Jefferson's.
                                    As to the religious affiliations of the members of the Continental Congress, if
                                    Hamowy would look them up he would find deists were few, as I stated.</p>
                        <p>In a general statement, Hamowy said my book "contains controversial
                                    assertions for which no evidence is adduced." Yet for anyone who <hi rend="i">reads</hi> my book the evidence is there in abundance. Moreover, much
                                    of that evidence is not "adduced." It is found in the self-evident
                                    statements of Jefferson himself. This is especially true of two of the
                                    book's principal assertions. First, the Declaration of Independence is an
                                    attack on religious absolutism in addition to its well-known attack on political
                                    absolutism since Jefferson maintained both absolutisms are antithetical to the
                                    Declarations's democratic politics. Second, a foundational truth of the
                                    democratic political relativism of the Declaration is its democratic religious
                                    relativism or deistic theology of "Nature's God" that
                                    Jefferson got from Lord Bolingbroke's deism or natural theology. These are
                                    original contributions to Jefferson scholarship that go well beyond Sydney Ahlstrom
                                    and Gilbert Chi-nard who, as Hamowy stated, recognized Bolingbroke's
                                    influence on Jefferson.</p>
                        <p>Hamowy gets the last word in this exchange since his response and my letter will be
                                    published simultaneously. His message will no doubt be similar to his review. The
                                    only counterpoint available to me, therefore, is to state that my book has been well
                                    reviewed by prominent scholars.</p>

                        <p>I have read Mr. Jayne's response to my review with some care and, despite
                                    its numerous italicized phrases, I find nothing in my original comments that needs
                                    changing. Indeed, his book warrants no more space than that already given to it by
                                    this journal.</p>
