            <p rend="center">(Copyright 1919, by John E. Iglehart)</p>
            <p>In 1916, at the request of the mayor of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the writer undertook the organization and direction of the work of
                    a Historical Commission of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Centennial for 1917. With a view to qualify himself better for the
                    work he sought the literature of the early western travelers, as well as other
                    writers, and began a search in the early records of the city and county of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName>, as well as of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> counties, out of which <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh county</region>
                    </placeName> had been created.</p>
            <p>The travels of William Faux in the west in the fall and winter of 1819 resulted
                    from his intimacy with the Ingle family in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Somersham</region>, <region type="county">Huntingdonshire</region>,
                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName>, where both families
                    lived, and a promise made by Faux to Rev. John Ingle, a Baptist minister, that
                    the former would visit the son of the latter at Saundersville in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh county</region>
                    </placeName>. The diary of Faux during five weeks he spent in John
                    Ingle's cabin is the only record in existence of the first British
                    settlement in Indiana. While local histories have recorded the <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-015-2-004"/> lives of many mmebers of that settlement and their
                    descendants, including many of the leading men of the community, and in
                    southwestern Indiana for one hundred years, no mention is made in any of them of
                    the colony as Faux describes it.</p>
            <p>When the war came on in 1917 the Historical Commission ceased its labors. The
                    writer, as a descendant of John Ingle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Somersham</region>
                    </placeName> and as a representative of three pioneer families of that
                    settlement, felt a call to restore the fading picture, and to trace the work and
                    lives of the emigrants and their descendants as town builders and commonwealth
                    builders, which seemed to him worthy to be recorded.</p>
            <p>The chief qualifications of the writer for the work lay in the fact that he had
                    personally known some of the original emigrants of the first generation and many
                    of their children, who had been born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, among whom was his mother. He had more or less a knowledge of the
                    history of the leaders of the settlement, as well as a large number of the one
                    hundred or more families who came into the settlement in the first decade. In a
                    law practice of about fifty years in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he has lived a still longer time, he was in a manner
                    familiar with the early history of the people of the city and county. So that in
                    handling the records and files of the city and county from the beginning as late
                    as 1830, the writer was able, so to speak, to become acquainted with the people
                    of the town and county, their character and their work in the first decade, and
                    to interpret many of the old records more fully than could have been done by a
                    stranger. In tracing the history of the beginnings of the early British
                    settlement, the personal knowledge of Mr. Edward Maidlow, still living in
                    excellent health, and James Erskine, recently deceased, who were born in it in
                    1831, were of great assistance, as has been Mrs. Samuel G. Evans, a
                    granddaughter of Sauriders Hornbrook, Sr., who has permitted the writer to
                    examine the family correspondence of the early time.</p>
            <p>As will appear in this sketch, the movement represented in the Indiana colony was
                    part of a greater one and a clear presentation of the whole was necessary to a
                    history of the part. No attempt has been made to repeat the history of the
                    Birkbeck-Flower movement, so fully presented in the writings <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-015-2-005"/> of those two men. The correctness of Prof. Edwin
                    Erle Sparks' statement as to the final outcome of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> colony, was challenged by Mr. Walter Colyer, and the writer was
                    glad to avail himself of the opportunity to invite Mr. Colyer to state the facts
                    upon the other side of the matter, which are presented by him probably as well
                    and as fully as can be done, and they will probably be the last word on that
                    subject.</p>
            <p>The final success of each of these colonies is not to be sought at this time, in
                    outward evidence of distinguishing British life, manners, or customs in any
                    form, as Professor Sparks seems to imply. The emigrants, though of English,
                    Irish and Scotch birth, became immediately American and their descendants are as
                    distinctly such today in every respect, as any portion of the American people.</p>
            <p>The Hoosier neighbors of the colonists in southern Indiana are traced with some
                    care, both the native leaders and the body of the people with whom they lived as
                    citizens and neighbors. Morris Birkbeck's descriptions in his <hi rend="i">Notes and Letters</hi> will always remain a valuable contribution
                    to the history of the time. His description of the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, quoted in the Edinburgh <hi rend="i">Review</hi>, is truthful, as
                    the writer has every reason to believe, and he has practiced law in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and on the circuit for almost fifty years and has a fair general
                    knowledge of the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson county</region>
                    </placeName>. While the influence of the early English and other foreigners and
                    the native eastern people has been felt in southern Indiana, there is no doubt
                    that the great body of the people of the southern portion of the State are of
                    southern descent.</p>
            <p>In dealing with the status of those people in the early history of the State, any
                    fair critic must realize that altogether undue emphasis has to this time been
                    placed in public opinion east of Indiana upon descriptions by early writers, who
                    have not fairly interpreted the people, but who have taken the bottom layer to
                    represent the whole people, or have been, correctly or not, so interpreted. In
                    presenting Birkbeck's picture of these people, as a fair type of the
                    plain people, who were much similar to the body of the people in all of the
                    counties of southern Indiana, the writer may seem to have dealt with the subject
                    as an advocate and a partisan. He <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-015-2-006"/> has
                    eliminated as irrelevant to a truthful picture of the better class of Hoosiers,
                        <hi rend="i">The Hoosier School Master</hi> entire, and much of the <hi rend="i">New Purchase</hi>, and has presented his facts and reasons.</p>
            <p>Both the chapter on the Men of the Western Waters by Roosevelt and the new and
                    splendid interpretation of frontier life in the Old North West by Frederick G,
                    Turner, relate to the people, the location and the time of which we are writing
                    and are germane to the description of the Hoosier neighbors of the British
                    colonists, who included the family of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
            <p>The references to Abraham Lincoln are intended chiefly to call attention to him
                    as a Hoosier neighbor of the British colony during its first decade and longer,
                    and the influence Upon his character of a life among the pioneer farmers of
                    southwestern Indiana, and to point out avenues of opportunity and information
                    which existed within his reach, during his residence in Indiana, up to the time
                    he was twenty-one years of age and which furnish facts relevant in the history
                    of the main theme. That he had more opportunities and read more books than his
                    historians are able to trace is conceded by them.</p>
            <p>The writer had prepared biographical data, with illustrations, of a number of the
                    original settlers and their descendants, among the latter a number of the
                    representative men and women in this section of the State, as well as elsewhere,
                    as a most complete verification of his statements, but the limitations of a
                    magazine article properly exclude them.</p>

            <p>In the summer of 1817, Saunders Hornbrook, Sr., of Tavistock, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Devonshire</region>, <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName>, perfected arrangements for his son, Saunders
                    Hornbrook, Jr., to come to America with his two sisters, and furnished him money
                    to purchase land, build temporary improvements and prepare accommodations for
                    the rest of the family, in the wilderness of the far west. He intended to follow
                    when the accommodations were ready. His wife, a woman of unusual ability, was to
                    remain behind a <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-015-2-007"/> couple of years with the two
                    smaller children and settle up the business. The senior Hornbrook operated large
                    manufactories (for the time), woolen mills and an iron foundry. He was an
                    educated man, as were his ancestors for several generations before him, and came
                    of good stock.</p>
            <p>The first week in October, 1817, the junior Hornbrook, with his sisters, arrived
                    at Pigeon creek, "a place merely for loading and discharging vessels
                    for the western part of Indiana State." <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, located half a mile above the mouth of Pigeon creek, then
                    consisted of thirteen log houses. A road ran out to the river through the bluff
                    bank at a point now the foot of Main street. He proceeded without delay to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twenty-seven miles due north, where Birkbeck and Flower had
                    established temporary quarters, while arrangements for the accommodations of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> settlement across the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> were in
                    progress. Both Flower and Birkbeck were well known in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and Hornbrook, Sr., had planned to join their settlement and
                    purchase about 1,000 acres of land on which to settle with his family. Their
                    scheme of land speculation, however, limited the amount of the purchase of one
                    farmer to one-half section of land, 320 acres, required the purchaser to take it
                    where it was assigned him, and the nearest to the proposed village centre where
                    Horn-brook could buy was about twenty miles distant. He was required to pay a
                    price per acre greater than that for which equally good or better land, much
                    nearer in the government domain, could be bought.</p>
            <p>These terms young Hornbrook indignantly refused. He returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "and after fourteen days constant fag, sometimes one and
                    sometimes two meals a day, sleeping in a barn or cabin at night, he fixed on a
                    spot of one and one-half sections," nine hundred and sixty acres, about
                    ten miles from the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, and seventeen miles from <placeName>

                    This was the beginning of the British settlement in Indiana which, in November,

                    general movement, checked the rapid growth of the Indiana colony for some years.
                    But emigration never wholly ceased. Later in the forties and early fifties
                    renewed emigration in large numbers set in from Great Britain. These later
                    emigrants were attracted largely by relatives, friends or acquaintances of the
                    British settlers and their descendants, who by that time were among the foremost

            <p>From 1819, when the Wheeler brothers and Robert Parrett came into the settlement,
                    and for twelve or fifteen years afterwards, while the community was too poor to
                    build a church or support a preacher, the town of <placeName>

                    </placeName> itself, as well as the rural districts, relied almost entirely upon
                    them—excepting an occasional visit of a Presbyterian missionary, or
                    the Methodist circuit rider—for an educated ministry.</p>
            <p>The names of Hornbrook, Ingle, Maidlow, Parrett, Hillyard, Wheeler, Erskine and
                    others were early well known in <placeName>

                    hundred years, through several generations, those names have stood for truth,
                    honesty, and justice in dealing with others. The large representation of those

                    degree to this fact. Among the latter, now living, will appear names known
                    throughout the country in literature and great moral reform and when the <placeName>

            <p>Before entering more fully into these details, it will be appropriate to give an
                    outline of the wider movement recognized at the time by leading authority in
                    Great Britain and America, as of world-wide importance, and of which the Indiana
                    colony was a part.</p>
            <p>Usually the significance of local history is that it is part of a greater whole.
                    The right and vital sort of local history is the sort which may be written with
                    lifted eyes—the sort which has a horizon and an outlook upon the

            <p>William Cobbet, in his dedication to Thomas Hulme's <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of a tour of the far west in 1818, ascribes the activity of the
                    latter to his zeal against the twin monsters, tyranny and priestcraft, and a
                    desire to assist in providing a retreat for the oppressed. He speaks of the
                    great numbers of immigrants flocking to the western countries, the newest of the
                    New World, toward which the writings of Morris Birkbeck had called their pointed
                    attention. Especially, were so attracted those Englishmen, "who having
                    something left to be robbed of, and wishing to preserve it, were looking towards
                    America as a place of refuge from the boroughmongers and the Holy

            <p>Hulme says he saw that the incomes of his children were all pawned to pay the
                    debts of the borough or seat owners. That of whatever he might be able to give
                    his children, which was a very substantial sum, as well as of what they might be
                    able to earn, more than one-half would be taken away to feed pensioned lords and
                    ladies, "soldiers to shoot at us, parsons to persecute us, and
                    fundholders, who had lent their money to be applied to purposes of enslaving

            <p>Richard Flower said in his letter of August 20, 1821, that the grand reason for
                    emigration was to escape that overwhelming system of taxation, which had
                    diminished the property of the emigrants, and threatened, if they staid much
                    longer, to swallow up the whole. He adds:<text>

                        <p>I most sincerely congratulate you on your choice and successful
                                    removing from your native country; you have privations, you have
                                    calculated upon, and from your accounts, fewer than you
                                    expected. Had you stopped here, you would have lived somehow,
                                    but you could not have continued in the society you have been,
                                    used to. Here the smaller stations of property appear gradually
                                    wearing to pauperism and the prospect before us is unpromising
                                    indeed; agriculture dark, commercial and manufacturing stations
                                    no less so. Prices are low, markets are falling, corn traders
                                    stopping, laborers out of employ, and money so scarce as in a
                                    great measure, what can be omitted, possibly, is omitted. Poor
                                    rates are enormous and appearances seem to tell us they will
                                    still increase.</p>

            <p>Faux gives as the reason of James Maidlow for emigrating, that after a fair
                    trial, with a large farm, he found it impossible to farm, without losing money.</p>
            <p>Payton Wheeler, a tradesman from Chelsea, told Faux that having a wife and eight
                    children, he was determined on emigration by soberly looking into his affairs
                    and finding that he had an increasing family, and decreasing property, having
                    lost during his last year, among his tradsemen, 1,500 pounds. Birkbeck, in his
                        <hi rend="i">Notes</hi>, is thus quoted in the Edinburgh <hi rend="i">Review</hi>: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>A Nation, with half its population supported by alms, or poor-rates, and
                            one-fourth of its income derived from taxes, many of which are dried up
                            in their sources, or speedily becoming so, must teem with emigrants from
                            one end to the other, and, for such as myself, who have had
                            "nothing to do with the laws but obey them," it is
                            quite reasonable and just to secure a timely retreat from the
                            approaching crisis—either of anarchy or despotism.</p>
                        <p>An English farmer, to which class I had the honor to belong, is in
                            possession of the same rights and privileges with the villeins of old
                            time, and exhibits for the most part, a suitable political character. He
                            has no voice in the appointment of the legislature, unless he happen to
                            possess a freehold of forty shillings a year, and he is then expected to
                            vote in the interest of his landlord. He has no concern with public
                            affairs, excepting as a tax-payer, a parish officer, or a militiaman. He
                            has no right to appear at a county meeting, unless the word inhabitant
                            should find its way into the sheriff's invitation; in this case
                            he may show his face among the nobility, clergy, and freeholders; a
                            felicity which once occurred to myself, when the <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-015-2-015"/> inhabitants of Surrey were invited to
                            assist the gentry in crying down the Income Tax.</p>
                        <p>Thus, having no elective franchise, an English farmer can scarcely be
                            said to have a political existence; and political duties he has none,
                            except such as, under existing circumstances, would inevitably consign
                            him to the special guardianship of the Secretary of State for the home
                            department.</p>

            <p>Confirming the experience of Hulme and others, as to religious persecution,
                    Saunders Hornbrook, Sr., the father of the British settlement in Indiana, whose
                    mother, Barbara, was the daughter of Rev S. Richards, of Calstock, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Devonshire</region>
                    </placeName>, a Unitarian minister, gave as his reason for emigration, in
                    addition to business depression, the fact that he was fined a shilling for
                    attendance at the Unitarian chapel of each member of his family and household.</p>
            <p>As early as the end of 1816 the problem of emigration from Great Britain to
                    America had become a serious one, both to the British government, and to the
                    people of America. In <placeName>

                    </placeName> alone nearly 2,000 such emigrants who, according to John Bradbury,
                    foolishly remained about the cities till their money gave out, were stranded and
                    appealed to their home government for aid. Competition among laborers was great,
                    as emigrants were arriving from all of the nations of Europe. In February, 1817,
                    the British consul in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, by newspaper advertisement, announced "the important
                    privilege to such English emigrants, to settle in upper <placeName>

                    of emigrants, which practice, he says, was not confined to newcomers only, but

                    had assumed a new character. It was no longer merely the poor, the idle, the
                    profligate or the wildly speculative, who were proposing to quit their native
                    country, but men also of capital, of industry, of sober and regular pursuits;
                    men of reflection, who apprehended approaching evils; men of upright and
                    conscientious minds, to whose happiness civil and religious liberty were
                    essential. And men of domestic feeling, who wished to provide for the future

                    British people met with a response of approval so general as to alarm the
                    partisans of the government, and to provoke from them attacks upon America and
                    things American; travelers like Fearon and Faux were biased with this spirit. It
                    was said of him by Faux that "no man since <placeName>

                    of Surrey. He had accumulated property which he converted into about 55,000
                    dollars cash, which he invested in his scheme of emigration. A large number of

            <p>George Flower was the son of Richard Flower, who was a large brewer at Hertford,
                    the county town of Hertfordshire, who had retired from business after acquiring
                    a competence, and lived upon a beautiful estate called Marden. He was the head
                    of a prominent family, still influential in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    years of age, and personally joined him in promoting the success of the colony
                    where he lived the remainder of his life.</p>
            <p>Birkbeck and Flower sought to buy an entire township of about 40,000 acres, but
                    this required an act of congress to make an exception to the government method
                    of selling land, and that plan failed. The scheme outlined in
                    Birkbeck's <hi rend="i">Notes</hi> was therefore modified and Birkbeck
                    and Flower bought 16,000 acres in one body and other tracts were from time to
                    time added by them and by individual purchases. It is not unlikely that Birkbeck
                    and Flower might have obtained the privilege of buying one or more townships of
                    land in a body without its offer at public sale, if the Hibernian societies of

                    to the Irish emigrants for colonization in bodies in the west. The House of
                    Representatives, by a decisive vote, adopted a committee report adverse to these
                    petitions, and which called attention to others without naming them, doubtless
                    including that of Birkbeck and Flower.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> An unfortunate

                    extraordinary influence upon the British people. While in America, his son in <placeName>

            <p>Enormous sums of money were spent in many ways very early by the Flowers for the
                    betterment and improvement of the colony and its inhabitants and to attract
                    emigrants. They, with Birkbeck, were broad, liberal and philanthropic. Their
                    money so lavishly spent, was not a wise financial investment in the primitive
                    state of society and economic development of the country, then just commencing.
                    The final success of the prairie agricultural colony was to be from the labor of
                    the individual farmer and his family, acting independently. Large sums invested
                    so far in advance of the times in the wilderness, were never returned and George
                    Flower and his wife lived to endure "pinching penury" in the

                    Flower, and Morris Birkbeck, descriptive of the times and country in their
                    relationship to this emigration. He did not claim to have before him all the
                    facts in relation to the progress of that settlement, nor any acquaintance with
                    the community necessary for a determination of the question of the success of

                    </placeName> would seem to be a misapprehension.</p>

                    English customs or laws, or with a separate or independent existence. This was
                    the opposite of Birkbeck's scheme outlined in his <hi rend="i">Notes.</hi> It was rather their movement together into a new country for the
                    betterment of men and women of common hopes and aims. It was to become pioneers
                    and citizens of a democratic republic, where the oppressive burden of rents,
                    tithes, poor rates and taxes from which they fled, practically had no existence.
                    They came, too, like the Pilgrims of old, to seek freedom from oppression,
                    including freedom to worship God. All of the Americans were emigrants or
                    descendants of emigrants. The English settlers ceased to be foreigners, they
                    became Americans, with all others.</p>
            <p>The success, in a sense, of an English settlement in the beginning of a community
                    like this, lay in its perfect union with all the better elements of population
                    as then came into the country, and they came rapidly. Its highest success lay in
                    the extent of its contributions to the building of character among the people,
                    to the elevation of ideals, to the establishment of public opinion, based on
                    correct standards of right and wrong, leadership in establishing public
                    improvements, churches, school houses, introducing good stock, in creating
                    improved farms, early roads, bridges and mills, and later, canals, railroads,
                    telegraph and a system of public education, <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-015-2-022"/>
                    as well as everything entering into the make-up of good society.</p>
            <p>Many of these things were introduced by Birkbeck and Flower in the very beginning
                    at enormous expense never returned to them, and with the aid of the influence of
                    the English settlers most of them came sooner than they would have come without
                    that aid. Such was distinctly the result in southwestern Indiana of the

            <p>Mr. Walter Colyer, of Albion, himself a descendant of one of the English
                    settlers, was for nearly twenty years editor of the Albion <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, during which period he gathered much material relating to the <placeName>

                    past fifteen years, since quitting the newspaper field, his stock of material
                    has increased. He has written and published a number of articles upon the
                    subject, a number for the <placeName>

                    He has an invaluable collection of books and pamphlets on the subject which have
                    been of much value to the writer in extending his investigation to the <placeName>

                                    Centennial Celebration. I have no means of knowing how many of
                                    those descendants were present, but it is quite likely that they
                                    comprised from one-third to one-half of the total attendance.</p>
                        <p>Edwards is a county in which approximately nineteen-twentieths of
                                    the farmers reside on their own farms, and farm mortgages are
                                    the exception and not the rule. The delinquent tax list,
                                    published once a year, has numerous times been printed in less
                                    than one column of space in a local newspaper. There has not
                                    been a saloon in Albion, the county seat, for more than
                                    forty-five years, and none in the entire county for that period

                        <p>Edwards is a county in which practically every farmer owns a

                        <p>The county is famous for the fact that its county jail, as well
                                    as the county almshouse, is often unoccupied for months at a
                                    time, and the jailer makes his living by other means. It can
                                    also be said with truth that Edwards is a county in which high
                                    school, college or university graduates, can be found sprinkled
                                    about on almost every section of land.</p>

            <p>The facts which led Hornbrook to refuse the terms offered him by the promoters of
                    the <placeName>

                    appear in the reasons already given for that step.</p>
            <p>There was something in the headship of one or two persons over others, especially
                    strong men, in the direction and domination of the most important step, in the
                    change of home and country, that was tolerated in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, but wholly foreign to American soil and life. It appears that
                    Birkbeck and Flower could not agree and organized rival towns. Whatever the
                    cause assigned for the quarrel, it was true, then as now, that there could be
                    but one leader to a single movement.</p>
            <p>The natives called Birkbeck the Czar of the prairies. Flower, as stated, lived in
                    the finest house west of the Allegheny mountains, and in an unusual degree
                    brought into the far west English life and comforts at a great expense. Both
                    these men saw the future of the country and that empires were to be established
                    in the new western States.</p>
            <p>The power of organization, leadership and money had its limits, and the success
                    of the farmer lay in the products of the soil, only to be obtained by a life of
                    hard labor. Hired labor could not be obtained to accomplish that result. Men
                    would not work for others when their work for themselves would pay for their
                    farm.</p>
            <p>There was another circumstance which exerted some influence upon the members of
                    the Indiana colony. A number of the leaders of the emigrants in the Indiana
                    colony were men of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> faith and principles, which moulded their lives and characters.
                    They believed implicitly in God's providence in the affairs of men, and
                    that moral forces rule the world. The moral and religious supremacy of the
                    Indiana settlement was early one of its distinguishing features. Its ministers
                    and many of its leaders believed in positive and demonstrative Christianity as
                    opposed to mere forms. They were not, however, subject to the criticism made
                    against the backwoodsmen, where public worship was very often directed and
                    controlled by ignorant and uncouth native ministers.</p>

                    </placeName> on one occasion, on account of the absence of church services in
                    the prairie settlement, arrangements were made for a shoemaker, Mr. Brown, to
                    read printed sermons at Wanboro, in a little cabin, and another layman read the
                    Episcopal service in the public library at Albion. On the arrival of Richard
                    Flower in 1819, he "preached" regularly every Sunday, the
                    dissenters service without church organization.</p>
            <p>The slaveholders who attacked Birkbeck, denounced him unfairly, as an infidel. He
                    had, in one of his letters (No. 20), admitted writing a preacher who offered to
                    come to his colony to fight infidelity and bigotry saying he had not a word to
                    say to that offer "dissuasive or encouraging" and that bigotry
                    "is a disease for which I think no remedy is so effective as letting
                    alone." The preacher did not come. The press attacked him for his
                    alleged irreligion in other utterances.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Eclectic Review</hi> of 1818 denounced as a profane jest his
                    motto on the title page of his letters, "Vox clamantis e
                    deserto." The same motto is used in a similar manner in the <hi rend="i">New Purchase</hi>, Chap. X, by a prominent Presbyterian divine in a
                    description of pioneer life in Indiana, with seeming propriety.</p>
            <p>No doubt there was unfair criticism of the "theology" of these
                    promoters, but the absence of ministers, with a practical rebuff to one who
                    desired to come to the Wanboro settlement, had its effect upon some of the
                    deeply spiritual and religious men among the emigrants. Father Parrett and
                    Father Wheeler, who settled in the Indiana colony in 1819, were educated
                    Wesleyan ministers and for a generation exercised great influence among the
                    people with whom religion was a matter of the first importance.</p>

            <p>As one of a committee of five he made a contract with Dr. Robert H. Rose for an

                        <region type="county">Susquehanna county</region>

                    hundred thousand acres in a body extending into eight townships. He had, several
                    years previously, advertised substantially the same scheme of a colony and had
                    established a settlement of <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> farmers on the tract. Although his terms were easy, between April,
                    1813, and September, 1815, over one hundred suits had been brought against <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> settlers unable to pay the price of three dollars per acre.</p>
            <p>In 1818 Rose advertised still easier terms to settlers, bought out the small

                    who undertook to carry on the scheme which had been abandoned by the New

            <p>Faux's travels west of the Alleghenies, a round trip of over 1,600
                    miles, were made to visit an old friend, John Ingle, of Saundersville, upon a

                        <region type="county">Somersham</region>

                    absence, if the latter would visit his son in America. Faux spent five weeks in
                    John Ingle's cabin, the picture of which is the frontispiece of his
                    book.</p>

                    </placeName> and Albion and Wanboro and was by Ingle introduced to George Flower
                    and Birkbeck. Faux talked with both these men, as well as the third party
                    connected with their quarrel, and his apparently confidential conversations with
                    all of them are published by him, though of no public interest.</p>
            <p>Faux's descriptions are without any literary merit, and so described in
                    the English reviews of the time, and are only valuable as a record of facts

                    women raised in the old country, with its conveniences and comforts, that he was

                    to speak, in the agonies of birth, and things were at their worst. In a short
                    time many of the conditions Faux describes improved and most of his dire
                    predictions were never verified. His narration deals with events of trifling
                    importance in the daily life of the people without sense of propriety or
                    proportions of most of them. The privacy of the lives of the people was no
                    shield from his attacks. The Saundersville settlement, with its people and its
                    surroundings, occupies a greater portion of the diary of which his volume is
                    composed than any other single subject in the book. It is particularly valuable,
                    however, as it is the only published record of the early time, other than
                    Woods' reference above set out, in which any information whatever is

            <p>George Flower, who wrote his book forty years later, mentions Hornbrook, Ingle

                    was the father of the Indiana settlement, so called by Woods and Faux, and he
                    had ground to believe that Hornbrook did not like him. He goes out of his way,

                            advantage, an observer ought to have visited the New World twice in the
                            course of a few years. A single view is insufficient to exhibit this
                            progress in the States already settled; for there, quickly as the
                            changes are going on, the process of creation is not actually seen at
                            once, or disclosed, as it were, to the eye; some interval of time must

                            change. But the extraordinary state of things in the western part of the

                            nations; we at once behold in what manner the settled parts of America
                            are increasing with unparalleled rapidity; and how new and extensive
                            communities are daily created in the plains and the forests of the west,

                    in all civic duties. While members of the settlement in the beginning were

            <p>Robert M. Evans, Elisha Harrison, Hugh McGary and all of his brothers, State
                    Senator, later Governor Ratliff Boone, and others were indicted and tried for
                    misdemeanors, generally assault and battery. Some well-known persons were
                    indicted for more serious offenses. Doubtless it was true that resort was had to
                    the grand jury in a number of cases then, which to us now seem trivial. Probably
                    the excuses for such very strict and frequent use of the law existed in the fact
                    that there was in the beginning a vicious, lawless and dangerous element in the
                    lower classes, which without the fear of the law, stopped at nothing. It did not
                    hesitate to defy the law at the beginning, and until the supremacy of the law
                    was fully vindicated, which, as will appear, was soon done. It needs no argument
                    to make clear that even the lawless element of that period, as they appear to us
                    now, became such in part at least, as the result of the great sarcifice made by
                    them and their ancestors in performing their work, of conquering and holding the
                    land west of the mountains from the Indians. For several generations they had
                    been sentinels on the border of civilization. But for this work also, in
                    occupying the land conquered by George Rogers Clark, the treaty between Great
                    Britain and the Colonies at the close of the Revolutionary war would have left

                    1818, which we have seen, was written by Morris Birkbeck, who sought to discover
                    all that was good in them, but who stated both sides in his descriptions. In the
                    article already cited, from the Edinburgh <hi rend="i">Review</hi> of June,
                    1818, so fully reviewing Birkbeck's <hi rend="i">Notes on America</hi>,

                            arrival. It contained fifty houses; was the county town of the district;
                            and contained (says Mr. B) as many "well informed, genteel
                            people, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, as any county town I
                            am acquainted with." "I think," he adds,
                            "there are half as many individuals who are entitled to that
                            distinction as there are houses; and not one decidedly vicious
                            character, nor one that is not able and willing to maintain

                    races and elements, it would be absurd to expect that a general character could
                    then be formed, or that it would be for many years to come. After referring to

            <p>Consistent with all Birkbeck says, had he been searching for material for a

                    testify that practically all of his dialect phrases and words are true to life

                    made any claim that the book contains any description of the better class of
                    Hoosiers who lived in southern Indiana at the beginning of the State, or the
                    time of which he writes, he fails to guard that class against the opinion so

                    autobiographical sketch, a delightful article, the chief purpose of which seems
                    to be to clear his memory and that of his ancestors.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the many of such unfriendly interpretations was one by the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly</hi>, in reviewing one of his novels, which he says in his
                    introduction to his biography, sympathetically remarked on the hardship it must
                    have been to a "highly organized man" to be born in southern
                    Indiana, in an age of hard-cider campaigns. In resenting this, and praising <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, his birthplace, he confines his defense or eulogy to the beauty of
                    its location and of the natural scenery surrounding it—"one
                    of the loveliest villages on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>," but
                    there is nothing in defense of the much misunderstood Hoosiers who lived there.
                    The following sentence seems significant at this point: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I changed to the larger Indiana towns, along the <geogName>Ohio

            <p>Only speaking of his own family he says he was "born in an intellectual
                    atmosphere." While he vindicated himself and his family, he left it to
                    time and to others, to do full justice to the better class of early Hoosier
                    people. It cannot be doubted that this silence on the author's part,
                    upon the interpretation thus widely given to this work, the most popular of all
                    his books, was intentional on his part and that he had a motive in not
                    "meddling" with the subject.</p>
            <p>Two years later in 1892—he published a Library Edition of the book
                    with a long and elaborate preface, which he calls a biography of the book,
                    dealing with the history and character of the work, its wonderful success, and
                    declares it to be the file leader of American dialect novels. His discussion
                    along that line is novel and very interesting. He says: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Here seems to be an explanation why the author had determined to keep
                    "hands off" the book. Without discussing that subject, it
                    seems clear that as a dialect novel of low life only, it is irrelevant, and
                    should be excluded as a history of the better class of Hoosiers of that time.
                    The writer has always regarded Dr. Eggleston as one of the leading American men
                    of letters, of whom the Hoosiers should be justly proud. In his sketch of his
                    life mentioned, he traces his ancestry on one side to the old <placeName>

                    </placeName> aristocracy, and his short characterization of that people as they
                    appeared to him, is a masterpiece, worthy of reproduction here. After stating
                    that at sixteen, after his father's death, he was sent to live for a

                            out of the existence of a slave class, it could not fail to excite a
                            profound interest in the mind of one who had been bred in a simpler and
                            less dignified society, in which proprieties were less regarded, and

                            a life, which, in the new world and in the middle years of the

                    ideals.</p>
            <p>Had Eggleston remained west, in that deep sympathy with western life found in the
                    character sketches of Judge James Hall,<hi rend="sup">66</hi> of the same class
                    of people described in Eggleston's work generally, it may be questioned
                    whether his method of treatment would have been the same. Or, if so, whether he
                    would not at least have made a reasonable effort to anticipate the unfriendly
                    effect which his work was destined to produce upon the reputation of the early
                    Hoosier pioneers, outside of the State. It is to be regretted that he neglected
                    at this last opportunity to say a word on the subject.</p>
            <p>Had Baynard Hall sought to find the coarse exhibitions of uncultured and ignorant

                    doubt he could have found them. Many counterparts of his caricatures of
                    offensive habits of common people could probably then and later have been found
                    in <placeName>

                    written anonymously and individuals are attacked under assumed names so that a
                    key to the book is required. One future governor of the State, James Whitcomb,
                    was grossly caricatured, if not libeled. Upon the character of Joseph A. Wright,
                    later governor, <placeName>

                    Hall's criticisms against the camp-meetings are severe. They are
                    caricatured in a relentless manner with no expressions of sympathy with the
                    people, nor their religious emotion, to mitigate the bitterness. His style is

                    their home life, described by Hall as he saw it, will always remain an
                    interesting and truthful picture of the pioneer age of Indiana that has passed.
                    It cannot be denied, however, that his view point of the people is that of a
                    leading actor in the play of Hoosier life, where he failed to succeed, and he
                    makes no effort to disguise his bitterness as a bad loser.</p>

                    with other friendly travelers and writers of that time, give many illustrations
                    of the high traits of manhood, intelligence, independence, and good qualities
                    shown by them under circumstances of the severe hardships of their lives. They
                    place them above the common people of Europe and to some extent foretell the
                    character of the coming natives of the west.</p>
            <p>All this was accessible to Eggleston and Baynard Rush Hall. It is not believed
                    that it was intentionally suppressed by them, but it was not to their purpose
                    nor within their viewpoint. Under the guise of fiction or fictitious
                    surroundings, writers without restraint, or any seeming sense of responsibility
                    for consequences, have taken unfair liberties with society, sometimes with an
                    intent inconsistent with fairness and justice, with sarcasm and ridicule without
                    proper and fair discrimination in favor of the best. We refer to moral
                    responsibility. The doctrine of legal responsibility for libel protects
                    individuals from attacks of this kind whether open or covert.</p>
            <p>Very recently a leading western publishing house, which issued a novel, was
                    surprised with a libel suit in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    the plaintiff a verdict of thirty-five thousand dollars damages against the
                    publisher.</p>
            <p>Such material has been misleading and has furnished the man of the east the
                    opportunity of exercising the undue and offensive familiarity of the elder to
                    the younger brother in the west. There should be yet those, while a few of the
                    children of those pioneers live, who have spent their youth among them, and who
                    were in sympathy with them during their lives, who shall describe them, in truth
                    and justice and kindness, without the intrusion of descriptions of a lower and
                    disgusting class of humanity, to unfairly detract from a truthful picture. An

            <p>It is of the greatest importance that among the young people of Indiana there

                    rather than so great over-emphasis of the husks that are to be found in the

            <p>Roosevelt's chapters on the Backwoodsmen of the Alleghenies and on the
                    Men of the Western Waters contain a wealth of historical facts and descriptions
                    of the traits of the native pioneer. His appreciative sympathy with the
                    frontiersman has enabled him to furnish this as no other man has done. This has
                    been supplemented by the work of Dr. Frederick Turner, who has been concerned
                    with the reactive influences of the central west upon the east, with the
                    development of institutions, and the later history of events in which he has
                    been the best interpreter of the life of the people of this section of the time
                    of which we write.</p>
            <p>There were also men, a few of whom have been mentioned, living on the north side

                    population out of which that composite society was formed, and who have left
                    such a record.</p>

                    personally knew many of the men and women who were pioneers in the period

                    life, up to manhood, and his character as the world later knew him, show him to
                    have been too aggressive and earnest in search for knowledge of the outside
                    world to have been ignorant of all of these sources of information, which for
                    that age were fairly easy of access to him, without doubt. Many of the
                    interesting facts of his life in Indiana have been wholly lost to history. That
                    no record is preserved of his knowledge obtained from any of these sources may
                    be accounted for in the death of the people of that time, capable of
                    appreciating its importance, before Lincoln became famous, or that the facts
                    involved may have escaped inquiry later, or that many of the illiterate of his
                    neighbors may not have known or remembered such facts.</p>

                    these avenues of information till after he was 21 years old. Miss Robey, to whom
                    Lincoln paid special attention as a young woman, who later married Allen Gentry,
                    said of Lincoln: "He was better read than the world knows or is likely

                    frontier was more and more American at the start; and soon the older communities
                    were reacted upon wholesomely by the simplicity and democracy of the west. These
                    considerations give the key to the meaning of the west in American history.<hi rend="sup">102</hi> Says Frederick G.</p>

                    had put at his disposal. He adds: "Is it Herder who says, my whole life

                    State to the free soil and free institutions of Indiana and settled in the

                            and the development of great plantations in that region. What had been
                            typical of the democracy of the Revolutionary frontier and of the
                            frontier of Andrew Jackson was now to be seen in the States between the <placeName>

                            of the old northwest. Indeed, he is the embodiment of the democracy of
                            the west.</p>
                        <p>The pioneer life from which Lincoln came differed in important respects
                            from the frontier democracy typified by Andrew Jackson.
                            Jackson's democracy was contentious, individualistic, and it
                            sought the ideal of local self-government and expansion. Lincoln
                            represents rather the pioneer folk who entered the forest of the great
                            northwest to chop out a home, to build up their fortunes in the midst of
                            a continually ascending industrial movement. In the democracy of the
                            southwest, industrial development and city life were only minor factors,

                            of the region to which Lincoln came. The men were commonwealth builders,
                            industry builders. Whereas the type of hero in the southwest was
                            militant, in the northwest he was industrial. It was in the midst of
                            these "plain people," as he loved to call them, that
                            Lincoln grew to manhood. As Emerson says: "He is the true
                            history of the American people in his time." The years of his
                            early life were the years when the democracy of the northwest came into
                            struggle with the institution of slavery that threatened to forbid the
                            expansion of the democratic pioneer life in the west.</p>

            <p>The ideal of the west was its emphasis upon the worth and possibilities of the

                    of his own nature, under conditions of social mobility. Western democracy was no
                    theorist's dream. It came stark and strong and full of life from the

            <p>The severity of pioneer life, with its hard labor, the isolation of families,
                    want of good roads in winter, the limited opportunity for gathering together of
                    people at public entertainments and Sunday religious services, made social life
                    and entertainment at a very early day, especially for women and children, very
                    limited. In this respect the life of the settlers of the English settlement was
                    much in common with the life of the native pioneers with whom they mingled.
                    Visiting was common among young people and relatives. For a young man to call
                    upon a young lady meant often for him to ride horseback five or ten miles, even
                    farther. Saturday afternoons were generally recognized as a time for recreation.
                    At the neighborhood store of evenings and particularly Saturday afternoons, the
                    men, young and old, gathered in groups for sociability and to barter; money was
                    scarce and most of the trade, and purchases as well, were exchanges of goods at
                    market prices.</p>
            <p>At these gatherings stories were told and jokes perpetrated. Rifle practice,
                    testing the best skill of the hunter, was a popular entertainment. When men or
                    boys went to the store or visiting, they usually carried a gun, on the
                    probability of seeing a deer or other game or wild animal.</p>
            <p>At corn shuckings and log rollings a general good time, with feasting, dancing
                    and drinking, followed. If a neighbor was sick and unable to cut his firewood,
                    or a widow had no one to do that work for her, neighbors would gather with their
                    axes and cut a good pile of wood and carry or haul it to the house. Such an
                    occasion was generally followed by a general social entertainment. The drinking
                    habit, while abused here as elsewhere by persons who indulged to excess, was a
                    very common one, and public opinion was tolerant of it. Faux expresses
                    throughout his book the highest Christion sentiment, no doubt sincerely. He is
                    merciless in his criticisms generally, and especially of the poor lodging
                    accommodations for travelers at taverns and in private houses. He occasionally
                    mentions in mitigation of the many faults that good whiskey or brandy was
                    produced. Mr. Hornbrook <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-015-2-065"/> records the
                    well-known fact that when on occasions the preacher arrived at the house to
                    conduct religious services there, and was tired and needed a stimulant, he did
                    not hesitate to set out the decanter of brandy, which was welcome. As a rule,
                    people drank in moderation. The Erskines tried to raise a log cabin without free
                    whiskey, but most reluctantly were compelled to yield the point. Whiskey was
                    five cents a glass, and a glass full at the store was often divided up among a
                    number of persons. Fifteen or twenty cents would buy a small jug full. Excitable
                    or quarrelsome persons under the influence of whiskey sometimes engaged in
                    brawls.</p>
            <p>If a fight reached the danger point in the matter of public peace or example or
                    safety, the grand jury frequently indicted one or both of the parties, who had
                    to plead guilty or stand a jury trial in the circuit court. The record of these
                    court trials, as well as of civil suits, where the names of the principals
                    involved, as well as the names of by-standers and witnesses, are endorsed upon
                    the indictment or found in the summons and subpoenas, has been one of the aids
                    in refreshing the memories of the oldest inhabitants, particularly Edward
                    Maidlow and James Erskine, who have assisted in restoring the faded pictures of
                    these early times.</p>
            <p>Negley's mill was a rendezvous for people of all classes from different
                    neighborhoods, who came to mill. There stood a substantial frame steam saw mill
                    and steam flour, corn and grist mill. Nearby the family lived, in a substantial
                    and commodious farm house. The Negley mill, which had been established and owned
                    by James Anthony (not Jonathan Anthony, as the historians record), was the best
                    equipped mill of its kind in southwestern Indiana for many years, and changed
                    hands when Negley bought it, about 1819, at a very considerable price. At the
                    earliest date animal power, alone, in a log house, was used, and the mill
                    supplied the country for many miles around. In a local history is given an
                    interesting description of the old days at Negley's mill and the social
                    life and entertainments there, which continued down for a generation. A trip to
                    the mill was often an excuse for young people of both sexes to go to the
                    business and social <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-015-2-066"/> center. The list of

                    for sociability, with the labors which the women had then to perform, and this

                    to a greater extent." Of course, there was no benefit or sociability
                    for the women in these meetings, but there had "come into the

                    Sunday. If he could not get anyone to come, as they were, other than the
                    Wheelers, Joseph and Richard, and Parrett, few and far between, he would himself
                    read a sermon from some English book of sermons, and the reading was followed by
                    prayer and song service. There were at that early period eight or ten Unitarian

                            meetings of the class and preaching services were held. At this time the
                            territory was in the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                            </placeName> conference, <placeName>

                            </placeName> district, Patoka circuit. This circuit had thirty-two
                            appointments and was served by two preachers living at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                            </placeName>. Each made a round every four weeks. The class meetings in
                            those days were held invariably after preaching services.</p>
                        <p>In 1827, three years after the organization, the meeting place of the
                            society was transferred to the home of William Hillyard, Sr., and
                            continued at this place until the year 1834, when the society built a
                            hewed log house 20 × 24 feet and covered it with clapboards.
                            The first seats were round poles, after a time these were replaced with
                            improved seats made by splitting small logs in the center, shaving off
                            the splinters with a drawing knife, boring holes in the bark side,
                            inserting sharpened pieces of timbers into these holes. These seats were
                            known as benches. This church had five windows, two on each side, and
                            one behind the pulpit. This building stood on a rise of ground near the
                            cemetery. The society continued to worship in this rude structure until
                            1851, when the second house, which is still used, was built on ground
                            one-half mile south of the cemetery.</p>
                        <p>The first class leader was Hark Wheeler. There were eighteen persons
                            belonging to this class. Other class leaders, who had done estimable
                            service, were Joseph Harrison, Alexander Hillyard, Sr., William Crisp,
                            Henry Harrison and Thomas Hillyard.</p>
                        <p>From the best information that can be gained, the first Sunday School was
                            organized in 1838 in the old log church. There were twenty members
                            belonging to this school. Alexander Hillyard, Sr., was the first
                            superintendent. The Sunday School in those days memorized a great amount
                            of Scripture.</p>

            <p>The McJohnson Methodist Episcopal chapel was located at McCutchanville, about
                    three miles south of Hillyard church, at an early date, and these two churches
                    have for many years sustained a stationed minister in a church parsonage located
                    at McCutchanville. A Methodist church was erected near Saundersville at a point
                    where the church cemetery now known as the Ingle cemetery is located, but the
                    church building was later removed.</p>
            <p>The Episcopalians had a church in the settlement, and as late as 1850 one was
                    known as Faux's chapel. Whether named in honor of William Faux, the
                    early historian of the settlement, or one of his descendants, history does not
                    state. It has disappeared.</p>
            <p>There were among the various settlers representatives of many religious
                    denominations. The Established church of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> had a good representation. Whatever the former <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-015-2-073"/> religious affiliations of the settlers had been in
                    the old country, Wesleyanism, through the Hillyards, McJohnsons, Wheelers,
                    Parretts, Erskines, and other members of the settlement, as well as the circuit
                    rider, who passed through the settlement at stated periods, firmly established
                    Methodism in the beginning of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh county</region>
                    </placeName>'s existence. For years that church very largely pre-empted
                    the soil and the people with it, in the north half of the county. The burial
                    ground at McCutchanville church, one at Hillyard church, one near Saundersville,
                    now known as the Ingle cemetery, the Episcopal cemetery, and the Camp Ground
                    cemetery, established later than the others, ranked in the above order, first of
                    the earliest cemeteries in the county in the number of graves of the pioneers of
                    the first decade of the settlement of the county.</p>
            <p>Among the incidents preserved which show the close touch of some of the
                    immigrants with John Wesley during his ministry in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> are the following: Elizabeth Wheeler (1781–1870), wife
                    of Rev. Joseph Wheeler, was born at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Witney</settlement>, <region type="county">Oxfordshire</region>, <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName>, daughter of John and Elizabeth
                    Early, of Witney. John Wesley was a regular visitor at her mother's
                    home in Witney. When but a small child, she sat on Mr. Wesley's knee
                    and recited one of the longest psalms. Elizabeth Hillyard
                    (1760–1845), widow of John Hillyard, of Longford, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, was left by her husband at his death a retail store in Longford,
                    which she continued for some years. When the youngest of her four sons, James,
                    William, John and Alexander, was about grown, she came in 1818 with them to
                    America and this was the original Hillyard family of the Blue Grass
                    neighborhood. Her husband, John Hillyard, was one of the first Wesleyan class
                    leaders in Longford. Both she and her husband knew John Wesley. On one occasion
                    as a girl she wore to church a bow of bright ribbon on her bonnet, and Mr.
                    Wesley remarked, "It is a bow upon Bessie?" This was
                    understood by all to be a reproof to the young lady for undue gaiety in dress.</p>
            <p>Reference is elsewhere made to Rev. Joseph Wheeler and Rev. Robert Parrett, two
                    men cast in the same mold, whose influence for good in the new settlement and
                    for a much wider territory, was very great. Their influence upon the young <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-015-2-074"/> men of the settlement was very marked. To
                    their influence, especially the former, in a great degree may be traced the
                    education of a number of young men in the families mentioned, to the ministry.
                    Among these native ministers were James and William Ingle, sons, and John Cowle,
                    nephew, of John Ingle, of Saundersville, and William and Henry Wheeler, sons of
                    Mark Wheeler; James, son of John Hillyard, and Thomas Walker and John Harrison.
                    John W. Parrett, eldest son of Rev. Robert Parrett, was an active minister. All
                    of these were Methodists except Thomas Walker, who was resident pastor of the
                    Cumberland Presbyterian church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Owensville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, for a generation. So that before these older ministers
                    had passed their vigor, there arose among these families a native ministry, the
                    earliest in that section. Some of them remained in the settlement, rendering
                    good service to the community in furnishing public service at a time when it was
                    much needed. Some of them dedicated their lives wholly to the ministry and
                    passed out into the wider world. None of them are now living.</p>

            <p>One of the criticisms made against emigration to this immediate section was that
                    the country was wet, undrained, malarial and subject to fevers. The picture by

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> itself, located about half a mile east of the mouth of Pigeon
                    creek, lay on very high ground, and above the highest water, even up to the
                    present time; but on all three sides away from the river, the ground retreated
                    until it was low, and at the time mentioned, it was entirely undrained. The same
                    may be said of what is now Knight township on the east, as well as Union and
                    Perry townships on the west and south. These lowlands, which have since become
                    drained and are healthy for residence probably as much as the higher ground,
                    were at the time standing in water much of the year.</p>
            <p>Naturally the most inviting location for a settler, health considered, was the
                    high ground beginning on what was afterwards the state road, which started in <placeName>

                    the ground was well drained and rolling, and the view was picturesque,
                    especially the backbone of hills occupied by Mechanicsville (Stringtown), near
                    the southern line of the settlement. This was at the beginning occupied by early
                    settlers, some of English birth, including the Walkers, some of English
                    ancestry, all with English sympathies, which united them in many ways with
                    members of the settlement itself.</p>
            <p>The tracts selected by the Hornbrooks, Maidlows and Ingle were located close
                    together, and a great majority of the fifty-six families mentioned by Faux in
                    his book written in November, 1819, were located so closely to the land so
                    selected that the settlement was very compact. There were, however, at the same

            <p>The central part of the English and Irish location, some six miles east of
                    Saundersville, included the Wheelers, Hillyards, Erskines and McJohnsons, who
                    settled there early. The Hillyards and McJohnsons were there before Faux
                    arrived. The Erskines arrived at <placeName>

                    </placeName> by an ark Christmas day, 1819, just as Faux was preparing to leave
                    the country. Faux did not meet any of these persons, and his observations are
                    confined substantially to those persons whom he met in the immediate
                    neighborhood of John Ingle's residence, and in <placeName>

                    thus recognizing what was the fact, that the settlement properly embraced not
                    only the English, but the Irish and a few Scotch, who came about the same time,
                    and were for all practical purposes one with the English.</p>
            <p>The soil upon which the central settlement was made was not of the best. In fact,
                    the timber upon it would have indicated that fact to a farmer familiar with
                    judging soil covered with timber. This criticism was made by Judge McCreary,
                    associate judge of the circuit court, to Mr. Faux, who quotes him in a talk he
                    had with Hornbrook himself, which, the judge said, Hornbrook did not relish.</p>

                    swampy, or at least undrained of standing water, and much of the land through
                    which it ran was untenable for healthy residence. So, indeed, was much of the
                    best land in the county. The description by early travelers, including Fearon,
                    Faux and others, lays great stress upon the matter of health and the
                    neighborhood of extensive undrained lands, which properly disqualified it for
                    residence of men and their families, who were entering a new life of supreme
                    hardships. In this fact, greater than any other, may be found the explanation
                    why the Hornbrooks, Ingle, Maidlows, Scott, Kennerly, Hillyards, Wheelers,
                    Erskines and later comers, settled land not of the best soil. It compares
                    unfavorably with the land lying lower, especially now when all of it is drained
                    and in cultivation.</p>

                    complained greatly of the choice of land made by the British here. He wonders
                    they could not better inform themselves, because when they came there was plenty
                    of good land to be had and if not in bodies, yet in sections and in half
                    sections. "The soil," he said, "is as thin as a

                    "barrens," as then used, did not apply to arid soil, but
                    rather to land which was not covered by tall timber.) "They must have

            <p>In this Judge McCreary was wrong. As stated, the original location was made in
                    this section by Saunders Hornbrook, Jr., who came into the wilderness alone, and
                    made his selection, probably without much knowledge of the nature of the soil,
                    as he had not been a farmer in the old country.</p>
            <p>It is true that Samuel Scott lived in this neighborhood before Hornbrook came. At
                    Scott's house were held all the elections in that township, during his
                    life, and they continued to be held there at the house of his widow, after his
                    death, about 1825 or 1826.</p>

                    Englishmen, and as stated elsewhere, afterwards became part of the settlement.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Saundersville settlement was not located in the
                    most fertile section, and that health of the location had much to do with its
                    selection, a hundred years of cultivation and good farming have made the

            <p>The subject of water was then of great importance to a settler seeking a farm
                    location. A running stream upon the land was regarded as of great value. The
                    elder Hornbrook calls attention to this advantage of the location of the
                    settlement, in one of his letters. Faux's description of the difficulty
                    of some of the farmers in getting water for their families and stock is both
                    amusing and tragic.<hi rend="sup">138</hi> George Flower's history of

                    time, when representatives of much of the village stood in line with buckets for
                    two hours at night, being supplied from a well which he had dug.<hi rend="sup">139</hi>

            <p>The extreme eastern line of the settlement was from Pigeon creek, a point
                    selected by the elder Igleheart and others including the Lockyears as a water
                    supply. This creek runs north through <placeName>

                    eastern edge of the settlement around which, however, a dozen English families,
                    including the Lockyears, then and later settled. All of his three sons, and two
                    of his four daughters married members of the British settlement. Christopher
                    Lockyear, a brother-in-law of the senior Maidlow, came over with him in 1818. In
                    1918, at a reunion of his descendants in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, one hundred of them were present.</p>
            <p>Pigeon creek, as the source of unfailing water supply, was at the beginning
                    regarded as one of great importance. Saunders Hornbrook, Sr., in the letter
                    referred to, speaks of the landing of his son at Pigeon creek, rather than at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. A number of the travelers, in referring to the location, give
                    importance to the existence of Pigeon creek as a well-known stream of water. As
                    late as 1835 it is said the most serious inconvenience that people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> suffered was the want of good water, and that the <geogName>Ohio

            <p>An examination of the records of the county commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh county</region>
                    </placeName>, which had jurisdiction in the establishment, maintenance and
                    repair of roads, shows very clearly that there was universal interest among the
                    first settlers in the establishment of roads in this part of the wilderness.
                    Roads, when established, were for a long period not much more than blazed
                    trails, and the best that could be done in the way of laying out and improving a
                    road was cutting off the heavy timber, which usually left stumps around which
                    the road was compelled to run. So long as the adjoining forest was uncleared,
                    good drainage was impossible, and it was many years before good wagon or
                    carriage roads were established.</p>
            <p>The cost of hauling was so great as to be prohibitive of transportation of heavy
                    material. Faux says that fifty cents was the usual price of carriage for one
                    hundred pounds of corn for over twenty miles, sometimes higher, never lower. One
                    bushel of corn weighed from fifty to fifty-six pounds, so that if it was hauled
                    by weight, it would not pay the carriage for twenty miles. He says that Ferrel,
                    a man of experience and discernment, stated that he would not fetch corn from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twenty miles off, as a gift, if he could grow it, nor would he
                    carry it to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> for sale, because it would not pay carriage and expenses. When, if
                    ever, they will have surplus produce, he will give it to the pigs and cattle,
                    which will walk to market.<hi rend="sup">141</hi> Again he says: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            the nearest horse-mill, and carried it ten miles, paying seventy-five

                    investigate and lay them out, and making orders establishing roads. After a road
                    was established in the country districts, the question of its maintenance became
                    important; a road supervisor was appointed and assigned to a specified portion
                    or length of road. Sometimes <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-015-2-083"/> one road in the county, of length, would be
                    embraced within the jurisdiction of several supervisors. To the supervisor was
                    assigned the inhabitants sometimes by name, sometimes by a general description
                    of locality, living within the territory of his district, near the particular
                    highway which they, by law, were required to work. It was the duty of the
                    supervisor to call upon all the able-bodied inhabitants to work the roads, and,
                    in case of their failure to do so, to collect from them sufficient cash to hire
                    a substitute.</p>
            <p>So great was the interest of everyone in the proper maintenance of these highways
                    of travel, that the leading citizens of the county, without exception, were
                    willing to accept the appointment of road supervisor. This was true of all of
                    the leading men named. This was in some respects the most important public
                    position and nearest to the real interests of the community, although the pay
                    was trifling. The proportion of county business embraced within this routine of
                    work was so great for the first ten years as to indicate that it was of the
                    greatest importance to the people and to the county commissioners, who had
                    charge of it. There is no more reliable record of the names of citizens in
                    particular localities, at a particular time, than is to be found in the
                    enumeration of inhabitants for working roads in the particular road districts.</p>
            <p>More voluminous, however, were the "Estray notices." The stock
                    law was severe to protect stock from thieves. When a settler took up a horse,
                    cow or hog, the law required him to go before the nearest justice with two
                    neighbors and make an appraisement and give notice before the justice, who
                    transmitted the paper, usually a single small sheet, to the clerk's
                    office.</p>
            <p>In preparing the list of English families in this settlement at fixed dates, this
                    mass of contemporary record, each paper containing four names, with the date and
                    the township located, enabled the writer, with his own knowledge and the aid of
                    James Maidlow and James Erskine, to make out, with other aids, a substantially
                    correct record.</p>
            <p>The relative importance of the English settlement to other parts of the county
                    during its first decade may in some measure be estimated by the amount of time
                    and records devoted <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-015-2-084"/> by the county
                    commissioners to the roads of that portion of the county, as compared to other
                    portions. Upon such a comparison it appears that the northern part of the
                    county, in which this settlement was located, was much farther advanced in the
                    opening, existence and improvements of highways than the other parts of the
                    county. That part of the county was more thickly settled than was the southern
                    part. Saundersville was located in a central part of the settlement. It is
                    described as "a flourishing post town in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh county</region>
                    </placeName> in 1826.<hi rend="sup">142</hi> In 1833 the same authority
                    described it as "a small post village in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh county</region>
                    </placeName> ten miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Soon afterwards it ceased to exist. It had, in the early
                    twenties, among other interests, several stores, a mill, a warehouse and a
                    number of houses occupied as residences. There is now no trace of it to be seen
                    in the cultivated field where its location was formerly, and the exact spot of
                    its location cannot be pointed out by any one. The recorded plat of the
                    "town" unfortunately contains no reference to the section or
                    part of section or other description, on which the town was located.</p>
            <p>The road records of the county show that August 9, 1819, the State Road or <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> has not been changed, then the east and west landmark is also
                    fixed, locating Saundersville in the south part of Section 8. It is not
                    impossible that the variation of a quarter of a mile, more or less, might in
                    those times have been regarded as of little importance in descriptions. In fact,
                    roads were not usually surveyed, but located by the judgment of road viewers who
                    chose the "best route" between the termini.</p>

                    section, where the grain of the wood gives the lumber a finer quality than in
                    timber grown south of the temperate zone. Clearings by the settlers were often
                    as little as six or seven acres the first year, and gradually increased. John
                    Ingle, at the end of the first year, when Faux visited him, had cleared
                    seventeen acres, and was continuing the work, doing much of his own work in
                    person.</p>
            <p>Hogs were raised, half wild, in the woods on mast, with little expense, and pork
                    was always in demand, one of the most available articles for use in exchange and
                    barter, a substitute for money.<hi rend="sup">143</hi> Saunders Hornbrook, Sr.,
                    established a pork house for cutting and curing the meat, the earliest in the

            <p>Bears and wolves, when very hungry, would eat the hogs alive, and it was not
                    uncommon for a hog to come home with the loss of a pound or two of flesh bitten
                    from it. Cattle, hogs and sheep could only be certainly raised successfully by
                    keeping them in an enclosure at night. Mrs. Crawford Bell, daughter of David
                    Negley, described an exciting scene in her youth, when a gang of wolves in
                    daylight chased two cows past her, when she and her sister were riding
                    horseback, making her horse run away, fortunately not throwing its riders among
                    the wolves. Before aid could be given, the wolves had overtaken, killed and
                    partly eaten the cows.<hi rend="sup">144</hi> One of the early settlers is

                    were very common and easily killed with the rifle, and their meat was very

                    neighbors, good hunters as well as farmers.</p>
            <p>The controlling idea in the structure of the houses in which most of these first
                    settlers in the wilderness lived, as well as its furnishings, was perfect
                    economy of money, which at times was almost unknown. Gold and silver were a
                    great rarity, seldom seen, and paper money, also scarce, was very unreliable in
                    its rating, and in the purchase of the necessaries of life people learned to do
                    without money. So it was in house building. Birkbeck's first log house
                    cost him $20.00. Iron, lead, glass, salt, and rifles could not be
                    made in this section, and were very costly. Houses were built often without
                    nails or windows, and made of logs fitted by the axes and raised by the settlers
                    at house raisings, which were great social occasions. Faux thus describes the
                    log house of John Ingle, of Saundersville, a picture of which "drawn
                    from Ingle Refuge, State of Indiana, U. S., by W. Faux," is the
                    frontispiece in his book:<hi rend="sup">151</hi>

                            crevices between the rough logs admit light and air enough above and
                            below. It is five yards square and twenty feet high. At a little
                            distance stands a stable for two horses, a corn crib, pig sty and a

            <p>Both wooden chimneys in the house caught fire during Faux's visit and
                    threatened destruction of the house. The house was heated by fireplaces large
                    enough to hold large logs and nearly a quarter of a cord of wood. The cabins
                    were sometimes built with opposite doors so that a horse could haul the back log
                    into the house in front of the fireplace. An early settler describes the houses
                    in the entire settlement in his youth, in the 20's, from five to ten
                    years after the time of Faux's description, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    robbery of the house of James Cawson, a neighbor. Cawson and his wife were
                    wealthy. They were one of the thirty-nine families who sent Fearon to America.
                    They brought from <placeName>

                    </placeName> with them many of the household conveniences, practically unknown
                    in the wilderness of Indiana. And these, it was charged, tempted the young men
                    who broke into Cawson's house and stole them. The items are described
                    with much detail in the indictment. It is interesting to note some of the
                    sequels of this affair. The defendants were acquitted of robbery, but their
                    father was indicted, but later acquitted for perjury in testifying at their
                    trial. Cawson was indicted for compounding a felony, whereby he got his goods
                    back and ceased to be interested in the prosecution. While an agreement not to
                    prosecute under these circumstances is prohibited as against the policy of the
                    law, it is believed, even in this age, that police aid is more often sought to
                    recover stolen goods than to vindicate the majesty of the broken laws. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Nothing more clearly appears at this time than that success by farmers in the
                    wilderness, such as these men became, required an adjustment to the conditions
                    of frontier life. These pioneers performed household and farm labor without
                    hired help, a life of closest economy and continued sacrifice. The native
                    laborers were, as a rule, more or less shiftless and unreliable. Good land could
                    be bought from the <placeName>

                    </placeName> at $2.00 per acre, later at $1.25 per acre,
                    on payment of one-fourth cash, the remainder on long time; so that a thrifty and
                    industrious man could easily make upon the land the money to buy it, as the
                    purchase price became due. Therefore, with such opportunities, capable workers
                    naturally preferred by their labor to own their own land, instead of working in
                    service for others. Faux narrates an incident when John Ingle hired a native
                    preacher to do a job of carpenter work of some magnitude at that time, and,
                    trusting to his cloth, paid him forty dollars in advance, but the man refused to
                    begin or do the work, but kept the money, while his employer had no recourse, as
                    the preacher was irresponsible at law, and he lost his money. It was exceptional
                    that there was any profit in hired labor on the farm under the conditions as
                    they existed at the beginning.</p>
            <p>Women house servants became <hi rend="i">ipso facto</hi> members of the family,
                    on terms of equality or privileges with members of <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-015-2-090"/> the family, and in a country where women were
                    scarce, chances of marriage were plentiful and interfered with long employments.</p>
            <p>The life of these pioneers in the wilderness was, therefore, one of the hardest
                    labor, involving the greatest sacrifice of convenience, comfort and pleasure. It
                    was the severing of ties of relationship and friendship, leaving organized
                    society and civilization behind them. To these men and women who came from Great
                    Britain, where orderly society and restrains of convention, as well as of law,
                    were properly established, the change was a severe test.</p>
            <p>The panic of 1818, already referred to, lasted for many years, and checked the
                    growth of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> for more than a decade, checked also active emigration to the
                    British settlement. The reduction of the price of congress land from
                    $2.00 to $1.25 per acre immediately destroyed land values
                    and ruined many people. The financial effect upon the country was universal. <placeName>

                    section, which could only be carried by water, was affected by the panic, and
                    had no surplus money; from it this section had derived its specie.</p>
            <p>The town of Saundersville, which had considerable life during the first few years
                    of the settlement, disappeared and before 1840 not an inhabitant lived in it.<hi rend="sup">155</hi> Such was the fate of many other platted towns. The town
                    scheme of John Ingle and his associates and the British settlement were entirely
                    different matters. The latter was a natural and successful early settlement in
                    Indiana, and the foundation of much wider growth and influence. During the panic
                    the people did not suffer. They had plenty to eat, the women made the clothing,
                    houses were built when necessary, without iron, glass or money. Wooden hinges
                    even were not uncommon within the memory of persons now living.</p>

                    emigration better filled up the unoccupied lands in this section, English people
                    came in large numbers with those from other lands. All the time communication
                    had been kept up by correspondence and an occasional visit between the English
                    in the settlement and their acquaintances, friends and relatives in the old
                    country. This resulted in large numbers of British emigrants coming into this

                    </placeName>, from the English here to their friends and relatives in the old
                    country, to enable them to come over as well as to divide the profits of a

            <p>Through influences such as these, there came from <placeName>

                    </placeName> while it was still small, a number of young and vigorous men, who
                    soon became leaders in their various fields. Among these were leading farmers,
                    builders and contractors in wood, brick and stone, who in the last generation
                    were, at the least, equally, if not more prominent and capable than any other
                    element, in the building in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and other towns and cities in this section, of churches, schools,
                    sewers and other large structures, requiring ability, capital and public
                    confidence. A number of these acquired wealth and position, and some of them are
                    still living. There was for many years a section in the center of <placeName>

                    this inquiry to attempt to deal with the careers of these later emigrants, or
                    even to mention the names of prominent people among them; rather to deal with
                    emigrants who came previous to 1830.</p>
            <p>In these investigations, upon which much time and labor have been spent, a
                    personal knowledge of some of the pioneers mentioned and of most of their
                    children, and of facts and <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-015-2-092"/> circumstances
                    narrated, aided by family history, have been of material service to the writer.
                    The success and importance of the first British settlement in Indiana lies much
                    in its being a vital part of the beginning of organized society and government
                    in this section, and its impress of Anglo-Saxon ideals at the beginning, out of
                    which and upon which in a substantial degree were established the present
                    conditions in this community, including the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>So perfect was the assimilation that the history of the settlement is not the
                    tracing of a separate element, and but for a careful record of these details
                    there would be preserved now no dividing line between the British element and
                    other elements in the early settlement of this part of Indiana.</p>

            <p>
               <geogName>Paris Island</geogName>, S. C., was alive with khaki clad young men,
                    when I arrived at the Marine Training camp shortly after war had been declared.
                    Our instructions emphasized the use of the rifle and a knowledge of the
                    traditions of the Marine Corps, which we were so soon to be called upon to
                    uphold on the field of honor.</p>
            <p>From this station I was transfered to Quantico to join the Ninety-Sixth company,
                    Sixth regiment, which was then undergoing an intensive training, preparatory to
                    its departure for <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. There the days were spent in long marches through the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> hills, interspersed with detailed instruction in the use of machine
                    guns. We had profited from the experience of the English, and every man was
                    forced to qualify as an expert gunner. For there had been a time on the British
                    front when hundreds of these valuable weapons lay scattered on the battle
                    fields, for want of men who knew how to use them.</p>
            <p>After weeks of impatient waiting, at last the hour of our departure came. Early
                    one morning under cover of darkness we were assembled at the railroad station
                    and quietly entrained. We were sent to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> navy yards, where we found our ship waiting in the offing. We went
                    aboard immediately and that night slipped silently down the bay. Our trip across
                    was uneventful save for raids on the kitchen. While one man regaled the cook
                    with stories, nimble fingers searched the larder for dainties.</p>
            <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-015-2-094"/>
            <p>In the cold gray dawn of early morning, life belts adjusted, we entered the
                    submarine zone. A heavy fog enveloped the ship. Standing on the quarter deck,
                    one could hardly see across the rail. It was almost noon when the sunlight
                    dispelled the murky fog and revealed the presence of our expected destroyers.
                    The long arm of Uncle Sam had reached out across the sea to protect us in our
                    need and convoy us safely to port. It was evening when we sailed up the broad
                    waters of the <geogName>Loire river</geogName> into the port of Saint Nazaire,
                    Peasants working in the fields stopped to look, and, discovering the khaki clad
                    lads on the decks, dropped their hoes and leaped with joy; waving their arms
                    with a warmth of welcome that made up for the lack of any demonstration at our
                    departure. The early spring sunlight through the clear air brought out the vivid
                    coloring of the landscape. There in that valley of the Loire we saw <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in all her verdant beauty.</p>
            <p>Our trains were ready and we had our first experience of riding as cattle in a
                    French box car. The sign, 40 Hommes-8 Chevaux," amused us at first
                    until we realized what it meant to travel three days and nights across <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> with 40 men in a space ten by twenty feet. Fortunately, it was warm
                    and we escaped some of the hardships others had undergone who had preceded us.
                    Men stood until they became so exhausted they were able to lie down and sleep
                    despite that the others occasionally walked upon them. The floors were alive
                    with "cooties," and while we didn't see the front for
                    some days, we never spent another idle hour.</p>
            <p>But after all it was quite endurable and we enjoyed the trip in a way. It was a
                    beautiful ride across the heart of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, and the way the villagers shouted "Americans,"
                    warmed our hearts and made us happy to feel we were there to help them.</p>
            <p>Our destination was the little town of Damblain, in the foothills of the Vosges,
                    close to the birthplace of Joan D'Arc. There we detrained. And there
                    one of the men almost caused a stampede as he ran through the crowd shouting
                    that one could buy wine for twelve cents a gallon. "This is some
                    town," exclaimed an old sergeant with a row of campaign bars across his
                    breast. But one swallow was enough. It <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-015-2-095"/>
                    tasted like varnish. The French thought it inconceivable that we should drink so
                    much water, but it was always a source of wonder to us how they could drink
                    their "vin ordinaire." On the day following our arrival we
                    marched to the little villa of Blevencourt, where my company was billeted. We
                    slept in barns for the most part and there in the highlands it was not unusual
                    to wake up in the morning beneath a blanket of snow.</p>
            <p>It was here that we had our first experience with the German spy system. Four
                    gypsy girls entered the town, apparently for the purpose of selling small
                    trinkets to the soldiers. They visited the various billets, but no one suspected
                    they had any ulterior motives until an aeroplane landed in a field close to the
                    town late one night and flew quickly away when approached by the guards. One of
                    the gypsies was found in the field and she with her companions was immediately
                    arrested by the French authorities, who said later they had found sufficient
                    evidence to justify their being interned. Incidents of this kind soon taught us
                    the value of absolute secrecy in all our movements.</p>
            <p>We were only there a short time until we were sent to the front. We went in by
                    train to Fort Dugny, one of the ring of forts surrounding Verdun. Evidently our
                    movements had been observed, for when we arrived at the railroad station the
                    Germans began to bombard it. We escaped with only the loss of the Fifth
                    regiment's band instruments. The country in this section was as barren
                    as a desert. The long column moved hurriedly on to the road and we marched
                    thirty miles in to the protection of the Verdun highlands.</p>
            <p>Hidden away in the woods of Camp Massa we rested. There we came into our first
                    intimate contact with the activity on the front. An anti-aircraft battery was
                    located near us. Whenever a German plane appeared in the sky the battery went
                    into action. To us it was always an amusing sight. Every Frenchman looked like
                    he was trying to do all the work himself, while all talked so fast and furiously
                    you wondered who was in command. When the aeroplane came into range they would
                    open fire and it was a wonderful sight to see the balls of shrapnel bursting
                    close to the plane, following it in its <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-015-2-096"/>
                    efforts to escape and leaving a long trail of little white puffs of smoke across
                    the sky.</p>
            <p>The roar of the guns on the front rolled up about us and vibrated through the
                    valleys. An occasional shell fell near enough to make us uneasy. It was here
                    while walking in the woods one Sunday morning with some comrades that we were
                    attracted by the sound of music. We listened, and above the rumble of the guns
                    there floated through the trees the sound of a church service. There in the
                    midst of all that great destruction of human life, only a little distance from
                    the red ruin of the front line, was a padre and a group of French soldiers at
                    prayer. We stopped, knelt beside them and prayed with the feeling that one can
                    only experience when he is standing on the brink of eternity.</p>
            <p>Nearby were several little graves on the roadside with their wooden crosses
                    marked with the tri-color. We wondered how long it might be until we would be
                    occupying one. There are many of these little wooden crosses on the roadsides of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, and when the marches were unusually long and hard and we were very
                    tired and sleepy, we used to envy those sleeping there in the peace and silence
                    of the forest, and death did not seem such an enemy after all, if only we could
                    lay down our heavy packs and rest forever.</p>
            <p>The American army had been assigned the section of the lines from Verdun eastward
                    to the Swiss border, the reason being that their lines of communication would
                    lie to the south and not interfere with those already established by the French
                    and British. The Marines were placed on the right bank of the Meuse, the lines
                    extending from Verdun eastward. We moved in, one night. Early in the evening
                    while patrolling the roads we saw a small balloon, such as is often seen on the
                    Fourth of July, float up from a woods where a high wind caught it and sent it
                    sailing away towards the German lines. It was carrying a message from some
                    German spy, telling them that we were going in to relieve the French. As we
                    wended our way along the road we were held up by some unexplained delay, when
                    suddenly out of the inky darkness of the sky came a salvo of shells that
                    completely destroyed the <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-015-2-097"/> road just ahead of
                    us, and which would have annihilated all had we continued our march.</p>
            <p>These trenches which we were to occupy had been dug by the French Colonial troops
                    in the early part of the war. They were in a very bad condition and there was
                    plenty of work to do in repairing them. The dugouts swarmed with vermin; huge
                    rats ran across the men as they slept, and wrought havoc with the emergency
                    rations. This section had been an inactive one since the great Verdun offensive
                    of 1916 and was being used at the time by the French as a rest sector under what
                    seemed to us a tacit agreement that, "if you don't shoot at
                    me, I won't shoot at you." Our instructions were to keep our
                    heads down and not to permit the enemy to see that the Americans had entered the
                    lines.</p>
            <p>But they didn't know the Marines.</p>
            <p>When the dawn came our men climbed onto the parapets and when they saw some
                    Germans down by a creek washing their clothing they promptly opened fire on
                    them. This not only brought down the wrath of the French but a raid by the
                    Germans. Now came our long waited chance for action. The Germans after a
                    preliminary bombardment, came over on us in force. When they reached the barbed
                    wire entanglements in front of our trenches, we opened up such a heavy rifle and
                    machine gun fire that we held them in the wire until the American artillery,
                    which had only moved in an hour before, got into action, and the barrage they
                    poured upon them sent them back with a heavy loss of life. We had been
                    successful in our first encounter, and a wave of such pride and enthusiasm swept
                    over the line that it silenced all criticism and dispelled any doubt in the
                    minds of the French that we could fight.</p>
            <p>Resistance became more stubborn and raids more daring as our first feeling of
                    nervousness wore off. Encounters with the enemy patrols were eagerly sought as
                    the clashes grew more frequent, for we invariably exacted a heavy toll. The
                    Germans infuriated at the appearance of this new foe, bombarded our positions
                    and resorted to every device to make our stay in the trenches as uncomfortable
                    as possible. Every trick known to trench warfare was resorted to and sleep soon
                        <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-015-2-098"/> became impossible. There they first
                    conferred upon us the name of "Devil Dogs," and as there had
                    been only two other units named by the Germans during the entire war: The
                    Scottish troops, called "The Ladies from Hell," and the Alpine
                    Chausseurs, the "Blue Devils," we felt that we had been very
                    highly complimented. When we left the trenches General Harbord was placed in
                    command. General Pershing told him at that time he was placing him in charge of
                    the finest body of troops in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. We now took our position in the Allied armies as an equal, for we
                    had been tried by fire and surpassed their expectations.</p>
            <p>On the Somme the great German offensive was at its height. The Boche was slowly
                    driving a wedge between the French and British on the Oise. Ameins, Perrone, and
                    Mont-didier hung in the balance, when word came to rush the Second division to
                    the Picardy front. I looked for the last time down over "No
                    Man's Land," the long winding brown lines that marked the
                    network of trenches spreading over the valley. An ominous silence broods over
                    this shamble; danger ever threatening. The grass had turned to a brilliant
                    green, the few trees that had escaped destruction were sending forth their
                    leaves, and the little birds sang on their branches. Nature seemed in tune; only
                    man was discordant.</p>
            <p>Our march to the Somme was a forced one. The French line was bending to the
                    breaking point. It was a question as to whether we would arrive in time to give
                    them the needed assistance to hold it. For four days and nights we hiked down
                    the long dusty Dieppe road. It was hot and sultry. Water was scarce. The horses
                    and mules in the artillery train died on the roadside—walked to
                    death. There we demonstrated that there is no limit to human endurance as long
                    as there remains the will to do.</p>
            <p>In the villages we saw the evidence of the shocking cruelties committed by the
                    Germans in the early part of the war. Little children, with their arms cut off,
                    trudged alongside the column that we might see for ourselves their misery. If we
                    had ever had any doubts as to the truthfulness of the stories of Hun atrocities,
                    they were dispelled then and there.</p>
            <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-015-2-099"/>
            <p>Scarcely had we arrived on the Picardy front when word came that the Germans had
                    broken through the line on the Chemin des Dames, and were advancing on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the rate of twenty-five miles a day. The most dramatic moment of
                    the war had come. General Pershing had told Marshal Foch, "The American
                    people would be proud to be engaged in the greatest battle of all
                    history." Foch gave his consent. The Marines were ordered to Chateau
                    Thierry. We moved immediately. After an all night march to Serans we were placed
                    in French automobile trucks and started across <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in one of the most famous rides in history. The French people along
                    the road had received word of our coming and at every cross roads and village
                    groups stood to see us pass. They realized the Americans were going into battle.
                    They pelted us with flowers and strewed the roads with daisies from the fields.
                    "Good luck," they cried, while little groups of maimed
                    children held up their arms in mute supplication.</p>
            <p>Tears came into the eyes of the men, vengeance into their hearts, and a feeling
                    of exaltation swept over the long caravan, blazing forth in their faces and
                    causing the French to call us "Crusaders." We passed through
                    Meaux, and the main body of the French army in full retreat. All semblance of
                    formation had disappeared. Sodiers mingled with civilians in a mad rush to
                    safety. Beyond Meaux the road was filled with refugees. A motly looking mass of
                    men and women and children and cattle and carts. Toothless old women and aged
                    men struggling under heavy burdens. Young girls dragging little children
                    scurried along the edge of the fields. They watched us pass, without emotion,
                    pausing only to cry, "Tue Le Boche," and draw their hands
                    across their throats, suggesting this method as the most effective means. Sad
                    and sullen with despair, hatred flashing in their eyes, they trudged along. As
                    we sang snatches of songs an old woman shook her head and inquired how we could
                    sing when we were going up to be killed.</p>
            <p>Full thirty hours we rode. The boom of the cannons came to our ears. Enemy avions
                    droned over our heads, dropping occasional bombs. Night fell and we finally drew
                    up in a <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-015-2-100"/> small village where we bivouacked,
                    just behind the battle lines.</p>
            <p>This was the darkest of the dark hours of the Allied cause. The French and
                    British armies lay stunned from the heavy onslaughts of the past month. <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> had abandoned all hope. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> trains waited at the stations to evacuate the civilian population.
                    The Germans were on the outskirts of Chateau Thierry. Only a miracle could save <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> from disaster.</p>
            <p>This was the crisis the Marines faced when we advanced down the Metz-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> road on June 1, 1918. The French rearguard, which had been fighting
                    for more than a week against a foe vastly superior in numbers and equipped with
                    a preponderance of artillery, filtered slowly through our lines. As we passed a
                    clump of trees near the Triangle Farm, a French officer at the head of a company
                    of horsemen dashed up to my section and shouted, "Go back while you
                    have the opportunity. There are many Boche!" "Many
                    Boche," I answered, "why that's just what we came
                    over here to see."</p>
            <p>Near the southern limits of the Bois Belleau the Germans encountered a stone wall
                    of resistance. They advanced through a wheat field in their famous mass
                    formation, confident of victory. Bayonets flashed, machine guns burst forth and
                    a heavy rifle fire raked their ranks. The Boche recoiled, came on. Our men took
                    careful aim before they shot. The Boche wavered and broke, crawling off through
                    the wheat to shelter in the woods. A French colonel witnessing the fight
                    declared it was the first time in the history of European warfare that men ever
                    sighted their guns and fired with such precision.</p>
            <p>Many difficulties were experienced as we advanced through the wooded areas. The
                    tree tops were infested with machine gun nests. This meant work with the
                    bayonet, hand to hand with an enemy we had already found we could master. We
                    took no prisoners and the only Germans we left behind were dead Germans. They
                    were quick to perceive this and changed the whimper of
                    "Kamarad" to the plea, "La Guerre est fini."
                    But the thoughts of those maimed children and <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-015-2-101"/> the menace to our own homes only made us sink our bayonets the deeper.</p>
            <p>Then followed days and nights of heavy bombardment. Sleep was impossible. Food
                    was scarce. Even the red embalmed Argentine beef, called "Monkey
                    Meat," was A. W. O. L. (absent without leave). There was only
                    excitement to live on. My company was sent down to take the town of Bouresches,
                    a tactical position which the Boche had already seized. To reach the town it was
                    necessary to cross a wheat field more than 200 yards wide. The German artillery
                    opened up point blank upon us, supported by a withering machine gun fire, the
                    bullets running like a river of lead through the tops of the wheat. Captain
                    Donald F. Duncan stepped forth from the woods, calmly smoking his pipe, and
                    swung his cane over his head as a signal to advance. He was shot down instantly.
                    The first American officer to fall at Chateau Thierry, he left an example of
                    coolness and bravery under fire that was an inspiration to all who knew him.</p>
            <p>Advancing by short, quick rushes and then down to the ground for cover, we swept
                    forward in the old American style of fighting. In the screen of trees directly
                    before Bouresches, the foliage and branches rattled and vibrated with the
                    put-put-put of the concealed machine guns. As my section advanced, eight of the
                    twelve men were killed before we had gone a hundred feet. We pushed on. The
                    bullets whipped and cut our clothing and clipped the ammunition from our belts.
                    Men fell fast upon that field. Out of one hundred and fifty who started across
                    that field but twenty-four reached the town itself. A fierce hand-to-hand
                    struggle ensued. Bouresches was occupied by 300 of the enemy. Every street had
                    its fight; sticking—slashing—banging. Machine guns in the
                    doors of the buildings, in the church steeple, behind piles of rubbish, and
                    sharpshooters in every coign of vantage. I ran down one street with a lieutenant
                    who had the bars shot off his shoulders. A high explosive shell burst above us,
                    denting our helmets, but we were spared. In a cellar a number of the enemy hid
                    with a machine gun. I tossed a hand grenade into their midst and it was
                    "Fini La Guerre" for them. We soon found we were in advance of
                    our <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-015-2-102"/> lines, as the German artillery began to
                    pound us on three sides. The Second Engineers rushed in to our assistance. Some
                    carried only picks and shovels, but, full of fight, those brave fellows made it
                    possible for us to hold our gain against the immediate counter-attack.
                    Replacement men came in to fill our decimated ranks under cover of darkness.
                    Five of them assigned to my section were killed the same night before the poor
                    chaps had a chance to see a German. Few houses in the town escaped the
                    destructive fire of the artillery that hammered us incessantly. In the cellar of
                    one we found an old man and his wife. Urged to go to the rear, they refused.
                    Later the place was found deserted. The man had left. The body of the woman was
                    hanging to a rafter, where she had sought escape in suicide.</p>
            <p>The capture of Bourseches was the preliminary step to the fight in Belleau wood,
                    now named by the French "The Forest of the Brigade of the
                    Marines." Our artillery arrived. Four hundred guns moved in at night.
                    Information had been obtained that the Germans were filtering into the wood in
                    force preparatory to making another thrust. Just before daylight the American
                    artillery opened up and a perfect hurricane of shells fell upon it. The Bois
                    became ablaze with the lights of bursting shells. The drumfire of a hundred
                    cannon was terrrifying, as the heavy barrage swept back and forth through the
                    trees.</p>
            <p>The Marines charged. They rushed into the impregnable mass of tangled underbrush
                    with blood-curdling yells. Falling naturally into the Indian style of advancing,
                    they crawled from tree to tree. The Boche gave way. He had had enough. From the
                    wood into the road poured hundreds of the men in gray. We turned our machine
                    guns into them and piled them up in heaps until they sought another outlet. It
                    was American pluck against the German mass formation. The tide turned. American
                    spirit triumphed. The Boche was beaten, his morale destroyed and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> was saved.</p>
            <p>Eight thousand Marines were pitted against thirty-five thousand Prussian Guards,
                    the crack troops of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. These divisions had been resting for almost a month behind the
                    lines near Noyon, held for just such an emergency. They <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-015-2-103"/> were sent in to make the final dash to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> a success. Is it any wonder that we were as surprised as the German
                    General Staff, when they received the news of their retreat?</p>
            <p>Just what the losses were on the German side we have never heard, but we do know
                    that there were less than two thousand Marines surviving when we finally
                    withdrew. With no greater number than eight thousand Marines in the lines at any
                    time our losses in the war were over twelve thousand. Only twenty-five Marines
                    were taken prisioners by the Germans. With us it was kill or be killed.</p>
            <p>In a service of less than three months, the Marine Corps received eleven
                    citations for bravery, this being the highest number given to any unit during
                    the war.</p>
            <p>From this sector we were sent to a woods just in the rear of the lines on the
                    Soissons front, where we rested and received replacements. Early on the morning
                    of the following day we moved forward under orders to capture the town of Lucy
                    de Bruges. When we swept into the town we discovered it was then held by
                    Americans, so we withdrew into a woods on the east to await further orders. The
                    German observers, in a huge sausage balloon, saw us enter the woods. They took a
                    few sighting-in shots at us during the afternoon. That night their artillery
                    opened up with one of the most vicious gas attacks recorded during the war.</p>
            <p>When the shells began to fall, a lieutenant ran over to me and gave orders to
                    move the men in our platoon out of the woods and onto a road a hundred feet
                    distant, where they might find some protection from the shells. He had scarcely
                    shouted the order when a shell burst near him and I never saw him again. It was
                    very dark in the woods, which made it necessary for me to remove my gas mask and
                    summon the men to me by the sound of my voice. The shells were falling on the
                    path to the road about every six seconds. This obliged us to time the shells by
                    counting off the seconds and sending the men through the barrage on the run,
                    starting them while pieces of the exploded shells were still flying in the air.
                    In this manner I succeeded in passing through in safety about forty men. The
                    others had shifted for themselves. Gunnery Sergeant Fred W. Stockman, an
                    old-time member of the <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-015-2-104"/> Marine Corps, walked
                    back and forth through the woods that night, driving the men out of their fox
                    holes and making them get up and go to me, as all were loath to leave the
                    shallow holes which provided at least a little protection. The woods was a mass
                    of crashing shells and falling trees as the gas, mingled with high explocives,
                    swept through the branches. But the brave sergeant never stopped until he had
                    made every man he could find move out to the road. Poor chap; he voluntarily
                    gave up his life that he might save others. Such deeds are immortal.</p>
            <p>When I reached the road I found that the men, unable to see in the darkness and
                    seriously hampered by their gas masks, had stretched themselves out in the
                    center of the roadway instead of under the shelter of a low bank on the side of
                    the road. I had not as yet put on my mask and so was able to see their
                    predicament. I walked down the long line, ordering them to crawl over to the
                    bank. While doing this I found that a German spy, a member of our own
                    organization, was continually passing the word up to the men to take off their
                    masks, endeavoring to deceive them by saying that there was no gas; that the
                    odor was that of the high explosives. I sent several men in search of him, but
                    in the great confusion we were not able to locate the guilty one. By this time I
                    had put on my gas mask, but it was blown from my face by a shell a few minutes
                    later. There was no escape from this terrible situation. We could only lie quiet
                    and take the "strafing." When daylight came, the woods which
                    we had been in were completely destroyed, and there was an inch coating of
                    pieces of shrapnel and shells over the roadway.</p>
            <p>Then began the evacuation of the wounded. The gas, while I was inhaling it, did
                    not feel so disagreeable. It made me feel quite sleepy, but aside from the
                    burning sensation in my eyes, I experienced little pain. I endeavored to carry
                    some ammunition down to the line just beyond us, when a sudden weakness came
                    over me. An officer, noticing me stagger, ordered me to the rear. I took about
                    twenty men with me, all suffering from the effects of the gas. We walked about
                    two miles against the wind, after removing the greater portion of our clothing,
                    in order to escape the severe body <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-015-2-105"/> burns
                    that follow mustard gassing. Nine of these men died on the way.</p>
            <p>We were sent through to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When we arrived we had all become blind, and it was ten days
                    before we again saw daylight. The damage to my throat and lungs held me in the
                    hospital for eight months. Only two men out of my original company of 250
                    survived this encounter, and practically all of the men who had composed the
                    original members of the Fifth and Sixth regiments had been wiped out.</p>
            <p>The Second division, of which the Marines composed one-half, sustained the
                    highest number of casualties, captured more prisoners, guns and territory than
                    any other division, and wrote into American history one of its most brilliant
                    pages.</p>
            <p>War is a crucible through which men pass into larger and nobler lives. It brings
                    out the courage to die for one's ideals; it overcomes the fear of death
                    and leads us into a higher appreciation of all that is good and true, a more
                    exalted patriotism and a firmer faith in God.</p>

            <p>The letters of this volume cover the period from 1831 to 1858. Judge Ruffin took
                    an active part in southern politics and the letters here printed throw much
                    light on the development of the political estrangement of the South, beginning
                    with 1830. Far more interesting are the letters describing farm life in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. The elegant style, the typical southern sentiment and culture of
                    the old time are shown as well in these letters, as I have seen. Besides being a
                    lawyer by profession, chief justice of the State, he was a planter. He writes of
                    his slaves absconding after quarreling with the overseer and later returning of
                    their own accord. One slave wandered as far as <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Judge Ruffin reveals in his letters, always calm and dignified,
                    the gradually growing restlessness of the slaves, the irritation of the planters
                    at the increasing interference from the North and the widening gap between North
                    and South. Aside from the historical value these letters make most delightful
                    reading.</p>

            <p>Mr. Foulke has been an active member of the National Civil Service Reform League
                    almost from its organization at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1881. Under Roosevelt he became a member of the Civil Service
                    Commission, resigning in the spring of 1903 on account of failing health. In
                    State and Nation the author thus had about twenty years experience in the field
                    of Civil Service Reform. The movement is treated historically, <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-015-2-107"/> covering the administrations of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Harrison, McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft and Wilson. Each of these
                    Presidents, Mr. Foulke believes, was personally favorable to the reform, but all
                    were not equally capable of evading or refusing the demands of the politicians
                    for plunder. The volume is not an essay nor sermon on the merits of Civil
                    Service Reform; the author assumes that the American people are convinced of the
                    justice and value of the reform, but a historical record of the actual struggle,
                    names, dates, places, facts, documents, and accusations are freely given. It is
                    hardly necessary to say to those acquainted with the character and skill of Mr.
                    Foulke that his work is done fearlessly and skillfully. Many reformers grow
                    impatient with the slow-moving world and retire from the fight in disgust. Mr.
                    Foulke is of a different temper. While carrying on a fight to the death he has
                    preserved his good temper, which is shown, even in the record, by a tinge of
                    humor. The characteristics of the spoilsmen are set forth in numerous cases. It
                    may be objected that these cases are tried <hi rend="i">ex parte</hi> but in
                    most cases we will forever have to do without the other side. The limits of the
                    classified civil service as well as other problems incident, such as
                    superannuation, are set forth. As a historical record of this political struggle
                    in America this volume will take rank along with the writings of Carl Shurz,
                    with decided advantage in concise and pointed treatment, in fact is is so
                    systematically presented as to make it especially useful in the schools.</p>

                    of the word, but as indicated by the title, a study or interpretation. The facts
                    on which the author's conclusions rest are not stated in sufficient
                    detail to enable one not thoroughly conversant with the facts in the case to
                    judge of the soundness of the interpretation. The study bears the evidences in
                    itself however of being a very careful and reliable interpretation. There are so
                    many elements in the interpretation of political history, all uncertain in
                    value, that a given body of facts admit of almost infinite explanation or
                    interpretation. A customary device for setting forth the truths of an election
                    is the political map, and the study under review has a number of excellent ones,
                    but a careful study of political development in Inliana indicates that such maps
                    carry about an equal amount of truth and error.</p>
            <p>Another common line of interpretation in western history is that based on
                    ancestry and previous homes of the voters. The reviewer is convinced that in
                    Indiana at least conclusions based on such reasoning are worthless. There are so
                    many instances of political leaders from remotely different <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-015-2-109"/> sections combining in the heartiest cooperation and
                    other instances of men from the same original neighborhood bitterly opposing
                    each other that it seems futile to attempt to establish any valid conclusions.</p>
            <p>In dealing with the political influence of the churches in Indiana similar
                    difficulties have been met. Resolutions by meetings of ministers have often been
                    found to furnish a poor clue to the political conduct of their parishioners.
                    Ardent Freesoilers and pro-slavery leaders belonged to the same church. In only
                    two instances in Indiana does it seem the influence of the churches was
                    sufficient to decide the elections.</p>
            <p>In general Mr. Streeter's conclusions for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> apply to Indiana. The Jacksonian Democrats, the Whigs, the
                    Freesoilers, the union of factions to form the Republican party, the
                    Knownothings, the personal followings resulting in faction, the cleavage between
                    office-holding politicians and the voters—especially federal
                    officeholders—all find their counterpart in Indiana. However, there
                    are some significant differences. There seems to have been more personality in
                    politics in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> than in Indiana, or perhaps these changes came later in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and are incident to the frontier. The period of personal politics
                    ended in Indiana about 1830 while it would seem to have lasted in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> till after 1840. There also seems to have been more party loyalty
                    or regularity in Indiana, a characteristic usually found increasing as one goes
                    from north to south.</p>
            <p>In Indiana it was the Whigs who had to shoulder the blame for the Internal
                    Improvement failure, while in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> it seems to have been put on the Democrats. It is a very
                    interesting book especially to a reader acquainted with politics in a neighbor
                    State.</p>

                    1,158 acres of grounds. The institution cost over $1,500,000 and can

                    that the hospital is already crowded. This is the fifth Hospital for the Insane
                    in the State. The problem thus presented to the State is serious. Dr. James W.

                    The State Park Commission, organized 1916, now works in cooperation with the
                    Board. The recent General Assembly reorganized this department but fortunately
                    Richard Lieber, State forester, and Charles C. Deam, acting State forester, are
                    still in charge and their plans will be continued. The following quotation from
                    the report will give a hint as to what they are doing:</p>
            <p>"The Commission last year located an old and dilapidated log cabin some
                    four miles northeast of the park. The poplar logs the smallest of which is 27
                    inches high, were so remarkable that the Commission decided to rebuild the cabin
                    in the park. This was done in the spring. Doors and casings were made out of an
                    old dead black walnut and the roof covered with clapboards made on the premises.
                    A large ‘cat <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-015-2-113"/> and
                    clay’ smoke stack completes the building, which we trust will serve
                    as a reminder of the time when the State was young". Turkey Run was
                    visited last year by more than 25,000 people.</p>

            <p>The following statement shows what the State Board of Charities has done and
                    hopes to do for the orphans of the State: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="center">A HOME FOR EVERY HOMELESS CHILD</p>
                        <p>A Home for Every Homeless Child is the slogan for the various social
                            agencies in Indiana which are making an effort to protect and conserve
                            the childhood of the State. A Home for Every Homeless Child is the
                            crying need of the children who, because of neglect, have become
                            dependent and have been denied some of their natural birthrights.</p>
                        <p>There are being maintained in the orphans' homes of the State
                            about 1,900 children for whom good family homes are desired. We believe
                            that for every homeless child that is physically and mentally normal
                            there is some good home ready and able to receive it and give to it the
                            love, care and training of which it has been deprived through no fault
                            of its own. Many of them are of the impressionable
                            age—between 5 and 12 years old. They want homes. They want
                            kind, sympathetic, patient foster fathers and mothers who will help them
                            to grow into useful citizenship. The citizens of our State and the
                            public officials can render a most useful service by helping secure
                            homes for these unfortunate children.</p>
                        <p>Figures in the office of the Board of State Charities show that many
                            thousand children have had advantage of foster homes in past years.
                            About 3,200 of them are in family homes at the present time under
                            supervision, while many others have been legally adopted. These children
                            are having restored to them their right to normal life and training and
                            in return are bringing happiness to many foster parents.</p>
                        <p>The 1,900 children, in orphans' homes are longing for a like
                            opportunity. Will you help them? Will you take some boy or girl into
                            your home and find other families who will take them? If you want to
                            render a useful service to the children and to the State communicate
                            with the board of children's guardians in your county, the

                    present demand for history of the immediate present. Not only the war just ended
                    but all other events of like magnitude have their beginning and development deep
                    in the history of the past. The citizen unacquainted with the past unless
                    inspired is about as capable as the traditional blind pilot.</p>
