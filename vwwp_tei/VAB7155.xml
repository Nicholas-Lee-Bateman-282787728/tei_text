                <p><hi>HE</hi> was only a little lad coming singing through the summer weather;
                    singing as the birds do in the thickets, as the crickets do in the wheat at

                    sunshine.</p>
                <p>Only a little lad with brown eyes and bare feet, and a wistful heart driving his
                    sheep and his goats, and carrying his sheaves of cane or miller, and working
                    among the ripe grapes when the time came, like all the rest, here in the bright
                    Signa country.</p>
                <p>Few people care much for our Signa and all it has seen and known. Few people even

                    vaguely as a mere name. Assisi has her saint, and Perugia her painters, and
                    Arezzo her poet, and Siena her virgin, and Settignano her sculptor, and Prato
                    her great carmelite, and Vespignano her inspired shepherd, and Fiesole her
                    angelâmonk, and the village Vinci her mighty master; and poets write of them all
                    for sake of the dead fame which they embalm. But Signa has found no poet, though
                    her name lies in the pages of the old chroniclers like a jewel in an old kingâs
                    tomb, written there ever since the Latin days when she was first named Signomeâa
                    standard of war set under the mountains.</p>
                <p>It is so old our Signa, no man could chronicle all it has seen in the centuries;
                    but not one in ten thousand travelers thinks about it. Its people plait straw
                    for the world, and the train from the coast runs through it: that is all that it
                    has to do with other folks.</p>
                <p>Passengers come and go from the sea to the city, from the city to the sea, along
                    the great iron highway, and perhaps they glance at the stern, ruined walls, at
                    the white houses on the cliffs, at<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7155-004"/> the broad
                    river with its shining sands, at the blue hills with the poplars at their base,
                    and the pines at the summits, and they say to one another that this Signa.</p>
                <p>But it is all that they ever do do; it is only a glance, then on they go through
                    the green and golden haze of Valdarno. Signa is nothing to them, only a place
                    that they stop at a second. And yet Signa is worthy of knowledge.</p>
                <p>She is so ancient and so wise, and in her way so beautiful too; and she holds so
                    many great memories in her; she has so many faded laurelâboughs as women in
                    their years of age keep the dead roseâleaves of their days of love; and once on
                    a timeâin the Republicâs time, as her sons will still turn from the plough or
                    rest on the oar to tell to a stranger with pride;âshe was a very Amazon and
                    Artemis of the mountains setting her breast boldly against all foes, and they
                    were many, who came down over the wild western road, from the sea or from the
                    Apennines, with reddened steel and blazing torch to harry and fire the fields,
                    and spread famine and war to the gates of Florence.</p>
                <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7155-005"/>
                <p>These days are gone.</p>
                <p>The years of its glory are done. It is a grey quiet place which now strays down
                    by the water and now climbs high on the hill, and faces the full dawn of the day
                    and sees the sunset reflected in the mirror of the river, and is starry with
                    fireflies in midsummer, and at noon looks drowsy in the heat and seems to
                    dreamâbeing so very old. The buttressed walls are ruins. The mass bell swings
                    over the tower roofs. The fortresses are changed to farms. The vines climb where
                    the culverins blazed. White bullocks and belled mules tread to and fro the
                    tracks which the free lances made; and the peasants sing at their ploughs where
                    the hosts of the invaders once thundered.</p>
                <p>Its ways are narrow, its stones are crooked, its summer dust is dense, its winter
                    mire is heavy, its hovels are many, its people are poorâoh, yes, no doubtâbut it
                    is beautiful in various ways and worthy of a scholarâs thought and of an
                    artistâs tenderness. Only the poet does not come to make it quoted and beloved
                    by the world as one<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7155-006"/> single line on the drifting
                    autumn leaves has rendered Vallombrosa.</p>
                <p>Here where the ancient walls of its citadel rise hoary and broken against the
                    blueness of the sky; there where the arches of the bridges span the river, and
                    the sand and the shallows and the straw that is drying in summer shine together
                    yellow in the sun; her where under the sombre pointed archways the little
                    children play, their faces like the cherubs and the cupids of the renaissance;
                    there where the cobblers and coopers and the plaiting maidens and the makers of
                    the yellow rush brooms, all work away under lintels, and corbels, and carved
                    beam timbers, four hundred years old if one; here where through the gate ways
                    with their portcullises woven over by the spiders, there only pass the patient
                    mules with sacks of flour, or the hay carts dropping grasses, or the waggons of
                    new wine; there where the villas that were all fortresses in the fierce fighting
                    times of old, gleam white in the light upon their crests of hills with their
                    cypresses like sentinels around them, and breadths of corn and vineyards
                    traversed by green grassy paths, that lead upward<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7155-007"/> to where the stone pine and the myrtle make sweet the air together. In all
                    these Signa is beautiful; most of all, of course, in the long light radiant
                    summer when the nightingales are singing everywhere, noon as well as night; the
                    summer which seems to last almost all the year, for you can only tell how it
                    comes and goes by the coming and the going of the flowers; the longâlived summer
                    that is ushered in by the daffodils, those golden chamberlains of the court of
                    flowers, and dies, as a king should, on the purple bed of anemones, when the
                    bells of the feast of the saints sound its requiem from hill to hill. And Signa
                    revels in all that brightness of the Tuscan weather, and all about her seems
                    singing, from the cicala piping away all day long, through the hottest heat, to
                    the mandolines that thrill through the leaves at night as the peasants go by
                    strumming the chords of their loveâsongs. Summer and song and sunshine;âSigna
                    lies amidst them like some warâbruised shield of a knight that has fallen among
                    the roses and golds the nest of a lark.</p>
                <p>One day in summer Signa kept the Feast of<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7155-008"/> the
                    Corpus Domini with more pomp and praise than usual. The bells were ringing all
                    over the plain and upon the hillâsides, and the country people were coming in
                    from all the villages that lie scattered like so many robinsâ nests amongst the
                    olives and the maize plumes and the arbutus thickets everywhere around. They
                    were like figures out of a Fra Bartolommeo or a Ghirlandajo as they came down
                    through the ripe corn and the red poppies from the old grey buildings up above;
                    in their trailing white dresses and their hoods of blue, with the unlit tapers
                    in their hands, and the little whiteârobed children running before with their
                    chaplets of flowers still wet from the dew. It was the procession of Demeter
                    transmitted through all the ages, though it was called the Feast of Christ; it
                    might have been the hymns of Ceres that they sang, and Virgil might have looked
                    upon them with a smile of praise as they passed through the waving wheat and
                    under the boughs red with cherries.</p>
                <p>The old faith lives under the new, and the old worship is not dead, here in the
                    country of Horace and in the fields where Proserpine wandered.<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7155-009"/> The people are Pagan still; only now they call it
                    being Christian, and mingle together Cupid and the Madonna in their songs.<ref target="#ouida-signa101">*</ref></p>
                <p>It was fairest summer weather. There was sure harvest and promise of abundant
                    vintage. The sweet strong west wind was blowing from the sea, but not too
                    roughly, only just enough to shake the scent out of the acacia blossoms and fan
                    open the oleanders.</p>
                <p>The peasantry were in good heart and trooped down to the feast of the Body of God
                    from the loneliest farmstead on the highest hillâcrest; and from every villa
                    chapel set along the mountains, or amongst the green sea of the valley vines,
                    there was a bell ringing above an open door.</p>
                <p>The chief celebration was at Signa, which had broken from its usual ways, and had

                    was Signa in the Middle Ages once again, and Fra Giovanni might have stood by
                    and painted it all in a choral book, or Marcillat have put it in a stained

                <p>The procession came down the hill and across the bridge, with its irregular
                    arches and its now shallow green water shining underneath, and on its sands the
                    straw lying drying, and beyond it the near hills with their dusky pines, and the

                <p>All the people were chaunting the Laus Deoâchaunting with chests made strong by
                    the mountain air, and lips made tuneful by the inheritance of melody; men and
                    women and children were all singing, from the old whiteâhaired bishop who bore
                    the host, to the fourâyearâold baby that trod on the hem of its motherâs

                <p>But above all the voices there rose one sweetest and clearest of all, and going
                    up into heaven, as it seemed, as a larkâs does on a summer morning. He was only
                    a little fellow that sangâa little boy of the Lastra a Signa, poorer than all
                    the rest; with his white frock, clean, but very coarse, and a wreath of scarlet
                    poppies on his auburn curls; a very little fellow, ten years old at most, with
                    thin brown limbs and a lean wistful face, and the straight brows of his country,
                    with dark eyes full of dreams beneath them, and naked feet that could be fleet
                    as a hareâs over the dry yellow grass or the crooked sharp stones.</p>
                <p>He was always hungry, and never very strong, and certainly simple and poor as a
                    creature could be, and he knew what a beating meant as well as any dog about the
                    farm. He lived with people who thrashed him oftener than they fed him. He was
                    almost always scolded, and bore the burden of othersâ faults. He had never had a
                    whole shirt or a pair of shoes in all his life. He kept goats on one of the
                    dusky sweetâscented hillsides above Signa, and bore, like them, the wind and the
                    weather, the scorch and the storm.<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7155-013"/> And yet, by
                    Godâs grace and the glory of childhood, he was happy enough as he went over the
                    bridge and through the white dust, chaunting his psalm in the rear of the
                    priests, in the ceremonies of the Corpus Domini.</p>
                <p>For the music was in his head and in his heart; and the millions of leaves and
                    the glancing water seemed to be singing with him, and he did not feel the flints
                    under his feet, or the heat of them, as he went singing out all his little soul
                    to the river and the sky and the glad June sunshine, and he was quite happy,
                    though he was of no more moment in the great human world than any one of the
                    brown grilli in the wheat, or tufts of rosemary in the quarryside; and he did
                    not feel the sharpness of the stones underneath his feet or the scorch of them
                    as he went barefoot along the street, because he was always looking up at the
                    brightness of the sky, and expecting to see it open and to see the faces of
                    curlyâheaded winged children peep out from behind the sunrays as they did in the
                    old pictures in the villa chapels.</p>
                <p>The priests told him he would see them for<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7155-014"/> a
                    certainty if he were good; and he had been good, or at least had tried to be,
                    but the heavens never had opened yet.</p>
                <p>It is hard work to be good when you are very little and very hungry, and have
                    many sticks to beat you, and no motherâs lips to kiss you.</p>
                <p>But he tried in his own small way. When he carried the bright blue plums to the
                    market, not to taste even one when his mouth was parched with the dust and the
                    sun; to let his reedâflute lie mute while he searched for a straying kid; to
                    tell the truth, though it cost him a thrashing; to leave his black bread
                    untouched on a feast morning, though he was so hungry, because he was going to
                    confession; to forbear from pulling the ripe grapes as he went along the little
                    grass paths through the vines;âthese were the things that were so hard, and that
                    he tried his best to do, because in his little dim mind he saw what was just,
                    and in his loneliness endeavoured with all his might to follow it, that he might
                    see the faces of the angels some day; and he wondered now why he could not see
                    the cherubs through the blue smiling sky,<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7155-015"/> as
                    the old frescoâpainters had done who did not want it half so much as he did,
                    because no doubt the painters were wise men and knew a great deal, and were very
                    happy, and were not like him, who was always wanting to know everything, and
                    could never get any one to tell.</p>
                <p>The old painters would have painted him, and would have made a cherub of him,
                    with his wreath of poppies and his wondering eyes and his little singing mouth,
                    and would have taken all the leanness out of his face, and the paleness out of
                    his cheeks, and the darns out of his little coarse frock, and would have made
                    his fieldâflowers roses of paradise, and would have glorified him, and made him
                    a joy to the wondering world for ever.</p>
                <p>But he did not know that; he did know that the painters never saw any other
                    little angels than just such footâtired and sunâtanned little angels as he,
                    which their genius lifted up and transfigured into the likeness of the children
                    of God.</p>
                <p>He did not know that Fra Angelico would have kissed him, and Raffaelle would have
                        put<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7155-016"/> him for ever in the internal sunshine
                    of the Loggie, with gold rays about his head and the lilies of Mary in his
                    hands.</p>
                <p>He only looked upâin vainâfor the cherubs in the shining morning skies, and was
                    sorry that he was not good enough to have the right to see them; and yet was
                    glad at heart as he went carrying his taper in the rear of the silken banners
                    and the silvered robes and the chaunting contadini, over the green sunlightened
                    Arno water, with the midsummer corn blowing on all the hills around, and the
                    west wind bringing the salt of the sea with it to strengthen the young
                    budâclusters of the vine.</p>
                <p>Gladâbecause he was so young, and because he was sure of one creature that loved
                    him, and because the music thrilled him to his heartâs delight, and because it
                    was a happiness to him only to sing, as it is to the thrush in the depths of the
                    woods when the day dawns, or to the nightingale when she drinks the dew in heats
                    of noon off the snow of a magnolia flower.</p>
                <p>He had a little lute of his own, given to him by the only hand that ever gave him
                        anything.<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7155-017"/> Where he lived he might not play
                    it on pain of its being broken; but upon the hills he did, and along the country
                    roads; and when people were asleep in their beds in Signa, they would be
                    awakened by notes that were not the birdsâ rippling up the street in the sweet
                    silent dark, and going higher and higher and higherâit was only the little
                    fellow playing and singing as he went along in the dusk of the dawn to his
                    work.</p>
                <p>In the Lastra no one thought anything of it. In any other country, lattices would
                    have been opened and heads hung out and breaths of deep pleasure held to listen
                    better, because the childâs music was wonderful in its way, or at least would
                    have been so elsewhere. But here there was so much music everywhere: nobody
                    noticed much. It was no more than a hundred other lutes strumming at cottage
                    doors, than a thousand other stornelli or rispetti sung as the oxen were
                    yoked.</p>
                <p>There is always song somewhere.</p>
                <p>As the wineâwaggon creaks down the hill, the waggoner will chaunt to the corn
                    that grows upon either side of him. As the millerâs mules cross the bridge, the
                    lad as he cracks his whip will hum<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7155-018"/> to the
                    blowing alders. In the red clover, the labourers will whet their scythes and
                    sickles to a trick of melody. In the quiet evenings a kyrie eleison will rise
                    from the thick leaves that hide a village chapel. On the hills the goatherd,
                    high in air, amongst the arbutus branches, will scatter on the lonely mountain
                    side stanzas of purest rhythm. By the seaâshore, where Shelley died, the
                    fisherman, rough and salt, and weatherworn, will string notes of sweetest
                    measure under the tamarisk tree on his mandoline. But the poetry and the music
                    float on the air like the leaves of roses that blossom in solitude, and drift
                    away to die upon the breeze: there is no one to notice the fragrance, there is
                    no one to gather the leaves.</p>
                <p>The songs of the people now are like their fireflies in summer. They make night
                    beautiful all over the dusky hills, and the seas of vine, and the blowing fields
                    of maize, in a million lonely places of the mountains and the plains. But the
                    fireflies are born in the corn and die in it; few eyes see their loveâfires,
                    except those of the nightingale and the shrew mouse.</p>
                <p>Theocritus cried aloud on his Sicilian muses,<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7155-019"/>
                    and the world heard him and has treasured the voice of his sweet
                    complaining.</p>
                <p>But the muse of these people now lives with the corncrake under the wheat, and
                    the swallow under the houseâeaves, and is such a simple natural homeâborn thing
                    that they think of her no more than the firefly does of her luminance. And so
                    they have no Theocritus, but only everârenewing bursts of song everywhere as the
                    millet grows ripe, and the lemonâtree flowers, and the red poppies leap with the
                    corn.</p>
                <p>Often they do not know what they sing:âDoes the firefly know that she burns?</p>
                <p>This little fellow did not know what he sang.</p>
                <p>He did not know what he was.</p>
                <p>At home he was always being told that he had no right to exist at all; perhaps he
                    had not; he did not know.</p>
                <p>Himself, he thought God had made him to sing, made him just for that; as he made
                    the finches and nightingales. But he did not tell any one so. At home they would
                    have asked him what should the great God want<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7155-020"/>
                    with his puny oat pipe. Toto could make as good a noise cutting a reed in the
                    fields any day.</p>
                <p>Perhaps Toto could. He thought his own voice better, but he was not sure. He was
                    only glad to sing, because all the world seemed singing with him, and all the
                    sky seemed one vast space of sweetest soundâas, perhaps, it seems to a bird, who
                    knows?</p>
                <p>When he went to bed in the hay he could hear the nightingales and the owls and
                    the grilli singing all together in the trees behind the village and in the
                    fields that stretched by the river; and in the dusk of the dawn when he ran out
                    with his little bare feet, dripping with dew, there were a million little voices
                    hymning in the day. That was what he heard. Other people, no doubt, heard
                    cartâwheels, and grinding mills, and the scolding of women, and the barking of
                    dogs, and the creaking of doors, and a thousand other discordant things; but to
                    him the world was full of the singing birds and the humming insects, and the
                    blue heavens teemed with a choir of angels: he could not see them, but he<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7155-021"/> heard them, and he knew they were near, and
                    that was enough: he could wait.</p>
                <p>âDo you hear anything up there?â the other children would ask him, when he stood
                    listening with his eyes lifted, and they could not see so much as a bird, and he
                    would look back to them quite sorrowfully.</p>
                <p>âDo you not hear, too? You are deaf then!â</p>
                <p>But the children of Signa would not allow that they were deaf, and pelted and
                    fought him for saying so. Deaf, indeed! when it was he who was the simpleton
                    hearing a bird song where none was.</p>
                <p>Were they deaf? or, was his dreaming?</p>
                <p>The children of Signa and he never agreed which was which.</p>
                <p>It is the old eternal quarrel between the poet and the world; and the children
                    were like the world, they were strong in numbers; since they could see no bird,
                    they would have it there could be no music, and they boxed his ears to cure him
                    of hearing better than his neighbours.</p>
                <p>Only it did not cure him.</p>
                <p>His angels sung above him this day of the<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7155-022"/> Corpus
                    Domini, and he did not feel the sun hot on his bare head, nor the stones sharp
                    under his bare feet, and he did not remember that he was hungry, and that he had
                    been beaten that morning, until the music ceased suddenly, and he dropped to
                    earth out of the arms of the angels.</p>
                <p>Then he felt his bruises, and the want of food gnawed in him, and he gathered up
                    his little white acolyteâs dress and ran as quickly as he could, the withering
                    poppies shaking off his hair.</p>
                <p>He was only Pippaâs child.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                <p><hi>THERE</hi> is wild weather at Signa. The mountain streams brim over and the
                    great historic river sweeps out in full flood, and the bitter Alpine wind tears
                    like a living thing over the hills and across the plain. Not seldom the
                    lowâlying fields become sheets of dull tawny water, and the little hamlets
                    amongst them are all flooded, and from the clockâtowers the tolling bells cry
                    aloud for succour, while the low, white houses seem to float like boats.</p>
                <p>In these winters, if the harvests before have been bad, the people suffer much.
                    They have little or no bread, and they eat the raw grass even sometimes. The
                    country looks like a lake<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7155-024"/> in such weather when
                    the floods are on; only for ships there are churches, and the lighthouses are
                    the trees; and like rocky islands in all directions the village roofs and the
                    villa walls gleam red and shine grey in the rain. It is only a short winter, and
                    the people know that when the floods rise and spread, then they will find
                    compensation, later on, for them in the doubled richness of grass and measure of
                    corn.</p>
                <p>Still, it is hard to see the finest steer of the herd dashed a lifeless
                    dunâcoloured mass against the foaming piles of the bridge; it is hard to see the
                    young trees and the stacks of hay whirled together against each other; it is
                    hard to watch the broken crucifix and the cottage bed hurled like dead leaves on
                    the waste of waters; it is hardest of all to see the little curly head of a
                    drowned child drift with the boughs and the sheep and the empty hencoop and the
                    torn house door down the furious course of the river.</p>
                <p>Signa has seen this through a thousand winters and more in more or less violence,
                    and looked on<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7155-025"/> untouched herself; high set on
                    her hills like a fortress, as indeed she was, in the old republican days.</p>
                <p>In one of these wild brief winters, in a drenching night of rain, a woman came
                    down on foot along the high road that runs from the mountains, the old post road
                    by which one can travel to the sea, only no one now ever takes that way. In
                    sunshine and mild weather it is a glorious road, shelving sheer to the river
                    valley on one side and on the other hung over with bold rocks and bluffs dusky
                    with ilex and pine; and it winds and curves and descends and changes as only a
                    mountain road can do, with the smell of its rosemary and its wild myrtle sweet
                    at every turn. But on a winterâs night of rain it is very dreary, desolate and
                    dark.</p>
                <p>The woman stumbled down it as best she might.</p>
                <p>She had come on foot by short stages all the way from the sea some forty miles
                    over hill and plain. She carried a bundle with her, and never let go her hold on
                    it however wildly the wind seized and shook her, nor however roughly the<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7155-026"/> rain blew her blind. For the bundle was a
                    child.</p>
                <p>Now and then she stopped and leaned against the rocks or the stem of a tree and
                    opened her cloak and looked at it; her eyes had grown so used to the thick
                    darkness that she could see the round of its little red cheek and the curve of
                    its folded fist and the line of its closed eyelashes. She would stop a minute
                    sometimes and bend her head and listen, if the wind lulled, to the breathing of
                    its parted lips set close against her breast; then she would take breath herself
                    and go onward.</p>
                <p>The child was a year old, and a boy, and a heavy weight, and she was not a strong
                    woman now, though she had once been so; and she had walked all the way from the
                    sea. She began to grow dizzy, and to feel herself stumble like a footsore mule
                    that has been driven until he is stupid and has lost his sureness of step and
                    his capacity for safety of choice. She was drenched through, and her clothes
                    hung in a soaked dead weight upon her. Even with all her care she could not keep
                    the child quite dry.</p>
                <pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7155-027"/>
                <p>Somewhere through the darkness she could hear bells tolling the hour. It was
                    eight oâclock, and she had been in hopes to reach Signa before the night
                    fell.</p>
                <p>The boy began to stir and cry.</p>
                <p>She stopped and loosened her poor garments and gave him her breast. When he grew
                    pacified, she stumbled on again; the child was quiet; the rain beat on her naked
                    bosom, but the child was content and quiet; and so she went on so.</p>
                <p>Sometimes she shivered. She could not help that. She wondered where the town was.
                    She could not see the lights. In earlier years she had known the country step by
                    step as only those can who are born in the air of it and tread it daily in their
                    ways of work. But now she had forgotten how the old road ran. Her girlhood
                    seemed so far away; so very, very far. And yet she was only twentyâtwo years of
                    age.</p>
                <p>But then life does not count by years. Some suffer a lifetime in a day, and so
                    grow old between the rising and the setting of a sun.</p>
                <p>She had gone over the road so many times in<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7155-028"/> the
                    warm golden dawns and the white blamy nights, plaiting her wisps of straw,
                    bareâheaded in the welcome air, and with a poppy or a briarâ rose set behind her
                    ear for vanityâs sake rather than for the flowerâs. But she had been long
                    awayâthough she was so youngâat least it seemed very long to her, and with
                    absence she had lost all the peasantâs instinct of safe movement in the dark,
                    which is as sure as an owlâs or an assâs, and comes by force of long habit and
                    long treading of the same familiar way. She was not sure of her road; not even
                    sure of her footing. The wind terrified her and she heard the loud surge of the
                    Arno waters below; beating and foaming in flood. She was weak too from long
                    fatigue, and the weight of the water in her clothes, and of the child in her
                    arms, pulled her earthward.</p>
                <p>No one passed by her.</p>
                <p>Every one was housed, except sentries on the churchâtowers watching the rising of
                    the waters, and shepherds getting their cattle upward from the lowâlying
                    pastures on to the hills.</p>
                <p>She was all alone on the old seaâroad, and if<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7155-029"/>
                    she were near the lights of Signa she could not see them for the steam and mist
                    of the furious rain.</p>
                <p>But she walked on resolutely, stumbling often over the great loose stones. She
                    did not care for herself. Life was over for her. She would have been glad to lie
                    down and die where she was. But if the boy were not under some roof before
                    morning, she knew he would perish of cold in her arms. For she could give him so
                    little warmth herself. She shivered in all her veins and all her limbs; and she
                    was soaked through like a drowned thing, and he was wet also. So she went on,
                    growing frightened, though her temper was bold, and only keeping her courage to
                    love by feeling now and then as she went for the fair face of him at her breast.
                    But the touch of her hand made him cryâit was so coldâand so even that comfort
                    ceased for her, and she could only pray in a dumb unconscious way to God to keep
                    the numbness out of her arms lest they should drop the boy as she went.</p>
                <p>At a turn in the road there is a crucifixâa wooden one set in the stone.</p>

                <p>She sat down a moment under it, and rested as well as she could, and tried to
                    think of heaven. But the wind would not let her. It tore the covering off her
                    head, and tossed her long hair about; it scourged her with a storm of snapt
                    boughs; it stung her with a shower of shrivelled leaves; it pierced through and
                    through her poor thin clothes. She prayed a little as well as she could in the
                    torment of it, but it went round and round her in so mad a whirl that she could
                    not remember how the words should go. Only she remembered to keep the child
                    warm, as a motherâsheep sets her body between the lamb and the drifts of
                    snow.</p>
                <p>After a while she began to cry.</p>
                <p>Do what she would she could not keep a sense of chilliness and discomfort from
                    reaching him; he wanted the ease and rest of some little cosy bed; her cramped
                    arms held him ill, and the old shawl that wrapped him up was wet and cold.</p>
                <p>She murmured little words to him, and tried even to sing some scrap of old song;
                    but her voice failed her, and the child was not to be<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7155-031"/> comforted. He cried more, and stirred restlessly.
                    With great effort she bent her stiffened knees, and rose, and got on her way
                    again. The rocking movement, as she carried him and walked on, stilled him a
                    little.</p>
                <p>She wished that she had dared to turn up a path higher on the mountain that she
                    knew of, which she had passed as the Ave Maria bell hand rung. But she had not
                    dared.</p>
                <p>She was not sure who was there; what welcome or what curse she might get. He who
                    was certain to be master there now had always been fierce with her and stern;
                    and he might be married, and new faces be there tooâshe could not tell; five
                    years were time enough for so much change.</p>
                <p>She had not dared go up the path; now that is was miles behind her she wished
                    that she had taken it. But it was too late now. The town she knew, must be much
                    the nearer of the two, now that she had come down so far; so she went onward in
                    the face of the blinding rainâstorm. She would go up in the morning, she
                    thought, and tell him the truth; if he were<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7155-032"/>
                    brutal to herself, he would not let the child starve; she would go up in the
                    morningâso she said, and walked onward.</p>
                <p>Her foot had slipped a dozen times, and she had recovered her footing and gone on
                    safe. Once again in the dark she slipped, her foot slid farther on loose wet
                    earth, a stone gave way, she clutched the child with one arm, and flung out the
                    otherâshe could not see what she caught at in the dark. It was a bush of furze.
                    The furze tore her skin, and gave way. She slipped farther and farther, faster
                    and faster; the soil was so drenched, and the stones were unloosed. She
                    remembered the road enough to know that she was going down, down, down, over the
                    edge. She clasped the child with both arms once more, and was borne down through
                    the darkness to her death.</p>
                <p>She knew nothing more; the dark night closed in on her; she lost the sound of the
                    ringing bells, and she ceased to feel the burden of the child.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                <p><hi>AN</hi> hour later two men came with lanthorns into the fields that lie
                    between the rough vineyards underneath the road from the sea. They had sheep
                    there, which they were going to drive into the town in the morning, and they
                    were afraid that the flock, terrified in the winds and rains, might have broken
                    loose, and strayed across the iron rails of the other road that runs by the
                    river, and might get crushed under the wheels of the night trains running from
                    the west.</p>
                <p>As they went they stumbled against something on the ground, and lowered their
                    lights to look.</p>
                <p>There was a broken brambleâbush, and some crushed ferns, and a thing that had
                    fallen from<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7155-034"/> the height above the soaking soil.
                    By their dim lanthorns they saw that the thing was a woman, and bending the
                    light fuller on her as well as they could for the rain, they saw that she had
                    been stunned or killed by the fall.</p>
                <p>There was a great stone on which the back of her head had struck. She lay face
                    upward, with her limbs stretched out; her right arm was close round the body of
                    a living child; her breast was bare.</p>
                <p>The child was breathing and asleep; he had fallen upon his mother, and so had
                    escaped unhurt.</p>
                <p>The men had been born peasants, and they were used to wring the throats of
                    trapped birds and to take lambs from their mothers with small pity. They lifted
                    the boy with some roughness and some trouble from the stiffening arm that
                    enclosed him; he began to wail and moan; he was very wet and miserable, and he
                    said a little word which was a call for his mother, like the pipe of a little
                    bird that has fluttered out of the nest, and lies cold on the grass and
                    frightened.</p>
                <pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7155-035"/>
                <p>One of them took him up, and wrapped his cloak across the little sobbing
                    mouth.</p>
                <p>The other knelt down, and tried to make his light burn better, and laid his hand
                    on the womanâs breast to feel for pulse of life. But she was quite dead. He did
                    what he could to call back life, but it was all in vain; at length he covered
                    her breast, and stared up at his fellow.</p>
                <p>âThis looks like Pippa,â he said, slowly, with a sound as of awe in his
                    voice.</p>
                <p>The other lowered his light too and looked.</p>
                <p>âYes, it is like Pippa,â he said, slowly, also.</p>
                <p>Then they were both silent for some moments, the lanthorn light blinking in the
                    rain.</p>
                <p>âYes, it is Pippa; yes, certainly, it is Pippa,â said the first one stupidly; and
                    he ran his hand with a sort of shudder over the outline of her features and her
                    form.</p>
                <p>The one who held the child turned his light on the little wet face; the baby
                    ceased to cry, and opened his big, dark, wondering eyes at the flame.</p>
                <p>âAnd whose byblow is this?â said he.</p>
                <pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7155-036"/>
                <p>âThe devil knows,â said he who knelt by the mother. âBut it is Pippa. Look here
                    on her left breastâdo you see? there is the little threeâcornered scar of the
                    wound I gave her with my knife, at the wine fair, that day.â</p>
                <p>The other looked closer while the rain beat on the white cold chest of the
                    woman.</p>
                <p>âYes, it must be Pippa.â</p>
                <p>Then they were both silent again a little, for they were Pippaâs brothers.</p>
                <p>âLet us go and tell them in the Lastra, and get the bier.â said the one who knelt
                    by her, getting up to his feet, with a sullen, dazed gloom on his dark face.</p>
                <p>âAnd leave her here?â said the one who had the child.</p>
                <p>âWhy not? nobody will run away with the dead!â</p>
                <p>âBut this little beastâwhat can one do with him?â</p>
                <p>âCarry him to your wife.â</p>
                <p>âThere are too many at home.â</p>
                <p>âShe has one of his age; she can take him.â</p>
                <pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7155-037"/>
                <p>âShe will never touch Pippaâs boy.â</p>
                <p>âGive him to me, then, and stay you here.â</p>
                <p>âNo, that I dare notâthe foul fiend might come after her.â</p>
                <p>âThe foul fiend take your terrors. Let us get into the Lastra; we can see then.
                    We must tell the Misericordia, and get the bierââ</p>
                <p>âThere is no such haste; she is stone dead. What a pipe this brat has! One would
                    think he was a pig with the knife in its throat.â</p>
                <p>âIt is very cold. Who would have thought it could have livedâsuch a fall as that,
                    and such a night!â</p>
                <p>âIt lives because nobody wants it. She had no gold about her, had she?â</p>
                <p>âI do not know.â</p>
                <p>The one who held the child stopped over the dead woman awhile, then rose with a
                    sigh of regretâ</p>
                <p>âNot a stiver; I have felt her all over.â</p>
                <p>âThen she must have done ill these five years.â</p>
                <p>âYesâand yet so handsome, too. But Pippa never plaited even.â</p>
                <p>âNay, neverâpoor Pippa!â</p>
                <pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7155-038"/>
                <p>So they muttered, plodding over the broken heavy ground, with the sound of the
                    swollen river in their ears and the lanthorn lights gleaming through the steam
                    of the rain. In the noise of the waters the child sobbed and screamed unheard.
                    The man had tossed him over his shoulder as he carried the newâborn lambs, only
                    with a little less care.</p>
                <p>They clambered up into the road and tramped through the slough of mud into the
                    town. The woman had drawn nigh to the upper town by a dozen yards, when her foot
                    had slipped, and she had reeled over to her death. But the feet of the shepherds
                    were bare, and kept sure hold, like the feet of goats. They tramped on, quick,
                    through the crooked streets and over the bridge; the river had run high, and
                    along the banks, and on the flat roofs of the towers there were the lights
                    burning of the men who watched for the flood. They heard how loud and swiftly
                    the river was running as they went over the bridge and down in to the irregular
                    twisting streets, and under the old noble walls of the lower village of the
                    Lastra.</p>
                <pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7155-039"/>
                <p>The one who carried the child opened a rickety door in the side of a tumbledown
                    house, and climbed a steep stairway, and pushed his way into a room where
                    children of all ages, and trusses of straw, and a pig, and a hen with her
                    chickens, and a black crucifix, and a load of cabbageâleaves and maizeâstalks,
                    and a single lemonâtree in a pot, were all together nearly indistinguishable in
                    the darkness. He tossed the child to a sturdy brown woman with fierce brows.</p>
                <p>âHere, Nita, here is a young one I found in the fields. Feed it toânight, and
                    toâmorrow I will tell the priest and the others, and we shall get credit. It is
                    near dead of cold already. NoâI cannot stayâdo you hear how the waters are out?
                    Bruno is down below wanting me to help to house the sheep.â</p>
                <p>He clattered away down the stairs, and joined his brother in the street.</p>
                <p>âI told her nothing of Pippa,â he said, in a whisper. âIf she knew it were
                    Pippaâs not a drop of milk would he get toânight. As it is, it is a pretty
                    little beggar; she will let him share<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7155-040"/> with
                    Toto. She knows charity pleases Heaven. Andâandâsee here, Bruno, why need we
                    speak of Pippa at all.â</p>
                <p>His brother stared at him in the murky gloom. âWhy? âwhy we must fetch her in and
                    bury her.â</p>
                <p>âThe waters will do that before morning if we let them alone; that will spare us
                    a deal of trouble, Bruno.â</p>
                <p>âTroubleâwhy?â</p>
                <p>âOh, it is always troubleâthe church and the law, and all the rest. Then you know
                    the Syndic is such a man to ask questions. And nobody saw her but ourselves. And
                    they may say we tumbled her over. She has come back poor, and all Signa knows
                    that you struck her with your knife on the day of the fair, and that she has
                    been a disgrace and a weariness always. We might have trouble, Bruno.â</p>
                <p>âBut the child?â</p>
                <p>âOh, the child! I have told Nina we picked it up lost in the fields. Why should
                    we tell anybody toânight about Pippa? The poor soul is dead. No worse can come.
                    Men do not hurt<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7155-041"/> dead women. And there is so
                    much to do toânight, Bruno. We should see for our sheep on the other side now,
                    and then stay down here. The devil knows what pranks the Arno may not play
                    toânight. In five hours I warrant you he will be out all over the country.â</p>
                <p>âBut to leave her thereâall aloneâit is horrible!â</p>
                <p>âHow shall we show we did not push her there to her death?â</p>
                <p>âBut we did <emph>not</emph>.â</p>
                <p>âThat is why they would all say we did. Everybody knows that there was bad blood
                    with us and Pippa: and most of all with you. Let the night go over, Bruno. We
                    want the night to work in, and if she be there at day dawn, then we can tell. It
                    will be time enough.â</p>
                <p>âWellâlie as you like,â said the other, sullenly. âLet us get the sheep in
                    anyhow.â</p>
                <p>So they went out to the open country again, through the storm of the west wind
                    that was blowing the river back from the sea, so that it could not get out, and
                    was driven up again between the hills, and so overflowed the lands<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7155-042"/> through which it travelled. The men worked hard and
                    in earnest, housing their own sheep and driving their neighboursâ cattle on
                    rising knolls, or within church doors, or anywhere where they were safe from the
                    water; and then came down again into the street towards midnight, where all the
                    people were awake and astir watching the Arno, and holding themselves ready to
                    flee.</p>
                <p>âYou have got the ague, Bruno,â said the man at the wineâshop, for his arm shook
                    as he drank a draught.</p>
                <p>âSo would you if you had been up to your middle in water all the night like me,â
                    said the elder brother, roughly.</p>
                <p>But it was not the water, they were too used to that. It was the thought of the
                    woman dead all alone under the old seaâroad.</p>
                <p>The night became a bitter black night. Up the valley the river was out, flooding
                    the pastures far and near. Boats went and came, taking help, and bringing
                    homeless families. Watchfires were burning everywhere. Bodies of drowned cattle
                    drifted in by scores. There were stories that the great city herself was in
                    flood. In such<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7155-043"/> a time every breath is a tale of
                    terror, and every rumour grows instantly to giant proportions.</p>
                <p>The upper town of Signa itself was safe. But was great peril for the lowâlying
                    Lastra. No one went to their beds. The priest prayed. The bells tolled. The men
                    went to and fro in fear. The horrid loudness of the roaring waters drowned all
                    other sounds.</p>
                <p>When the morning broke, sullen and grey, and still beaten with storm, the cold
                    dull waste of water stretched drearily on either side of the great bridge. The
                    two brethren went with the crowd that looked from it eastward and westward.</p>
                <p>The river had spread over the iron rails, and the grassy, broken ground, and the
                    bushes of furze, and reached half way up to the rocks and the hillâroad above.
                    The wind had changed, and was blowing in from the eastward mountains. The water
                    rolled under its force with furious haste to the sea like a thing long
                    imprisoned, and frantic with the joy of escape.</p>
                <p>âIt has taken Pippa,â said the brothers, low to one another.</p>
                <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7155-044"/>
                <p>And they felt like men who have murdered a woman.</p>
                <p>Not that it mattered of course. She was dead. And if not to the sea, then to the
                    earth, all the dead must go,âinto darkness, and forgotten of all.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> brothers looked pale under their brown skins in the ashen light of
                    the dawn.</p>
                <p>But they had lost sheep like other folks, and so like other folks were pitied as
                    they went back into the Lastra to get a mouthful of bread, after the sickly
                    vigil of the night.</p>
                <p>Bruno was an unwedded man, and could bear misfortune; but Lippo was a man early
                    married, and having six young children to clamour round his soupâpot, and fight
                    for the crusts of bread. He was pointed out amongst the crowd of sufferers, and
                    was one of those who were pitied the most, and who was sure to get a good
                    portion of the almsâgiving and public relief.</p>
                <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7155-046"/>
                <p>âGive Bruno a cup of wine and a crust, Nita,â said he, going up the stairs into
                    the house of his wife. He lived there with her because her father, who was a
                    cobbler, owned the place, and he himself best liked the life of the Lastra. The
                    wife, too, having been a cobblerâs daughter and grandâdaughter, had been always
                    used to see life from the halfâdoor of the workshop; she would not become a mere
                    contadina, hoeing and weeding and plaiting and carrying dung in a broadâleaved
                    hat and a russet gownânot she, were it ever so; and Anita was one those strong
                    and fortunate women who always get their own way by dint of their power to make
                    everyone wretched who crosses them.</p>
                <p>âLeave me to speak,â said Lippo, with a glance of meaning to his brother.</p>
                <p>It was five in the morning, very cold, and still dusky. Anxiety was allayed,
                    since the wind blew from the east, and the waters were sinking, though
                    slowly.</p>
                <p>Nita, who had been up all night on the watch, like the rest of the women, was
                    boiling coffee in a tinâpot, and fanning the charcoal. The chilâ<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7155-047"/> dren lay about as they chose on the floor. None of
                    them had been put to bed, since at any moment they might have had to run for
                    their lives.</p>
                <p>Bruno looked round for Pippaâs child. He did not see it.</p>
                <p>âAn awful night,â said Lippo, kicking the pig out of a doze. âThey do say the
                    Vecchio bridge is down in Florence, and that the jewellers could not get out in
                    time. I wish the gold and silver and stones would drift down here. All the GrÃ¨ve
                    country is swamped. St. Guisto sticks up on his tower like a masthead. The
                    cattle are drowned by herds. Whole stacks of wheat are against the piles, making
                    hungry soulsâ mouths water; rotted and ruined; fine last yearâs grain; the good
                    God is bitterâhard sometimes. Where is the baby I brought you last night, my
                    woman?â</p>
                <p>Nita pointed with her charcoal fan; her coffee was on the point of boiling.</p>
                <p>The brothers looked where she pointed, to a nest of hay close to the hen and her
                    chickens. The child lay there sound asleep, with his little<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7155-048"/> naked limbs curled up; and close against him was
                    Toto, a yearling child also.</p>
                <p>The elder brother turned away suddenly, and his body shook a little.</p>
                <p>âYou have never dried your clothes, Bruno,â said his sisterâinâlaw. âWhat a <choice>
                        <corr>baby</corr>
                        <sic>gaby</sic>
                    </choice> a man is without a wife. Drink that, it is hot as hot. And what did
                    you bring me that baby forâyou and Lippo? You know whose brat it is, I suppose,
                    and look out for the reward? I thought so, or I would not have given it
                    houseâroom. Toto is more work than enough, so masterful as he isâand so
                    ravenous.â</p>
                <p>âNay,â said Lippo, as with a sheepish apology for his weakness. âI know nothing
                    of whose brat it isâI was just sorry for it; left in the soaking fields there;
                    and I picked it up as I should pick up a lame lamb. What do you think of it, my
                    dearest? does it look like a poor child or a rich one, eh? Women are quick to
                    judge.â</p>
                <p>The black brows of Nita lowered in wrath.</p>
                <p>âMercy of heaven! Who would have to do with such dolts as men? Just because the
                    child was there you pick it up, never thinking of all<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7155-049"/> the hungry mouths halfâfed at home! Shame on you. You
                    are an unnatural brute. You would starve your own to nourish a stranger!â</p>
                <p>âNay, sweetest Nita!â murmured Lippo, coaxingly. âOn such a nightâand a child
                    taken down by flood, tooânot a living soul but would have done as I did. And who
                    knows but he may be some rich fatherâs child, and make our fortunes? Any way,
                    the township will give us credit, and he can go to the Innocenti toâmorrow if we
                    find no gain in him. Look what his things betoken.â</p>
                <p>âOh, his things are roughâspun enough, and vile as can be,â said his wife, in a
                    fuming fury. âAnd would a rich manâs child be out on flood? It is only the poor
                    brats that the weather finds loose for it to play antics with; the child is a
                    beggarâs son, and this thing linked round his neck by a little string, is a
                    thing you get at the fairs for a copperâbit.â</p>
                <p>The two men looked together at the locket that she held to them; it was of
                    baseâmetalâa little poor round trumpery plaything. On it there was the one word
                    in raised letters of Signa,<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7155-050"/> and inside a curl
                    of soft light hair. That was all. They could none of them read, so the letters
                    on the metal told them nothing. They stooped together over the sleeping
                    child.</p>
                <p>He was pretty and well made; he lay quite naked in the hay, and beside brown Toto
                    looked like one of the little marble children of old Mino. His lashes and his
                    brows were black, but over his forehead hung little rings of soft, fair,
                    crumpled hair.</p>
                <p>Bruno turned away.</p>
                <p>âShe used to look just like that when she was a little child,â he muttered to
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Lippo glanced round to see if his wife heard. But she was busy with the hen, who
                    had got into a barrel of rice, and was eating treble her own price at the market
                    at one meal.</p>
                <p>âThe brat must go,â said she, turning and flogging the hen away. âAs for a chance
                    that it is a rich manâs child, that is all rubbish. You make your bread with
                    next yearâs corn. Chances like that are old wivesâ tales. What we have to do is
                    to feed six hungry stomachs. You were a<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7155-051"/> fool to
                    bring it here at all. But to dream one should keep it! Holy Mary!â</p>
                <p>âHoly Mary would say, keep it,â said Bruno, munching his crust.</p>
                <p>âMaybe it is your own, Bruno. Those that hid can find,â said his sisterâinâlaw
                    sharply. âThe child shall pack toâday. I shall go and tell them at the
                    guardâhouse. Toto is more than enough, and as for that locket, you can get such
                    trash as that at nay fair for a couple of figs. That goes for nothing.â</p>
                <p>âWell, well, keep the poor baby till noon, and I will see what the Curato says.
                    It is always well to see what he says,â her husband answered her hurriedly, and
                    afraid of the gathering storm on Brunoâs face.</p>
                <p>Bruno was passionate, tempestuous, and weak, and the quieter, subtler brother
                    ruled him with ease whilst seeming to obey. But for turning the baby of dead
                    Pippaâs to public maintenanceâLippo had a foreboding in him that in this matter
                    his brother would be too strong for him.</p>
                <p>He hurried away out of pretext of labour<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7155-052"/>
                    awaiting them in the inundated country, not without misgiving that the darkest
                    suspicions as to the fatherhood of the foundling were awakening in the jealous
                    soul of his wife.</p>
                <p>They went straight to the edge of the river, and got out their old black boat,
                    with its carved prow and tricoloured tiller, and pulled down the current of the
                    now quiet water to see with the rest what could help so save from the flotsam
                    and <choice>
                        <corr>jetsam</corr>
                        <sic>jetsum</sic>
                    </choice> of the flood. Whole districts lay under water, and the river was full
                    of dead cats and dogs, drowned sheep, floating pipkins and wineâcasks, bales of
                    hay, carcases of cows. and broken bits of furniture from many a ruined farmstead
                    and peasantâs hut laid low.</p>
                <p>âListen,â said the elder brother suddenly, when the boat was fairly out from the
                    bank, and with his hooked pole he drew in a spinningâwheel with its bank of flax
                    drenched like a drowned girlâs hair. âListen to me, Lippo. Pippaâs son must not
                    go to charity. Do you hear?â</p>
                <p>âI hear. But we are poor men, and Pippa was ââ</p>
                <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7155-053"/>
                <p>âThat is neither here nor there,â said Bruno, with his dark brows meeting. âShe
                    never asked alms of us, nor houseâroom, nor did anything except to go to her
                    death just as sheep tumble over a rock. The baby must not go to the parish. We
                    did faulty enoughâletting her go down flood with never an office of church said
                    over her. And who knowsâwho knowsâshe might not be quite dead, after all.â</p>
                <p>âNita will not keep himâthat is sure,â said the younger quickly. âLook, that is
                    Barcelliâs old red cow. You may know her by the spot on her side.â</p>
                <p>âWould she keep him if she were paid?â</p>
                <p>Lippoâs eyes lighted with joy, but he bent a grave face over his pole as he raked
                    in a floating oilâflask by its wicker coat.</p>
                <p>âI doubt if she would. She has a deal of trouble with Toto. And who is there to
                    pay, pray? We know no more than the cow there who the man wasâyou know
                    that.â</p>
                <p>âI will pay.â</p>
                <p>âYou!â</p>
                <p>âYes; I will pay the childâs keep.â</p>
                <pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7155-054"/>
                <p>âHoly angels! And you who were for ever at words and blows with Pippa, and
                    stabbed at her even for being too gay!â</p>
                <p>âI will pay,â said Bruno.</p>
                <p>Lippo rowed on in silence some moments.</p>
                <p>âHow much?â he asked at last.</p>
                <p>âI will give you half all I get.â</p>
                <p>Lippoâs white teeth showed themselves in a sudden smile. His brother gained a
                    good deal in corn and oil and beans and hay and wine, being on good land, and
                    being a man who worked and got the uttermost out of the soil that he shared with
                    his master, and Lippo was often pinched by his fatherâinâlaw Baldo the cobbler,
                    and half famished by his wife, and was a true son of the soil, and knew the
                    worth of a hundredth part of a copper coin as well as any man between sea and
                    mountain.</p>
                <p>âHalf all you get, and we to keep the child?â he said absently, and as with
                    reluctance. âBut what can we say to Nita?â</p>
                <p>âYou are never at a loss for good lying, Lippo.â</p>
                <p>Lippo smiled; his vanity was flattered.</p>
                <pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7155-055"/>
                <p>âI never lie to Nita. She always finds one out. Only in the matter of Pippaâs son
                    I hid the truth to please you. She never would nurse the child if she guessed.
                    Bust as for making her keep him, say what one will, it will be
                    impossibleâimpossible, my dear.â</p>
                <p>âIt must be,â said Bruno, withdrawing his hand from the tiller and bringing it
                    down with violence on the boatâs side, while his eyes flashed with blue fire as
                    the lightning flashes most summer nights over the blue hills of his own Signa.
                    âIt must be. I will pay. I will give you half I get. Good harvestsâyou know what
                    that is. But Pippaâs child shall not go to parish while I have an arm to drive a
                    plough through the ground or to guide over the field. Settle it with your wife
                    your own way. But Pippaâs child shall grow up amongst us.â</p>
                <p>âDear Bruno, to please you I will try,â said gentle Lippo with a sigh. âBut we
                    have brats too many in the house, and you know what Nitaâs âNayâ can be.â</p>
                <p>âNay or yea, the child stays,â said Bruno.</p>
                <p>âThe half of everything,â murmured Lippo,<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7155-056"/> as he
                    bent to his oars and passed by a dog howling on the top of its floating kennel
                    to reach his pole to a butcherâs basket of meat that was tossing amongst the
                    rubbish.</p>
                <p>But Bruno, having the tiller, pushed first to reach the dog.</p>
                <p>âIt is only a cur,â said Lippo.</p>
                <p>Bruno pulled the dog into the boat.</p>
                <p>In the Lastra, and in the town, and in all the country round or near Signa, the
                    brothers were known as well as the massâbells of the churches. The Signa people
                    thought that Bruno the contadino was a bad man enough, ready with his knife and
                    often in a brawl, and too often seen at fairs and with other menâs wives on
                    feastâdays. Lippo they liked and respected, and everybody spoke him fair; and he
                    would keep the peace most beautifully when men got angry in the streets before
                    his houseâdoor.</p>
                <p>They were both handsome men, and could neither of them read, and believed in
                    their priest and their paternoster, and had never been beyond the mountains
                    around Signa, except now and thenâBruno with his bullocks, and Lippo in<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7155-057"/> a donkeyâcart to buy leatherâdown the Valdarno
                    into the Lily City.</p>
                <p>Bruno lived on the wild hillside, amongst the thyrne and the myrtle and the gorze
                    and the grassâcropping sheep and the everâsinging nightingales. Lippo dwelt down
                    in the street, doing as little as he could, and by preference nothing, in the
                    smell of his wifeâs frying and in the sound of her fatherâs little hammer;
                    rowing out his boat when there was any chance for it to pay, and seeing after
                    the few sheep that the shoemaker kept above the bridge. They had been born
                    within a year of one anotherâsons of peasants and workers in the fields. Bruno
                    stayed on the old land where his fathers had had rights of the soil uncounted
                    generations. Lippo had loitered down loveâmaking into the Lastra, and had
                    married very early the daughter of wellâtoâdo old Baldo.</p>
                <p>There had been several sons after them. Two had been killed as soldiers, and
                    others had died in infancy by various strokes of evil chance; and the youngest
                    of them all had been PippaâPippa, whose body was gone out on the flood<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7155-058"/> to the sea with never a prayer said over her.
                    Beautiful, fierce, wayward, wilful, fireâmouthed Pippa, who had run over the
                    hills like a lizard, and who had had saucy words on her tongue as a rose has its
                    thorns, and who had had all Signa gazing after her for her beauty when she had
                    walked singing like a cherub in the wake of the banners of the church.</p>
                <p>Not that she had ever cared much for the church,âpoor Pippa.</p>
                <p>She had always been quarrelsome and selfâwilled and headstrong; and had flouted
                    her lovers, and been petulant to her own hindrance, and as wild as a hawk, and
                    provoking,âyes, provoking, past the endurance of any man who was a brother and
                    nothing more. She would never sit quiet and spin; she would never keep her eyes
                    on her tress of straw as other girls did; if she milked the cow she would upset
                    the pail just out of wantonness, and would laugh and dance to see their rage
                    when she let the pigs run in amongst her brotherâs plot of green peas. Yes,
                    certainly, she was provoking; a bad girl, even though loving at heart; no one
                    was to blame that<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7155-059"/> she had gone away without a
                    word and come back so, with a child at her breast, to find her death the night
                    of the flood.</p>
                <p>A selfâwilled foolish girl and with wrongâdoing ingrained in herâas for patience,
                    who could be very patient with a woman that let the pigs in amongst your peas
                    just when green peas fetched their weight in silver? And then she had such a
                    tongue too, the little shrewâtrue, she did not bear malice, and would not growl,
                    growl, growl for hours together as Nita would, and Nitaâs mother, thinking it
                    the only way to manage men; true, she was a generous soul, and would let a
                    beggar have her dinner, though meals were meagre on the hills; and when one had
                    beaten her till she was blue she would not tell, but say she had fallen from the
                    ladder trimming the vines, or that the bees had stung her. Still a wilful,
                    quarrelsome, pettish thing; no man could be blamed for her illâhap nor for her
                    end. So Lippo said to himself when his brother had gone up to the hills, and he
                    himself left his boat to go down the narrow street homeward, pondering on
                    Pippaâs child and on what he should say to Nita.</p>
                <pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7155-060"/>
                <p>As he went up the stairs he settled the lie to his mindâs content, and entered
                    the room looking with his fairest faith out of his clear brown eyes.</p>
                <p>âI am going to be frank with you, Nita,â he said, and then he sat down and lied
                    so prettily, that if there be a Father of Lies he must quite have rejoiced to
                    hear him.</p>
                <p>Nita listened as well as a woman can listenâthat is, interrupting twenty times
                    and getting up to do some irrelevant thing twice twenty.</p>
                <p>âBrunoâs son!â she cried at last.</p>
                <p>âHush! The children will hear,â said Lippo. âIt is as I tell you. Only Bruno must
                    not know that you know, because he is so afraid that redâhaired Roma whom he is
                    courting should hear of it. But you see why I closed with him, Nita. It will be
                    a good thing for us. We can eat like fatting pigs off Brunoâs land. Nothing to
                    prevent us. And it is hill land, you know, and his share comes to a good bit,
                    taking fair weather and foul. And then, besides that, we shall have credit in
                    the Lastra, for Bruno never will say a word, and the curato and all the place<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7155-061"/> may as well think the child a foundling as
                    not. A good deed smells sweet in the neighboursâ nostrils, and a good name is
                    like a blest palm. We must tell your father, or he will grumble at the seventh
                    mouth. But nobody else need know. The brat will grow up with the others, and we
                    shall seem kind, that is all.â</p>
                <p>âTo think of its being Brunoâs!â cried Nita, with a clap of her big brown hands.
                    âDid I not say so, now? Did I not jeer him as he looked at it asleep? Ohâoh! Who
                    can deceive me? Never you try, Lippo, more!â</p>
                <p>âYou can see through a millstone,â replied Lippo, with an embrace of her. âOnly
                    an ass can ever seek to blind you, and that is why I told you the truth, though
                    Bruno would have screened it. He is so afraid of the creature he goes to now
                    ever knowingâyou understand.â</p>
                <p>âThe child will be a bother,â said Anita, remembering the kicks and cuffs with
                    whose best administration she could scarce manage to keep the peace amongst her
                    brood or their hands ever out of the soupâpot.</p>
                <p>âOh, no,â said Lippo, shrugging his shoulders,<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7155-062"/>
                    âwhere there are six there may as well be seven. He will tumble up with the
                    others. We are to have half of all Bruno gets, and I can guess to a stalk, you
                    know, what an acre of wheat is worth, or what an olive or a fig tree bears. No
                    fattore would outwit me. I was not bred out on the fields for nothing. Half of
                    everything, you know, Nita. That will mean a good deal in good seasons. I am
                    very hungry, carina. Could you not fry something in oil, nice and tempting for
                    one? An artichoke, now, or a blackbird?â</p>
                <p>Nita grumbled at the extravagance, but being in a good humour went downstairs and
                    across the way and brought over some artichokes and fried them and ate them with
                    her husband, the children being sent to make dust pies and castles in the sun on
                    the stones below, old Baldo keeping an eye on them over his halfâdoor.</p>
                <p>Lippo and his wife ate their artichokes, and drank a little wine with them.</p>
                <p>Pippaâs son cried unnoticed in his nest of hay, and sobbed out his one little
                    word for mother, which was like the moan of a little unfledged bird left in the
                    snow.</p>
                <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7155-063"/>
                <p>âWe will bring him up to help himself,â said Lippo, with his mouth filled with
                    the fried eggs and oil.</p>
                <p>The child sobbed on, and felt for his motherâs breast, and only had his small
                    soft rosy hands torn with the thorns and pricked with the burrs and briars of
                    the sunâdried hay.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                <p><hi>MEANWHILE</hi> Bruno went up the hills; up the same old road which had felt
                    Pippaâs footsteps on it the night before; with the river underneath it, and on
                    the other side of the mountains rising, with the olives and vines about their
                    sides, and on their summits old watchtowers and fortresses, and dusky woods of
                    ilex, and cloudy masses of stoneâpine, that sent their strong odour down the
                    valley a score of miles.</p>
                <p>Bruno went on his way, looking neither right nor left. He went over the ground so
                    often, and he had seen it all from the year he was born; always this and never
                    anything else; and long familiarity dulls the sense of beauty, even where such
                    sense has been awakened, and<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7155-065"/> Brunoâs never had
                    beenâexcept for a womanâs looks.</p>
                <p>He strode on, not looking up nor looking back; a straightâlimbed, swarthy,
                    fineâbuilt peasant, of thirty years or more, with the oval face of his country,
                    and broad, black, luminous eyes, soft and contemplative, like the eyes of the
                    ox, when the rage was not alight in them.</p>
                <p>He did not look round, because peasants do not look up from the soil; and he did
                    not look back, because he had no care to see the spot where he had kneeled down
                    in the wet grass by the broken bushes, with the noise of the river in his
                    ears.</p>
                <p>He went up the seaâroad some way, and then quitted it and ascended to the left.
                    The estate to which he belonged was on the side of a spur of the mountains, that
                    turns to Signa, and faces straight down the valley, and whose wine is named as
                    famous in the Bacco in Toscana of Redi.</p>
                <p>There are beautiful hills in this country, steep and bold, and formed chiefly of
                    limestone and sandstone, covered all over with gumâ<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7155-066"/> cistus and thyme, and wildâroses and myrtle, with low
                    growing laurels and tall cypresses, and boulders of stone, and old thorn trees,
                    and flocks of nightingales always, and the sadâvoiced little owl that was
                    beloved of Shelley.</p>
                <p>Brunoâs farmstead was on one of these hills; half the hill was cultured, and the
                    other half was wild; and on its height was an old, grey, mighty place, once the
                    palace of a cardinal, and where there now dwelt the steward of the soil on which
                    Bruno had been born.</p>
                <p>His cottage was a large, low, white building, with a red roof, and a great arched
                    door, and a sunâdial on the wall, and a group of cypresses beside, and a big
                    walnutâtree before it. There was an old well with some broken sculpture; some
                    fowls scratching under the fig boughs; a pig hunting for roots in the black bare
                    earth; behind it stretched the wild hillâside, and in front a great slope of
                    fields and vineyards; and far below them in the distance the valley and the
                    river and the bridge, with the high crest of the upper Signa, and the low lying
                    wallâtowers of the Lastra on either side of the angry waters.</p>
                <pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7155-067"/>
                <p>Bruno did not look back at it at all. He saw the sun rise over it, and the
                    beautiful pale light steal up, and up, and up, and up, wherever he rose to his
                    work in the dayâdawn. But is was nothing at all to him. When now and then a
                    traveller or a painter strayed thither, and said it was beautiful, Bruno smiled,
                    glad because it was his own countryâthat was all.</p>
                <p>He went into his cold, quiet, desolate house, and sat down for a minuteâs rest;
                    he was tired. There was no one to greet him. He did everything for himself. He
                    had no neighbours. The nearest contadino lived a mile down beyond the fields
                    which in summer were a sea of maize and a starry world of fireâflies; and the
                    old palace was some distance higher on the crest, where the gorze grew thickest,
                    and the mountain moss clustered about the roots of the stoneâpines.</p>
                <p>Hereâin the long, low rambling dwelling, with the sunâdial on its wall, and the
                    great archways underneath it, and the stacks of straw before itâthere had been
                    nine of them once. Now Bruno lived there alone.</p>
                <pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7155-068"/>
                <p>He sat down a minute on the settle, and thought. Thinking was new work to him. He
                    never thought at all, except of the worm in the ripening wheat, or the ticks in
                    the flockâs fleeces. The priest did his thinking for him. What use was it to pay
                    a priest for having opinions if one had to think for oneâs self as well?</p>
                <p>But he sat and thought now.</p>
                <p>Poor Pippa! what a little, ruddy, pretty thing she was, lying in her white
                    swaddling bands, when he was a big rough boy twelve years old, with bare feet
                    and chest, who used to come in from the fields hungry and footsore, and feel
                    angry to the lastâcome child in his motherâs arms, getting all her care and
                    caresses.</p>
                <p>He bore Pippa a grudge from her birth.</p>
                <p>They were all boys, rough and tumble together, share and share alike; and then
                    one summer morning the girl came, and their mother never seemed the same to them
                    againânever any more. The little girl, with a face like the bud of the red rose
                    laurel, seemed to be all she thought aboutâor so they fancied; and anything good
                    that could be got, honey, or a drop of new milk, or a little<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7155-069"/> white loaf from the town, or an apricot from the
                    fattoria, was always set aside for Pippa; pretty, saucy, noisy, idle Pippa, who
                    was more often in mischief than they were, but never got, as they did, a
                    thrashing, and a wish that the devil might come and fetch away all naughty
                    children.</p>
                <p>There had been times when he had hated Pippa, hated her from the first day he saw
                    her lying on her motherâs bosom, with her little red mouth, clinging as bee does
                    at a flower, to the night when he had scolded her for dancing with any fool that
                    asked her, and then she had mocked him about a dead love, and he had struck at
                    her with his knife, and the people had dragged him off her, all blind with rage
                    and shame at his own misdoing; and the blood had sprouted up out from her neck,
                    and stained the lace she wore as red as a goldfinchâs feathers.</p>
                <p>He had hated her always.</p>
                <p>It seemed to him now that he had been like a brute to herâpoor, pretty,
                    brownâeyed, happy, selfâwilled thing, who had been spoilt from her babyhood
                    upward.</p>
                <pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7155-070"/>
                <p>Lippo remembered how provoking she had been, and justified himself as he went
                    home through the Lastra.</p>
                <p>But Bruno forgot it, and only reproached himself. He had always been rough and
                    fierce and moody with herâoh yes, no doubt. If he had been patient with herâhe
                    twelve years older, tooâshe might never have run away from her home on the hill,
                    and borne that nameless child, and gone to her death on the old seaâroad.</p>
                <p>No doubt he had done wrong by her; had been too severe and tyrannous, and had
                    helped to make the cottage distasteful to her after their mother had died and he
                    had become master, and had tried to shut her in, as a thrush is shut in a wicker
                    cage.</p>
                <p>He forgot all her faultsâpoor dead Pippaâand he remembered all his own. Liberal
                    natures will err thus to themselves; and Bruno, with all his evil ways, was
                    liberal as the sun and winds.</p>
                <p>Poor Pippa!</p>
                <p>He saw her as he had seen her standing out in the light on the hill, with her
                    little brown hands<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7155-071"/> plaiting the straw all
                    unevenly, and her bowâlike mouth gay with laughter at some piece of mischief
                    sweet to her as fig in summer. She had used to look so pretty, with her arch
                    eyes shining under her great straw penthouse of a hat, and her supple, slim
                    shape, in brown and red, like a firefly, standing up as a poppy does against the
                    corn on the amber light of the evening sky, here where the hill was just the
                    same, and only she was a thing that was gone for ever and ever and ever.</p>
                <p>Bruno shut his eyes not to see the hill. But he could not shut out his thoughts.
                    He had been a brute to her. It stirred and grew in him; this mute remorse, which
                    Lippo would have laughed out, and which had been awake ever since he had gone
                    about his business as the river rose, and left the dead woman alone to drift
                    down with the flood.</p>
                <p>She was dead, of course, and it could hurt her no more to be swept out to the
                    salt seaâpools westward than to be lowered into the earth in a coffin. Still
                    Bruno, if he had gone straight to the priest and told him, and had let the
                        Church<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7155-072"/> sorrow over and bury her, would not
                    have been tormented by the thought of her was he was now. Now, in a curious kind
                    of half stupid way, he felt as if he had found her and had killed her.</p>
                <p>There had been war between him and Pippa always; and though it had shocked him a
                    little to find her lying there lifeless in the dark, yet he had not cared much
                    at first. But since he had forsaken her to the will of the waters, in the vague
                    fear of that nameless trouble which his brother had threatened him with as
                    possible, Brunoâa brave man all his daysâfelt a coward; and with the tingling
                    shame of that new craven sense came a selfâreproach in which any rough word and
                    fierce act of his life against the lost creature rose in judgment against
                    him.</p>
                <p>Poor Pippa!</p>
                <p>After all, what had her faults been? Only mirth and overâeagerness for pleasure,
                    and a quick tongue, and a love of the sunshine idly spent amongst fruits and
                    flowers whilst others were working. These were all.</p>
                <p>She had been truthful and generous of temper,<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7155-073"/>
                    and never unwilling to forgive. Nay, though he had struck at her with his open
                    blade that fairânight, she had called out to the people not to hurt him for it;
                    and when she had left the hillside that very summerâno one knew for whither nor
                    with whomâdid she not tell an old woman, who alone saw her going through the
                    millet at break of day with a bundle, âSay to my brothers I am not angry any
                    more; they have been unkind to me, but I have been troublesome, and said hot
                    words very often; and I will pray for them, if that will do any good: only tell
                    them not to try to bring me back, because we never are at peace togetherâ?</p>
                <p>Poor Pippa!</p>
                <p>He shut his eyes against the sunlight; but, shut them as he would with both
                    hands, he saw her as he had seen her last, coming through the beanflowers, with
                    the long evening shadows and the little golden fireflies seeming to run before
                    her; when he had turned across the fields and avoided her because of the thrust
                    with the knife, which she had never spoken of, and of which he was half ashamed
                    and half defiant,<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7155-074"/> and which therefore he would
                    never admit that he regretted, living on in silence with her under the same
                    roof, trusting to chance.</p>
                <p>And chance cameâthe chance that one summer morning the bed of Pippa was empty,
                    and old Viola, coming in with a sheath of green cane for her donkey, told them
                    how she had met the girl, and of her farewell words.</p>
                <p>Shut his eyes as he would, he saw her so, amongst the purple beanflowers that
                    night when his heart had swelled a little at sight of her, and he had been half
                    inclined to tell her he was sorry for that blow, and then had felt the pride
                    rise in him, and had said to himself that the girl had deserved itâdisobeying
                    him, and then jesting at himâand so had struck across the rustling corn, and let
                    her go without a word.</p>
                <p>And now she was deadâgone out on the flood to the sea; and he had never told her
                    that he had been sorry for the stab, and never could tell her now.</p>
                <p>Would God tell her? or any one of the saints?</p>
                <pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7155-075"/>
                <p>Bruno wondered. He felt as if that dead woman whom the river had got stood for
                    ever between him and all the hosts of heaven.</p>
                <p>He was a strong man, and his emotions and his intelligence were both unawakened,
                    and his life was much like that of his own plough bullocks; but he shuddered
                    through all his limbs as he rose up from the wooden settle and faced the day.
                    Work with the labourer is an instinct, as watching is the houseâdogâs; and pain
                    may stifle it for a moment, but no more.</p>
                <p>He went out and unloosed the bar of the stableâdoors, and brought out his oxen,
                    and muzzled them and yoked them together, and drove them out over the steep
                    slanting fields that ran upward and downward, and were intersected by lines of
                    maples and mulberries with the leafless vines clinging to them, and by
                    watercourses cut deep that the rain might be borne down the mountain side, and
                    by wild hedges of briony and rose and arbutus, with here and there winterâred
                    leaves of creepers that the winds had forgotten to blow away.</p>
                <p>It was a grey morning, with heavy white mists<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7155-076"/>
                    lying over all the valley down below; and on the high hills it was very cold.
                    Bruno drove his meek largeâeyed beasts through the black earth with a heavy
                    heart.</p>
                <p>He seemed always to see Pippa as she had used to come, when their father lived,
                    and she was a child, with a black loaf and a flask of wine, out to them on the
                    hill in the ploughing time, and stroked the bullocks, and put round their
                    leathern frontlets gay wreaths of anemones, purple and red and blue, or the
                    berries of the beautiful corbezzolo.</p>
                <p>And now she was deadâstone deadâlike the mouse the share killed in the
                    furrow.</p>
                <p>The bullocks, well used to goad and curse, turned their broad foreheads and
                    looked at him with luminous fond eyes: he was so gentle with themâthey were
                    grateful, but they wondered why.</p>
                <p>Bruno ploughed all day, and the wind blew up from the sea, and he felt as if it
                    were blowing her long wet hair against him.</p>
                <p>âI will do good by the child, so help me â, and perhaps they will tell her in
                    heaven,â he<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7155-077"/> said to himself, as he went to and
                    fro up and down the shelving fields underneath the lines of the leafless
                    trees.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps they will tell her in heaven?â he thought, as he went over the heavy wet
                    clods in the mist.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                <p><hi>BRUNONE MARCILLO</hi>, always known as Bruno, did what all his people had
                    always done for seven hundred centuries and more.</p>
                <p>They had been vassals and spearmen in the old warlike times, and wellâtoâdo
                    contadini ever afterwards; giving their sons, when need arose, to die in the
                    common cause of the native soil, but otherwise never stirring off their own
                    hillside; good husbandmen, bold men, fierce haters, honest neighbours, keeping
                    their womenâkind strictly, and letting their males have as much license as was
                    compatible with unremitting and patient labour in all seasons.</p>
                <p>They were a race remarkable for physical beautyâa beauty that is strictly
                    national; the<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7155-079"/> dark straightâbrowed classic
                    beauty which Giotto has put in his Garden of Olives, and Signorelli given to his
                    noble Prophets.</p>
                <p>They had always intermarried with mountain races like their own, or taken wives
                    from the Lastra households, where the ancient blood ran pure. The father of
                    Brunone and Lippo had done otherwise; he had taken a workâgirl of the city, a
                    pretty feckless thing, whom he had seen one market night that he had strayed
                    into the Loggia theatre, when a good harvest had put too much loose cash in his
                    pockets, and the humours of Cimarosaâs <bibl><title>Nemici Generosi</title></bibl> had been
                    making him laugh till he cried.</p>
                <p>The girl had become to him a good wife enough, nobody had denied that; but she
                    was not of the stern stuff that the Marcillo housewives always had been, with
                    their busts of Ceres and their brows of Juno, their arms that could guide the
                    oxen and their heads that could balance a wineâ barrel.</p>
                <p>She was timid, and some said false, though that was never proved, and she had not
                        the<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7155-080"/> hillâborn strength of mind and body
                    that these people who had lived nigh a thousand years in the same air
                    possessed.</p>
                <p>Her second son, Filippo, or Lippo, inherited her constitution, and with it her
                    supplicating caress of manner and her timidityâperhaps her falseness too; but
                    the Lastra did not think so; the Lastra was fond of Lippo, though he had
                    deserted the ways of his fathers, and dwelt in an idleness not altogether
                    creditable and altogether alien to the habits of his race, who had always been
                    used to labour together, father and sons, and often grandsons, all under the
                    same roof and on the same fields, generation after generation.</p>
                <p>When the large family dwindled down to one man, it was out of custom to leave so
                    much land to solitary labourer. But Brunone Marcillo was a favourite with his
                    master, and one of the best husbandmen in the province; besides he was sure to
                    marry and fill the house, they thought, so he was left undisturbed, and the land
                    suffered nothing; for though he loved his pleasure in a wild lawless way, and
                    took fierce fits of it at times, he was devoted to his homeâ<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7155-081"/> stead and his work, and loved his birthplace with
                    that fastârooted love of the Tuscan which makes the little red roof under the
                    red waning skies, on the solitary upland, or in the silent marsh, or amidst the
                    blueâflowered fields of the flax, or above the thymeâcovered, windâblown hills
                    by the sea, more precious and more lovely than any greater fate or fairer gifts
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>All alone on his little farm Bruno became a man well to do, and who could have
                    put money by had he not loved women so wellâso they said.</p>
                <p>It was a broad rich piece of land that went with the dwelling house he occupied.
                    He grew wheat, and maize, and beans, and artichokes, and had several sturdy
                    figâtrees that yielded richly, and noble olives that numbered their hundred
                    years, and the vines that marched with his corn were amongst the best in the
                    Signa country.</p>
                <p>The half of all its produce was his, according to the way of the land and the
                    provisions of custom, and the house was a better one than most of its degree;
                    and the fields that were his lay well on the open hillside, sunâswept, as was<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7155-082"/> wanted by vines and grain both, but sheltered
                    from cold winds by the jutting out of the quarried rocks and the woods of ilex
                    and pine that were above.</p>
                <p>Bruno was a laborious workman, and was skilled in field labour; he knew how to
                    make an ear of barley bear double, and how to keep blight away, and the fly from
                    the vine.</p>
                <p>He could not read; he could not write; his notions of God were shut up in a
                    little square coloured picture, framed and hung up over the gateway into his
                    fields to bring a blessing there; his idea of political duty was comprised in
                    hating any one who taxed him, and being ready to shoot any one who raised the
                    impost on grain; but he was a husbandman after Virgilâs own heart; he wanted no
                    world beyond the waving of his corn, and if a steer were sick, or when the
                    grapes were ripe, he took no sleep, but watched all night, loving his cattle and
                    his fruits as poets their verse or kings their armies.</p>
                <p>On the whole Bruno led a contented and prosperous life, and if he had not been so
                    ready with<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7155-083"/> his wrath, might have been welcome
                    in all households; and if he had not been over fond of those fairs in all the
                    little towns where wandering players set up their little music booths, and of
                    the women that he found there, and of the license that is always to be had by
                    any man whose moneyâbag has its mouth open and its stomach filled, might also
                    have become a very wealthy man in his own way. But he was fierce, and every one
                    feared him, and he was improvident, and every one fleeced him. And he was lax
                    and lawless in his loves, and had a dangerous name in the countryside amongst
                    the mothers of maidens.</p>
                <p>So that he of all men had had no title to be hard upon Pippa: and yet hard he had
                    been always.</p>
                <p>The most amorous men and the wildest are usually the most exacting of virtue and
                    modesty in their own women.</p>
                <p>He had always hated her: yes, honestly hated her he told himself; and as she grew
                    up into girlhood, and they were shut alone in the same house, always opposed on
                    to another, Pippaâs<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7155-084"/> idleness, and sauciness,
                    and rebellion against homekeeping, and passion for dancing and straying and
                    idling, infuriated him against her more and more with every day that dawned.</p>
                <p>Bruno, with all his excesses, never neglected or slurred over his labour. The
                    land and its needs were always first with him. He would have had his sister one
                    of those maidens, numerous around him, who asked nothing better than the daily
                    round of household and field duties; who could reap as well as a man; who could
                    harness an ox and guide him; and who were busy from dusk of dawn to nightfall
                    hoeing, drawing water, spinning, plaiting, shelling beans, rearing chickens,
                    drying tomatoes, setting cauliflowers, thinning fruitâtrees, winding silk off
                    the cocoons, and went to bed with tired limbs and a light conscience, never
                    dreaming of more pleasure than a stroll on a feastâday with a neighbour, or a
                    new white linen skirt for some grand church function.</p>
                <p>âWhy was not Pippa like that?â he had asked himself, angrily, ten thousand times,
                    instead of a girl that would hardly do as much<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7155-085"/>
                    as tie up a few bunch of carnations or S. Catherine lilies for the market.</p>
                <p>The Marcillo women had always been reared in strong usefulness and in stern
                    chastity. This handsome, buoyant, gay, insolent, idle thing offended him in
                    every way and at every turn.</p>
                <p>He would have married her away willingly, and dowered her well, to the first
                    honest fellow; but Pippa had laughed in the faces of all the neighboursâ sons
                    who had wanted her to wed with them. She was in no hurry, she said.</p>
                <p>She made all the countryside in love with her, and then turned her back on it
                    with a saucy laugh, and the sunshine in her face was never merrier than whenever
                    she heard that two young fellows had quarrelled about her, and drawn knives on
                    one another, and set all the Lastra talking.</p>
                <p>So that when Pippa disappeared many were glad, and none very sorry. Bruno smarted
                    with shameâthat was all.</p>
                <p>Indeed, when she was gone away, the townsfolk talked of a foreigner, a student
                    and painter, who had been seen with the girl at<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7155-086"/>
                    evening on the road, or by the river, or in the shadow of the old Lastra
                    bastions; a young man with a delicate face, and a playful way, and a gay tongue,
                    who had wandered on foot, with his knapsack and colours, down from the Savoy
                    country and into Tuscany, and had danced often with Pippa, and had been met with
                    her after sunset, on the hillside.</p>
                <p>But none had told Bruno till too late, being afraid of his ready knife if a hint
                    were taken wrong, and he had known nothing of these tales until Pippa had
                    vanished, and even then the neighbours were slow to rouse his wrath by telling
                    the scanty rumours they had heard.</p>
                <p>Even the young manâs name the people had not known; a youngster lightly come and
                    lightly gone, whom no one took account of, till of a sudden they noticed that he
                    had been unseen since Pippa had been missing. He had lodged a little while above
                    a wine shop, and gone up and down the river, and to and from the old white town,
                    painting; and had danced at the fairs and learned to strum on a guitar, and
                    eaten piles of fruit, and been restless and graceful as a firefly:<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7155-087"/> that was all; and only a few women had observed as
                    much as that.</p>
                <p>It told nothing to Bruno; and, besides, if they had told him a hundred times as
                    much, he could have done nothing; a contadino is rooted to the soil, and it no
                    more would have seemed possible to him to travel into far countries than to have
                    used his ploughshare for a boat, or driven his steers to turn the sea like
                    sod.</p>
                <p>People had hardly ever though what Pippaâs fate had been. If anything great had
                    come to her, the countryside would have heard of it.</p>
                <p>In these little ancient burghs and hillside villages, scattered up and down
                    between mountain and sea, there is often some boy or girl, with a more wonderful
                    voice, or a more beautiful face, or a sweeter knack of song, or a more vivid
                    trick of improvisation than the others; and this boy or girl strays away some
                    day with a little bundle of clothes, and a coin or two, or is fetched away by
                    some farâsighted pedlar in such human wares, who buys them as bird fanciers buy
                    the finches from the nets; and then, years<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7155-088"/> and
                    years afterwards, the town or hamlet hears indistinctly of some great prima
                    donna, or of some larkâthroated tenor, that the big world is making happy as
                    kings, and rich as kingsâ treasuries, and the people carding the flax or
                    shelling the chestnuts say to one another, âThat was little black LiÃ , or that
                    was our old Momo;â but Momo or LiÃ  the village or the vinefield never sees
                    again.</p>
                <p>If anything great had come in that sort of way to Pippa, Signa would have heard
                    of it. There is always someone to tell of a successâalways someone to bring
                    word, so that the friends may gird up their loins, and go and smell out the
                    spoil, claim the share of it, and remind Momo, as he comes out of a palace, of
                    his barefoot babyhood, and call to LiÃ âs mind the time when she, who now
                    quarrels with princes, was glad of the dayâs branâbread.</p>
                <p>But none had ever said anything of Pippa. She had dropped out of sight and
                    remembrance, and no one had asked what had become of her, though the girl had
                    been beautiful in her way, darkly, brightly, roughly, tenderly, capriciously
                        beautiful,<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7155-089"/> like the barley blowing from
                    shade to sunâonly, no men ever would stand her temper, said the women.</p>
                <p>That had been conceded everywhere: and her brothers had been pitied.</p>
                <p>Between the day that she had gone over the fields with the farewell word to old
                    Viola and the night that she had stumbled to her death, over the sea, in the
                    dark road, no one had ever heard or known anything of Pippa.</p>
                <p>But it was not because her story was a strange one; it was only because it was so
                    common. Mystery is to the tongue of the storyteller as butter to the hungry
                    mongrel; but what is simple is passed over by human mouths as daisies by the
                    grazing horse.</p>
                <p>Her tale was very simple.</p>
                <p>That fairâday in Signa she had been so resolute to go to the merryâmaking,
                    because of the stranger, who would whirl to the thrum of the mandolin as a bat
                    does when a lamp burns, and who would come through the beanflowers to see her
                    plait straw when her brothers were out in the fields, and who was gay like
                    herself, and<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7155-090"/> passionate, and young, and found
                    but one song worth the singing when the sun went down and the fireflies
                    burned.</p>
                <p>Then there had come Brunoâs blow, and the stab in her breastâand all a manâs
                    natural passion of sympathy had been aroused, and all a girlâs terror of her
                    fierce brotherâs worse vengeance, if only the truth were known.</p>
                <p>And so her lover took her with him when he went back to France, while the
                    beanflowers faded and died; and Pippa loved him like a dog:âpoor Pippa! who
                    always having been so saucy of tongue, and stubborn of neck, and proud, and full
                    of petulance, clung like a vine, and crouched like a spaniel, and trembled like
                    a leaf, when once she loved, as all such women do.</p>
                <p>Thus the broad shining Tuscan fields were changed for streets of Paris, and the
                    hills of olive for the roofs of lead; and the song of the grilli for the beat of
                    the drum; and the fires of the lucciole for the shine of the gas; and Pippa, a
                    thing of sun and wind and seablown air, fresh as a fruit and free as a bird, was
                    cooped up in<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7155-091"/> a studentâs attic, with the roar
                    of the traffic for ever on her ear, and the glistening shine of the neighbourâs
                    houseâroofs for ever before her casement.</p>
                <p>He did what he could for her.</p>
                <p>He was a landscape painter and a student of Paris. He had a beautiful face, great
                    dreams, ardent passions, and no money, except such little pittance as an old
                    doting mother, a widow in a little Breton hamlet, could send him, by pinching
                    herself of oil and bread. For three months he worshipped Pippa; and this scarlet
                    poppy from the Tuscan wheat glowed on a hundred canvases in a hundred forms; and
                    then of course he tired. Then, of course, the poppy ceased to be a magical
                    flower of passion and of sleep; it seemed only a red bubble, blowing useless in
                    the useful corn.</p>
                <p>He thought he hid this from her; but she felt, before he knew, it. Women will
                    always do so who love their lives out in a year, as Pippa did.</p>
                <p>The Mimis, and Bibis, and Libis around her were happy enough, with a pot of
                        mignonette<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7155-092"/> for their garden, and a theatre
                    for their heaven, and a Sunday in the woods now and then for their liberty.
                    Besides, they could all chatter with one another, and change their lovers, if
                    need was, and sing little triplets, like little canaries, as they sat sewing at
                    roseâcoloured ballâskirts, or twirling up their cambric mockârosebuds.</p>
                <p>But Pippa was in exile. Pippa had the womanâs worst crime of loving over much.
                    Pippa had brought nothing with her but her own full, fierce, fond, little heart
                    of storm. Pippa felt her heart break in this cage.</p>
                <p>Pippa could not read. Pippa knew nothing that he talked of, except when he told
                    her that he loved her, and men get weary of saving this too long to the same
                    woman. Pippa could only plait strawâand that not very well; and no one wanted it
                    in Paris.</p>
                <p>Pippa, when in the danceâgardens, one night, struck with a knife at a man who
                    would have kissed her, and wounded him sorely, and when hidden away from the
                    perils that arose, could not be made to see she had done wrong, because Bruno
                    had stabbed her, and she had borne him no<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7155-093"/>
                    malice, and here she was on her just defence, and had done right, she thought.
                    Then her lover grew wroth with her, and Pippa, whose spirit was broken, like
                    that of all fiery creatures when they love, could only sob and kiss his feet;
                    and then,âhe went elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Then came hard winters, and a crying child, and the garret was cold and empty,
                    and debt stole in like a ghost, and hunger with him, and Pippa sold her
                    pearlsâreal pearls, fished up from the deep sea by coral divers, and worn at
                    fairs and feasts by her with the honest pride of the true Tuscan peasant. Only
                    she never let him know the pearls were sold. She made him think that it was one
                    of his own pictures which had brought them that little heap of gold.</p>
                <p>But the money lasted very little time, and the child sickened and died, and the
                    summer came; but that would not banish hunger; and Pippa lost her beauty, and
                    her rich, round, radiant look, and her great brown eyes got a frightened
                    lookâbecause he so seldom kissed her now, and sometimes would give her a little
                    gesture like that which a man gives when he sweeps away quickly<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7155-094"/> with his elbows some dead flower or dropped ashes.
                    Yet still he was good to herâoh, yesâhe was good. Pippa told herself so a
                    thousand times a day. He never beat her. Pippa, once so saucy and so proud, was
                    grateful. Love is thus.</p>
                <p>Then another winter came, the third oneâthat was hardest. They had nothing to eat
                    for many days. They sold their clothes and their bedâlinen, and even the copper
                    pot in which their food was stewed; and she had no more pearls.</p>
                <p>Pippa had nothing either of her beauty left but her straight brows and her big,
                    lustrous eyes. She was no longer even a bright bubble, as the field poppy was.
                    She was a little dusky peasant, pale and starved, and blown amongst the snow
                    like a frozen redbreast.</p>
                <p>âIt is the pictures that he cares for,â she had learned to say to herself. She
                    had found his out. She got to hate them, the senseless things of wood and
                    colour, that cost so much money, and now had all his looks, all his longings,
                    all his memories, all his regrets.</p>
                <p>She hated even those canvas likenesses of herself, that had blossomed into being
                    with the<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7155-095"/> purple beanflowers, under the summer
                    suns of Signa, when their passion was newâborn.</p>
                <p>Pippa loved her lover with the same love, fierce, and faithful, and dogâlike, and
                    measureless, as when he had first taken her small head within his hands, and
                    kissed her on the eyes and mouth.</p>
                <p>But it was a love that could understand nothing; least of all, change.</p>
                <p>One day, in the bitterness of the midâwinter, after weeks of hunger, and the
                    shameful straits of the small debts that make the commonest acts and needs of
                    daily life a byword and reproach, she woke to find herself alone.</p>
                <p>There were twenty gold pieces on the bed, long stript of all its covering, and a
                    written line or two. She took the paper to the woman of the house below, who
                    read it to her. It hold her that he was gone to Dresden to copy a famous picture
                    for a wealthy man; he sent her all the sum they had advanced him, and said a
                    little phrase or two of sorrow and of parting, and of hope of better days, and
                    of the unbearable pain of such beggary as they had<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7155-096"/> known. He spoke vaguely of some union in the
                    future.</p>
                <p>Pippa cast the twenty gold pieces into the mud of the street, where the poor
                    scrambled and clutched and fought for them. She understood that she was
                    forsaken.</p>
                <p>All he had said was true; but the great truth was what he had not said. Pippa was
                    ignorant of almost everything; but this she knew enough to know.</p>
                <p>That night they took her to a madhouse, and cut close the long brown braids of
                    her hair, and fastened together the feet that had used to fly, as the wind
                    flies, through the paths of the vines in summer.</p>
                <p>Poor Pippa! She had always plaited ill; the women had always said so.</p>
                <p>In halfâaâyearâs time she gave birth to a child, and her reason came back to her,
                    and after a time they let her go. She promised to go to her own country.</p>
                <p>But she cheated them, and went to Dresden. She had kept that name in her mind.
                    She got there as best she could, begging on the way or<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7155-097"/> working; but of work she knew so little, and of
                    workers there were so many. She carried the child all the way. Sometimes people
                    were good to her; sometimes they were bad; oftenest they were neither one nor
                    the other. Indifference is the invincible giant of the world.</p>
                <p>When she reached Dresden it was summer. The city was empty.</p>
                <p>With much trouble she heard of him. The copy was done, and he was gone back to
                    France.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps he does not want you. If he wanted you he would not leave you,â said a
                    comely woman, who was sorry for her, but who spoke as she thought, giving her a
                    roll of bread under a tree in the street.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps he does not want me,â thought Pippa. The words awoke her memory. She had
                    been left by him. He would not have left her unless he had been tiredâtired of
                    all the poverty and pain, and of the passion that had lost its glow, as the
                    poppy loses its colour once being reaped with the wheat.</p>
                <p>There was a dull fierce pain in her. There were times when she wished to kill
                    him. Then<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7155-098"/> at other times she would see a look
                    of his face in the childâs and would break into an anguish of weeping.</p>
                <p>Anyway, she set backward to find him.</p>
                <p>Carrying the child, that grew heavier with each day, and travelling sometimes
                    with gipsies and vagrants, and mountebanks, but more often alone, and begging
                    her bread on the way, she got back into France after many months. She had got
                    stupid and stunned with fatigue and with pain. She had lost all look of youth,
                    but she kept the child as fresh as a rose; and now and then she would smile,
                    because his mouth laughed like her loverâs.</p>
                <p>Back into Paris she went. The strange fortunes that shelter the wretched kept her
                    in health and strength, though she rarely had a roof over her at night, and all
                    she ate were the broken pieces that people gave her in pity.</p>
                <p>In his old haunts it was easy to hear of him; he had gone to study in Rome.</p>
                <p>âHe will do well for himself, never fear,â they said in the old house on the
                    Seine water, where her dream of joy had dreamt itself away. Some<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7155-099"/> great person, touched by his poverty and genius, and
                    perhaps by his beauty, had given him the means to pursue the high purposes of
                    his art at leisure. Some said the great person was a woman, and a princess: no
                    one knew for sure. Anyhow, he was gone to Rome.</p>
                <p>Pippa knew the name of Rome.</p>
                <p>People had gone through Signa sometimes, to wind away by the sea road, amongst
                    the marshes and along the flat sickly shores, to Rome. And now and then through
                    Signa, at fair time, or on feast days, there had strayed little children, in
                    goatskins, and with strange pipes, who played sad airs, and said they were from
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>But the mountains had always risen between her and Rome. It had always been to
                    her far off as some foreign land. Nevertheless, she set out for Rome by the sole
                    way she knewâthe way that she had travelled with himâstraight across France and
                    downward to the sea, and along the beautiful bold road, under the palm trees and
                    the sea alps, and so along the Corniche back to Signa.</p>
                <pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7155-100"/>
                <p>She knew that way; and toilsome though it was, it was made sweet to her by
                    remembered joys.</p>
                <p>He had gone with her; and at every halting place there was some memory so
                    precious, yet so terrible, that it would have been death to her, only the child
                    was there, and wanted her, and had his smile, and so held her on to life.</p>
                <p>Her lover had been with her in the summer and autumn weather; and all the way had
                    been made mirthful with loveâs happy foolish ways; and the dust of the road had
                    been as gold to her, because of the sweet words he murmured in her ear: and when
                    they were tired they had leaned in one anotherâs arms, and been at rest; and
                    every moonlit night and rosy morning had been made beautiful, because of what
                    they read in each otherâs eyes and heard in the beating of each otherâs
                    hearts.</p>
                <p>Pippa had forgotten nothing; she had only forgotten that she had been
                    forsaken.</p>
                <p>Women are so slow to understand this always; and she, since that day when she had
                    flung the money in the street, and fallen like a furious thing, biting the dust,
                    and laughing horribly, had never been too clear of what had happened to her.</p>
                <pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7155-101"/>
                <p>There was the child, and heâher loveâwas lost. This was all she knew.</p>
                <p>Only she remembered every trifle, every moment of their first love time; and as
                    she went, walking across great countries as other women cross a hayfield or a
                    village street, she would look at the roseâbush at a cabin door, and think how
                    he had plucked a rosebud there; or touch a gate rail with her lips, because his
                    hand had rested on it; or lift the child to kiss a wayside crucifix, because he
                    had hung a rope of woodbine there and painted it one noonday; and at each step
                    would murmur to the child, âSee, he was hereâand hereâand hereâand here,â and
                    would fancy that the baby understood, and slept the sweeter because told these
                    things.</p>
                <p>Poor Pippa!âshe had always plaited ill.</p>
                <p>Women do, whose only strand is one short human love.</p>
                <p>The tress will run uneven; and no man wants it long. Still, it is best to love
                    thus. For nothing else is Love.</p>
                <p>So she had walked on, till the golden autumn<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7155-102"/>
                    weather lost its serenity, and stirred with strife of winter wind and rain; so
                    she had walked, and walked, and walkedâa beggar girl for all who met her, with
                    no beauty in her, except her great, sad, lustrous eyesâuntil she found herself
                    come out once more on that familiar road which she had trodden daily in her
                    childhood and her girlhood, with her hank of straw over her arm, and a pitcher
                    of milk, or a sheaf of gleaned corn, or a broad basket of mulberries balanced on
                    her head.</p>
                <p>She thought she would see Brunoâjust once. He had been rough and fierce with her;
                    but once she could have loved Bruno, if he would have let her do so. She thought
                    she would show him the child, and ask himâif she never got to Romeâ</p>
                <p>Then her foot slipped, and she fell down into darkness, and of Pippa there was no
                    more on earthâonly a dead woman, that the flood took out, with the drowned
                    cattle and the driftwood, to the sea.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                <p><hi>LOCAL</hi> tradition has it that all this plain of Signa was once a lake with
                    only the marsh birds calling and the reeds waving in the great silence of its
                    watersâlong ago. Their âlong agoâ is very dim in date and distance, but very
                    clear to fancy and to faith. Here Ãneas is a hero born only yesterday, and
                    Catiline brought his secret sins into the refuge of these hills an hour since
                    its seems; and Herculesâone can almost see him still, bending his bold brows
                    over the stubborn rock in that stream where the quail dips her wing and the
                    distaff cane bends to the breeze.</p>
                <p>Nay, it is not so very far away after all since the dove plucked the olive off
                    the mounâ<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7155-104"/> tains yonder, and no one sees
                    anything strange in the stories that make the sons of Enoch and the children of
                    Latona tread these fields side by side, and the silver arrows of Apollo cleave
                    the sunshine that the black crucifixes pierce. Nay, older than tale of the Dove
                    or legend of Apollo is this soil. Turn it with your spade and you shall find the
                    stone coffins and the gold chains of the mighty Etruscan race whose buried
                    cities lie beneath your feet, their language and their history lost in the
                    everlasting gloom.</p>
                <p>This was once Etruria, in all the grace and greatness of her royalties; then
                    through long ages the land was silent, and only heard the kite shriek or the
                    mountain hare scream; then fortified places rose again, one by one, on the green
                    slopes, and Florence set to work and built between her and the seaâbetween her
                    and the coast, and all her many enemies and debtsâthe walled city of Lastra
                    Signa; making it noble of its kind, as she made everything that she touched in
                    the old time; giving it a girdle of the massive, grey mountain stone, and<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7155-105"/> gateways with carven shields and frescoes;
                    and houses within, braced with iron, and ennobled by bold archways and poetised
                    by many a shrine and symbol.</p>
                <p>And the Lastra stood in the green country that is called the Verdure even in the
                    dry city rolls, and saw the spears glisten among the vines, and the steel
                    headâpieces shine through the olives, and the banners flutter down from the
                    heights, and the condottieri wind away on the white road, and the long lines of
                    the pilgrims trail through the sunshine, and the scarlet pomp of the cardinals
                    burn on the highway, and the great lords with their retinues ride to the sea or
                    the mountains, and the heralds and trumpeters come and go on their message of
                    peace or strife; and itself held the road when need arose, staunchly, through
                    many a dark day, and many a bitter night, for many a tale of years, and kept its
                    warders on the watchâtowers, looking westward through the centuries of war. And
                    then the hour of fate struck when the black eagle, who has âtwo beaks to more
                    devour,â flew with his heavy wing over the Arno; and the Republic had no help
                        or<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7155-106"/> hope but in Gideon, as she called
                    him:âfrank Ferruccio.</p>
                <p>Ferruccio knew that the Lastra was the iron key to the gates of Florence. But he
                    had no gifts of gods to make him omniscient, and he was rash, as brave men are
                    most apt to be. With his five hundred troopers he wrought miracles from of
                    valour and of relief, but in a fatal hour he, scouting the country to search the
                    convoys of food that he conveyed to Florence, left the Lastra for Pisa, and the
                    traitor Bandini whispered in the ear of Orange, âStrike nowâwhile he is absent.â
                    And Orange sent his Spanish lances and the Lastra beat them back. But he sent
                    them again as many in numbers against the place as well as all Ferruccioâs army,
                    and with artillery to aid, and they made two breeches in the walls, and entered
                    and sacked and pillaged, and ravished and slew; the bold gates standing erect as
                    they stand toâday.</p>
                <p>Is not the record painted in the Hall of Leo the Tenth?</p>
                <p>The brave gates stood erect, but the Lastra was an armed town no more.</p>
                <pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7155-107"/>
                <p>Its days of battle were done.</p>
                <p>The grass and the green creepers grew on the battlements; and out of the iron
                    doors there only passed the meek oxen and the mules and the sheep.</p>
                <p>The walls of the Lastra are very old, and are still beautiful. Broken down also
                    in many places, and with many places where are hillocks of grass and green
                    bushes instead of the old mighty stones, or, worse still, mean houses and tiled
                    roofs. But they are still erect in a great part and very picturesque, with the
                    ropemakers at work on the sward underneath them, and the white bullocks coming
                    out of their open doors. The portcullis still hangs in the gateways that face
                    the east and the west, and the deep machicolations of the battlements are sharp
                    and firm as a lionâs teeth. There is exquisite colour in them, and noble lines
                    severe and stern as any that Arnolfo drew, or raised. âShe is so oldâour
                    Lastra!â say the people, with soft pride, while the women sit and spin on the
                    stairs of the old watchâtowers, and the mules drink, and the waggons pass, and
                    the sheep are driven under their pointed archways.</p>
                <pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7155-108"/>
                <p>Of the Lastra it may be written, as of the old tower of Calais church:ââIt is not
                    as ruins are, useless and piteous, feebly or fondly garrulous of better days;
                    but useful still, going through its daily work as some old fisherman beaten grey
                    by storm yet drawing his daily nets.â Its years of war indeed are done; it can
                    repel no foeâit can turn aside no invader; the wallâsorrel grows on its
                    parapets, the owl builds in its loopholes, the dust of decay lies thick upon its
                    broken stairs; in its fortified places old women spin flax and the spiders their
                    webs; but its decay is not desolation, its silence is not solitude; its sadness
                    is not despair; the Ave Maria echoes through it morning and night; when the warm
                    sunrise smites the battlements, its people go forth to the labour of the soil;
                    when the rays of the sunset fill the west, there rises from its mountains a
                    million spears of gold, as though the hosts of a conquering army raised them
                    aloft with a shout of triumph; it garners its living people still as sheep
                    within a foldââits bells for prayer still rolling through its rents.â Harvest
                    and vintage and seedâtime are precious to it: fruits of the earth are<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7155-109"/> brought within it; the vine is green against its
                    doors, and the corn is threshed in its ancient armouries; beautiful even where
                    unsightly; hoary with age, yet linked with living youth; noble as a bare sea
                    cliff is noble, that has kept the waves at bay throughout uncounted storms, the
                    Lastra stands amidst the green billows of the foliage of the fields as a
                    lighthouse amongst breakers; its towers speaking of strength, its fissures of
                    sorrow, its granaries of labour, its belfries of hope.</p>
                <p>When a great service was over, and the bishop and the nobles had passed away in
                    their glory, and the bells had ceased for a season to ring, and the whiteârobed
                    contadini had gone up amongst their hills, and the families of Lastra had gone
                    within doors and closed their windowâshutters to the sun, the little singer, who
                    loved every stone of the old place, laying off his little surplice, and by a
                    rare treat being free of task and punishment, and sent only to gather salads
                    from the hill garden of his one friend, made his way quickly through the
                    village, and out by the western gate.</p>
                <pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7155-110"/>
                <p>Just a child of Pippaâsâwith no name or use or place or title that anyone could
                    see, or right to live at all, if you pushed matters closely.</p>
                <p>That was all he wasâa child of Pippaâs, who had died without a coin upon her, or
                    a roof she could call her own, or anything at all in this wide world except this
                    little sunnyâheaded, softâlimbed, useless thing, fresh as dew and flushed like
                    appleâblossoms, that she left behind her, as the magnoliaâleaf, dropping brown,
                    to the brown earth, leaves a blossom.</p>
                <p>Himself, he did not know even as much as this, which indeed was as bad as nothing
                    to know. To himself he was only a foundling, as he was to everyone else; picked
                    up as any blind puppy might have been, motherless, on the face of the flood.</p>
                <p>The old white town had stood him in the stead of father and mother, and nation
                    and friends; and though the Church, purifying him with baptismal water, had
                    given him a long saintâs name, Signa was his true eponymus.</p>
                <p>The children had called him Signa, because of the name on the little gilt ball
                    that they were<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7155-111"/> scratched onâthe little gilt
                    ball which Nita had hung round his neck by its string again.</p>
                <p>âIt looks well to give it to him,â she had said to her husband. âAnd it would
                    fetch so little, it is not worth keeping for oneself.â</p>
                <p>So his little locket had been left himâthe locket that had been bought that day
                    of the fair, and filled with a curl of sunnyâbrown hair, which Pippa had cut off
                    herself in the dusk where the vines met overhead;âand he was called after the
                    word that was on it, first by the children, and then by their elders, who had
                    said, âAs well that as any name, why not? the dogs of Jews are often called
                    after the towns that bear them; why not this little cur, so near drowned here,
                    after the place that sheltered him?â</p>
                <p>Hence he was Signa, like the town; and in a vague fancy that he never followed
                    out; he had some dim idea that this village of the Lastra, which he loved so
                    dearly, had created him; out of her dust, or from her wandering winds, or by her
                    bidding to the owls that roosted in her battlements: how he did not know, but in
                    some way. And he was thoroughly content; loving<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7155-112"/> the place with a great love quite reasonless, and quite childlike, and yet
                    immeasurable.</p>
                <p>He was proud because he had the name. Whey they beat him, he would not cry out,
                    because the Lastra had been brave; so the old people who told stories of it to
                    him said; and he would be brave likewise.</p>
                <p>It was like his impudence to dare be brave when honestâborn children squealed
                    like caught mice! so Nita would say to him a score of times, slapping his cheek
                    when Toto had trodden on her gown, or beating him with the rods of alder when
                    Toto had stolen the fritters from the fryingâpan.</p>
                <p>âShe is a good woman, Nita,â said the neighbours, shaking out the gleaned hay
                    before their houseâdoors, or sitting to plait together in the archways; âand
                    Lippo is an angel. To think of themâseven children, and an eight nighâand
                    keeping, all for charity, that little stray thing found at the flood. Any one
                    else had sent it packing, a poor child, as one could tell by its clothes that
                    were all rags, and no chance for any rich folk ever coming after it. And yet
                        treating<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7155-113"/> it always like their own, share
                    and share alike, and no preference shownâah, they were good people. Old Baldo,
                    too, not saying even a word, though he was a sharp man about shoeâleather, and
                    no blame to him, because, after all, who will save the skin of your onion for
                    you unless you do it yourself?â</p>
                <p>As from a baby it grew into a little child, Bruno ever and again saw to its
                    wants.</p>
                <p>âThe child must be clean,â he had said; and he would not have it go in rags.</p>
                <p>âThe child must be well kept,â he had said; and he would not have its curls
                    shaved close, as Totoâs was.</p>
                <p>Then as it grew older.</p>
                <p>âLet the child learn,â he had said; and Nita humoured him, because she believed
                    it to be his own offspring, and Lippo, because of that good half of everything,
                    which kept his fatherâinâlaw in such good humour, and left himself free to idle
                    in the sun, and lie face downward on the stone benches, and do nothing all day
                    long except kill flies.</p>
                <p>So Lippo and his wife were very careful to<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7155-114"/> have
                    the childâs curls shine, instead of shearing them close as they did their own
                    babiesâ, and when he ran into the street would give him a big lump of crust to
                    eat as people passed, and on saint days take him with them to the church in a
                    little frock snowâwhite, like one of the straightârobed, longâhaired,
                    childâfigures in any panel or predella of Della Francesca or the Memmi. He was
                    so pretty that people gave him cakes and fruits and money, just for the beauty
                    of his wistful eyes, and to see his little mouth, like a carnation bud, open to
                    sing his Aves.</p>
                <p>And of course there was reason that the child, once home, should give up the
                    cakes and fruits to the other children who were like fosterâbrothers and sisters
                    to him, and as for the money, of course he could not keep it, being such a
                    little thing; they took it from his to take care of itâthey were good, honest
                    people.</p>
                <p>As for the little lad, true he was hungry often, and beaten often, when no one
                    was looking, and worked like a footsore mule at all times.</p>
                <p>But then nobody noticed that, because he was always taken to mass, and had the
                    little white<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7155-115"/> shirt on just like Toto, and no
                    difference made, and all his curls brushed out. The curateâs sister said there
                    never was so sweet a soul as Lippoâs, for of course it all was Lippoâs doing;
                    Nita was an honest woman, and trueâhearted; but Lippo it was that was the saint
                    in the house. Another man would have turned the brat out by the ears first
                    sight: not heâhe cut the stray childâs bread as big as any of his boysâ, and
                    paid for him, too, to learn his letters.</p>
                <p>So the curateâs sister said, the neighbours said after her; and Lippo, being a
                    meek man, smiled gently, and cast his eyes down underneath the praise, and said
                    in answer, that no one could have turned a pretty baby like that out after once
                    housing it, and added, with a kindly grace that moved the women to tears, that
                    he hoped the child might be like those goldâwinged porcellini that, flying in
                    your window with the sunbeams, bring good will and peace, the people say.</p>
                <p>This day, after the ceremony, the little fellow ran over the bridge and up the
                    hillâroad, where his mother, of whom he knew nothing, had met<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7155-116"/> her death. He was stiff with a severe beating that
                    had been given him.</p>
                <p>The night before there had been a basket of red cherries missing, and Toto had
                    been found crunching them in the loft, and Toto had said that he had been given
                    them by Signa, who first had eaten half; and old Baldo, who had got them as a
                    present for the priest, had been beside himself with rage, and Nita had beaten
                    Signa, as her habit and daily comfort was, because he never would cry out, which
                    made him the more provoking, and also was always innocent, than which there is
                    nothing more irritating anywhere.</p>
                <p>He was very stiff, and felt it now that the music was all done; but almost forgot
                    it again in the pleasure of the hillâside and the holyday.</p>
                <p>The country was full of joys to the child that he never reasoned about, but which
                    filled him with delight. The great bold curves of the oak bough overhead; the
                    amethyst and amber of the trefoil blossoms; the voices of the wood doves; the
                    jovial croakings of the frogs; the flash of butterflies; the glories of the
                    oleanders here, white as snow, and there rosily radiant as flame;<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7155-117"/> the poppies that had cast their petals, and had round
                    grey heads like powdered wings; the spiders, red and black, like bits of old
                    Egyptian pottery; the demure and dusky cavaletti, that looked like ghosts of
                    nuns, out by an error in the daylight; the pretty lizards that were so happy
                    asking nothing of the world except a sunbeam and a stone to sleep under; the
                    nightingales that were so tame, and sang at broad noontide to laugh at poets;
                    the orchids, gold and ruby, the mimicked bees and flies to make fun of them,
                    because there is so much humour in nature with all her sweet seriousness of
                    beauty; the flies that shone like jewels; the hedges of china roses that ran
                    between the corn; the gaunt stern spikes of the artichokes; the green Madonnaâs
                    herb; the mountains that were sometimes quite lost in the white mists, and then
                    of a sudden lifted themselves in all their glory, with black shadows where the
                    woods were, and hazy breadths of colour where the bare marble shone beneath the
                    sun;âall these things, so various, great and small, wonderful and obscure, under
                    his feet, or on the far horizon, were sources of<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7155-118"/> delight to the child, who as he went lost sight of nothing from the little
                    gemmed insect in the dust he trod to the last glow left on the faintest,
                    farthest peak of the great hills that rose between him and the sea.</p>
                <p>Nobody had ever told him anything.</p>
                <p>None had led him by the hand and bade him look.</p>
                <p>Some instinct moved him to see and hear where others were blind and deaf. That
                    was all.</p>
                <p>To the ploughman of Ayr the daisy was a tender grace of God, and the mouse a
                    fellow traveller in the ways of life.</p>
                <p>To Signa, who was only a baby still, and was beaten most days of the week, and
                    ran barefoot in the dust, the summer and the world were beautiful without his
                    knowing why, and comforted him. For in all the sea of sunshineâas in the
                    musicâhe forgot his pain.</p>
                <p>He ran like a little goat up the road with the green river winding below, and the
                    hills changing at each step with those inconstancies of light and shade, and
                    aspect, and colour in which all hills delight. It was an hour before, always<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7155-119"/> climbing steadily, he reached an old stone
                    gateway set in breadths of grain just golden for the sickle, with a black
                    crucifix against it, and above it a little framed picture of the
                    Annunciation.</p>
                <p>He stooped his knee, and crossed himself; then ran between the old stone posts,
                    which had no gate in them, and sent his voice up the hillâside before his feet.
                    âBruno! Bruno! Bruno!â</p>
                <p>âHere!â sang the manâs voice in answer from above, amongst the corn.</p>
                <p>Signa climbed the steep green patches that ran between the wheat and under the
                    vines up the face of the hill, and threw his arms round Brunoâs knees.</p>
                <p>âA whole day to spend!â he cried, breathless with running. âAnd are you working?
                    Why it is Corpus Domini. They do not work anywhere!â</p>
                <p>Bruno put down the handful of corn that he had just cut and wound together.</p>
                <p>âNo; one should not work,â he said, with some shame for his own industry. âBut
                    those clouds look angry; they may mean rain at sunset;<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7155-120"/> and to spoil such grain as thisâand the Padre will
                    not come this way; he never gets so far down on feasts. And you are well,
                    Signa?â</p>
                <p>âOh quite well.â</p>
                <p>âBut you must be hungry?ârunning so?â</p>
                <p>âNo; I can wait.â</p>
                <p>âYou have had your bread then?â</p>
                <p>âYes.â</p>
                <p>It was not true. But then Signa had found out two things: one, that when he told
                    Bruno that he was illâtreated or illâfed at home, there were quarrels and
                    troubles between Bruno and his brother; and the other, that if he let Bruno see
                    that he was at all unhappy, Bruno seemed to be consumed with selfâreproach. So
                    that the child whose single love, except that for the old town itself, was
                    Bruno, had early learned to hold his tongue and bear his sorrows silently as
                    best he might, and tell an innocent little lie even now and then to spare pain
                    to his friend.</p>
                <p>Bruno always took his part. It was Bruno who got him any little joy he ever knew,
                    and Bruno who would not let them shave his pretty clustering curls to make a
                    bare round pumpkin<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7155-121"/> of his head like Totoâs;
                    and one day when he had been only seven years old, and Bruno by chance had found
                    him crying, and learned that it was with the smart of Nitaâs thrashing, Bruno
                    and Lippo had had fierce words and blows; and late that night the eldest boy of
                    Lippoâs had come and shaken him in his bed of hay, and hissed savagely in his
                    ear:</p>
                <p>âYou little fool, if you go telling my uncle Bruno we illâtreat you, he will
                    strike at my father and kill him perhaps, who knows, he is so violent, and then
                    a nice dayâs work you will have made for every one;âyou little beast. My father
                    dead, and Bruno at the galleys, all through you who are not worth the rind of a
                    rotten melon, little cur!â</p>
                <p>And Signa, trembling in his bed, had vaguely understood the mischief he might do,
                    though why they quarrelled for him, and why Lippo gave him a home, and yet
                    illâtreated him, or why Bruno should have any care to take his part, he could
                    not tell; but he comprehended that all he had to do was to accept illâusage
                    dumbly, like the dogs, and bring none into any trouble<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7155-122"/> by complaining. And so he grew upâwith silence for a
                    habit: for he loved Bruno.</p>
                <p>Bruno, who was fierce and wayward and hated and feared by every one on the
                    country side, but who to him was gentle as a woman, and was always kind. Bruno,
                    who had a terrible knack of flashing out his knife in anger, and who had
                    quarrelled with all the women he had wooed, and who had a rough heartless way of
                    speech that made people wonder he could be of the same blood and bone as mild
                    and pleasant Lippo, but who to him was never without a grave soft smile that
                    took all the darkness from this face it shone on, and who for him had many
                    tender thoughts and acts that were like the blue radish flower on its rough,
                    grey, leafless stalk.</p>
                <p>The child never wondered why Bruno cared for him. Children take love as they take
                    sunshine and their daily bread. If it rain and they starve, then they wonder,
                    because children come into the world with an innocent undoubting conviction that
                    they will be happy in it, which is one of the oddest and the saddest things one
                    sees; for, being begotten by men and borne by<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7155-123"/>
                    women, how can any such strange error ever be alive in them?</p>
                <p>Bruno put by his reapingâhook, and let the big bearded turkish wheat stand over
                    for another day. He had risked his own soul to make sure of the wheatâfor to
                    Bruno it was a soulâs peril to use a sickle on a holy day;âbut he let go the
                    corn rather than spoil the little fellowâs pleasure.</p>
                <p>âYou can eat something againâcome,â he said, stretching his hand out to the
                    boyâs.</p>
                <p>Pippaâs child was like her, only with something spiritual and farâreaching in his
                    great dark eyes that hers had never had, and a gleam of gold in the soft
                    thickness of his hair that did not come from her. He was more delicate, more
                    slender, more like a little supple reed than Pippa ever had been, and he had a
                    more uncommon look about him; but he was like herâlike enough to make Bruno
                    still shudder now and then thinking of the dead woman left all alone to the rain
                    and to the river.</p>
                <p>âCome and eat,â he said, and took the child indoors.</p>
                <p>His house had a great arched door where<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7155-124"/> Pippa
                    had stood plaiting many a night. It had a brick floor and a ceiling of old
                    timbers, and some old dusky chests and presses that would have fetched a fortune
                    in city curiosity shops, and a strong musty smell of drying herbs and of piles
                    of peas and beans for winter uses, and trusses of straw cleaned and cut for the
                    plaiters; and hens were sitting on their eggs inside an old gilded marriage
                    coffer six hundred years old, if one, whose lid, that had dropped off the
                    hinges, was illuminated with the nuptials of Galileo in the style of the early
                    school of Cortona.</p>
                <p>Through a square unglazed window there was seen the head of a brindled cow
                    munching grass in her shed on the other side, and through a wide opening
                    opposite that had no door, the noon sun shining showed the great open building
                    that was granary and cartâshed, and stable and hothouse all in one, and where
                    the oilâpresses stood, and the vats for the wine, and the empty casks.</p>
                <p>Against one of the walls was a crucifix with a little basin for holy water, for
                    Bruno was a man who believed in the saints without question; and<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7155-125"/> above the arched entrance there grew a great
                    mulberryâtree that was never stripped, because he had no silkworms, and
                    magnolias and cistusâbushes, and huge poppies that loved to glow in the stones,
                    and big dragonâheads flaming like rubies, and arabian jessamine of divinest
                    odour, and big myrtles, all flourishing luxuriant alike together, because in
                    this country flowers have nine lives like cats, and will live anywhere, just
                    because no one wants them or ever thinks of gathering them unless there be a
                    corpse to be dressed.</p>
                <p>âEat,â said Bruno; and he got the little lad out some brown bread and a jug of
                    milk, and a cabbageâleaf of currants, which he had gathered early that morning
                    before the massâbells rang, being sure Signa would come before the day should be
                    over.</p>
                <p>Signa ate and drank with the eager goodwill of a child who never got enough,
                    except by some rare chance on a feastâday like this; but the larger part of the
                    currants he left on the leaf, taking only one or two bunches.</p>
                <p>Bruno watched him.</p>
                <pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7155-126"/>
                <p>âAre you going to give them away?â</p>
                <p>âI will give them to GemmaâI may?â</p>
                <p>âDo as you like with your own. But if you must give them to any one, give them to
                    Palma.â</p>
                <p>Signa coloured on both his little pale cheeks.</p>
                <p>âI will give them to the two,â he said, conscious of an unjust intention nipped
                    in the bud.</p>
                <p>âPalma is a better child than Gemma,â said Bruno, sharpening a vineâstake with
                    his claspâknife.</p>
                <p>Signa hung his head.</p>
                <p>âBut I like Gemma best.â</p>
                <p>âWhen that is said, there is no more to be said,â answered Bruno, who had learned
                    enough of human nature on the hills and in the Lastra to know that liking does
                    not go by reason nor follow after merit.</p>
                <p>âGemma is so pretty,â said the little fellow, who loved anything that had beauty
                    in it; and he ran and got his mandoline out of the corner where Bruno let him
                    keep it, and began to turn its keys and run his fingers over its strings and
                    call the cadence out of it with as light a heart<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7155-127"/> as if his back had never been black and blue with Nitaâs thrashing.</p>
                <p>âIf Gemma broke your chitarra, would you like her the better then?â asked
                    Bruno.</p>
                <p>âI would hate her,â said Signa under his breath; for he had two idolsâhis lute
                    and the Lastra.</p>
                <p>âI wish she would break it, then,â said Bruno, who was jealous of this little
                    child for whom Signa was saving his currants.</p>
                <p>But Signa did not hear. He was sitting out on the threshold of an empty red
                    lemonâpot turned upside down, with the slope of the autumn corn and the green
                    hillside beneath him in the sun, and beyond them, far down below in the great
                    valley, and golden in the light were first the walls of the Lastra set in the
                    sea of vines, and then the towers and domes of Florence far away; and farther
                    yet, where the east was warm with morning light, the mountains of Umbria, with
                    the little towns on their crest, from which you see two seas.</p>
                <p>With all that vast radiant world beneath him at his feet, Signa tuned his
                    mandoline and sang<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7155-128"/> to himself untired on the
                    still hillside. The cow leaned her mouth over the windowâsill, and listened;
                    cows seem so stupid, chewing grass and whisking flies away, but in their eyes
                    there is the soul of Io; the nightingales held their breaths to listen, and then
                    joined in till all the branches that they lived in seemed alive with sound; the
                    great white watchâdog from the marshes came and laid down quite quiet, blinking
                    solemnly with attentive eyes; but the cicali never stopped sawing like
                    carpenters in the treeâtops, nor the gossipping hens from clacking in the
                    cabbageâbeds, because cicali and chickens think the world was made for them, and
                    believe that the sun would fall if they ceased from fussing and fuming:âthey are
                    so very human.</p>
                <p>Bruno laid himself down face forward on a stone bench, as contadini love to do
                    when they have any leisure, and listened too, his head upon his arms.</p>
                <p>The water dropped from the wellâspout; a lemon fell with a little splash on the
                    grass; the big black restless bees buzzed here and there; blue butterflies
                    danced above the grain as if the<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7155-129"/> cornflowers
                    had risen winged; the swallows wheeled round the low redâtiled roof; the old
                    wooden plough lay in the shade under the figâtrees; the oxen ate clover and the
                    leaves of cane in fragrant darkness in their shed; the west wind came from the
                    pines above with the smell of the sea and the thyme and the rosemary.</p>
                <p>Signa played and sang, making up his song as he went along, in rhymes strung like
                    chains of daisies, all out of his own head, and born in a moment out of nothing,
                    and, beginning with the name of a flower, and winding in with the sun and the
                    shadow, the beasts and the birds, the restless bees and the ploughshare at rest,
                    and the full wheatâears and the empty wellâbucket, and anything and everything
                    little and large, and foolish and wise, that was there about him in the
                    midsummer light.</p>
                <p>Anywhere else it might have been strange for a little peasant to make melody so;
                    but here the children lisp in numbers, and up and down on the hills, and in the
                    road when the muleâbells ring, and on the high mountains with the browsing
                    goats, the verse and song of the<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7155-130"/> people fill
                    the air all day longâthis people who for the world have no poet.</p>
                <p>Bruno, lying face downward and listening, half asleep, to the rippling music,
                    thought it pretty, but nothing rare or of wonder; the little lad played better
                    than most of his age, and had a gift for stringing his rhymes, that was all.</p>
                <p>For himself, he was almost jealous of the lute as he was of the child Gemma. For
                    Bruno loved the boy with a covetous love and a strong love, and felt as if in
                    some way or other Signa had escaped him.</p>
                <p>The boy was loving, obedient, grateful, full of caressing and tractable ways;
                    there was no fault to find with him; but Bruno at times felt that he held him no
                    more surely than one holds a bird because it alights at oneâs feet.</p>
                <p>It was a vague feeling with him. Bruno, being an unlearned man, did not reason
                    about his impressions nor seek to know whether they were even wise ones. But it
                    was a strong feeling with him, and something in the farâaway<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7155-131"/> look of the little ladâs eyes as he sang,
                    strengthened it.</p>
                <p>Pippa had never had that look; no one had it except the little Christs or St.
                    Johns sometimes in the old frescoes in the churches that Bruno would enter once
                    a year or so, when he went to Prato or Carmignano or Pistoia to buy grain or to
                    sell it.</p>
                <p>âThat is God looking out of the eyes,â an old sacristan here said once to him,
                    before one of those altar pictures, where the wonderful faces were still radiant
                    amidst the fading colours of the ageâclad frescoes.</p>
                <p>But why should God look out of the eyes of Pippaâs child?</p>
                <p>Why was God in him more than in any others?</p>
                <p>Those children in the frescoes were most fitting in their place, no doubt,
                    amongst the incense, and the lilies, and the crosses, and above the sacred Host.
                    But to sit at your bench, and eat beans, and be sent to fetch in sheep from the
                    hills;âBruno felt that a more workaday soul was better for this, he would have
                    been more at ease if Signa<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7155-132"/> had been just a
                    noisy, idle, troublesome, merry morsel, playing more like other boys, and happy
                    over a baked goose on a feastâday. He would have known better how to deal with
                    him.</p>
                <p>And yet not for worlds would he have changed him.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                <p><hi>IF</hi> Pippa had not been quite dead that night when they had found her in
                    the fields? If here had been any spark of life flickering in her that with
                    warmth and care and a surgeonâs skill might have been fanned back again into a
                    steady stream? It was not likely; but it was possible. And if it had been so,
                    then what were he and Lippo?</p>
                <p>The sickly thought of it came upon him many a time and made him shiver and turn
                    cold. When he had left the woman lying in the field he had been quite sure that
                    all life was gone out of her. But now he was not so sure. Cold and the fall
                    might have made her senseless. Who could tell?âif they had done their duty by
                    herâPippa might have been living now.</p>
                <pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7155-134"/>
                <p>It was not probable. He knew the touch of a dead thing, and she had felt to him
                    dead as any slaughtered sheep could be. But sometimes, in the long lonely nights
                    of autumn, when he sat watching his grapes, with the gun against his knee, lest
                    thieves should strip the vines, Bruno would think of it, and say to himselfââIf
                    she were not really dead, what was I?â</p>
                <p>He told all to the good priest in the little brown church beneath the vines on
                    his hill; told it all under the seal of confession, and the priest absolved him
                    by reason of his true penitence and anxious sorrow. But Bruno could not absolve
                    himself.</p>
                <p>He had left her there for the flood to take her;âand after all she might have
                    been brought back to life, had he lifted her up on his shoulders and borne her
                    down in to shelter and warmth, instead of deserting her there like a coward.</p>
                <p>The water had done it; had washed her away out of sight and killed her if she
                    were not already dead when it rose, and swept her out to the secrecy of the deep
                    seas. But he told himself, at<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7155-135"/> times, that it
                    was he who was the murdererânot the water.</p>
                <p>When he looked at the river shining away between the green hills and the grey
                    olives, he felt as if it knew his guilt, as if it were a fellow sinner with him,
                    only the more innocent of the two. Of course the pain and the remorse of it were
                    not always on him. He led an active life; he was always working at something or
                    another, from daybreak till night; the free fresh air blew always about him, and
                    blew morbid fancies from his brain. But at times, when all was quiet, in the
                    hush of midnight, or when he rested from his labours at sunset, and all the
                    world was gold and rose, then he thought of Pippa; then he felt the cold,
                    pulseless breast underneath his hand; then he said to himselfââIf she were not
                    quite dead?â The torment of the thought worked in him and weighed on him, and
                    made his heart yearn to the little lad, who, but for his cowardice, might not
                    now have been motherless and alone.</p>
                <p>Bruno sat on at his house door that night, watching the little lad run along the
                    hill. He<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7155-136"/> could see all the way down the slope,
                    and though the trees and the vines at times hid Signa from sight, and at times
                    he was lost in the wheat, which was taller than he, yet at intervals, the small
                    flying figure with the sunset about its hair, could be seen going down, down,
                    down along the great slope, and Bruno watched it with a troubled fondness in his
                    eyes.</p>
                <p>He was doing the best for the child that he knew. He had him taught to read and
                    write; he had him sing for the priests; he was learning the ways of the fields,
                    and the needs of beasts, tending his sheep and Lippoâs by turns, as a little
                    contadino had to do in the simple life of the open air. he could not tell what
                    more to do for him; he a peasant himself and the son of many generations of
                    peasants, who had worked here one after another on the great green hill above
                    the Lastra valley.</p>
                <p>He did not know what else to do.</p>
                <p>That was the way he had been brought up, except that he had never been taught a
                    letter; running with bare legs over the thyme on the hills, and watching the
                    sheep on the high places amongst<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7155-137"/> the gorze,
                    and pattering through the dirt after the donkey, when there were green things to
                    go into market, or loads of fir cones to be carried, or sacks of corn to be
                    borne to the grinding press. If there was a better way to bring up a child he
                    did not know it. And yet he was not altogether sure that Pippa, if she saw, from
                    heaven, was satisfied.</p>
                <p>The child was thinner than he liked, and his shirt was all holes, and never a
                    little beggar was poorer clad than was Signa winter and summer; and Bruno knew
                    that he gave into Lippoâs pocket more than enough to keep a child well, for his
                    land was rich, and he laboured hard, and he bore with Lippoâs coming and going,
                    and prying and calculating always to make sure how much the grain yielded, and
                    to count the figs and potatoes, and to watch the winepress, and to see how the
                    peas yielded, and to satisfy himself that he always got the full amount they had
                    agreed for; he bore with all that from Lippo, though it was enough to exasperate
                    a quieter man, and many a time he could have kicked his brother out of his
                    fields for all that meddling and<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7155-138"/> measuring;
                    and being an impatient temper and resentful, chafed like a tethered mastiff, to
                    have Nita and her brood clamouring for roots and salads and eggs and buckwheat,
                    as if he were a slave for them.</p>
                <p>âThe half of all I get,â he had said in the rash haste of his repentance and
                    remorse; and Lippo pinned him to his word.</p>
                <p>He would have given the world that instead of that mad bargain made without
                    thought, he had taken the child to himself wholly and told the truth in the
                    Lastra, and given the poor dead body burial, and been free to do with Pippaâs
                    boy whatever he chose. But Bruno, like many others, had fallen by fear and haste
                    into a false way; and stumbled on in it galled and entangled.</p>
                <p>Bruno was now over forty years old, and his country folk spoke more ill of him
                    rather than less. When he went down into the Lastra to sit and take a sup of
                    wine, and play a game at dominoes as other men did, none were glad to see him.
                    The women owed him a grudge because he married none of them, and the men thought
                    him fierce and quarrelsome, when he was not taciturn,<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7155-139"/> and found that he spoiled mirth rather than increased
                    it by his presence.</p>
                <p>He was a handsome man still, and lithe, and burnt brown as a nut by the sun. He
                    wore a loose shirt, open at the throat, and in winter he had a long brown cloak
                    tossed across from one shoulder to the other. He had bare feet, and the walk of
                    a mountaineer or an athlete. Marching beside his bullocks, with a cartâload of
                    hay, or going down the river for fish, with his great net outspread on its
                    circular frame, he was a noble, serious, majestic figure, and had a certain half
                    wild, half lordly air about him that is not uncommon to the Tuscan peasant when
                    he lives far enough from the cities not to be contaminated by them.</p>
                <p>The nine years that had run by since the night of the flood, had darkened Brunoâs
                    name in the Lastra country.</p>
                <p>Before that night he had been, whatever other faults or vices he had had,
                    openhanded to a degree most rare amongst his people. A man that he had struck to
                    the ground one day, he would open his leathern bag of coppers to the next.
                        Whatever<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7155-140"/> other his crimes, he had always
                    been generous, to utter improvidence, which is so strange a thing in his nation,
                    that he was often nicknamed a madman for it. But no one quarrels with a madness
                    that they profit by, and Brunoâs generosity had got him forgiven many a misdeed
                    and many a license, by men and women.</p>
                <p>Since the flood, little by little, parsimony growing on him with each year, he
                    had become careful of spending, quick to take his rights, and slow to fling down
                    money for menâs sport or womenâs kisses. The country said that Bruno was
                    altogether given over to the devil, he was no longer good to get gain out of
                    even; he had turned niggard, and there was no excuse for him, they averred; a
                    better padrone no man worked under than he, and his fattore was old and easy;
                    and the land that in the old time had served to maintain his father and mother
                    with a tribe of children to eat them out of house and home, now had only himself
                    upon it, good land and rich, and sheltered though on the mountains, whilst, as
                    every one knows, the higher the land lies the better is the vintage. Men
                        gossipping<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7155-141"/> in the evenings under the old
                    gateways of the Lastra, watching Bruno with his empty bullockâcart go back
                    between the hedges to the bridge, would shake their heads:â</p>
                <p>âA bad fellow!â said Momo, the barber, for Bruno never came to have his head
                    shaved as clean Christians should in summer, but wore his thick dusky mane
                    tossed back much like a lionâs.</p>
                <p>âBrutal bad!â echoed Papuccio, who was a tailor, with slack work. âNo doubt that
                    little flyâblow is his own, and see how he fathers it on Lippo. Lippo has as
                    good as told me it was that poor Fritaâs child by Bruno; you remember her, a
                    pretty young girl, died of a ball in the throatâor they said soâvery likely it
                    was Bruno, that wrung her neck in a rageâI should not wonder. He would have left
                    the boy to starve, only Lippo took it home, and shamed him.â</p>
                <p>âHe is good to the child now,â said NoÃ«, the tinman, who had a weakness for
                    seeing both sides of a question, which made him very disagreeable company.</p>
                <p>âOh hi!â demured the barber, with his<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7155-142"/> underâlip
                    out in dubious reply. âThe other day the little lad was bathing with my
                    youngster, and I saw his back all blue and brown with bruises. âIs he such a bad
                    child you beat him so?â I said to Lippo, for indeed he was horrid to look at,
                    and Lippo, good man, looked troubled. âBruno will be violent,â he told me quite
                    reluctantly, âhe forgets the child is small.â Oh, I daresay he does forget, and
                    when he has him alone there flays him of half his skin!â</p>
                <p>âWhy say the child was Brunoâs or Fritaâs, either. He was found in the fields at
                    the great flood, and Frita was dead a year before,â said NoÃ«, who had that
                    awkward and unsocial quality, a memory. âNot but what I daresay it is Brunoâs,
                    and perhaps he pays for it,â he added with an afterthought, willing to be
                    popular.</p>
                <p>âNo, not a stiver,â said the barber. âLippo and Nita have said to me a score of
                    times, âwe took the boy from pity, and we keep it from pity. Not a pinâs worth
                    shall we ever see back again this side heaven. But what matter that. When we
                    feed eight mouths it is not much to feed a ninth.â They are good people, Lippo
                    and his wife.â</p>
                <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7155-143"/>
                <p>âGood as gold,â said Brizzo, the butcher, âand saving money, or I suppose it is
                    old Baldoâs; they have bought that little pasture up at Santa Lucia; a snug
                    little place, and twenty little Maremma sheep upon it as fat as I ever put a
                    knife into;âLippo has Godâs grace.â</p>
                <p>âA fair spoken man always, and good company,â said Momo, who had shaved him bare
                    and smooth as a melon that very morning.</p>
                <p>This was the general opinion in the Lastra. Lippo who had always a soft smart
                    word for everybody; who smiled so on people who knew he hated them, that they
                    believed they were loved whilst he was smiling; who was always ready for a nice
                    game at dominoes or cards, and if he did cheat a little, did it so well that no
                    one could fail to respect him the more for it; Lippo was well spoken of by his
                    townsfolk, and one of the Council of the Misericordia had been often heard to
                    say that there was not a better man in all the province.</p>
                <p>But Bruno, now that he chose to save money, was a very son of the fiend without a
                    spot of light anywhere. Now that he would never drink,<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7155-144"/> and now that he would never marry, the Lastra gave
                    him over to Satan, body and soul, and for all time.</p>
                <p>Bruno cared nothing at all. They might split their throats for any notice that he
                    took.</p>
                <p>âIll words, rot no wheat,â he would say to his one friend, Cecco, the cooper; who
                    lived across by the bridge, and had a workshop there, with a great open arch of
                    the thirteenth century sculpture, and a square window with crossed bars of iron,
                    and a screen of vineâfoliage behind it that might have been the background of a
                    pietÃ âso beautiful was it when the sun shone through the leaves.</p>
                <p>He went on his own ways, ploughing with his oxen, pruning his olives, sowing and
                    reaping, and making the best of his land, and going down on market days into the
                    city, looking as if he had stepped out of Ghirlandaioâs panels, but himself
                    knowing nothing of that, nor thinking of anything except the samples of grain in
                    his palm or the cabbages in his cart.</p>
                <p>Bruno earned nothing for other folksâ opinions.<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7155-145"/>
                    What he cared for was to keep faith with Pippa in that mute compact born of his
                    remorse, which he firmly believed the saints had witnessed on her behalf.</p>
                <p>He had cared nothing for the child at first, but as it had grown older, and each
                    year caught hold of his hand more fondly, as if it felt a friend, and lifted up
                    to him its great soft serious eyes, a personal affection for this young life
                    which he alone protected, grew slowly upon him; and as the boy became older, and
                    the intelligence and fancies of his eager mind awed the man whilst they
                    bewildered him, Bruno loved him with the deep love of a dark and lonely soul,
                    for the sole thing in which it makes its possibility of redemption here and
                    hereafter.</p>
                <p>He sat now at the houseâdoor and watched the running figure so long as it was in
                    sight. When the bottom of the hill was reached and the path turned under the
                    lower vines, he lost him quite, and only knew that he must still be running on,
                    on, on, under all those roofs and tangles of green leaves.</p>
                <p>He was not quite at east about him. The boy<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7155-146"/>
                    never complained; nay, if questioned, insisted he was happy. But Bruno
                    mistrusted his brother, and he doubted the peace of that household. The
                    children, always grovelling and screaming, greedy and jealous, he hated. It was
                    not the nest for this young nightingaleâthat he felt. But he did not see what
                    better to do.</p>
                <p>Lippo held him fast by his word; and he had no proof that the boy was really
                    illâused. Sometimes he saw bruises on him, but there was always some story of an
                    accident, or of a childish quarrel to account for these, or of some just
                    punishment, and he, roughly reared himself, knew that boys needed such; and
                    Signaâs lips were mute; or if they ever did open, said only âthey are good to
                    me,ââa lie, for which he confessed and besought pardon on his knees in the
                    little dark corner in the Misericordia church.</p>
                <p>Still Bruno was not satisfied. But what to alter he knew not, and he was not a
                    man who could spare time or acquire the habit of holding communion with his own
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p>When the child had quite gone out of sight, he<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7155-147"/>
                    rose and took his sickle again and went back to his wheat.</p>
                <p>He seldom had anyone in to help him; men were careless sometimes, and split the
                    straw in reaping, and spoiled it for the plaiters. He generally got all the
                    wheat in between S. Procoloâs day and S. Paulâs; and the barley he took
                    later.</p>
                <p>The evening fell suddenly; where this land lies they lose the sunset because of
                    the great rise of the hills; they see a great globe of fire dropping downward,
                    it touches the purple of the mountains, and then all is night at once.</p>
                <p>The bats came out an the night kestrels and the wood owls, and went hunting to
                    and fro. Nameless melodious sounds echoed from tree to tree. The cicali went to
                    bed and the grilli hummed about in their stead; they are cousins, only one likes
                    the day and the other the night. The fireflies flitted, faint and paling, over
                    the fallen corn. When the wheat was reaped their day was done. later on a faint
                    light came above the far Umbrian hillsâa faint light in the sky like the dawn;
                    then a little longer, and<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7155-148"/> out of the light
                    rose the moon, a round world of gold ablaze above the dark, making the
                    treeâboughs that crossed her disc, look black.</p>
                <p>But Bruno looked at none of it.</p>
                <p>He had not eyes like Pippaâs child.</p>
                <p>He stooped and cut his wheat, laying it in ridges tenderly. The fireflies put out
                    their lights because the wheat was dead.</p>
                <p>But the glowworms under the leaves in the grass shone on; they were pale and
                    blue, and they could not dance; they never knew what it was to wheel in the air,
                    or to fly so high that men took them for stars; they never saw the treeâtops of
                    the nests of the hawks, or the lofty magnolia flowers, the fireflies only could
                    do all that; but then the glowworms lived on from year to year, and the death of
                    the wheat was nothing to them; they were worms of good sense, and had holes in
                    the ground.</p>
                <p>They twinkled on the sod as long as they liked, and pitied the fireflies, burning
                    themselves out by soaring so high, and dying because their loves were dead.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> child Signa ran on through the soft gray night.</p>
                <p>Toto was afraid of the night, but heânever.</p>
                <p>The fireflies ran with him along the waves of the standing corn. Wheat was cut
                    first on the sunniest land, and there was much still left unreapen on the lower
                    ground.</p>
                <p>One wonders there are no fairies where there are fireflies, for fireflies seem
                    fairies. But no fairies are found where the Greek gods have lived. Frail Titania
                    has no place beside Demeter; even Puck will not venture to ruffle Panâs sleep;
                    and where the harp of Apollo CytharÅdus was once heard, Ariel does not dare sing
                    his song to the bees.</p>
                <pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7155-150"/>
                <p>Signa caught a firefly in his hand and watched it burn a minute and then let it
                    loose again, and ran on his way.</p>
                <p>He wished he could be one of them, up in the air so high, with that light always
                    showing the mall they wished to know; seeing how the owls lived on the roofs of
                    the towers, and how the bees ruled their commonwealth on the top of the acacias,
                    and how the snow blossom came out of the brown magnolia spikes, and how the
                    cypress tree made her golden balls, and how the stoneâpine added cubics to his
                    height so noiselessly and fast, and how the clouds looked to the swallows that
                    lived so near them on the chapel belfries, and how the wheat felt when it saw
                    the sickle, and whether it was pained to die and leave the sun, or whether it
                    was glad to go and still the pain of hungry children. Oh what he would ask and
                    know, he thought, if only he were a firefly!</p>
                <p>But he was only a little boy with nothing to teach him anything, and a heart too
                    big for his body, and no wings to rise upon, but only feet to carry him, that
                    were often tired, and bruised, and weary of the dust.</p>
                <pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7155-151"/>
                <p>So he ran down towards the Lastra, stumbling and going slowly, because he was in
                    the dark, and also because he was so constantly looking upward at the fireflies,
                    that he lost his footing many times.</p>
                <p>Across the bridge, he turned aside and went up into the fields to the right of
                    him before he walked on to the Lastra.</p>
                <p>Between the bridge and the Lastra it is a picturesque and broken country. On one
                    side is the river, and on the other hilly ground, green with plumes of corn, and
                    hedges of briarârose, and tall rustling poplars, and up above, cypresses; and
                    old villas, noble in decay, and monasteries with frescoes crumbling to dust, and
                    fortresses that are barns and stables for cattle, and convent chapels, whose
                    solitary bell answers the bells of the goats as they graze.</p>
                <p>Signa ran up the steep grassy ways a little, and through a field of two under the
                    canes, twice his own height, and came to a little cottage, much lower, smaller,
                    and more miserable than Brunoâs house; a cottage that had only a few<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7155-152"/> roods of soil apportioned to it, and those not very
                    arable.</p>
                <p>Before its door there were several sheaves of corn lying on the ground; all its
                    produce except the few vegetables it yielded. The grain had been cut the day
                    before and was not carried in on account of the day being a holy one, for its
                    owner did not venture to risk his hereafter as Bruno had dared to do.</p>
                <p>The man was sitting on the stone bench outside his door; a goodâhumoured fellow,
                    lazy, stupid, very poor, but quite contented. He was one of the labourers in the
                    gardens of a great villa close by, called Giovoli. He had many children, and was
                    as poor as it is possible to be without begging on the roads.</p>
                <p>âWhere is Gemma,â called Signa. The man pointed indoors with the stem of his
                    pipe:</p>
                <p>âGone to bed, and Palma too, and I go too, in a minute or less; you are out late,
                    little fellow.â</p>
                <p>âI have been with Bruno,â said Signa, unfolding his cabbage leaf and his currants
                    in the<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7155-153"/> starlight, that was beginning to gleam
                    through the deep shadow of the early evening. âLook, I have brought these for
                    Gemma; may I run in and give them to her? They are so sweet!â</p>
                <p>The gardener, who was called Sandro by everybody, his name being Alessandro
                    Zanobetto, nodded in assent. He was a goodânatured, idle, mirthful soul, and
                    could never see why Lippoâs wife should treat the child so cruelly; he had
                    plagues enough himself, but never beat them.</p>
                <p>âIf Gemma be asleep she will wake, if there be anything to get,â he said, with a
                    little chuckle; himself he thought Palma worth a thousand of her.</p>
                <p>Signa ran indoors.</p>
                <p>It was a squareâbuilt place, all littered and untidy; there were hens at roost,
                    and garden refuse, and straw with a kid and its mother on it; and a table and a
                    bench or two, and a crucifix with a bough of willow, and in the corner, a bed of
                    hay upon the floor, sweetâsmelling, and full of dry flowers.</p>
                <p>Two children were in it, all hidden in the<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7155-154"/> hay,
                    except their heads and the points of their feet.</p>
                <p>One was dark, a little brown, strong, softâeyed child, and the other was of that
                    curious fairness, with the hair of reddened gold, and the eyes like summer
                    skies, which the old Goths have left here and there in the Latin races. Both
                    were asleep.</p>
                <p>They were like two little amorini in any old painting, with their curving limbs,
                    and their curly heads, and their rosy mouths, curled up, in the withered
                    grasses; the boy did not know anything about that, but he vaguely felt that it
                    was pretty to see them lying so, just as it was pretty to see a cluster of
                    pomegranate flowers blowing in the sun.</p>
                <p>He stole up on tiptoe, and touching the cheek of the fair one with a bunch of
                    currants, laughed to see her blue bright eyes open wide on him with a stare.</p>
                <p>âI have brought you some fruit, Gemma,â he said, and tried to kiss her.</p>
                <p>âGive me! give me quick!â cried the little child tumbling up half erect in the
                    hay, the dried<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7155-155"/> daisies in her crumpled curls,
                    and her little bare chest and shoulders fit for a statue of Cupid. She pushed
                    away his lips; she wanted the fruit.</p>
                <p>âIf I do not eat it quick, Palma will wake,â she whispered, and began to crunch
                    them in her tiny teeth as the kid did its grasses. The dark child did wake, and
                    lifted herself on her elbow.</p>
                <p>âIt is Signa!â she cried, with a little coo of delight like a wood pigeonâs.</p>
                <p>âI kept you no currants, Palma!â said Signa, with a pang of selfâreproach. He
                    knew that he had done unkindly.</p>
                <p>Palma looked a little sorrowful. They were very poor, and never hardly tasted
                    anything except the black bread, like dogs.</p>
                <p>âNever mind; come and kiss me,â she said, with a little sigh.</p>
                <p>Signa went round and kissed her. But he went back to Gemma again.</p>
                <p>âGoodânight,â he said to the pretty white child, sitting up in the hay; and he
                    kissed her once more. So Gemma was kissed twice; and had the currants as
                    well.</p>
                <pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7155-156"/>
                <p>Palma was used to that.</p>
                <p>Signa ran out with a hardened conscience. He knew he had been unjust; but then if
                    he had given any of the currants to Palma, Gemma never would have kissed him at
                    all.</p>
                <p>He liked them both; little things of ten and nine, living with their father and
                    their brothers close to the gates of the great garden, low down on the same hill
                    where, higher, Lippoâs sheep were kept.</p>
                <p>He liked them both, having seen them from babyhood, and paddled in the brook
                    under the poplars with them, and strung them chains of berries, and played them
                    tunes on the pipes he cut from the reeds.</p>
                <p>They were both his playfellows, pretty little things, halfânaked, bareâfooted,
                    fed by the air and the sun, and tumbling into life, as little rabbits do amongst
                    the grass.</p>
                <p>But Palma he did not care about, and about Gemma he did. For Gemma was a thousand
                    times prettier, and Palma loved him always, that he knew; but of Gemma he never
                    was so sure.</p>
                <pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7155-157"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, he knew he had not done them justice about those currants, and he
                    was sorry for it, as he ran along the straight road in to the Lastra, and with
                    one look upward to the gateway that he loved, though he could not see the colour
                    on the parapet because it was dark, he darted onward quickly lest the gate
                    should close for the night and he be punished and turned backward, and hurried
                    up the passage into Lippoâs house.</p>
                <p>Lippo lived in a steep paved road above the Place of Arms, and close to the
                    openâarched loggia what used to be the wood market, against the southern gate.
                    There is no great beauty about the place, and yet it has light and shade, and
                    colour, and antiquity, to charm a Prout or furnish a Canaletto. The loggia had
                    the bold round arches that Orcagna most loved; the walls have the dim, soft
                    brown and greys of age, with flecks of colour, where the frescoes once were;
                    through the gateway there come the ox carts and the mules, and the herds of
                    goats, down the steep paved way; there is a quiver of green leaves, a breadth of
                    blue sky, and at the<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7155-158"/> bottom of the passageâway
                    there is a shrine of our Lady of Good Council, so old that he people can tell
                    you nothing of it; you can see the angels still with their illumined wings, and
                    the Virgin with the rays of gold, who sits behind a wicket of grey wood, with a
                    carven M interlaced before her, and quaint little doors that open and shut; but
                    of who made it or first set it up for worship there they can tell you nothing at
                    all.</p>
                <p>It is only a bit of the Lastra that nobody sees except the fattori rattling over
                    the stones in their light carts, or the contadini going in for their masterâs
                    letters, or now and then a noble driving to his villa, and the country folks
                    coming for justice or for sentence to the Prefettura. But there is beauty in it,
                    and poetry; and the Madonna who sits behind her little grey wicket has seen so
                    much since first the lilies of liberty were carved on the bold east gate.</p>
                <p> The boyâs heart beat quickly as he went up the stairs; he was brave in a shy,
                    silent way, and he believed that the angels were very near, and would help him
                    some day. Still Nitaâs weighty<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7155-159"/> arm, and the
                    force of her alder twigs or her ash stem, were not things to be got rid of by
                    dreaming, and the angels were very slow to come; no doubt because he was not
                    good enough, as Signa thought sorrowfully. And he had sent them further away
                    from him than ever by that unjust act about the currants, so that his heart
                    throbbed fast as he climbed the rickety stairs where the spiders had it all
                    their own way, and the old scorpions never were frightened by a broom, which
                    made them very happy, because scorpions hate a broom, and tumble down dead at
                    the sight of one (cleanliness having immeasurable power over them), in as moral
                    and allegory as Ãsop and Fontaine could ever have wished to draw.</p>
                <p>Nita and all her noisy brood were standing together over the table with a big
                    loaf on it, and an empty bowl and flasks of oil and vinegar, getting ready for
                    supper.</p>
                <p>Lippo was down in the street playing dominoes, and old Baldo was sitting below
                    puzzling out, by a bronze lamp, from a book of dreams, some signs he had had
                    visions of in a doze, to see their numbers for the tombola.</p>
                <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7155-160"/>
                <p>âHow late you are, you little plague, I gave you till sunset,â screamed Nita, as
                    she saw him. âAnd where is the saladâgive meâquick!â</p>
                <p>âI am very sorry,â stammered Signa, timidly. âThe salad? I forgot it. I am very
                    sorry!â</p>
                <p>âSorry; and I waiting all this time for supper,â shrieked Nita. âNothing to do
                    but just to cut a lettuce, and some endive off the ground, and you forgot it.
                    Where have you been all day?â</p>
                <p>âWith Bruno.â</p>
                <p>âWith Brunoâof course with Brunoâand could not bring a salad off his land. The
                    only thing you had to think of, and we waiting for supper, and the sun over the
                    mountains more than an hour ago, and you stuffed up there, I warrant, like a
                    fatting goose!â</p>
                <p>âI had some bread and milk,â said Signa. He was trembling in all his little
                    limbs; he could not help this, they beat him so, so often, and he knew well what
                    was coming.</p>
                <p>âAnd nothing else?â screamed Nita, for every good thing that went to him she
                        conâ<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7155-161"/> sidered robbery and violence done on
                    her own children.</p>
                <p>âI had fruitâbut I took it to Zanobettoâs girls,â said Signa, very low, because
                    he was such a foolish little fellow, that neither example, nor execration, nor
                    constant influence of lying could ever make him untruthful, and a child is
                    always either untruthful or most exaggeratedly exact in truthâthere is no medium
                    for him.</p>
                <p>âAnd not to us,â screeched Nitaâs eldest daughter, and boxed him on the ear.</p>
                <p>âYou little beast,â said Georgio, the biggest boy, and kicked him.</p>
                <p>Toto waited about, and sprang on him like a cat, and pulled his hair until he
                    tore some curls out by the roots.</p>
                <p>Signa was very pale, but he never made sound nor effort. He stood stockâstill and
                    mute, and bore it. He had seen pictures of S. Stephen and S. Lawrence and of
                    Christâand they were still and quiet always, letting their enemies have their
                    way. Perhaps, if he were still too, he thought it might be forgiven to himâthat
                    sin about the currants.</p>
                <pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7155-162"/>
                <p>Nita, with an iron hand, sent her offsprings off, reeling to their places, and
                    seized him herself and stripped him.</p>
                <p>He was all bruised from the nightâs beating still; but she did not pause for
                    that; but she did not pause for that. She plucked down her rod of alder twigs,
                    and thrashed his till he bled again. Then threw him into the hay in the inner
                    room beyond where the boys slept.</p>
                <p>All the time he was quite mute. Shut up in the dark his courage gave way under
                    the pain, and he burst out crying.</p>
                <p>âDear angels, do not be angry with me any more,â he prayed, â and I only did it
                    to make Gemma happy; and they beat me so here, and I never tell Bruno.â</p>
                <p>But the angles, wherever they be, never now come this side of the sun; and Signa
                    lay all alone in the dark, and go no rest nor answer.</p>
                <p>âThe lute will be sorry,â he thought, getting tired of waiting for the
                    angels.</p>
                <p>He told all his sorrows and joys to the lute, and he was sure it understood, for
                    did it not<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7155-163"/> sing with him, or sigh with him,
                    just as his heart taught it?</p>
                <p>âI will tell the lute,â said Signa, sobbing in his straw, with a vague babyish
                    dim sense of the great truth that his art is the only likeness of an angel that
                    the singer ever sees on earth.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> little fellow had a laborious life at the best of times, but he had
                    so grown up in it that it never occurred to him to repine.</p>
                <p>True Toto, the same age as himself, and a motherâs darling, led one just as lazy
                    and agreeable as his was hard and overâworked. Toto sported in the sun at
                    pleasure, played morra for halfpence, robbed cherry trees, slept through noon,
                    devoured fried beans and green almonds and artichokes in oil, and refused to be
                    of any earthly use to any human creature through all his dirty idle days as best
                    beseemed to him. But Signa from the cradle upward had been taught to give way to
                    Toto, and been taught to know that the measure of life for Toto was golden and
                    for him was lead.<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7155-165"/> It had always been so from
                    the first, when Nita had laid him hungry in the hay to turn to Toto full but
                    screaming.</p>
                <p>Signa, sent out in the dark before the sun rose to see to the sheep on the hill,
                    kept on the hill winter and summer if he were not sent higher to fetch things
                    from Brunoâs garden and fields; running on a dozen errands a day for Baldo or
                    Lippo or Nita; trotting by the donkeyâs side with vegetables along the seven
                    dusty miles into the city, and trotting back again afoot, because the donkey was
                    laden with charcoal, or linen to be washed, or some other town burden that Lippo
                    earned a penny by in fetching for his neighbours; early and late, in heat and in
                    cold, when the south wind scorched, as when the north wind howled, Signa was
                    always on his feet, doing this and that and the other. But he had got quite used
                    to it, and thought it a wonderful treat that they allowed him to sing now and
                    then for the priests, and that he let his voice loose as loud as he liked on the
                    hillâsides and in the fields.</p>
                <p>When he went up into these fields and knew the beautiful Tuscan world in summer,
                    the liberty<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7155-166"/> and the loveliness of it made him
                    happy without his knowing why, because the poetic temper was alive in him.</p>
                <p>The little breadths of grassâland white as snow with a million cups of the
                    earthâcreeping bindweed. The yellow wheat clambering the hillâsides and darkened
                    to ruddy bronze when the vineâshadows fell over it. The springtide glory of the
                    Judas trees, which here they call in cruel irony the Tree of Love, with their
                    rose flowers blushing amongst the great walnuts and the coneâdropping figs. The
                    figâtrees and the appleâtrees flinging their boughs together in June, like
                    children clasping arms in play. The glowworm lying under the moss, while the
                    fireflies shone aloft in the leaves. The blue butterflies astir like living
                    cornflowers amongst the bearded barley, and the dainty grace of the oats. The
                    little shallow brooks sleeping in sun and shade under the green canes, with the
                    droll frogs talking of the weather. The cistus, that looks so like the dogârose
                    that you pluck one for the other every day, covering the rough loose stones and
                    crumbling walls with beauty so delicate you fear to<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7155-167"/> breathe on it. The long turf paths between the vines,
                    left for the bullocks to pass by in vintage time, and filled with colours from
                    clover or iris, blue bugloss, or bright fritillaria. The wayside crucifixes so
                    hidden in coils of vine and growing stalks of rushâlike millet and the swaying
                    frond of acacia offâshoots that you scarce can see the cross for the foliage.
                    The high hills that seem to sleep against the sun, so still they look, and dim
                    and dreamful, with clouds of olives, soft as mist, and flecks of white where the
                    mountain villages are, distant as far off sails of ships, and full, like them,
                    of vague fancy and hope and perils of the past. All these things were beautiful
                    to him, and he was very happy when he went up to Bruno.</p>
                <p>Besides, this tall dark fellow, who scowled on everyone and should have been a
                    brigand, people said, was always good to him.</p>
                <p>He had to work, indeed, for Bruno, to carry the cabbages into the town, to pump
                    the water from the tanks, to pick the insects off the vines, to cut the distaff
                    canes, to carry the cow her fresh fodder, to do all the many things that are<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7155-168"/> always wanting to be done from dawn to eve on
                    a little farm. But then Bruno always spared him half an hour for his lute,
                    always gave him a good meal, always let him enjoy himself when he could, and
                    constantly interceded to get him spared labour on a feast day, and leave to
                    attend the communal school.</p>
                <p>He did not wonder either at Brunoâs kindness or at the otherâs unkindness;
                    because children take good and evil as the birds take rain and sunshine. But it
                    lightened the troubles of his young life and made them bearable.</p>
                <p>He had never wandered farther than the hills above the town, and sometimes he was
                    sent with the donkey into Florence; that was all. But the warâworn staunch old
                    Lastra is enough world for a child; it would be too wide a one for an historian,
                    could all its stones have tongues.</p>
                <p>It is a trite saying that it is not what we see but how we see that matters; and
                    Signa saw in his battleâdinted worldâforsaken little town more things and more
                    meanings than a million grownâup wanderers would have seen in the width of many
                    countries.</p>
                <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7155-169"/>
                <p>He got the old men to tell him stories of it in the great republican centuries;
                    the stories were apocryphal, no doubt, but had that fitness which almost does as
                    well as truth in popular traditions, and, indeed, is truth itself in a
                    measure.</p>
                <p>He knew how to read, and in a old muniment rooms, going to decay in farmhouses
                    and granaries, found tattered chronicles which he could spell out with more or
                    less success. He knew all the old towers and ruined fortresses as the owls knew
                    them. When he got a little time to himself, which was not very often, he would
                    wander away up into the high places and play his lute to the sunny silence, and
                    fancy himself a minstrel like those he saw in the illuminations of the vellum
                    rolls that the rats ate in many a villa, once a palace and now a wineâwarehouse,
                    whose lords had died out in root and branch. Wading kneeâdeep in the green river
                    water amongst the canes and the croaking frogs that the other boys were fishing
                    for, his shining eyes saw the broad channel of the river filled with struggling
                    horses and fighting men, as they told him it had been in<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7155-170"/> the old days when Castruccio had forded it and
                    Ferruccio had ridden over it with his lances.</p>
                <p>It was all odds and ends and waifs and strays of most imperfect knowledge that he
                    got, for every one was ignorant around him, and though the people were proud of
                    their history, they so mixed it up with grotesque invention and distorted
                    hyperbole that it was almost worthless. Still the little that he knew made the
                    old town beautiful to him and venerable and most wonderful, as Troy, if he could
                    see it entire, would seem to a Hellenic scholar. His little head was full of
                    delicate and glorious fancies, as he pattered on his bare brown feet beside the
                    donkey under the gateways of the Lastra;âthe west one with its circlet of azure
                    where the <choice>

                    </choice> used to be, and its chasm of green where the ivy and bushes grow; and
                    the east one with its great stone shields, and its yawning depth of arch, and
                    its wardersâ turrets on the roof.</p>
                <p>He was so absorbed in thinking, that he would sometimes never see the turnips
                    jump out of the panniers, or the chestnuts shake out of the sacks on the
                    donkeyâs back, and Nita would beat<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7155-171"/> him till he
                    was sick for leaving them rolling in the Lastra streetsâto be puzzling about old
                    colours on the tops of gates, when the blessed vegetables were flying loose like
                    mad things on the stones!âit was enough to call down the instant judgment of
                    heaven, she averred.</p>
                <p>Those gleams of blue on the battlements, what use were they? and as for the
                    cloudsâthey were always holding off when they were wanted, and coming down when
                    rain was ruin. But as for turnips and beansâabout their preciousness there could
                    be no manner of doubt. And she taught the priority of the claims of the soupâpot
                    with a thick cudgel, as the world teaches it to the poet. The poet often learns
                    the lesson, and puts his conscience in to stew, as if it were an onion; finding
                    philosophy will bake no bread.</p>
                <p>But no beating could cure Signa of looking at the frescoes, and hearing the
                    angels singing in the clouds above.</p>
                <p>Signa was not as other children were. To Nita he seemed more foolish and more
                    worthless than any of them, and she despised him.</p>
                <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7155-172"/>
                <p>âYou cannot beat the gates down nor the clouds,â said Signa, when she thrashed
                    him, and that comforted him. But such an answer seemed to Nita the very
                    pertinacy of the Evil One himself.</p>
                <p>âHe was an obstinate little beast,â said Nita, âand if it were not for that half
                    of Brunoâs land ââ</p>
                <p>But he was not obstinate. He only stretched towards the light he saw, as the
                    plant in the cellar will stretch through the bars.</p>
                <p>Tens of millions of little peasants come to the birth, and grow up and become
                    men, and do the daily bidding of the world, and work and die, and have no more
                    of soul or Godhead in them than the grains of sand. But here and there, with no
                    lot different to his fellows, one is born to dream and muse and struggle to the
                    sun of higher desires, and the world calls such a one Burns, or Haydn, or
                    Giotto, or Shakespeare, or whatever name the fierce light of fame may burn upon
                    and make <choice>

                <p>Some other relaxations and enjoyments too the child found; and here and there
                    people were good<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7155-173"/> to him; women for the sake of
                    his pretty innocent face, with the cloud of dusky golden hair tumbling half over
                    it always, and priests for the sake of his voice, which gave such beauty to
                    their services, when anything great happened to demand a full ceremonial in
                    their dark, quiet, frescoed sanctuaries scattered under the hills and on them.
                    Indeed Lippo would have taken him into the city, and made money of his singing
                    in the celebrations at Easter time, or on Ascension Day, or in Holy Week at the
                    grand ceremonies of Rome. But of that Bruno would never hear. He set his heel
                    down on the ground with an oath.</p>
                <p>âSell your soul, if you please, and the devil is fool enough to pay for it,â he
                    said, âbut you shall never sell the throat of Pippaâs child like any trapped
                    nightingaleâs.â</p>
                <p>Poor Lippo sighed and yielded; it was one of those things in which his own good
                    sense and calm wisdom had to let themselves be overborne by this brotherâs
                    impetuous unreason. The churchesâeven the great onesâpay but a few pence; it was
                    not worth while risking for a few coppers, or for an uncertain future, that
                        lucrative,<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7155-174"/> âhalf of my halfâ off the rich
                    fields and vineâpaths of the Artimino mountain.</p>
                <p>So Signa sang here and there, a few times in the year, in the little choirs about
                    the Lastra for nothing at all but the love of it; and in the Holy Week sang in
                    the church of the Misericordia, where one of his chief haunts and sweetest
                    pleasures was found at all times.</p>
                <p>It is the only church within the Lastra walls, the parish church being outside
                    upon the hills, and very little used. It is a small place, grey and grim of
                    exterior, with its red door veils hanging down much worn, and having, within,
                    its altar piece by Cimabue, only shown on high and holy feasts; no religious
                    building in this country, however lowly, is quite without some treasure of the
                    kind.</p>
                <p>The church fills to overflowing at high mass, and the people stand on the steps
                    and in the street, and the sound of the chanting and the smoke of the incense,
                    and the tinkle of the little bells come out on to the air over the bowed heads,
                    and with them there mingle all sweet common country sounds, from bleating
                        sheep<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7155-175"/> and rushing winds, and watchâdogs
                    baying afar off, and heaving ropes grating boats against the bridge; and the
                    people murmur their prayers in the sun, and bow and kneel and go home comforted,
                    if they know not very well why they are so.</p>
                <p>Above the body of the church, led up to by a wooden staircase, there are the
                    rooms of the Fraternity to which all good men and true belong for the love of
                    the poor and the service of heaven. Rooms divided into little cells, each with
                    the black robes and mask of a brother of the order in it; and blackâlettered
                    lines of Scripture above, and the crossbones of death; and closets where the
                    embroidered banners are, and the sacred things for holy offices, and the black
                    velvet pall, with its memento mori and its golden skulls, that covers each
                    brother on his last travel to his latest rest.</p>
                <p>Here, in the stillness and the silence, with these symbols of death everywhere
                    around, there dwelt at this time in the dull songless church a man who, in his
                    day, had been a careless wandering singer, loving his art honestly, though
                    himself one of the lowliest of her servitors.</p>
                <pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7155-176"/>
                <p>Born in the Lastra, with a sweet voice and an untrained love of harmony, his
                    tastes had led him to wander away from it, and join one of the troops of
                    musicians who make the chance companies in the many small theatres that are to
                    be found in the Italian towns which lie out of the great highways, and are
                    hardly known by name, except in their own commune. He had never risen high in
                    his profession, though a favourite in the little cities, but had always wandered
                    about from season to season from playhouse to playhouse; and in the middle way
                    of his career a drenching in a rainâstorm, after a burning day, had made his
                    throat mute and closed his singing life forever. He had returned to his
                    birthplace, and there joining the Misericordia, had become organist and
                    sacristan to their church in the Lastra, and had stayed in those offices some
                    thirty years, and now was over seventy; a silent, timid, old creature usually,
                    but of a gentle temper, and liking nothing better than to recall the days of his
                    wanderings as a singer, or to linger over the keys of his old organ with some
                    worldâforgotten score before him.</p>
                <pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7155-177"/>
                <p>There was little scope for his fondness for melody in the Lastra. It was only in
                    Holy Week that he could arrange any choral service; or once in two or three
                    years, perhaps, there would come such a chance for him as he had had on that day
                    of Corpus Domini when the bishopâs visit had brought about an unusual greatness
                    of ceremonial.</p>
                <p>At all other times all he could ever do was to play a few symphonies or fugues at
                    high mass, and if any village child had a great turn for melody, teach it the
                    little science that he knew, as he taught Signa; Signa who was so docile a pupil
                    that he would have knelt in happy obedience to the whip which S. Gregory bought
                    for his scholarsâonly he never would have merited it for the transgressions of
                    singing out of time.</p>
                <p>The stillness, the sadness, the seclusion, where no sound came unless it were
                    some tolling bell upon the hills, the melancholy associations of the place,
                    which all spoke of pain, of effort, of sorrow, of the needs of the poor, and of
                    the warnings of the grave, all these fostered the dreamful temper of the boy,
                    and the thoughtfulâ<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7155-178"/> ness which was beyond his
                    years; and he passed many a happy tranquil hour listening to the old man
                    playing, or trying to reproduce upon his lute, as best he might, themes of the
                    musicians of earlier generationsâfrom the figure of Merulaâfrom the airs of
                    Zingarelliâfrom the Stabat Mater of Jesiâfrom the Benedictus of Jomelliâfrom the
                    Credo of Perezâfrom the Cantata of Porporaâknowing nothing of their names or
                    value, but finding out their melodies and meanings by sheer instinct.</p>
                <p>Luigi Diniâwhom everyone called Gigiâhad many a crabbed old score and fine sonata
                    and cantata copied out by his own hands, and the child, having been taught his
                    notes, had grown able to find his way in this labyrinth, and pick out beautiful
                    things from the dust of ages by ear and instinct, and make them all his own, as
                    love appropriates whatever it worships; and never knew, as he went over the
                    stones of the Lastra with the donkey, and woke the people in their beds with his
                    clear voice, whilst all was dark, and only he and the birds were astir, that
                    when he was singing the great <foreign xml:lang="ita">Se<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7155-179"/> circa, se dice</foreign>, or the mighty <foreign xml:lang="ita">Misero pargoletto</foreign>, or the delicious <foreign xml:lang="ita">QuelliâlÃ </foreign>, or the tender <foreign xml:lang="ita">Deh signore!</foreign> he was giving out to the silent street, and the
                    dreaming echoes, and the wakening flush of day, airs that had been the rapture
                    of the listening world a century before.</p>
                <p>Grave Gregorian melodies; Laudi of Florentiae laudisti of the Middle Ages; hymns
                    from the monasteries, modelled on the old Greek traditions, with âthe note the
                    slave of the word;â all things simple, pure, and old filled the manuscripts of
                    the sacristy like antique jewels. Signa, very little, very ignorant, very
                    helpless, strayed amongst them confused and unconscious of the value of the
                    things he played with, and yet got the good out of them and felt their richness
                    and was nourished on the strength of them, and ran away to them at every stolen
                    moment that he could, while Luigi Dini stood by and listened, and was moved at
                    the wonderful instinct of the child, as the Romans were moved at the young
                    Mozartâs rendering of the Allegri requiem.</p>
                <p>Music was in the heart and the brain of the child; his feet moved to it over the
                    dusty roads,<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7155-180"/> his heavy burdens were lightened
                    by it, and, when they scolded him, often he did not hearâthere were so many
                    voices singing to him. Where did the voices come from? he did not know; only he
                    heard them when he lay awake in the straw, beside the other boys, with the stars
                    shining through the unglazed window of the roof, as he heard them when the hot
                    noon was bright and still on the hillâtop where he strayed all alone with his
                    sheep.</p>
                <p>One day he found the magical voices shut up in a little brown prison of wood, as
                    a great soul ere now has been pent in a mean little body;âone day, a wonderful
                    day, after which all the world changed for him.</p>
                <p>In a little shop in the Lastra by the Porta Fiorentina, there was a violin for
                    sale. A violin in pearâwood, with a shell inlaid upon its case, and reputed to
                    be very, very old.</p>
                <p>Tonino, the locksmith and tinman, had it. So many years before that he could not
                    count them a lodger had left it with him in default of rent, and never gone back
                    for it. The violin lay neglected in the dust of an old cupboard. One<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7155-181"/> day a pedlar had spied it and offered ten francs for
                    it. Tonino said to himself, if a pedlar would give that, it must be worth four
                    times the sum at least, and put it in his window with his old keys and his new
                    saucepans, and his ancient locks and his spick and span bright coffee pots; a
                    little old dusky window just within the tall east gateway of the Lastra, where
                    the great poplars throw their welcome shadow across the sunny road.</p>
                <p>Signa going on an errand there one day and left alone in the shop took it up and
                    began to make the strings sound, not knowing how, but finding the music out for
                    himself as they young Pascal found the science of mathematics.</p>
                <p>When Tonino entered his workshop, with a pair of hot pincers in his hand, he was
                    frightened to death to hear the sweetest sounds dancing about the air like
                    butterflies, and when he discovered that he child was playing on his precious
                    violin that the pedlar would give ten francs for, he hardly knew whether to kiss
                    the child for being so clever or whether to pinch him with the red hot nippers
                    for his imâ<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7155-182"/> pudence. Anyhow he snatched the
                    violin from him and put it in the window again.</p>
                <p>A thing that could make so sweet a noise must be worth double what he
                    thought.</p>
                <p>So he put a price of forty francs upon it, and stuck it amongst his tins, hoping
                    to sell it; dealers or gentlefolks came sometimes up and down the Lastra, seeing
                    if there were any pretty or ancient thing to buy, for the people have beautiful
                    old work very often in lace, in majolica, in carvings, in missals, in <foreign xml:lang="fre">repoussÃ©</foreign>, in copper and can be cheated out of these
                    with an ease that quite endears them to those who do it.</p>
                <p>A few people looked at Toninoâs violin, but no one bought it; because the right
                    people did not see it, or because it was an old violin without any special grace
                    of Cremona or value of Bologna on its case. As it lay there in the window
                    amongst the rusty iron and the shining tin things, with the dust drifting over
                    it, and the flies buzzing about its strings, Signa saw it twenty times a week,
                    and sighed his little soul out for it.</p>
                <p>Oh the unutterable wonder locked up in that<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7155-183"/>
                    pearâwood case! oh, the deep undreamedâof joys that lay in those mute
                    strings!</p>
                <p>The child thought of nothing else. After those murmurs of marvellous meanings
                    that had come to him when touching that strange thing, he dreamed of it by day
                    and night. The lute was dear to him; but what was the power of the lute beside
                    those heights and depths of sound that this unknown creature could give?âfor a
                    living creature it was to him, as much as was the redbreast or thrush.</p>
                <p>Only to touch it again! just once to touch it again!</p>
                <p>He begged and prayed Tonino; but the tinman was inexorable. he could not risk his
                    bit of property in such babyish hands. True the child had made the music jump
                    out of it; but that might have been an accident, and who could tell that another
                    time he would not break itâa little beggarâs brat like that, without people to
                    pay for it if any damage were done.</p>
                <p>âGive me my forty francs and you shall have it, piccinino,â Tonino would say with
                    a grin, knowing that he might as well tell the<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7155-184"/>
                    child to bring him down the starâdust from the skies.</p>
                <p>Signa would go away with his little head hung down; the longing for the violin
                    possessing him with a oneâideaâd passion. In the young child with whom genius is
                    born its vague tumultuous desires work without his knowing what it is that ails
                    him.</p>
                <p>The children laughed at him, the old people scolded him, Nita beat him, Bruno
                    even grew impatient with him because he was always sighing for an old fiddle,
                    that it was as absurd for him to dream of as it were a kingâs sword or a queenâs
                    pearls.</p>
                <p>âAs if he were not lazy and tiresome enough as it is!â said Nita, boxing his ears
                    soundly, when she went by one evening and caught him leaning against Toninoâs
                    casement and looking with longing, pitiful, ardent eyes at the treasure in its
                    pearâwood shell.</p>
                <p>After a time the child, shy and proud in temper, grew ashamed of his own
                    enthusiasm, and hid it from the others, and never any more tried to soften
                    Toninoâs heart and get leave to touch that magical bow again.</p>
                <p>Bruno thought he had forgotten it and was<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7155-185"/> glad.
                    The violin lay with the metal pots and the rusty locks, and no one brought it.
                    Signa when he had to go past, on an errand through the gate, to Castagnolo or S.
                    Maria del Greve, or any other eastward village, tried not to look at the brown
                    shining wood that the wasps and the mosquitoes were humming over at their will.
                    But he longed for it the more because he kept the longing silent, and had no
                    chance of ever feeling those keys of enchantment under his little fingers. A
                    thing repressed, grows.</p>
                <p>He would lie awake at night thinking of the violin; if it had not been so wicked
                    he would have stolen something to buy it with; some days it was all he could do
                    to keep himself from stealing it itself.</p>
                <p>One bright afternoon in especial, when everyone was at a marionette show in the
                    square, and he had come back very footâsore from the city, and passing saw
                    Toninoâs place was empty and the old lattice windows were open and the sunâs
                    rays fell across the violin, it would have been the work of a second to put his
                    hand in, and draw it out, and run offâanywhereâanyâ<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7155-186"/> where, what would it have mattered where, if only he
                    had carried all that music with him?</p>
                <p>For genius is fanaticism; and the little barefoot hungry fellow, running errands
                    in the dust, had genius in him, and was tossed about by it like a small moth by
                    a storm.</p>
                <p>To run away and wander, with the violin to talk to him wherever he might go:âthe
                    longing to do this tortured him so that he clasped his hands over his eyes and
                    fledâwithout itâas fast as his feet could take him.</p>
                <p>To see it lying dumb when at his touch it would say such beautiful things to
                    him!âhe ran on through the gateway and down the road with the burning temptation
                    pursuing him as prairie flames a frightened fawn.</p>
                <p>If any one had had it who could have made it speak he would not have minded; but
                    that it should lie mute thereâuselessâlostâhurt him with a sharper pain than
                    Nitaâs hazel rods could deal.</p>
                <p>âOh Gemmaâalmost I stole it!â he gasped, panting and breathless with the horror
                    of himself, as he stumbled up against the pretty child on the green strip that
                    runs under the old south<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7155-187"/> wall, where the
                    breaches made by the Spanish assaults are filled in with ivy, and the ropemakers
                    walk to and fro, weaving their strands under the ruined bastions.</p>
                <p>Gemma put her finger in her mouth and looked at him.</p>
                <p>âWhy not quite?â she said. Gemma had stolen many things in her day, and had
                    always been forgiven because she was so pretty.</p>
                <p>âOh, Gemma, I didâso nearly!â he murmured, unheeding her answer in the confusion
                    of his own new stricken sense of peril and escape.</p>
                <p>âWas it to eat?â said Gemma.</p>
                <p>âTo eat?â</p>
                <p>He echoed her words without knowing what he said. Two great tears were rolling
                    down his cheeks. He was so grateful that strength for resistance had been given
                    him; and yet, he was thinking of a song<ref target="#signa-ouida02">*</ref> of
                    the country to a lute; which <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="signa-ouida02">*<cit>

                    gild its strings and wander with it even as far as Romeâmountains and rocks
                    inclining before its silver sounds.</p>
                <p>If only he could have that beautiful strange thing, he thought, how he would roam
                    the world over fearing nothing, or how happy he would lie down among the sheep
                    and the pines, for ever making music to the winds.</p>
                <p>âWhy did you not take it, if nobody was by to see,â said Gemma.</p>
                <p>âOh dear, it is wicked to thieve,â said Signa, drearily. âWicked, you know, and
                    mean.â</p>
                <p>Gemma put out her lower lip.</p>
                <p>âIf no one know, it is all right,â she said, with accurate perception of the
                    worldâs standard of virtue.</p>
                <p>Signa sighed heavily, his head hung down; he hardly heard her; he was thinking of
                    the violin.</p>
                <p>âYou are a mammamia,â said Gemma, with calm scorn, meaning he was a baby and very
                    silly. âWhen I wish to do a thing, I do it.â</p>
                <p>âBut you do very wrong things sometimes.â</p>
                <p>Gemma shrugged her little white shoulders up to her ears.</p>
                <pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7155-189"/>
                <p>âIt is nice to do wrong,â she said placidly.</p>
                <p>âThey <emph>say</emph> things are wrong you know,â she added, after a pause. âBut
                    that is only to keep us quiet. It is all words.â</p>
                <p>They called her stupid, but she noticed many facts and drew many conclusions.
                    This was one of them; and it was alike agreeable to her and useful. She was a
                    naughty child, but was naughty with logic and success.</p>
                <p>âIf only he would let me touch it once,â murmured Signa.</p>
                <p>Gemma finding him such bad company went away hopping on one foot, and wondering
                    why boys were such silly creatures.</p>
                <p>âWhat is the matter?â said one of the ropemakers kindly to the boy. âDo you want
                    to see the puppet show that came in the morning? Here is a copper bit if you
                    do.â</p>
                <p>Signa put his hands behind his back.</p>
                <p>âOh no, it is not that. You are very good, but it is not that.â</p>
                <p>âTake what you can get another time,â said the ropemaker, offended and yet glad
                    that his too generous offer had been repulsed by him.</p>
                <pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7155-190"/>
                <p>âWhat an ass you are! The puppets are splendid,â hissed Toto, who was near, and
                    who had spent an hour in the forenoon, squeezed between the tentâpegs of the
                    forbidden paradise, flat on his stomach, swallowing the dust. âThey are half an
                    armâs length high, and there are three kings in it, and they murder one another
                    just like lifeâso beautiful! You might have taken the money, surely, and given
                    it to me. I shall tell mother; see then if you get any fritters for a week!â</p>
                <p>âI did not want to see the puppets,â said Signa, wearily, and walked away.</p>
                <p>It was late in the day; he had worked hard, running into the city and back on an
                    errand; he was tired and listless and unhappy.</p>
                <p>As he went thinking of the violin by the walls, not noticing where his steps took
                    him, he passed a little group of strangers. They were travellers who had
                    wandered out there for a day. One of them was reading in a book, and looked up
                    as the child passed.</p>
                <p>âWhat a pity the Lastra is forgotten by the world!â the reader said to his
                    companions; he<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7155-191"/> was thinking of the many
                    memories which the old castello shuts within her walls as manuscripts are shut
                    in coffers.</p>
                <p>Signa heard; and flushed with pain up to the curls of his flying hair.</p>
                <p>He said nothing, for he was shy, and, besides, was never very sure that people
                    would not take him to Nita for a thrashing; they so often did. But he went on
                    his way with a swelling heart. It hurt him like a blow. To others it was only a
                    small, ancient, desolate place filled with poor people, but to him it was as
                    Zion to the Hebrew children.</p>
                <p>âIf I could be very great, if I could write beautiful things as Pergolesi did,
                    and all the world heard them and treasured them, then praising me, they would
                    remember the Lastra,â he thought.</p>
                <p>A dim, sweet, impossible ambition entered into him, for the first time; the
                    ambition of a child, gorgeous and vague, and out of all realms of likelihood;
                    visions all full of gold and colour, with no perspective or reality about them,
                    like a picture of the twelfth century,<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7155-192"/> in
                    which he saw himself, a man grown, laurelâcrowned and whiteârobed, brought into
                    the Lastra, as the old Sacristan told him Petrarca was taken into Rome; with the
                    rays of the sun of his fame gliding its ancient ways, whilst all Italy chanted
                    his melodies and all the earth echoed his name.</p>
                <p>âIf I could but be what Pergolesi was!â he thought.</p>
                <p>Pergolesi who consumed his soul in high endeavour, and died, at fiveâandâtwenty,
                    of a broken heart!</p>
                <p>But then he knew nothing of that; he only knew that Pergolesi was a great dead
                    creature, whose name was written on the scores of the Stabat and the Salve
                    Regina which he loved as he loved the roll of thunder and the rose at sunrise:
                    and he knew that it was he who had written that â<foreign xml:lang="ita">Se
                        circa se dice</foreign>,â which he had learned in the dusky organâloft of
                    the Misericordia; that song in which the great poet and the great musician
                    together poured forth the passion of a divine despair, the passion which, in its
                    deepest woe and highest pain, thinks but of saving the creature that it suffers

                <p>He did not know anything about him, but looked up at the sun, which was sinking
                    downward faintly in the dreamy warmth of the pale green west, and wondered where
                    Pergolesi was, beyond those realms of light, those beams of glory?</p>
                <p>Was he chanting the Salve Regina now?</p>
                <p>Between him and the radiance of the setting sun stood the little figure of Gemma,
                    her hair all aflame with the light; hair like Titianâs Magdalen and Slave and
                    Venus, like the hair that Bronzino has given to the Angel who brings the tidings
                    of the Annunciation, carrying the spray of lilies in his hand.</p>
                <p>âOh, you mammamia!â she cried, in derision, stopping short, with her brown little
                    sister bowed down beside her under the weight of some earthen pots that they had
                    been sent to buy in the Lastra.</p>
                <p>âOh, you mammamia!â cried Gemma, munching a S. Michaelâs summer pear that some
                    one had given her in the Lastra for the sake of her pretty little round face
                    with its angelic eyes.</p>

                <p>Signa took Palmaâs flowerâpots on his own back, and smiled back at Gemma.</p>
                <p>âI have nothing to do before bedtime,â he said: âI will carry these up for
                    you.â</p>
                <p>âAnd then we can play in the garden,â said Gemma, jumping off her rosy feet as
                    she finished the pear. âBut what were you thinking of? staring at the
                    clouds?â</p>
                <p>âOf a dead man that was a very great man, dear, I think, and made beautiful
                    music.â</p>
                <p>âOnly that!â said Gemma, with a pout of her pretty lips; throwing away her pear
                    stalks.</p>
                <p>âTell us about him,â said Palma.</p>
                <p>âI do not know anything,â said Signa, sadly. âHe has left half his soul in the
                    music and the other half must beâthere.â</p>
                <p>He looked up again into the west.</p>
                <p>The two little girls walked along in the dust, one on each side of him; Palma
                    wished he would not think so of dead people; Gemma was pondering on the veiled
                    glories of the puppets, of whose exploits Toto had told her marvels.</p>
                <p>âOh, Signa! if we could only see the <foreign xml:lang="ita">buratâ<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7155-195"/> tini!</foreign>â she murmured, as they trotted
                    onward; she had been sighing her heart out before the tent.</p>
                <p>âThe <foreign xml:lang="ita">burattini</foreign>?â said Signa. âYes. Gian
                    Lambrochini would have given me the money to go; but I would as soon hear the
                    geese hiss or the frogs croak.â</p>
                <p>âYou might have gone inâreally <emph>in</emph>?âand seen them, murders and all?â
                    said Gemma, with wideâopened eyes of amazement.</p>
                <p>âYes.â</p>
                <p>âMoney to go in!âto go in!âAnd you did not take the money even!â</p>
                <p>âNo; I did not wish to go.â</p>
                <p>âBut you might have given it to <emph>me</emph>! <emph>I</emph> might have
                    gone!â</p>
                <p>The enormity of her loss and of his folly overcame her. She stood in the road and
                    stared blankly at him.</p>
                <p>âThat would not have been fair to the Lambrochini,â said Palma, who was a sturdy
                    little maiden as to right and wrong.</p>
                <p>âNoâand he so poor himself, and so old!â said Signa. âIt would not have been
                    fair, Gemma.â</p>
                <pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7155-196"/>
                <p>âIf you were fond of me, would you think of what was âfairâ? You would think of
                    amusing me. It is a shame of you, Signaâa burning shame! And longing to see
                    those puppets as I have doneâcrying my eyes out before the tent! It is
                    wicked.â</p>
                <p>âDear, I am sorry,â murmured Signa. âBut, indeedâindeed, I never thought of
                    you.â</p>
                <p>âAnd never thought of all you might have got with the money!â</p>
                <p>Gemma twisted herself on one side, putting up her plump little shoulders,
                    sullenly, into her ears, with a scowl on her face.</p>
                <p>It cost a whole coinâten centimesâto go in to even the cheapest standingâplaces
                    in the theatre, and with a whole coin you could get a big round sweet cake for
                    five centimes, and for another centime a handful of melonâseeds, and for another
                    a bit of chocolate, and for another two figs, and for the fourth and fifth and
                    last a painted saint in sugar. And he might have brought all those treasures to
                    her!</p>
                <p>Gemma, between her two companions, felt the immeasurable disdain of the practical
                        intelliâ<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7155-197"/> gence for the idle dreamer and
                    the hypercritical moralist. She trotted on in the dust sulkily; a little rosy
                    and auburn figure in the shadows, as if she were a Botticelli cherub put into
                    life and motion.</p>
                <p>âYou are cross, dear!â said Signa, with a sigh, putting his hand round her throat
                    to caress her back into content. But Gemma shook him off, and trotted on alone
                    in outraged dignity.</p>
                <p>They climbed the steep ascent of grassy and broken ground past the parish church,
                    with the sombre convent above amongst its cypresses, and the wilder hills with
                    their low woodland growth green and dark and fresh against the south, and then
                    entered the great gardens of Giovoli, where Sandro Zambetto worked all the years
                    of his life amongst the lemons and magnolia trees.</p>
                <p>The villa was uninhabited; but the gardens were cultivated by its owner, and the
                    flowers and fruits were sent into the city market, and in the winter down to
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>âAre you cross still, Gemma?â said Signa, when he had put the big pots down in
                    the toolâ<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7155-198"/> house. Gemma glanced at him with her
                    forefinger in her mouth.</p>
                <p>âWill you play? What shall we play at?â said Signa, coaxingly. âCome! It shall be
                    anything you like to choose. Palma does not mind.â</p>
                <p>Gemma took her finger out of her mouth and pointed to some Alexandrian apricots
                    golden and round against the high wall opposite them.</p>
                <p>âGet me four big ones and I will play.â</p>
                <p>âOh, Gemma!â cried Palma, piteously. âThose are the very best, the Alexandria S.
                    Johns for the padrone!â</p>
                <p>âI know,â said Gemma.</p>
                <p>âBut the fattore counted them this very morning, and knows every one there is,
                    and will blame father if one be gone, and father will beat Signa or make Nita
                    beat him!â</p>
                <p>âBesides, it is stealing, Gemma,â said Signa.</p>
                <p>âChÃ¨!â said little Gemma, with unmeasured scorn. âYou can climb there,
                    Signa?â</p>
                <p>âYes, I can climb; but you do not wish me to do wrong to please you, dear?â</p>
                <pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7155-199"/>
                <p>âYes, I do,â said Gemma.</p>
                <p>âOh, Gemma, then I cannot!â murmured Signa, sadly. âIf it were only myselfâbut it
                        <emph>is</emph> wrong, dear, and your father would be blamed. Palma is
                    right.â</p>
                <p>âChÃ¨!â said Gemma, again, with her little red mouth thrust out. âWill you go and
                    get them, Signa?â</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Signa.</p>
                <p>âTista!â cried Gemma, with her sweetest little chirp, and flew through the
                    twilight fragrance. âTista! Tista! Tista!â</p>
                <p>Tista was Giovanni Baptista, the twelveâyearâold son of fellowâlabourer of
                    Giovoli, who lived on the other side of the wall; a big brown boy, who was her
                    slave.</p>
                <p>Signa ran after her.</p>
                <p>âNo, No! Gemma, come back!â</p>
                <p>Gemma glanced over her shoulder.</p>
                <p>âTista will get them, and he will swing me in the big tree afterwards.â</p>
                <p>âNo! Gemma, listenâcome back! Gemmaâlisten, I will get them.â</p>
                <p>Gemma stood still, and laughed.</p>
                <pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7155-200"/>
                <p>âGet them first, then I will come back; but Tista will do as well as you. And he
                    swings me better. He is bigger.â</p>
                <p>Signa climbed up the wall, bruising his arms and wounding his feet, for the
                    stones of it were sharp, and there was hardly any foothold; but, with some
                    effort he got the apricots and dropped to the ground with them, and ran to
                    Gemma.</p>
                <p>âHere! Now you will not go to Tista? But, oh, Gemma, why make me do such a thing?
                    It is a wrong thingâit is very wrong!â</p>
                <p>âI did not make you do anything,â said Gemma, receiving the fruit into her skirt.
                    âI did not make you. I said Tista would do as well.â</p>
                <p>Signa was silent.</p>
                <p>She did not even thank him. She did not even offer to share the spoils. He was no
                    nearer her good graces than he had been before he had sinned to please her.</p>
                <p>âOh, Signa! I never, never would have believed!â murmured Palma, ready to cry,
                    and powerless to act.</p>
                <p>âShe wished it so. She would have gone to<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7155-201"/>
                    Tista,â said Signa, and stood and watched the little child eating the fruit with
                    all the pretty pecking ardour of a chaffinch. Gemma laughed as she sat down upon
                    the grass to enjoy her stolen goods at fuller ease. When she had got her own
                    way, all her goodâhumour returned.</p>
                <p>âWhat sillies you are!â she said, looking at the tearful eye of her sister, and
                    at Signa standing silent in the shade.</p>
                <p>âIt is you who is cruel, Gemma,â said Palma, and went, with her little black head
                    hung down, into the house, because, though she was only ten years old, she was
                    the mistress of it, and had to cook and sweep and wash, and hoe the cabbages and
                    bake the bread, or else the floors remained filthy and the hungry boys shirtless
                    and unfed.</p>
                <p>Gemma did not know that she was cruel. She was anything that served her purpose
                    best and brought her the most pleasureâthat was all.</p>
                <p>She ate her apricots with the glee of a little mouse eating a bit of cheese.
                    Signa watched her. It was all the recompense he had.</p>
                <p>He knew that he had been weak, and had<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7155-202"/> done
                    wrong, because the fruit trees were under Sandroâs charge, who had no right to
                    any of it, being a man paid by the week, and without any share in what he helped
                    to cultivate; and this on the south wall being the very choicest of it all,
                    Sandro had threatened his children with dire punishment if they should dare even
                    to touch what should fall.</p>
                <p>When she had eaten the last one, Gemma jumped up. Signa caught her.</p>
                <p>âYou will kiss me now, and come and play? There is just half an hour.â</p>
                <p>But Gemma twisted herself away, laughing gleefully.</p>
                <p>âNo; I shall go and swing with Tista.â</p>
                <p>âOh, Gemma! when you promisedââ</p>
                <p>âI never promised,â said Gemma.</p>
                <p>âYou said you would come back.â</p>
                <p>Gemma laughed her merriest at his face of astonished reproach.</p>
                <p>âI did come back; but I am going again. Tista swings better than you.â</p>
                <p>And with her little carols of laughter rippling away among the leaves, Gemma ran
                    off and<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7155-203"/> darted through a low door and banged
                    it behind her, and called aloud:</p>
                <p>âTista! Tista! Come and swing me!â</p>
                <p>In a few moments on the other side above the wall her little body curled upon the
                    rope, and her sunny head, as yellow as a marigold, were seen flying in a
                    semicircle up into the boughs of the high magnolia trees, while she laughed on
                    and called louder:</p>
                <p>âHigher, higher, Tista!âhigher!â</p>
                <p>Signa could see her, and could hearâthat was all the reward he had.</p>
                <p>He sat down disconsolate near the old broken statue by the waterâlilies.</p>
                <p>He was too proud to follow her and to dispute with Tista.</p>
                <p>âI will not waste another hour on herâever!â he thought, with bitterness in his
                    heart. There were the lute and the music in the quiet sacristy; and old fragrant
                    silent hills so full of dreams for him; and Bruno, who loved him and never
                    cheated him; and the nightingales that told him a thousand stories of their
                    lives amongst the myrtles; and the stones of the Lastra that<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7155-204"/> had the tales of the great dead written on them:âwhen
                    he had all these, why should he waste his few spare precious minutes on this
                    faithless, saucy, sulky, ungrateful little child?</p>
                <p>His heart was very heavy as he heard her laughter. She had made him do wrong, and
                    then had mocked at him and left him.</p>
                <p>âI will never think about her, never any more!â he said to himself while the
                    shadows darkened and the bats flew out and the glowworms twinkled, and in the
                    dusk he could still just see the golden head of Gemma flying in the bronzed
                    leaves of the magnolias.</p>
                <p>After a while her laughter and her swinging ceased.</p>
                <p>The charm of perfect silence fell on the grand old garden. He sat on, soothed and
                    yet sorrowful. The place was beautiful to him, even without Gemma.</p>
                <p>In the garden of these children all the flora of Italy was gathered and was
                    growing.</p>
                <p>The delights of an Italian garden are countless. It is not like any other garden
                    in the world. It is at once more formal and more<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7155-205"/> wild, at once greener with more abundant youth and venerable with more
                    antique age. It has all Boccaccio between its walls, all Petrarca in its leaves,
                    all Raffaelle in its skies. And then the sunshine that beggars words and laughs
                    at painters!âthe boundless, intense, delicious, heavenly light! What do other
                    gardens know of that, save in orangeâgroves of Grenada and roseâthickets of
                    Damascus?</p>
                <p>The old broken marble statues, whence the water dripped and fed the waterâlily;
                    the great lemonâtrees in pots big enough to drown a boy, the golden globes among
                    their emerald leaves; the magnolias, like trees cast in bronze, with all the
                    spice of India in their cups; the spires of ivory bells that the yuccas put
                    forth, like belfries for fairies; the oleanders taller than a man, red and white
                    and blush colour; the broad velvet leaves of the flowering rush; the dark
                    majestic ilex oaks, that made the noon like twilight; the countless graces of
                    the vast family of acacias; the high box hedges, sweet and pungent in the sun;
                    the stone ponds, where the goldâfish slept through the sultry day; the
                    wilderness of carnaâ<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7155-206"/> tions; the huge roses,
                    yellow, crimson, snowâwhite, and the small noisette and the banksia with its
                    million of pink stars; myrtles in dense thickets, and camellias like a wood of
                    evergreens; cacti in all quaint shapes, like fossils astonished to find
                    themselves again alive; high walls, vineâhung and topped by pines and cypresses;
                    low walls with crowds of geraniums on their parapets, and the mountains and the
                    fields beyond them; marble basins hidden in creepers where the frogs dozed all
                    day long; sounds of convent bells and of chapel chimes; green lizards basking on
                    the flags; great sheds and granaries beautiful with the clematis and the
                    wisteria and the rosy trumpets of the bignonia; great wooden places cool and
                    shady, with vast arched entrances, and scent of hay, and empty casks, and red
                    earthen amphorÃ¦, and little mice scudding on the floors, and a sunâdial painted
                    on the wall, and a crucifix set above the weathercock, and through the huge
                    unglazed windows sight of the green vines with the bullocks in the harvestâcarts
                    beneath them, or of some hilly sunlit road with a muleâteam coming down it, or
                    of a blue high<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7155-207"/> hill with its pineâtrees black
                    against the sky, and on its slopes the yellow corn and misty olive. This was
                    their garden; it is ten thousand other gardens in the land.</p>
                <p>The old painters had these gardens, and walked in them, and thought nothing
                    better could be needed for any scene of Annunciation or Adoration, and so put
                    them in beyond the windows of Bethlehem or behind the Throne of the Lambâand who
                    can wonder?</p>
                <p>The mighty lives have passed away into silence, leaving no likeness to them on
                    earth; but if you would still hold communion with them, even better than to go
                    to written score or printed book or painted panel or chiselled marble or
                    cloistered gloom, is it to stray into one of these old quiet gardens, where for
                    hundred of years the stone naiad has leaned over the fountain, and the golden
                    lizard hidden under the fallen caryatide, and sit quiet still, and let the
                    stones tell you what they remember and the leaves say what the sun once saw; and
                    then the shades of the great dead will come to you. Only you must love them
                    truly, else you will see them never.</p>
                <pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7155-208"/>
                <p>Signa, in his little ignorant way, did love them with just such blind untaught
                    love as a little bird born in a dark cage has for the air and the light.</p>
                <p>When he stole into the deserted villas, where, after centuries of neglect, some
                    fresco would glow still upon the damp walls where the cobwebs and the wild vine
                    had their way; when he saw the sculptured cornices and the gilded fretwork and
                    the broken mosaic in the halls where cattle were stabled and grain piled; when
                    he knelt down before the dusky nameless Madonnas in the little churches on the
                    hills, or found some marble head lying amongst the wild thyme, the boyâs heart
                    moved with a longing and a tenderness to which he could have given no title.</p>
                <p>As passion yet unknown thrills in the adolescent, as maternity yet undreamed of
                    stirs in the maiden; so the love of art comes to the artist before he can give a
                    voice to his thought or any name to his desire.</p>
                <p>Signa heard âbeautiful thingsâ as he sat in the rising moonlight, with the bells
                    of the little bindweed white about his feet.</p>
                <pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7155-209"/>
                <p>That was all he could have said.</p>
                <p>Whether the angels sent them on the breeze, or the birds brought them, or the
                    dead men came and sang them to him, he could not tell. Indeed, who can tell?</p>
                <p>Where did Guido see the golden hair of S. Michael gleam upon the wind? Where did
                    Mozart hear the awful cries of the risen dead come to judgment? What voice was
                    in the fountain of Vaucluse? Under what nodding oxlip did Shakespeare find
                    Titania asleep? When did the Mother of Love come down, chaster in her unclothed
                    loveliness than vestal in her veil, and with such vision of her make obscure
                    Cleomenes immortal?</p>
                <p>Who can tell?</p>
                <p>Signa sat dreaming, with his chin upon his hands, and his eyes wandering over all
                    the silent place, from the closed flowers at his feet to the moon in her circles
                    of mist.</p>
                <p>Who walks in these paths now may go back four hundred years. They are changed in
                    nothing. Through their high hedges of rhododendron and of jessamine that grow
                    like woodland trees it<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7155-210"/> would still seem but
                    natural to see Raffaelle with his courtâtrain of students, or Signorelli
                    splendid in those apparellings which were the comment of his age; and on these
                    broad stone terraces with the lizards basking on their steps and the trees
                    opening to show a vineâcovered hill with the white oxen creeping down it and the
                    blue mountains farther still behind, it would be but fitting to see a dark
                    figure sitting and painting lilies, upon a golden ground, or cherubsâ heads upon
                    a panel of cypress wood, and to hear that this painter was the monk
                    Angelico.</p>
                <p>The deepest charm of these old gardens, as of their country, is, after all, that
                    in them it is possible to forget the present age.</p>
                <p>In the full, drowsy, voluptuous noon, when they are a gorgeous blaze of colour
                    and a very intoxication of fragrance, as in the ethereal white moonlight of
                    midnight, when, with the silver beams and the white blossoms and the pale
                    marbles, they are like a world of snow, their charm is one of rest, silence,
                    leisure, dreams, and passion all in one; they belong to the days when art was a
                    living power, when love was a<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7155-211"/> thing of heaven
                    or of hell, and when men had the faith of children and the force of gods.</p>
                <p>Those days are dead, but in these old gardens you can believe still that you live
                    in them.</p>
                <p>The boy, who did not know hardly why he was moved by it so greatly, musing in
                    this garden of Giovoli, and sitting, watching the glowworms in the ground
                    bindweed, was more than half consoled for the cruelty of his playmate. When the
                    nine oâclock chimes rang down below in the Lastra, he did not move; he had
                    forgotten that if he were away when Nita should shut her house up he would have
                    another beating and no supper.</p>
                <p>How often was Giotto scolded for letting the sheep stray?</p>
                <p>Very often, no doubt.</p>
                <p>When the moon had quite risen, with a ring of mist round her, because there was
                    rain hanging in the air, little feet ran over the bindweed, and a little rosy
                    face, all the prettier for the shadows that played in its eyes and the watery
                    radiance that shone in its curls, looked up into his with saucy merriment.</p>
                <pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7155-212"/>
                <p>A little piping voice ran like a cricketâs chirp into the stillness.</p>
                <p>âYou may swing me toâmorrowâdo you hear?â</p>
                <p>Signa started, roused from his musing.</p>
                <p>The beautiful things were mute; the clouds and the leaves told him nothing more.
                    He was only a little bareâfooted boy, vexed at being left alone and jealous of
                    big brown Tista.</p>
                <p>Gemma was a pretty sulky baby, with a pert tongue and a sturdy will of her own; a
                    little thing that could not read a letter, and cared nothing but for eating and
                    for play; but there were shadowed out in her the twin foes of all geniusâthe
                    Woman and the World.</p>
                <p>âAre you sulking here?â said Gemma. âTista swung me so high!âso high! Much better
                    than you. You must get out of the garden now; father is come to lock the
                    gates.â</p>
                <p>Signa got up slowly.</p>
                <p>âGoodânight, Gemma.â</p>
                <p>âGoodânight, Gemma!â echoed the child, mimicking the sadness of his answer. âOh,
                    how stupid you are! Just like Palma! Tista has<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7155-213"/>
                    more life in him, only he never has anything for one except those little green
                    apples. You may come and swing me tomorrow, if you like.â</p>
                <p>âNo; you love Tista.â</p>
                <p>âBut I love you best.â</p>
                <p>She whispered it with all the wooing archness and softness of twenty years
                    instead of ten, with the moonbeams shining in her eyes till they looked like wet
                    cornflowers.</p>
                <p>Signa was silent. He knew she did not love him, but only his pears that he got
                    for her from Bruno, or his baked cakes that he coaxed for her from old
                    Teresina.</p>
                <p>âYou will come toâmorrow?â said Gemma, slipping her hand into his.</p>
                <p>âYou will flout me if I do come.â</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Gemma.</p>
                <p>âYes, you will. It is always like that.â</p>
                <p>âTry,â said Gemma; and she kissed him.</p>
                <p>âI will come,â said Signa; and he went away through the dewy darkness, forgetting
                    the stolen apricots and the choice of Tista. It was so very seldom that she
                    would kiss him, and she looked so pretty in the moonlight.</p>
                <pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7155-214"/>
                <p>Gemma glanced after him through the bars of the high iron gate with the japonica
                    and jessamine twisting round its coronet.</p>
                <p>Tista was going away on the morrow into the city to be bound âprentice to a
                    shoemaker, who was his motherâs cousin, and had offered to take him cheaply.</p>
                <p>But it had not been worth while to tell Signa that.</p>
                <p>âThere would have been nobody to swing me if I had not coaxed him,â thought
                    Gemma; âand perhaps he will bring me one of those big sweet round pears of
                    Brunoâs.â</p>
                <p>And the little child, well contented, ran off under her fatherâs shrill scolding
                    for being out so late, and went indoors and drink a draught of milk that Palma
                    had begged for her from a neighbour who had a cow, and slipped herself out of
                    her little blue shirt and homespun skirt, and curled herself up on her bed of
                    hay and fell fast asleep, looking like a sculptorâs sleeping Love.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                <p><hi>A FEW</hi> days later fell the feast of SS. Peter and Paul, and Signa for
                    more than half a year had been promised a great treat.</p>
                <p>Bruno had said that on that day he would take him to see the marble men and the
                    painted angels of the Certosa Monastery, some ten miles away along the bend of
                    the the green Greve water.</p>
                <p>What Bruno promised he did always; the child had the surest faith of his word;
                    and by five oâclock in the fair sunrise of the June morning, Signa slipped down
                    the dark staircase, and undid the door and ran out bareheaded into the sweet
                    cold air, and stood waiting on the stones.</p>
                <p>The Madonna of Good Council smiled on him through her wooden wicket; bells were
                        ringing<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7155-216"/> over the country around; some
                    tender hand had already placed before the shrine a fresh bunch of field flowers;
                    the sky was red with the rose of the daybreak.</p>
                <p>He had not waited long before a tall figure turned the corner, and Brunoâs shadow
                    fell upon the slope.</p>
                <p>âYou are ready? That is right,â he said, and without more words the child ran on
                    by his side out of the lofty Fiorentina gate.</p>
                <p>The morning was fresh and radiant, very cold, as it always is in midsummer,
                    before the sun has warmed the earth and drunk up the deep night dews that drench
                    the soil.</p>
                <p>The shutters of the houses were unclosing and through the open doors, and in the
                    darkness of the cellars there was the yellow gleam of wheat, cut and waiting for
                    the threshers; the gardens and yards were yellow, too, with piles of strawâhats
                    wetted and drying; the shadows were broad and black; men were beginning their
                    work in the great arched smithies and workshops; there was everywhere the smell
                    of the wet earth refreshed and cooled by night.</p>
                <pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7155-217"/>
                <p>They went along the road that leads to the Greve river;âpast the big stone barns
                    where the flails would be at rest all day for sake of good SS. Peter and Paul;
                    past the piles of timber and felled firâtrees that strewed the edge of the road;
                    past the old grey villa of the Della Stufa who nigh a thousand years before had
                    come over the mountains, Christian knights and gallant gentlemen, with their red
                    cross and their tawny lions on their shields; the chapel bell was calling the
                    scattered cotters of Castagnolo to first mass; past the pretty bridge of the
                    Stagno (the pool) with its views of the far mountains, and the poplarâtrees that
                    the Latins named so because of the restlessness of their leaves, like the
                    unresting mob; past the great fortress of the Castel Pucci, once built to hurl
                    defiance at the city itself, now white and silent, sheltering in its walls the
                    woeful pain, and yet more woeful joys, of minds diseased; past the worthy
                    barberâs shop, where it is written up that he has only painted his sign with the
                    tricolour to quiet tasteless whirligigs, he being a man of humour, with a pity
                    kindred to contempt of all the weathercock<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7155-218"/>
                    vagaries of politics; past the old dirty, tumbleâdown, wayside houses, where the
                    floors were strewn with the new straw picked for the plaiting, and the babies
                    were lying in flat fruitâbaskets, swaddled and laughing, and the girls were
                    getting ready for mass with bright petticoats and braided hair and big earrings,
                    and, if they were betrothed maidens, strings of pearls about their throats; past
                    all these till they came to the Greve bridge, where they met a priest with the
                    Host in the brightness of the festal dayâdawn.</p>
                <p>They uncovered their heads and knelt down in the dust and prayed for the passing
                    soul till the little bell, borne before the holy man, had <choice>
                        <sic>tinckled</sic>
                        <corr>tinkled</corr>
                    </choice> away in the distance. Then they walked on by the Greve water under the
                    shivering poplars and amongst the grazing sheep.</p>
                <p>There is no regular path along the river; but they made one for themselves,
                    brushing through the canes, getting round the rushes, or when it was needed,
                    wading kneeâdeep, or oftener, for the water was low, walking in the stony sand
                    of the dry river bed.</p>
                <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7155-219"/>
                <p>Once it was a warlike water enough, in the old days when the Lotteringhi and
                    Alberti, and Acciajoli and Pandolfini, and all the other great races, Guelph and
                    Ghibelline, had their fortified places bristling along its banks; when its stone
                    landing quays were crowded with condottieri watering their horses ere they went
                    to lend their lances to the strongest; when mighty nobles in penitence raised
                    shrines and built hospitals beside it to seek Godâs grace upon their arms; when
                    the long lines of pilgrims wound along it, or the creeping files of sumpter
                    mules, of the bright array of the White Company; in those days Greve was a busy
                    stream, and was as often as not made red with the blood let out in many a
                    skirmish or the reflected flames from a castle fired in feud.</p>
                <p>But all that is of the past. Now it is only a millrace, a washing pool, a ford, a
                    fishing burn, anything the people liked to make of it; it sees nothing but the
                    millerâs mules or the grape waggons, or the women with their piles of white
                    linen; and the only battles it beholds are the fighting of the frogs in the
                    canebrake or of the<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7155-220"/> tree sparrows in the air.
                    Now the Greve is a simple pastoral river. No one has ever sung of it that one
                    knows. It lies so near to the Arno, held dear by every poet and made sacred by
                    every art, that the little Greve is as a daisy set beside a crown diamond; and
                    no one thinks of it.</p>
                <p>Yet perhapsâonly one dare not say so for oneâs lifeâperhaps it has as much real
                    loveliness as Arno has. It has the same valleyâit has the same mountainsâit is
                    encompassed by the same scenes and memories; and it has a sylvan beauty, all of
                    its own, like Wyeâs or Dartâs or Derwentâs.</p>
                <p>Grassy banks where the sheep browse; tall poplars, great oaks, rich walnuts,
                    firs, and maples, and silver larch, and the beautiful cercis that blossoms all
                    over in a night; calm stretches of green water, with green hills that lock it
                    in; old waterâmills, halfâhidden in maize and dogâgrass and plumy reeds; broken
                    ground above with winding roads from which the mule bells echo now and then;
                    steep heights, golden with grain, or fragrant with hay, and dusky with<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7155-221"/> the dark emerald leaf of the innumerable
                    vines; deep sense of coolness, greenness, restfulness everywhere; and then,
                    where the riverâs windings meet its sister stream the Ema, set in a narrow gorge
                    between two hills, yet visible all along the reaches of the water while far off,
                    the mastery of the Carthusiansâthe Certosaâending all the sweet song of peace
                    with a great hymn to God.</p>
                <p>This is the Greveâwith flowering rushes in it, and the sun in its water till it
                    glows like emeralds, and goats going down to drink, and here and there a woman
                    cutting the green canes, and dragonâflies and swallows on the wing, and oxen
                    crossing the flat timber bridge, and from the woods and rocks above the sound of
                    chapel bells and reapersâ voices falling through the air, softly as dropping
                    leaves.</p>
                <p>Bruno and the child kept always along the course of the water, walking in its bed
                    or climbing its banks as necessity made them.</p>
                <p>Bruno was never a man of many words; the national loquacity was not his; he was
                    fierce, sudden, taciturn, but he smiled on the little ladâs<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7155-222"/> ecstasies, and though he could tell him none of the
                    ten thousand things that Signa wished to know, yet he said nothing that did not
                    suit the joyous and poetic mood of the child; for though Bruno was an ignorant
                    man, except in husbandry, Love is sympathy, and Sympathy is intelligence in a
                    strong degree.</p>
                <p>Signa was wildly happy; leaping from stone to stone; splashing in the shallow
                    water with a jump; calling to the gossipping frogs; flinging the firâapples in
                    the air; clapping his hands as the fieldâmice peeped out from the lines of cut
                    grain; wondering where the poppies were all gone that a week before had ârun
                    like torchmen with the wheat.â</p>
                <p>Once, his hands filled with blossoms and creepers from the hedges, he stopped to
                    gather a little blue cornflower that had outlived the corn as mortals do their
                    joys.</p>
                <p>âWhy is it called St. Stephenâs crown?â he asked.</p>
                <p>âHow should I tell?â said Bruno; for indeed it seemed to him the silliest name
                    that could be.</p>
                <pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7155-223"/>
                <p>âDo you think it saw when they stoned him, and was sorry?â said Signa.</p>
                <p>âHow should a flower see? You talk foolishness.â</p>
                <p>âFlowers see the sun.â</p>
                <p>âThat is foolish talk.â</p>
                <p>âAnd the moon, too, else how could they keep time and shut and go to bed? And
                    somebody must have named them allâwho was it?â</p>
                <p>Bruno was silent. Cattle liked dried flowers in their hay, and horses would not
                    eat them; that was all he knew about them, and when the child persisted,
                    answered him:</p>
                <p>âThe saints, most likely.â</p>
                <p>But he said within himself:</p>
                <p>âIf only the boy would pull off lizardsâ tails, or snare birds, like other boys
                    instead of asking such odd questions that make on think him hardly sensible
                    sometimes!â</p>
                <p>Signa, a little pacified, gathered his hands full, and ran on, puzzling his
                    little brain in silence. He had a fancy that St. John had named them all one day
                    out of gladness of heart<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7155-224"/> when Christ had
                    kissed him. That was what he thought, running by the Greve water.</p>
                <p>Who did indeed first name the flowers? Who first gave them, not their Latin
                    titles, but the old, familiar, fanciful, poetic, rustic ones that run so
                    curiously alike in all the different vulgar tongues?</p>
                <p>Who first called the lilies of the valley the Madonnaâs tears; the wild blue
                    hyacinth St. Dorothyâs flower? Who first called the red clusters of the oleander
                    St. Josephâs nosegays, and the clematis by her many lovely titles, consolation,
                    travellerâs joy, virginâs bower? Who gave the spiderwort to St. Bruno; the black
                    briony for Our Ladyâs Seal; the cornâfeverfew to St. Anne; the common bean to
                    St. Ignatius; the baneâberry to St. Christopher; the blue valerian to Jacob for
                    his angelâs ladder; the toywort to the shepherds for their purse? Who first
                    called the nyctanthes the tree of sadness; and the starry passiflora the Passion
                    of Christ? Who first made dedication of the narcissus to remembrance; the
                    amaranthus to wounded, bleeding love; the scabius to the<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7155-225"/> desolation of widowhood? Who named them all first in
                    the old days that are forgotten?</p>
                <p>It is strange that most of these tender old appellatives are the same in meaning
                    in all European tongues. The little German madchen in her pinewoods, and the
                    Tuscan contadina in her vineyards, and the Spanish child on the sierras, and the
                    farmâgirl on the purple English moorlands, and the softâeyed peasant that drives
                    her milch cows through the sunny evening fields of France, all gathering their
                    blossoms from wayside green or garden wall, give them almost all the same old
                    names with the same sweet pathetic significance. Who gave them first?</p>
                <p>Milton and Spenser and Shelley, Tasso and Schiller and Camoensâall the poets that
                    ever the world has known, might have been summoned together for the baptism of
                    the flowers, and have failed to name them half so well as popular tradition has
                    done, long ago in the dim lost ages, with names that still make all the world
                    akin.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the man and boy came to a wooden bridge that bullocks were crossing,
                    with flowers in their frontlets and red tassels. There was a<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7155-226"/> broken arch beyond of a bridge that Greve had thrown
                    down in flood. The reaped wheat was lying on the hills. The long cool grass
                    tossed about to the waterâs edge. Children were fishing in the shallows.</p>
                <p>Up above there was an open space, with a house that had a green bough over its
                    door, and men drinking, and mules resting with their noses in fresh cut cane
                    leaves. Here they left the bed of the stream, and went up on the high path that
                    goes along the wooded heights with the bold green bluffs on either side, and the
                    vines below, and the river under the aspens between them.</p>
                <p>They went along the path which is hardly more than a mule and ox track, rising
                    higher and higher, with the blue mountains behind them, through the blackberry
                    brambles and the starry clematis, and the wild myrtle, and the innumerable hill
                    flowers of all hues, and past a rambling farmâhouse called Assinaria, with old
                    arched doorways, and a boy drawing water by a rope, standing in a high unglazed
                    window, with blue shirt and brown limbs, against the dark behind him, like a
                    figure painted upon an oaken<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7155-227"/> panel; and then <choice>
                        <sic>ancle</sic>
                        <corr>ankle</corr>
                    </choice>âdeep through the sea of yellow corn strewn all about around the place
                    awaiting threshing, and out on to a knoll of rock set thick with rosemary, and
                    so on in view of the Certosa.</p>
                <p>The Certosa, afar off, above the stream with the woods in front beneath it, so
                    that it seemed lifted on a forest throne of verdure against the morning
                    splendour of the east; as he saw it, Signa was still a minute, and drew a deep,
                    long breath.</p>
                <p>Approached from the Roman road the monastery is nothing; a pile of buildings,
                    irregular, and only grand by its extent, on a bare crest of rock; but approached
                    from the Greve river, when the morning sun, shining behind it, shrouds its vast
                    pile in golden mist, and darkens the wooded valley at its feet, the monastery is
                    beautiful, and all the faith and the force of the age that begot it are in it:
                    it is a Te Deum in stone.</p>
                <p>âIt looks as if the angels fought there,â said Signa, with hushed awe, as he
                    stood on the sward and made the sign of the cross; and indeed it has a look as
                    of a fortress, Acciajoli,<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7155-228"/> when he raised and
                    consecrated it, having prayed the Republic to let him make it warâproof and
                    braced for battle.</p>
                <p>âMen fight the devil there,â said Bruno, believing what he said.</p>
                <p>The chimes of the monastery were ringing out for the first mass; deep bells and
                    of sweet tone, that came down the river like a benediction on the day.</p>
                <p>Signa kneeled down in the grass.</p>
                <p>âDid you pray for the holy men?â Bruno asked him when they rose, and they went on
                    under the tall, green, quivering trees.</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Signa, under his breath. âI prayed for the devil.â</p>
                <p>â<emph>For</emph> him!â echoed Bruno aghast, âwhat are you about, child? are you
                    possessed? do you know what the good priests would say?â</p>
                <p>âI prayed for him,â said Signa, with that persistency which ran with his docile
                    temper. âIt is he who wants it. To be wicked <emph>there</emph> where God is,
                    and the sun, and the bells.â</p>
                <p>âBut he is the foe of God. It is horrible to pray for him.â</p>
                <pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7155-229"/>
                <p>âNo,â said Signa, sturdily. âGod says we are to forgive our enemies and help
                    them. I only asked him to begin with His.â</p>
                <p>Bruno was silent. He did not know what to say to the boy. The devil to him was a
                    terrible reality; had he not seen him with his black, foul deformity and
                    flameâvomiting jaws on the frescoed walls, whenever he had entered any church in
                    the heat of noon, to sit a little and turn his face to the pillars, and hear the
                    murmurs of low mass in some side chapel?</p>
                <p>The devil lived in the flesh for Bruno; the devil had made him stab Pippa; the
                    devil was always in the fire of his tongue, and in the haste of his hand; and
                    these holy painters of the church had surely seen the devil in the flesh, or how
                    could they ever have portrayed him?</p>
                <p>âPray for those the devil enters, carino,â he said, sadly. âWhen you have done
                    with them it will be time to pray for him, and they count by tens of
                    thousands.â</p>
                <p>âIt is best to pray for him, himself,â said Signa, with his docile determination
                    to keep his own ideas which Nita so constantly endeavoured<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7155-230"/> to thrash out of him. âPerhaps men made him bad,
                    because they would not leave him any hope of being better.â</p>
                <p>âDo no talk of those things, the priests would not like it, Signa,â said Bruno,
                    to whom such a manner of speaking of Satan seemed impiousâonly the child was so
                    youngâheaven, he trusted would not be angry.</p>
                <p>Signa was silent; he obeyed an order always; only he kept his own ideas; it was
                    as a dog obeys a call, but keeps its instincts.</p>
                <p>But his joyous chatter was subdued. He kept looking up at the great monastery
                    above the woods, that was all in a glow of sunlight, and where men fought the
                    devil, and, perhaps, saw God.</p>
                <p>âI would not fight him,â he thought to himself. âI would just bring him out, and
                    tell him to look down the river, and I think he would take no more pleasure in
                    hell then.â</p>
                <p>And he fancied he saw goldenâhaired Michael and the angel that was called Gabriel
                    leading the dark incarnate Sin out there, into the light, till the sun changed
                    his sable wings to silver.</p>
                <pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7155-231"/>
                <p>Satan was as real to him as to Bruno; only he felt sorry for him, always sorry,
                    when he heard the priests talk of him and saw the old terrible pictures on the
                    walls of all the woe he wrought and the devouring flames.</p>
                <p>Signa had thought a great deal about all these thingsâsitting in the dusky aisle
                    with his hand telling his beads and his little hot feet on the cold pavement,
                    while they droned out the mass.</p>
                <p>There were other country people waiting to go in; the peasants love these places;
                    you will see them very often in little groups, hushed and yet happy, wandering
                    very quietly through the aisles of the churches or monasteries, or sitting
                    against the columns or in the shade on the altar steps. Though they are a
                    mirthful people at times, and like their lotteries and dominoes and whirling
                    dances and gossiping jokes, there is something in the solemn rest, in the
                    serious dusky stillness, that suits them strangely; the houses of God are really
                    to them abodes of rest; they take their tired limbs there and get repose actual
                    as well as figurative; perhaps they do not think about anything, but sit in a
                    sort of day sleep<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7155-232"/> when their prayers are done;
                    but the influence of the place is with them and their love for it is true.</p>
                <p>A whiteâfrocked brother met them in the long vaulted passageâway, looking as
                    though he had stepped out from some canvas of Del Sartoâs, and they went in with
                    the five other contadini waiting there; Bruno, with his brown cloak on one
                    shoulder and a clean shirt, and the child in rough white linen with a carnation
                    at his throat; a flower in the ear or at the throat is seen here so often with
                    bare legs and feet.</p>
                <p>Signa, aweâstricken and full of the beauty of the place, was mute as they strayed
                    through its cloisters and crypt, and followed the whiteâfrocked brother, and
                    passed other monks kneeling wrapt in prayer or meditation. Only when he came to
                    where the old bishop was asleep in the wonderful marble of Fracesco di San Gallo
                    he was moved by a sudden impulse, and plucked the end of Brunoâs cloak.</p>
                <p>âI should like to sing him something,â he whispered.</p>
                <p>âSing? to whom?â</p>
                <pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7155-233"/>
                <p>âTo that old man,â said Signa, and then coloured, ashamed of himself.</p>
                <p>âHis soul is in heaven, he would be angered,â said Bruno in dismay. âHe hears
                    much better singing than yours. Look! the padre is shocked at you, and in this
                    holy place!â</p>
                <p>Signa hung his head.</p>
                <p>âAre you fond of singing, little fellow?â asked a stranger, who had been looking
                    at the Perugino on the wall.</p>
                <p>Signa nodded shyly.</p>
                <p>âAnd why do you want to sing to the dead bishop?â</p>
                <p>âBecause he is only asleep,â said Signa, timidly, âand it might give him pretty
                    dreams. Old Teresina says she always had good dreams towards morning, because I
                    go under the house singing.â</p>
                <p>âSing, then,â said the stranger, and turned to the monk with some words of
                    entreaty.</p>
                <p>âIf it be a holy song,â said the monk, with reluctant consenting.</p>
                <p>âHe sings well,â said Bruno, with an outbreak of the tender pride in Signa, which
                    he endeavoured to conceal, but could not always.</p>
                <pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7155-234"/>
                <p>Signa was shy and silent for a minute; he wished he had not spoken of doing it,
                    with this grand strange signore there; but the old dead manâs face smiled at
                    him, and the Holy Child in Peruginoâs picture seemed to look down in
                    expectation; he forgot the living people; the bishop and the Gesu were all he
                    saw; he joined his hands as if he were at prayer, and sang a sacrament hymn of
                    Pergolesi that they sang in his own church.</p>
                <p>Whether the good bishop dead five hundred years, or hardâhearted honest Perugino
                    sleeping under the wayside oak in Frontignano, heard or not, who shall say till
                    the secret of the grave be loosed? But the contadini standing reverently by, and
                    the whiteârobed monk, and the listening stranger heard, and held their breath.
                    The monk turned his head a moment to Peruginoâs picture to see if it were not
                    some miracle being wrought there, and the Angels of the Nativity singing instead
                    of this peasant child.</p>
                <p>Signa sang on as larks do, forgetting everything when once his voice was loosened
                    on the air, and without knowing what he did, left the<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7155-235"/> hymn of Pergolesi, and sang on and on and on cadences
                    that were to be traced to no written score, and that came to him, he never could
                    tell howâjust as they came upon the mountain side, with not a creature near. The
                    words were the words of the Latin services, but the cadences were his own as
                    much as the thrushâs are its own in the hawthorn time.</p>
                <p>He might have sang on till sunset if two other monks drawn by the unwonted sounds
                    had not come near and looked on through the half open door. The sound stopped
                    him; he paused startled and half ashamed; and not another note could be got from
                    him.</p>
                <p>âHe is not angry,â he whispered to Bruno, looking at the statue. âHe is smiling
                    still.â</p>
                <p>âYou would make marble smile, if it had frowned through ages, till you sang,â
                    said the stranger, while the monks murmured something of a gift of God. âMy
                    pretty little boy, you may make the world hear of you, your mouth will drop
                    gold.â</p>
                <p>Signa glanced at him bewildered; he understood nothing of this kind of
                    language.</p>
                <pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7155-236"/>
                <p>âCome with me where I am painting,â said the stranger, âI should like to hear who
                    taught you your perfect phrasingâwho taught you to sing, I mean? Come with me a
                    few minutes. Is that your father with you?â</p>
                <p>âThat is Bruno,â said Signa. For the first time it occurred to himâwhy had he no
                    father? Was he born out of the old town from the stones and ivy as the owls
                    were?</p>
                <p>âNot your father? What is he to you then?â</p>
                <p>âHe is always good. I keep his sheep sometimes.â</p>
                <p>The artist did not ask any more; the boy was some peasantâs son; it did not
                    matter whose. âBut who taught you to sing?â he pursued.</p>
                <p>âI sing in the churches at home.â</p>
                <p>âBut have you had no teacher?â</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Signa; then added, after a pause, âThe birds do not have any.â</p>
                <p>âBut much that you sangâit is no known musicâis it composed by some village
                    genius of whom no one has heard?â</p>
                <p>Signa was very puzzled.</p>
                <pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7155-237"/>
                <p>âI sing the music that I have in my head,â he said, after a little while.</p>
                <p>âThen it is you who have the geniusâa second Mozart?â</p>
                <p>Signa could not understand those words at all. Perhaps he was something wicked.
                    Nita was always saying so.</p>
                <p>âA genius? that is a sin?â he asked softly.</p>
                <p>The artist laughed. âYes; unless you can sell it well. A sin sold well is half
                    forgiven.â</p>
                <p>The child did not understand, but was a little frightened. To speak of sin at all
                    was eerie in this great place, where men all day long and all night long fought
                    the fiend.</p>
                <p>âI should like to paint your face,â said the stranger: âas Perugino did the Holy
                    Childâs that you look at soâoh, a few lines will do, but I fancy your face will
                    be well known to a great world one day, and you have a look in your eyes that is
                    beautifulâcan you wait?â</p>
                <p>The child asked Bruno. Bruno was displeased, but an Italian has a respect for art
                    and artists; he muttered unwillingly that it was a feast day, the boy might do
                    as he liked for him;<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7155-238"/> it was a folly, but it
                    would not hurt; it was not as if it were a girl.</p>
                <p>The child went willingly into the room that is sacred to the Popes, and where
                    dread Leo frowned on him. In the wide window, looking to the north on to the
                    purple mountains, there stood an easel and other things of a painterâs work; the
                    artist being a great man, and bringing authority of governments with him, was
                    painting that glorious view, and living in retreat there for a few days.</p>
                <p>Bruno followed them; he would rather have preferred that strangers should leave
                    the boy alone; he was jealous over him, and he thought that praise would make
                    him vain.</p>
                <p>So Signa stood in his little white shirt, with his dark curls that had the gold
                    light in them touching his throat, and the painter painted his head and
                    shoulders with his chest half bare, and the carnation bright against the
                    skin.</p>
                <p>He swept the likeness in with the fast, broad, true touches of a great artist,
                    who with a dozen strokes can suggest a whole picture, as Rembrandt drew Jan
                    Sixâs Bridge.</p>
                <pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7155-239"/>
                <p>In half an hour he had what he wanted ; a little face full of sadness and joy
                    together, and most purely childâlike, with a look in the eyes that would make
                    women weep.</p>
                <p>He had been waiting for such a face in his great picture of the child DemophÃ¶on
                    in the sacred fire; for whose scene he had come to these purple hills and
                    dreamful plains as all the old paintersâand Rafaelle, in his days of wisdomâhad
                    come to these or such as these.</p>
                <p>To move the boy to wondering interest and wake the eager, rapt look in his eyes,
                    the painter talked to him, with easy graphic language, simple, yet eloquent,
                    such as the child had never heard.</p>
                <p>He told him about the flowers he loved; about the mountains; about the dead
                    Acciajoli, whose marble effigies were in the crypt below; about Donatello, who
                    had carved the stone warriors in their mighty rest; about Guiliano, who had
                    sculptured the fruits and flowers there to take away all terrors from the tomb;
                    about S. Bruno the founder, and of the far lone Alps, where he had dwelt,
                    forbidding the sight of woman<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7155-240"/> for many a mile
                    around; about the builder of this charterâhouse, gentle Orgagna, that good old
                    man, who loved to paint Cupids frolicking with young maidens under orange
                    boughs, and brave youths hawking under sunny skies, and yet could draw Black
                    Death as if he feared her not, but sent her upward through the air as though, by
                    allegory, not to leave men without hope; one of those mighty workers who could
                    write sculptor on their canvas and painter on their marble; one of those great,
                    rich, wise lives that make the best of our own look so barren, spent in raising
                    great piles and colouring beautiful things, and dwelling in peace and honour,
                    and closing tranquilly when their course was run. Orgagna was writing sonnets
                    when he died to a young lad he loved. Sixty years old, and yet with strength and
                    youth and faith enough, and enough freshness of heart and soul, to write a
                    sonnet that should please a boy! These men had never been bitten in the heel by
                    the snake of Satiety; the wound which kills the Achilles of Modern Art.</p>
                <p>Bruno, stretched on a bench, lay still as a felled tree and listened.</p>
                <pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7155-241"/>
                <p>âIf I could talk like that to Signa he would love me better,â he thought; but how
                    was he to talk like thatâa man who knew how to make barley grow, and how to
                    drive bullocks over the land, and how to cleanse the vines with sulphur, but no
                    more.</p>
                <p>He wished the painter would not tell the child the world would know of himâwhat
                    use was there in that. Valdarno and the hills were world enoughâand were he to
                    sing and the great unknown cities hear him, he would have to go away for that,
                    and Bruno hoped to keep him alwaysâalwaysâalways, and see him safe for all the
                    future after him on that good piece of land on the hillâside, where Pippa had
                    come through the beanflowers at sunset.</p>
                <p>What better life was there than that, with the meek beasts on the cornâlands,
                    high in the air amongst the vines?</p>
                <p>Kings no doubt were higher, and great lords; but Bruno pitied them.</p>
                <p>Two oâclock came, and the monks had their simple dinner in their refectory, and
                    the same fare was brought to the artist as to any laity who<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7155-242"/> may dwell there in retreat, and he made them bring
                    portions for the contadino and the child, and added wine of his own getting,
                    rich and rare.</p>
                <p>Bruno and Signa took it without ado, and with the single animalâlike grace which
                    is bred in Italian blood as in the limbs of the chamois or the wings of the
                    swallow.</p>
                <p>He was a great man, perhaps, and rich, no doubt, and far above them; but why
                    should they be ashamed to break his bread with him?</p>
                <p>They would have broken theirs with him.</p>
                <p>As for him, now he had the face he wantedâthe face that he had sought for high
                    and low amongst the beautiful children of the Riviera, and always vainlyâhe did
                    not care how soon they went nor where; and yet the boy had a wonderful
                    voiceâonly children were so often wonderful in Italy that no one ever heard of
                    when they were grown to menâa precocious, swiftly passing, universal genius,
                    that burst to beauty like a rose laurel blossom, and dropped down without fruit.
                    Still, this little barefoot boy, that sang to the dead bishop, had something in
                    his face that surely would not die.</p>
                <pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7155-243"/>
                <p>âIf I took you with me to the big world they would make an idol of you, little
                    lark,â he said, as the boy put down his white bowl of soup. âWould you come if I
                    would take you?â</p>
                <p>Signa looked up to Brunoâs face and across at the hills that hid his old town
                    from his sight.</p>
                <p>âNo,â he said, simply, but his face flushed all over suddenly; a vague fancy, a
                    dim possibility broke before him like the faint rose that is promise of the
                    sunrise. Only he was too young and knew too little to be able to be sure of what
                    he thought.</p>
                <p>âNo? Well, you are right,â said the great painter, smiling. âTo a million blanks
                    one prize, only the prize is a proud one, once got; though the men whose hands
                    are empty deny it, to console themselves. But be content in your life, little
                    fellow; it is a good one; you are not like a town child, âun brin dâherbe, sans
                    soleil, entre deux pavÃ©s.â You have the sun and the air and the country, the old
                    painters knew the value of these; we do not. Look here, my pretty boy, take
                    these pieces and buy what you fancy, and if you ever do wander far afield and
                    want help, here is my<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7155-244"/> name; come to me and
                    remind me of the Certosa, and such influence as I have with other men I will use
                    for you. But is you are wise you will not wander. The ox furrows are safer
                    travelling than the city stones. Farewell.â</p>
                <p>He gave the boy two gold pieces of France, and smiled at him. and went within to
                    the dormitory. He would not have minded the child remaining all the day, but he
                    was tired of seeing that blackâbrowed contadino stretched, listening and silent,
                    on the bench. Besides, he wanted to go on with his landscape.</p>
                <p>âAm I to keep them,â said Signa, looking down at the money in his palm.</p>
                <p>âMoney is money,â said Bruno, briefly. âIt is forty francs. Francs do not hang in
                    the hedges.â</p>
                <p>Signa was silent in absolute amaze. He had never had a centime for his own in his
                    whole life. He felt dizzy.</p>
                <p>Then all at once he gave a ringing shout of rapturous joy.</p>
                <p>âI could buy the violin!â he cried, till the vault of the chamber echoed.</p>
                <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7155-245"/>
                <p>It was to him as if could buy the earth and the sun and the planets.</p>
                <p>âYes; you can buy the violin,â said Bruno.</p>
                <p>Signa laughed all over his little face as a brook does when the sun and wind
                    together please it; he was beside himself with bewildered happiness. He shouted,
                    he leaped, he sang, he raced, regardless of the silence and sanctity of the
                    place, till Bruno hurried him away fearful that the good brethern might enter
                    and be displeased.</p>
                <p>âWhat did the paper say? you have forgotten the paper,â said Bruno, as they
                    passed the pharmacy, where the monks were distilling their sweet odours and
                    strong waters with a delicate fragrance of coriander and coromandel seeds, and
                    of dried herbs and lemons and the like, upon the air.</p>
                <p>Signa, giddy and breathless, unfolded the crumbled scrap on which the painter had
                    written his name with a pencil, his surnameâIstrielâcurtly, as men write who
                    know that the one word tells all about them to the world.</p>
                <p>He spelt the name out slowly, but the line beneath it puzzled him; it was only an
                        address<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7155-246"/> in Paris, but then the little boy
                    did not know what Paris meant.</p>
                <p>He crushed the slip of paper together with the gold and ran out of the cool
                    vaulted corridors, that were so still and hushed and grey, like twilight, into
                    the path that runs down the vines.</p>
                <p>âI can buy the violin!â he cried to the bright sky; he thought that the sky
                    smiled back again.</p>
                <p>After all the angels had thought of him.</p>
                <p>âOh this wonderful day!â he shouted. âOh Bruno, are you not happy that we
                    came?â</p>
                <p>âI am glad if you are gladâ, said Bruno. And that was the truth at all times.
                    Half way down the hill Signa stopped and looked back to the monastery.</p>
                <p>âI forgot to thank the Holy Child,â he said, with sharp contrition.</p>
                <p>âWhere? and for what?â</p>
                <p>âThe little Christ in the picture that they call Peruginoâhe sent me this to buy
                    the violin. I am sure of that. He smiled at me all the while I sang, and I never
                    said a prayer to thank him. Let me go back.â</p>
                <p>âThey would not let you in; say your prayers<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7155-247"/> to
                    him at home; he will be quite as pleased. But it was the painter who gave you
                    the money.â</p>
                <p>âIt was the Holy Child sent it,â said Signa, who had seen so many frescoes of the
                    heavenly host descending to mingle in the lives of men, and had heard so many
                    miracles and legends, that the visible interposition of Peruginoâs Gesu was only
                    such a thing as he had looked for naturally.</p>
                <p>Well, the Gesu might, why not? thought Bruno, the child was worthy even of such
                    memory.</p>
                <p>He did not knowâit seemed presumptuous to think they could think in heaven of a
                    childâs wish for a wooden toy; but still, who could tell?âit is such simple,
                    humble, foolish hopes as these that keep the peasantsâ hearts and backs from
                    breaking under the burden of unending toil. Untiring intelligence may live best
                    without a faith, but tired poverty and labour must have one of some sort. Called
                    by what name it may be, it is the selfsame thing, the vague, sad, wistful hope
                    of some far off, but certain, compensation.</p>
                <p>To Bruno, indeed, it seemed that the Gesu had sanctioned the spending of a vast
                    fortune on a<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7155-248"/> mere plaything; it was the cost
                    of a sheep or of a barrel of wine; but he could no more have denied the child
                    than he could have cut his hand offâbesides, if the saints willed it.</p>
                <p>As for Signa, he had no doubt that heaven had sent it to him. He cried and
                    laughed in his delight. He showed his gold to the birds, to the frogs, to the
                    butterflies. He leaped from stone to stone in the water, laughing at his own
                    image. He stopped to tell every contadino he met, and every fisherman throwing a
                    net from the canes. He ran through the hedges of acacia and clematis, and told
                    the spiders weaving silver in the leaves. He stopped to tell the millers at the
                    millâhouse over the river, where the good men leaned out of a little square
                    window with the yellow light of a candle behind them, and above the mossâgrown
                    roof the apple boughs interlaced against a dreamy blue evening sky, like a
                    Rembrandt set in a Raffaelle. He caught a big brown velvet stingless bee, and
                    whispered it the story, and let it go free to carry the news before him to the
                    swallows in the Lastra; and when he came to red cross that stands on a<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7155-249"/> pile of stones, where the Greve is broad and
                    green under the high woodlands, where they mighty Acciajoli once reigned, he
                    knelt down and said the prayers he had forgotten, while the wind chased the
                    shadows in the water, and the weir and the waterwheel sang to each other.</p>
                <p>âWill it be too late to buy it toânight?â he said, as he saw Venus rise above the
                    mountains from the sea.</p>
                <p>âNot if Tonino be not in bed,â said Bruno, who never could bear not to humour the
                    child. So they walked on as fast as they could.</p>
                <p>âYou are tired?â said Bruno. âIf you are tired get on my back.â</p>
                <p>âI am not tired!â laughed the child, who felt as though he had wings, and could
                    dart all the way home as swiftly and straight as a dragonâfly. It was quite dark
                    when they reached the Lastra.</p>
                <p>It was a hot night. The mosquitoes and the little white moths were whirling round
                    the few dusky lamps. There were lights behind the grated windows, and darksome
                    doorways lit as Rembrandt loved.</p>
                <pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7155-250"/>
                <p>The men stood about in their shirtâsleeves, and the women lingered, saying good
                    night as they plaited the last tress. There were groups in the archways, and on
                    the high steps, and in the bakersâ and wineâsellersâ shops, where the green
                    boughs were drooping after the heat of the day. In uncurtained casements only
                    lighted by the moon young mothers undressed their sucklings. There was a smell
                    of ripe fruit, of drying hay, of firâapples, of fresh straw, of that seaâscent
                    which comes here upon the west wind, and of magnolia flowers from the villas on
                    the hills.</p>
                <p>Signaâs heart beat so fast he felt blind as he flew under the gateway, and looked
                    to see if Tonino had shut his house for the night.</p>
                <p>His heart leaped in him as he saw a light in the place, and the big keys
                    magnified in the shadow till they were fit for the very keys of St. Peter, and
                    in the door the locksmith himself, with bare arms and easy mind, chatting with
                    his neighbour, Dionisio the cobbler.</p>
                <p>Signa darted to him.</p>
                <p>âGive it me! quickâquickâquickâoh,<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7155-251"/> please, good
                    Tonino!â he panted. âSeeâhere are the forty francsâall beautiful real goldâand
                    the fair child in the monastery sent it to me toâday. Quickâquick, oh dear
                    Tonino! You never have sold it while we were away?â</p>
                <p>âThe child pleased an artist toâday, and sat for a picture, and so got the money.
                    Let him have the toy,â said Bruno, following, to the astonished Tonino, who had
                    stretched out a hand by sheer instinct to seize the boy, making sure that he had
                    stolen something.</p>
                <p>âI have not sold it,â he said, with wide open eyes. âBut buy itâforty francs!âthe
                    like of you, you little bit of a fellow! It cannot be! It cannot be!â</p>
                <p>âOh, dear Tonino!â cried the child, piteously, and he began to tremble all over
                    with dread, his colour went and came hotly and whitely in the yellow gleams of
                    the locksmithâs brass lamp; and he could hardly speak plain for excitement, with
                    both his hands clinging to the manâs bare arm. âOh, dear, good Tonino, you never
                    have sold it? oh say you have not sold it? Here is the goldâbeautiful real
                    money, and you<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7155-252"/> never do have gold in Signa,
                    and pray, pray do let me have it quick; I have longed for it so. Oh, you never
                    will know how! Only I said nothing because you all scolded and laughed; and now,
                    perhaps, you have sold itâdo say you have not sold it?â</p>
                <p>And Signa broke down, crying with a very rain of tears in the reaction from this
                    immeasurable joy to fear.</p>
                <p>Brunoâs hand fell heavily on the locksmithâs shoulder.</p>
                <p>âIt is good money. You cannot refuse your own price. Let the boy have the
                    fiddle.â</p>
                <p>âBut a baby like that!â stammered Tonino. âAnd if there are painters about that
                    pay so, there is my little Ginna, rich and rosy as a tomato, and how can you,
                    even in conscience, let that brat squander such a heap of wealth,âthe price of a
                    calf almost, and a barrel of wine quite, and the best wine in the commune too;
                    and sure he ought to be made to take it to that good soul Lippo, who has kept
                    him, body and soul together, all these years, when any other man would have let
                    such a little mouse drown in the flood<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7155-253"/> where
                    he came from; and I do not think I could in conscience let the lad throw all
                    that away, and he a beggar one may say, unless I speak to Lippo and Nita first,
                    and they be willing, because ââ</p>
                <p>Brunoâs eyes took fire with that sudden light which all the Lastra had dreaded
                    since he had been a stripling, and his hand went inside his shirt, where, about
                    the belt of his breeches, he was always believed to carry a trusty knife,
                    notwithstanding all law and peril.</p>
                <p>âKeep your conscience for your neighboursâ kettles and pans that you send home
                    with new holes when you solder the old ones!â shouted Bruno. âOut with the
                    fiddle, or as the saints live above us, choked you shall be, and dead as a
                    doornail. Take the gold and fetch me the toy, and learn to preach to me if you
                    dare!â</p>
                <p>âBut in conscience,â stammered the locksmith.</p>
                <p>âGive the child the plaything,â he cried in a voice of thunder, shaking him as a
                    dog does a chicken, âor it shall be the worse for you. You know
                    <emph>me</emph>!â</p>
                <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7155-254"/>
                <p>âI would take the gold when I could get it, if I were you, Tonino,â whispered the
                    cobbler, who was a man of peace. âGold is a rare sight for sore eyes in Signa,
                    and what is Lippo to you?â</p>
                <p>âThat is true,â murmured the tinman, frightened out of his wits, and thankful for
                    any excuse to yield. âBut it is only toâday that I heard that the fiddle is
                    worth quite double. There is a great singer come to stay at one of the villas
                    who saw itâand to let a child have it who will break itânevertheless, to please
                    a neighbour ââ</p>
                <p>And having soothed himself a little with this elaborate and useless fiction, as
                    his country folk will, always deriving a very soothing and softening effect from
                    the pleasure of lying, Tonino went grumbling within, and poked about with his
                    dim lamp, and came out slowly with the violin, and clutched the two gold pieces
                    before he would let it go. Signa, who stood trembling with wild excitement, took
                    the precious instrument in both his hand with trembling reverence, the tears
                    falling fast down his cheeks.</p>
                <pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7155-255"/>
                <p>âBeast! you have made him cry!â muttered Bruno, and kicked the tinman into his
                    own doorway with a will, and laid his hand on the childâs shoulder, and strode
                    up the street of the Lastra, glancing from right to left with mute challenge if
                    any man should have the courage to stop his progress.</p>
                <p>No one attempted to call him to account. Tonino was not a popular man, and the
                    weight of Brunoâs wrath and the keenness of his knife had been felt by more than
                    one of the eager, chattering audience who leaned out of the windows and crowded
                    each other in the doorways, in breathless hope to see a pretty piece of
                    stabbing.</p>
                <p>Bruno went through them in silence. Signa trotted by his side, his hands clasping
                    the violin to his chest, and his great eyes dewy with tears, yet radiant as
                    jewels, in his joy.</p>
                <p>Tonino grumbled that if a man made such a sweet morsel of his own bastard he
                    should not be above the owning of it, and went to his bed with sore bones and a
                    grieved heart that he had not asked double for the fiddle; though for<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7155-256"/> more years than he could remember he had always
                    thought it worthless lumber.</p>
                <p>Bruno and Signa went up the street in the moonlight, with yellow flashes now and
                    then falling across them from the lamps swinging in the doorways.</p>
                <p>âWhere will you play on it, dear little lad,â said Bruno, gently, âif you take it
                    home?â</p>
                <p>The child looked at him with the smile of a child dreaming beautiful things in
                    its slumber.</p>
                <p>âI will keep it at old Teresinaâs. She will let me, and I will bring it to you
                    when I come. Oh! is it really, really true that I have got it?â</p>
                <p>âQuite true; and it is dearer to you already than the old lute, Signa?â</p>
                <p>Signa was silent. Bruno had given him the lute.</p>
                <p>They passed out of the Lastra and along the road into the street that curves
                    towards the bridge; it was quite dark; but at the little cafÃ© there which looks
                    towards the river, several men were drinking and playing dominoes on the stones
                    by the feeble light of the brass oilâlamps. Bruno saw Lippo amongst them.</p>
                <pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7155-257"/>
                <p>He put his own tall from with the dark cloud of his brown cloak between Lippo and
                    the child, and strode on carelessly without stopping.</p>
                <p>âGood night,â he called out, âI am taking the boy up with me. I want him to help
                    stack wheat, and he will have to be up at four, so he had best sleep on the
                    hill.â</p>
                <p>Lippo nodded, and hardly looked up from his dominoes.</p>
                <p>They went on over the bridge unquestioned.</p>
                <p>They bridge had many groups upon it as on all hot nights; leaning against the
                    parapets, and chatting in the cheerful, garrulous Tuscan fashion. The moon was
                    bright on the wide reaches of the river. The sky was studded with stars.</p>
                <p>On a summer night, Signa loses her scars of war and age, and is young as when
                    Hercules shook her sunny waters from his sunny locks; resting from labour.</p>
                <p>The child looked up at the stars. He wondered if ever in all the world there had
                    been so happy a thing as he. And yet he could only see the stars through his
                    tears; he did not know why the tears came.</p>
                <pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7155-258"/>
                <p>An aziola owl went by with its soft cry, <q>
                        <l>âSuch as nor voice nor lute nor wind nor bird</l>
                        <l rend="ti-3">The soul never stirred,</l>
                        <l>Unlike and far sweeter than they all.â</l>
                    </q></p>
                <p>âOh, dear ChiÃ¹!â said Signa to the owl, calling it by the familiar name that the
                    people give it, âwill you tell the little Christ how happy I am, and the old
                    dead bishop too? They may think I am thankless because I cry. Do tell them,
                    ChiÃ¹, you go so near the sky!â</p>
                <p>âWhat fancies you have,â said Bruno; but the little brown hand was hot as it
                    touched his own. âYou are tired and excited,â he said more gravely. âYou dream
                    too much about odd things. The owl is hunting gnats and mice, and not thinking
                    about the angels.â</p>
                <p>âI am not tired,â said Signa, but he was walking lame, and his voice was weak and
                    trembled.</p>
                <p>Bruno, without asking him, lifted him up in his arms; he himself was a strong
                    man, and the light burden of the thin little lad was a small one to him.</p>
                <p>âGo to sleep, I will carry you up the hill,â<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7155-259"/> he
                    said, putting the childâs head down against his shoulder. Signa did not resist.
                    He still clasped the violin to him.</p>
                <p>Bruno went up the steep road where his mother had carried him through the
                    darkness and cold before she stumbled and fell.</p>
                <p>With fever and fatigue Signa dropped asleep, and not awaken all the way up the
                    long lonely paths through the vines and the reapen fields.</p>
                <p>âHow he loves that thing alreadyâas never he will love me,â thought Bruno,
                    looking down at him in the starlight with the dull sense of hopeless rivalry and
                    alien inferiority which the selfâabsorption of genius inflicts innocently and
                    unconsciously on the human affections that cling to it, and which later on Love
                    avenges upon it in the same manner.</p>
                <p>Bruno, nevertheless, was glad that he had it. Fierce and selfish in all his
                    earlier life, he had taught himself to be gentle and unselfish to Pippaâs son.
                    He carried him into the house, still sleeping, and laid him down under the
                    crucifix on a pile of hay, and would have undressed him, but the child,
                    murmuring, resisted,<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7155-260"/> clasping the violin to
                    him, as though in his sleep, afraid that anyone should take it from him.</p>
                <p>So Bruno left him as he was upon the hay with his tumbled curls and his violin
                    folded in his crossed arms, in the deep dreamless sleep of a great fatigue, and
                    lit a lanthorn and went round to fodder to cow and see to the ass, and make sure
                    that all had been safe during his absence, and then, with his loaded gun beside
                    him, laid down to rest himself.</p>
                <p>He had not been asleep an hour himself, before he was awakened by silvery sweet
                    music that seemed to him to be like the voices of all the nightingales in May
                    singing together; but the nightingales were most of them dumb nowânow that the
                    lilies were dead, and the hay gathered.</p>
                <p>Bruno started up and listened and looked; he too believed in a dim sort of way in
                    the angels; only he never saw them come down on the slant of the sunârays as the
                    good men had done that had decorated the churches.</p>
                <p>The moon was shining into the house; by the<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7155-261"/>
                    white cool light he was that it was the child sitting up in the hay and playing.
                    Signaâs eyes were open and lustrous, but they had a look in them as if he were
                    dreaming.</p>
                <p>His chin was resting on the violin, his little hands fingered the keys and the
                    bow; his face was very pale; he looked straight before him; he played in his
                    sleep.</p>
                <p>Bruno listened aghast; he had a melodious ear himself, the music was never wrong
                    in a chord; it was sweet as all the nightingales in the country singing all
                    together.</p>
                <p>He dared not wake the boy, who played on and on in the moonlight.</p>
                <p>âIt is the gift of God,â thought Bruno, awed and sorrowful; because a gift of God
                    put the child farther and farther from him.</p>
                <p>He listened, resting on one arm, while the owls cried âWoe!â from the great
                    walnut trees over the houseâroof. The sweet melody seemed to fill the place with
                    wonder, and to live in the quivering rays of the moon, and to pass out with them
                    through the lattice amongst the leaves, and so go straight to the stars.</p>
                <pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7155-262"/>
                <p>A little while, and it faltered a moment, and then ceased. Signaâs head dropped
                    back, his eyes closed, his hands let the violin sink gently down; he slept again
                    as other children sleep.</p>
                <p>âIt is a gift of God; one cannot go against a gift of God,â said Bruno, making
                    the sign of the cross on his own broad breast. And he was very sorrowful; and
                    yet proud; and could not bear that it should be so, and yet would not have had
                    it otherwise; as men were in the old days of faith whose sons and daughters went
                    out to martyrdom.</p>
                <p>When he got up to his labour before the sun was up, and while the faintest
                    roseâred alone glowed beyond the mountains in the east, he stepped noiselessly
                    not to awaken the boy, and left him sleeping while he went out to his work at
                    the stacking of corn, with the earth dim with shadow and silvered with dew.</p>
                <p>He thought of the child and the gifts of God. He did not know that he had seen
                    Pippaâs lover.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                <p>â<hi>WHERE</hi> is the little bit of paper with the name on?â said Bruno, eating
                    his bit of black bread when the morning was up wide and golden over all the
                    harvest land.</p>
                <p>Signa lifted up his head from his violin. âI lost it. When I caught the bee,
                    coming home, the paper flew away, the winds too it; does it matter?â</p>
                <p>âNo. Only it might have been a friend for you. Do you recollect the name?â</p>
                <p>Signa shook his curly head.</p>
                <p>Recollect anything!âwith the violin in his hand, and the music dancing out on the
                    sunbeams, and saying everything for him that he never could say for himself.</p>
                <pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7155-264"/>
                <p>What was the name to him; the giver of the gold had only been the ministrant of
                    the little Christ.</p>
                <p>Bruno let him alone.</p>
                <p>The boy was so happy; sitting in the shade there; trying all cadences that came
                    to him on this new, precious, wondrous thing; he had not the heart to call him
                    to come out in the sun and carry the wheat.</p>
                <p>He had been too rough with Pippa. He atoned by being too gentle with this
                    child.</p>
                <p>So he went out into the fields again by himself, and built up his stacks, made
                    low because of the hurricanes that come over when there are white squalls upon
                    the sea, and covered till there should be time to thatch them, with snowy linen
                    cloths, so that they look like huge mushrooms growing for the table of
                    Gargantua.</p>
                <p>When he had been at work some two or three hours, hearing at intervals, when the
                    wind blew it towards him, the song of the violin that the boy was enjoying
                    within with the cow in her shed, and the sitting hens, and the tethered goat and
                    her kid for listeners, he heard the little feet<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7155-265"/> that he knew patter over the stubble, and from his half completed stack
                    looked down on Signaâs upraised face.</p>
                <p>The child had the violin with him.</p>
                <p>âBruno,â he asked shyly, âI have been thinkingâthere is old Nunziata often
                    without bread, and Giudetta, whose children all died of those poison berries,
                    and Stagno the blind man, that has no legs either, andâand so many of them that
                    want so much, and are only hungry and sadâwas it selfish of me not to give them
                    the money between themâwas it wicked to have the violin? I am sure the angels
                        <emph>meant</emph> the violin, you know; but still did the angels wish me to
                    think of others or all of myself? What do you think? Do you think I was
                    wrong?â</p>
                <p>âAnyway it is too late now, bambino,â said Bruno, with the curtness of his
                    natural speech. âYou have wanted the violin a year, why spoil the pleasure of
                    it?â</p>
                <p>âBut was it selfish?â persisted Signa.</p>
                <p>âWhy worry yourself; it is done?â</p>
                <p>âBut is was, then?â cried the little fellow, with a sort of feverish pain.</p>
                <pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7155-266"/>
                <p>Bruno came down the ladder and took up more corn.</p>
                <p>âOh, no; you things that love sounds or sights or bits of wood or oils and earths
                    better than human creatures, always are selfish, so. But I donât know why ever
                    you should be blamed. There is no more selfish beast than a cow with her calf,
                    or a woman with her wean. Why should you not have your fiddle like that; only
                    you will be like Frisco. I knew Friscoâhe thought of nothing but saving every
                    scrap of money to buy things to paint with, and he was always after the churches
                    and the gateways and places where the colours are; and he said it was a fine
                    gift, and a glorious one. I am not saying it was not; only he went away and left
                    his old mother to be kept by the commune, and people say he is a great man away
                    in Rome; but the old soul is dead and never saw him again. Not that it is for me
                    to say evil of any man.â</p>
                <p>âBut I have no mother,â said Signa.</p>
                <p>Bruno shrank as though a grass adder had stung him; and stooped and gathered more
                    corn again.</p>
                <pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7155-267"/>
                <p>âNo, dear,â he said, after a moment, very gently, âmake a mother of your music if
                    you can. The good God gave it you in her stead. And it is not selfish, dear; you
                    praise heaven in it, and make the children dance with joy, and the old folks
                    forget they are old when they hear you. Do they not say so in the Lastra a
                    thousand times? Do not fret yourself, Signa. The angels sent you the fiddle. Be
                    glad in it. To quarrel with happiness is to quarrel with God. It is but seldom
                    he sends any; perhaps he would send more, only whenever they get it people spoil
                    it by fuming and fretting, as a bad spinner knots the smooth flax. Play to the
                    sick folk and the old and the sorrowful. That will be the way to please the
                    little Christ.â</p>
                <p>Signa was comforted, and sat down amongst the loose wheat and played all his
                    little fancies away on those strings that were to him as of silver and gold,
                    whilst the cicale buzzed in chorus in the treeâtops, and all the field finches
                    strained in their pretty throats in rivalry.</p>
                <p>But he did not play gaily as he had done in the house. He was afraid the Gesu was
                        not<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7155-268"/> content; and why had he no mother as
                    other boys had?</p>
                <p>Bruno, working on the top of his golden rick could have bitten his own tongue out
                    for having reminded the child of that.</p>
                <p>Signa never asked any questions. They had told him he had come on the wave of the
                    flood, and for himself he thought that the owls had dropped him there. But then
                    it was never of any use to ask an owl. They never said anything to any one,
                    except âChiÃ¹, chiÃ¹!â âWoe, woe!â</p>
                <p>Bruno sent him away at sunset, with a big basket of beans and cabbages for Nita,
                    to propitiate her into good humour.</p>
                <p>It was cheating his lord, because it is understood that what a contadino takes
                    for eating shall be what is needed in his own house; but Bruno did not see harm
                    in it; the men who would not take a crumb out of their masterâs dwelling for all
                    the temptings of the worst hunger, will never see any sin in taking things off
                    the soil they labour on, and Bruno was no better than his neighbours. Besides,
                    he would have done a wrong thing knowingly, to serve or help the child.</p>
                <pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7155-269"/>
                <p>âI should love him little if I would not take a sin on my own soul for his
                    welfare,â he said to himself often; that was his idea of how he ought to keep
                    his word to Pippa. He did not argue it out so clearly as that, because peasants
                    do not analyse, but the sense of it moved him always.</p>
                <p>So Signa kissed his old lute in farewell, and laid it away on the old marriage
                    box under the crucifix, and sprinkled roseâleaves on it and meadow mint, because
                    he fancied it would like sweet smells, and then shouldered his big skip full of
                    vegetables, and made his way down the hill, hugging the violin close to him.</p>
                <p>The waning moon hung silvery and round over the town as he entered. In many of
                    the interiors and in the stone barns the men were thrashing, the flails heaving
                    and falling in pleasant regular cadence, the workers kneeâdeep in the yellow
                    grain. A few machines hum in Tuscany, but they are very few; they fear to spoil
                    the straw for the plaiters, and they cling to the old ways, these sons of Ceres
                    Mammosa.</p>
                <p>The rush skip on his back was heavy, but his<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7155-270"/>
                    heart was light as he went. The wonderful wooden thing that he could make sing
                    like a nightingale was all his own for ever.</p>
                <p>Only to think what he could do; all that he heardâand he heard so much from the
                    birds and the bees and the winds at dawn, and the owls at night, and the
                    whispering canes and the poplars down by the water, and the bells that swing for
                    prayerâhe could tell again on those wonderful strings, of whose power and pathos
                    the child, all untaught, had a true intuition.</p>
                <p>With the violin against his shoulder he felt strong enough to face the world and
                    wander over itâten years old though he was, and of no more account than a little
                    moth, that a man can kill with the wave of the hand.</p>
                <p>The fancy came once to him to go away, with the wooden Rusignuolo, as he called
                    it, and see what people would do to him, and what beautiful things he could
                    hear, going along the roads, and into the strange streets, playing. If only he
                    had not loved the town so well; but every stone of the Lastra was dear to him.
                    They held his feet to the soil.</p>
                <pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7155-271"/>
                <p>And, besides, he was only a little child, and the mountains looked too high for
                    him to climb, though those old painters, he knew, must have gone higher still,
                    or how could they have seen the clouds and the little angels and amorini that
                    dwell in the worlds where the rose never fades and the light never ceases?</p>
                <p>But neither mountains nor clouds were within his reach, so he only trotted down
                    into the Lastra with his skip of cabbages and beans upon his little tired back,
                    very happy because he had his heartâs desire; and if he had been selfish he had
                    asked to be forgivenânone of us can do more.</p>
                <p>All people were still astir in the place; by eight of the clock it is nearly dark
                    under these hills when once the day of SS. Peter and Paul is past; they were
                    sitting about in the street, the doorways showed the golden straw that the girls
                    were still sorting; there was the smell of the fields everywhere; oxen in red
                    waggons crept through the twilight taking grain to the thrashing barns; men came
                    in from the riverâside with their nets wet and their bare legs shining with
                    sand, and their pumpkin gourds full of little fish; here<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7155-272"/> and there was a brown monk with his huge straw hat on
                    his shoulders and his rosary dangling in front of his knees.</p>
                <p>He nodded up at old Teresina; eighty years old and spinning at a high window
                    under the gateway; she would let him go and play his violin there in her little
                    dusky den, among the ropes of onions and the strings of drying tomatoes, and
                    with the one little square lattice looking out to the bold mountain of the high
                    Albano range that rises above Artimino and Carmignano, and takes all the rose of
                    the dawn, and all the purples of the storm, and wears them as its own, and has
                    the sun go down behind it and the star of love rise from it.</p>
                <p>Then he ran up the little dark stairs into the room where she lived; a bright old
                    soul with many daughters and sons and grandchildren scattered over the place; a
                    good spinner and good plaiter still, though nigh eighty years old, she had spent
                    all her years here under the western gate, seeing the harvest waggons and the
                    grape barrels come and go for nearly threeâfourths of a century; she could
                    remember the<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7155-273"/> French fellows with Murat riding
                    through; she had sat at her window and watched them; she had just married then;
                    she had seen the sun sink down over the mountains calm and golden, or red and
                    threatening, every night of her life; and had never slept elsewhere than here,
                    where the warders had lighted their beacons and pointed their matchlocks in the
                    old days long before her, when the news come that the Pisans were marching from
                    the sea; the Lastra was her world, but it had been wide enough to make her
                    shrewd and keen of sight, and happy enough to keep her kindly of temper and of
                    quick sympathy with youth and childhood.</p>
                <p>Of the child Signa she was very fond; she liked to be woke in the dark mornings
                    by his fresh voice carolling some field song of the people as he went out under
                    the gateway to his work. And she was one of the few folks who liked Bruno better
                    than his gentler brother.</p>
                <p>âI have seen them both with their bullcocks when they were lads,â she would say
                    to her neighbours. âBruno made his do a hard dayâs work, but he fed them well
                    and never galled them, and<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7155-274"/> the beasts loved
                    him. Lippo would hang his with tassels and flowers, and pat them if people were
                    looking! but he would prick them twenty times an hour and steal their fodder and
                    sell if for a penny and play morra. Do not talk to me! the fierce one for my
                    money!â</p>
                <p>So when Signa ran in to her and told her the story of the violin, not very
                    coherently, mingling the tinman and the little Christ and the gold pieces and
                    the marble bishop all together in an inextricable entanglement, Teresina was
                    sympathetic and held up her hands, and believed in the angels and wondered at
                    the beautiful gift with all the ardour that he could have desired, and said of
                    course, to be sure he might keep it there; why not? and play it there too, she
                    hoped, and opened for its safer concealment the heavy lid of a great chest she
                    had in her chamber; one of those sarcophagusâlike coffers, which the Middle Ages
                    made in such numbers and ornamented with such lavish care; this one was of oak
                    wood, very old; and a hungry connoisseur had told her that it was of the
                    workmanship of Dello and had offered her any money for it; but she had told him
                        that<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7155-275"/> Dello, whoever he was, was nothing to
                    her, and that the chest had held her bridal linen and now held her cereâclothes
                    already, and all of her own spinning, and would hold her granddaughtersâ and
                    great granddaughtersâ after her, she hoped.</p>
                <p>So the chest, whether of Dello or not, remained in its corner, and she opened it
                    and let Signa lay his Rusignuolo in it on her bridal sheets, and her shroud,
                    that she had finished last winter and was very proud of, and helped him cover it
                    with the dead roseâleaves and the sprigs of lavender, which she had put there to
                    keep moth away, and the bough of cypress which she had laid there to bring good
                    luck.</p>
                <p>So Signa, quite sure that all was safe, went away quite happy and shouldered his
                    kreel again, and went towards Lippoâs house.</p>
                <p>Signa turned up by the old shrine that has the grey wood door and the soft pink
                    colour and the frescoed seraphs by the high south gate, and mounted the paved
                    steep lane to Lippoâs house.</p>
                <p>There was a little gossipping crowd before it; old Baldo with his horn spectacles
                    shoved up on his forehead, and Momo the barber, who had a tongue<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7155-276"/> for twenty, and Caccarello, the coppersmith, and
                    several women, foremost of whom was Nita screaming at the top of her voice, with
                    both hands in air in gesticulation, and Toto beating the drum tattoo with a
                    metal spoon on a big fryingâpan as a sort of chorus to his motherâs cries.</p>
                <p>Whilst still he toiled up the lane concealed from their view by the burden of
                    cabbages, he caught her flying sentences, scattered like dry peas rolling out of
                    a basket.</p>
                <p>âTwo hundred francs in gold! given him, all for his peaking little face, and
                    thrown awayâthrown awayâthrown away on a wretched creaking thing that Tonino
                    kept amongst his nails and his keys! and never a centime brought to us! to
                    people that took him out of the water like a halfâdrowned pup and have spent our
                    substance on him ever since as if he were our own. Oh, the little viper!âfed at
                    my breast as he was and laid in the cradle with my own precious boy! Two hundred
                    francs all in gold!âall in gold! and the horrid little wretch squanders it on a
                    toy with a hole in it for the wind to come out of, squeaking like a mouse in a
                    trap. But there<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7155-277"/> must be law on itâthere must
                    be law! that brute Tonino could not claim a right to take such swarms of money
                    from a pauper brat!â</p>
                <p>âNay,â said the barber. âTonino tells us he swore his conscience was hair on end
                    at such a thing. But when a man has a knife at his throatââ</p>
                <p>âI saw the steel touch him, so he shivered,â swore Caccarello, the
                    coppersmith.</p>
                <p>âAnd the fiddle was worth a thousand francs. It was a rare Cremona,â whined the
                    barber. âIt is poor Tonino that is cheatedânear as bad as you, dear
                    neighbour!â</p>
                <p>âBut the money was not the little bratâs, it belonged to those who nourished and
                    housed him,â said a fat housewife, who often gossipped with Baldo over a nice
                    little mess of oil and onions.</p>
                <p>âThat, of course,â said Caccarello. âBut Lippo is so meek and mild. He has
                    cockered up that flyblow as if it were a princeâs lawfullyâbegotten son and
                    heir.â</p>
                <p>âLippo is a heavenâaccursed fool,â said old Baldo, with a blow of his staffâhe
                    was never<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7155-278"/> weary of telling his opinion of his
                    sonâinâlawââbut he is not to blame here. He never could have fancied that a
                    little beast would come home with the price of a prime bullock and go and waste
                    it on a fiddle without a thought of by your leave or for your leave, or any
                    remembrance of all he owed in common gratitude for bed and bread. The child
                    could be put in prison, and so he ought to be; what is a foundlingâs gain
                    belongs to those that feed him. That is fair law everywhere. If Lippo were not
                    daft he would hand the boy over to the law and let it deal with him.â</p>
                <p>âBravo!â said the little crowd, in chorus; for Baldo was a wellâtoâdo old man and
                    much respected, wearing a silk hat and velvet waistcoat upon feastâdays.</p>
                <p>âAy, truly,â said Nita, stretching her brawny brown arms in all the relish of
                    anticipated vengeance, while Toto beat louder on his fryingâpan, and called in
                    glee:</p>
                <p>âAnd you will shave his head now, mother? and give me that gilt ball of his to
                    sell? and when his back is raw as raw, you will let me rub the salt in it?â</p>
                <pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7155-279"/>
                <p>Nita kissed his shaven crown, forgetful of the character for goodness that she
                    had been at such pains to build up before her townsfolk; but Lippo, mindful of
                    his fair repute, reproved him.</p>
                <p>âOnly a little wholesome chastisement: that is all we ever allow; you know that,
                    my son.â</p>
                <p>And Toto grinned. He knew his fatherâs tricks of speech.</p>
                <p>The neighbours thought nothing of it; take a brat off the face of the flood and
                    bring it up out of charity, and then see it squander the first money that it
                    touched upon a fiddle, without so much as bringing home a farthing! They were
                    unanimously of opinion that it would have provoked a saint into exchanging her
                    palmâsheaf for a rod of iron.</p>
                <p>A fiddle too, that Tonino swore was worth a thousand francs, if one, and a purest
                    old Cremona; as if an oat pipe cut in the fields were not good enough for this
                    little cur picked out of the muddy water! And then they all of them had children
                    too; pretty children, or, at least, children they all thought pretty, and<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7155-280"/> where was ever a painter found to give them
                    money for their faces?</p>
                <p>Money was scarce in the Lastra, and popular feeling ran strong and high against
                    Signa for having ventured to have a piece of good fortune fall upon him. If he
                    had brought it home now and put it in Lippoâs strong box and Lippo had given
                    them all a supper with it, and played a quarter of it away in morra or draughts,
                    as no doubt he would have done, then, indeed, they might have pardoned it. But a
                    fiddle! and not a single centime for themselves.</p>
                <p>âPunish him I will,â murmured Lippo, goaded to desperation, but thinking woefully
                    of what his brother would say, or worse still, do, on his own skin and bones.
                    âStill, he is such a little thing, and saved by me, as one may sayânot that I
                    take merit. It is a horrible thingâall that good gold squandered on a fiddle,
                    and we robbing our precious children nine long years to feed a bastard deserted
                    by those that had the right; and yet, dear friends, a child no older than my
                    Totoââ</p>
                <p>âMaudlin ass,â quoth Baldo in high wrath,<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7155-281"/> while
                    the barber said that Lippo was too great a saint to live, and the others
                    answered that such goodness was beautiful, but Lippo must look at home; and all
                    the while Nita screamed on to the night air, bewailing.</p>
                <p>Signa heard, as he laboured up the hill beneath his load of cabbages, the angry
                    voices rolling down the slope and drifting to the Madonna sitting with the glory
                    round her head behind her little wooden wicket.</p>
                <p>The poor Madonna often heard such words. When they had spoken them worst they
                    gave her flowers.</p>
                <p>Signa heard. What had he done? That they had power to put him in prison he never
                    doubted. They had power to beat himâwhy not to do anything else?</p>
                <p>His limbs shook, and his heart sank within him. Yet one great thought of comfort
                    was with himâthe fiddle was safe under its roseâleaves and its lilac
                    mintâflowers. Teresina would not let it go.</p>
                <p>He understood that the story of his buying the violin had run through the Lastra,
                        gathering<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7155-282"/> exaggerated wonders as it went.
                    Indeed, if only he had thought a little, he would have known that the scene at
                    the tinmanâs shop by the archway never could pass without being talked about by
                    the dozen idle folks who had had nothing to do but to watch it.</p>
                <p>But even Bruno had not thought of that. Italians love secrets; but they bury them
                    as the ostrich buries her head.</p>
                <p>Toiling up under his overshadowing cabbages, and in the dusk of the evening, they
                    did not see him. The loud shrill voices thrilled to his very bones.</p>
                <p>âLet me get at him!â thundered old Baldo, who echoed his daughter always. âTwo
                    hundred francs! The little brute! And he owes me that for lodgement! Oh, Nita
                    mine! now see what comes of taking nameless mongrels ââ</p>
                <p>âTwo hundred francs!â moaned Lippo, his voice shaking with a sort of religious
                    horror, âWhen he might have brought half to my wife, who has been an angel of
                    mercy to him, and spent the other half in masses for his poor dead motherâs
                    soul, which all the devils are burning now!â</p>
                <pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7155-283"/>
                <p>âThat is the thought of a good man, but of an ass!â said Baldo bluntly. âThey
                    should have come to your strong box and mine, son; and as many francs as there
                    were shall he have lashes!â</p>
                <p>âLet me get at him!âlet me get at him! Oh, the little snake that I suckled at my
                    breast, robbing my own precious child for him! Two hundred francs! two hundred
                    francs! A yearâs rent! A flock of sheep!âwine to flood the town!âwaggons of
                    flour!âten yearsâ indulgence!âhalf this world and all the next, why one might
                    buy for such a sum as that! And flung away upon a fiddleâcase! But to prison the
                    child shall go, and Tonino must disgorge. Let me only catch him! Let him only
                    come home!â</p>
                <p>Signa, in the dark upon the stones, looking up, saw this excited crowd, with
                    waving hands, and fists thrust into each otherâs eyes, and faces glowing in the
                    light of the gateway lamp, and voices breaking out against him and blaming
                    Bruno.</p>
                <p>They were ready to fling him bodily into the Arno.</p>
                <pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7155-284"/>
                <p>He was shy, but he was brave. His heart sickened and his temples throbbed with
                    horror of the unknown things that they would wreak upon him. But he lowered the
                    load off his shoulders, and darted up the paved way into their midst.</p>
                <p>âIt is all untrue,â he panted to them. âIt was only forty francs, and Bruno had
                    nothing to do with it, and the little Gesu of Perugino sent me the money for my
                    own, and selfish it might be, I know; but that I have asked God; and beat me you
                    may till I am dead, or put me in prison, as you say, but it was all my own, and
                    my wooden Rusignuolo is safe, and you cannot touch it, and ââ</p>
                <p>A stroke of Nitaâs fist sent him down upon the ground.</p>
                <p>He was light and agile. He was on his feet in a second. All the wrongs and
                    sufferings of his childhood blazed up like fire in him. He was a gentle little
                    soul, and forgiving; but for once the blood burned within him into a furious
                    pain.</p>
                <p>Stung and bruised and heated and blinded by the blows that the woman rained on
                    him, he<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7155-285"/> sprang on her, struck her in the eyes
                    with all his force, and tearing himself out of the score of hands that clutched
                    at him, he slipped through his tormentors and fled down the slope.</p>
                <p>âI will tell Bruno! I will tell Bruno!â he sobbed as he went; and while the women
                    surrounded the screaming Nita, who shrieked that the little brute had blinded
                    her for life. A solemn silence fell upon the men, who looked at Lippo. If Bruno
                    were told, life would not pass smoothly at the Lastra.</p>
                <p>That minute of their hesitation gave the child time for his liberty. When Lippo
                    and the barber pursued him, he was out of sight, running fast under the shadow
                    of the outer walls, where all was silent in the dusk.</p>
                <p>âThis comes of doing good!â groaned Lippo to the barber.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
                <p><hi>SIGNA</hi> ran on under the walls where the men make ropes on the grass, but
                    where it was all deserted now.</p>
                <p>He had never known what passion was before. He had borne all illâusage as his
                    due. He had let himself be kicked and cuffed as a gentle little spaniel does,
                    only looking up with wistful eyes of sorrowful wonder.</p>
                <p>But now the fury of a sudden sense of unbearable wrong had boiled up in his veins
                    and mastered him, and was hissing still in his ears and beating still in his
                    brains.</p>
                <p>A sense of having done some great crime was heavy on him. He knew he had been
                    very wicked. He could feel himself striking, striking, striking, and the womanâs
                    eyeballs under<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7155-287"/> his hands. He might have killed
                    her for anything he knew. To his vivid little fancy and his great ignorance it
                    seemed quite possible. And yet he had borne everything so long, and never said a
                    word, and lain awake so many nights from pain of bruises.</p>
                <p>Could anybody be very angry with him for having lost his temper just this
                    once?</p>
                <p>Bruno would notâthat he knew.</p>
                <p>He heard the steps of Lippo and the barber and the mutterings of their voices
                    pursuing him. He ran as if he had wings. A great vague terror of hideous
                    punishment lent him the speed of a gazehound. He doubled the walls at headlong
                    speed, his bare feet scarcely touching the ground, and darted in at the door of
                    old Teresinaâs dwelling in the western gateway. By heavenâs mercy she had not
                    drawn the bolt.</p>
                <p>The old woman was in her short kirtle, with the handkerchief off her grey knot of
                    hair, getting ready for going to bed, with one little lamp burning under a paper
                    picture of the Nativity.</p>
                <p>Signa ran to her, tumbling over the spinningâ<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7155-288"/>
                    wheel and the dozing cat and the huge brown moonâlike loaf of bread.</p>
                <p>âOh, dear Teresina! let me hide here!â he cried in his terror, clinging to her
                    skirts. âLippo is after me. They are so angry about the violin, and I have hurt
                    Nita very much because she knocked me down. Hide meâhide me quick, or they will
                    kill me or give me to the guards!â</p>
                <p>Old Teresina needed not twice telling. She opened the big black coffer with the
                    illuminated figures, where she had hidden the violin inside, and motioned the
                    child to follow it. The coffer would have sheltered a man.</p>
                <p>She left the lid a little ajar, and Signa laid himself down at the bottom with
                    the oldâworld smell of incense and spiced woods. His wooden Rusignuolo was safe;
                    he kissed it, and clasped it to him. After all, what did anything matter, if
                    only they would leave that to him in peace?</p>
                <p>âLie still till they have been here to ask for you,â said Teresina; and she tied
                    her handkerchief over her head again and began to spin.</p>
                <p>In a few minutes there was rapping on her door.</p>
                <pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7155-289"/>
                <p>Teresina put her head out of the window, and called to know who was there.</p>
                <p>âIt is IâLippo,â a voice called up to her in answer. âIs the little devil with
                    you? We have loved him as our own, and now he has half murdered NitaâNita that
                    fed him from her bosom and treated him inch for inch like Toto all these years!
                    Here is Papucciâhe will tell you. Is the boy with you?â</p>
                <p>âI have not seen him all day,â said Teresina. âI thought he was on the hills.
                    Come up, good Lippo, and look, and tell me more. The child has a sweet pipe, but
                    heaven only knows where the devil may not lurk. Come up, Lippo, and tell me all.
                    You make me tremble.â</p>
                <p>âYou work late, mother,â said Lippo, suspiciously, tumbling up the stairs into
                    the chamber.</p>
                <p>âAye. Lisaâs bridal is on S. Anneâs day, and there is next to no sheeting. A
                    granddame must do what she can for the dower. But tell me allâallâquick, dear!
                    How white you look, the saints keep us!â</p>
                <p>âWhite! With a little viper nurtured nine years stinging you, and a dear, good
                    wife blind,<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7155-290"/> I daresay, for life, who would not
                    be white?â wept Lippo, glancing sharply through the shadows of the room. âAnd of
                    course you must have heardâtwo hundred francs and a beastly fiddle! and it is
                    enough to bring the judgment of Holy Church ââ</p>
                <p>âI have heard nothing,â said Teresina, with her hands uplifted in amaze. âSit
                    down and tell me, Lippo and Pupucci too; you look ready to drop, both of you.
                    Two hundred francs! Gesu! why, it would buy up the whole of the town! And a
                    fiddleâah, now I think of it, the dear naughty little lad was always sighing for
                    an old thing in Toninoâs window that he had played on once.â</p>
                <p>âIf I could find him or it I would break it in shivers over his head,â said
                    Lippo, forgetting his saintly savour. âI am a meek man, as you know, and a
                    merciful, and never say a harsh word to a dog; but my dear wife blind, and all
                    that money squandered, and Bruno, if that little beast is gone to him, ready to
                    smash every bone in my body! It is horrible!â</p>
                <p>âHorrible, truly,â gasped Teresina. âIt is<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7155-291"/> like
                    a green apple to set oneâs teeth on edge. But tell me the tale clear; how is one
                    to understand?â</p>
                <p>They told her the tale, both in the same breath, with every ornament that
                    imagination and indignation could lavish on it: death may be imminent, time may
                    be money, a moment lost may mean ruin or murder or a house devoured by flames;
                    but, all the same, Lippo and his countryâpeople will stop to tell their tale.
                    Let Deathâs scythe fall or Timeâs sands run out, they must stand still and tell
                    their tale.</p>
                <p>The storyâtellers of the Decamerone are true to nationality and nature.</p>
                <p>And while they told it Teresina trimmed fresh her lucernata, and made the wick
                    burn so brightly that there was not a nook or cranny of the little place in
                    which a mouse could have been hidden unseen.</p>
                <p>âBut you never will go after him to Brunoâs,â she said, when the narrative was
                    done, and all her horror poured out at it in strongest sympathy. âThe child is
                    halfâway there by this time, and Bruno takes part with him right or<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7155-292"/> wrongâyou best know whyâand he is so violent; and at
                    night, too, on that lonely hill; there might be mischief.â</p>
                <p>âAye, there might,â said Papucci, with a quaking in his voice: she knew her
                    men.</p>
                <p>âNo fear of that,â said Lippo, with a boast; âBruno is fierce, we all know his
                    faultâdear fellow, the saints change his heart! But with meâoh, never with
                    me.â</p>
                <p>âFor all that he shook you once many years ago when you beat the child all in
                    justice and goodâmeaningâshook you as a big dog does a little one,â said
                    Teresina, with a nod of her head and a twinkle in her eyes. âI would not go nigh
                    him, not toânight; you must think of your good Nita and all those children. With
                    the morning you shall be cool, both of you. But Bruno on that hill, in the
                    darkâI should not care to face him, not on ill terms. You have your family,
                    Lippo.â</p>
                <p>âBut if we leave it till the morning ââ</p>
                <p>âWell, what harm can come? The childâs sin is the same, and Nita can have law on
                    him; and, about the money, Bruno, of course, must hear<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7155-293"/> reason, and give up the fiddle, and let you get the
                    whole sum back. Tonino would see the justice of that: you have reared and roofed
                    the child; all his is yoursâthat is fair right. But if you cross Bruno, of a
                    sudden, in the night ââ</p>
                <p>âThere is reason in what you say, mother,â assented Lippo, whose heart was
                    hammering against his ribs in mortal terror of confronting Bruno.</p>
                <p>And after a little while he went, glad of an excuse to veil his fears from the
                    loquacious barber.</p>
                <p>âTell Nita I shall see her in the morning, and how sorry I am, because I loved
                    the ladâs little pipe, and never thought he had such evil in him,â said
                    Teresina, opening her door to call the valediction after them down the stairway.
                    Then she came and opened the lid of the coffer.</p>
                <p>âHe is gone nowâjump out, little one.â</p>
                <p>âOh, why did you keep him?â cried Signa, looking up as if he were in his coffin.
                    âI thought he never would go, and I was so afraid. And have I hurt her so much
                    as that, do you think?â</p>
                <pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7155-294"/>
                <p>âAs if your little fists could bruise a big cow like Nitaâwhat folly! I kept him
                    to send him away more surely. When you want to get rid of a man, press him to
                    stay; and if you have anything you need to hide, light two candles instead of
                    one. No, you have never hurt Nita. Take my word, she is eating an onion supper
                    this minute. But there will be trouble when Bruno knows, that I do fear.â</p>
                <p>Signa sat up in the coffer, holding the violin to his chest with two hands.</p>
                <p>âAm I a trouble to Bruno?â he said thoughtfully.</p>
                <p>âWell, I should think soâI am not sure. The brothers are always quarrelling about
                    you. There is something underneath. You have never complained to Bruno?â</p>
                <p>âNo. Georgio told me Bruno might kill Lippo if I did, and then they would hurt
                    Brunoâsend him to the galleys all his life; so Georgio said.â</p>
                <p>âLike enough,â muttered Teresina. âBut you cannot hide this, little one. All the
                    Lastra will talk about it.â</p>
                <pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7155-295"/>
                <p>âAnd there will be harm for Bruno?â</p>
                <p>âHe will be violent, I dare sayâhe always is. Bruno does not understand soft
                    answers, and Lippo is all in the wrong; and then, of course, Bruno must learn at
                    last how they have treated you. It will be a <foreign xml:lang="ita">pasticcio</foreign>.â</p>
                <p>Teresina sat down on her wooden chair, and twitched the kerchief off her head,
                    again perplexed and sorrowful; to make a <foreign xml:lang="ita">pasticcio</foreign>âa bad pastyâis the acme of woe and trouble to her
                    nation.</p>
                <p>âCan I do anything?â said Signa wistfully, sitting still in the open coffer.</p>
                <p>âNoânot that I seeâunless you could put yourself out of the world,â said the old
                    woman, not meaning anything in particular, but only the utter hopelessness of
                    the matter in her eyes.</p>
                <p>Signa looked up in silence; he did not miss a word.</p>
                <p>âNo, there is nothing to be done,â said Teresina, in anxious meditation. âBruno
                    will get into trouble about youâI have always thought he would. But that is not
                    your fault, poor little soul! There is something â. Lippo is a fox.<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7155-296"/> He plays his cards well, but what his game has been
                    nobody knows. Perhaps he has made a mistake now. Bruno must know they have
                    illâused you. That comes of this money. Money is god and devil. Why could that
                    painter go and give you gold?âa bit of a thing like you. Any other man than
                    Bruno would have put it by to buy you your coat for your first communion. But
                    that was always Brunoâone hand on his knife and the other scattering gifts. For
                    my part, I think Bruno the better man of the two, but no one else does. Yes;
                    there must be trouble. Bruno will break his brotherâs head, and Lippo will have
                    law on him. You might go to Tonino and get him to take the fiddle back; but then
                    it was only forty francs, and Lippo will always scream for the two hundred that
                    the fools have chattered about; that would be no good. Oh, Dio mio! If only that
                    angel at the Certosa had not sent you anything. Angels stand aloof so many
                    years, and then they put their finger in the dough and spoil the baking. May
                    they forgive me up above! I am an ignorant old woman, but if they would only
                    answer prayer a little<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7155-297"/> quicker or else not at
                    all. I speak with all respect. My child, sleep here toânight, and be off at dawn
                    to Bruno. Sleep on it. Get up while it is grey, to have the start of Lippo and
                    his people. But sleep here. There is a bit of grass matting that will serve
                    youâthere, where the cat is gone. And I will get you a drop to drink and a bit
                    of bread, for tired you must be and shaken; and what the Lastra see in Lippo to
                    make a saint of baffles me; a whiteâlivered coward and a selfâseeker. He will
                    die rich; see if he do not die rich! He will have a podere, and keep his
                    baroccino, I will warrant, before all is done!â</p>
                <p>She brought the child the little glass of red wine and a big crust; he drank the
                    wineâhe could not eatâand laid down as she told him by the cat upon the matting.
                    He was so unhappy for Bruno; the Rusignuolo scarcely comforted him, only every
                    now and then he would stretch out his hand and touch it, and make sure that it
                    was there; and so fell asleep, as children will, be they ever so sorrowful.</p>
                <p>He woke while it was still dark, from long habit, but the old woman was already
                    astir. She<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7155-298"/> made him take a roll and a slice of
                    melon, as she opened her wooden shutter and looked out on to the little acacia
                    trees below, and the big mountain, that was as yet grey and dark.</p>
                <p>âGet you up the hill, dear, to Bruno, and out of the house before the men are
                    about underneath with the straw,â she said to him. âand I do not know what you
                    can say; and I misdoubt there will be ill words and bad blows; and it has been
                    said for many a year that Bruno would end his days at the galleys. I remember
                    his striking his sister once at the wine fair in Pratoâsuch a scene as there
                    wasâand the blood spoiled her <choice>
                        <corr>brand</corr>
                        <sic>bran</sic>
                    </choice> new yellow bodice, that was fit for the Blessed Maryâspeaking with all
                    respect. There is Gian undoing his big doors belowâevery place is full of grain
                    now. Run, run, dear little fellow, and the saints be with you, and do not forget
                    that they love a peacemaker; though, for the matter of that, we folks are not
                    like themâwe love a feud and a fight, and we will prick our best friend with a
                    pin rather than have dull times and no quarrel. Run off quick, and take the
                    melon with you.â</p>
                <pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7155-299"/>
                <p>He did as she told him, and ran away. She watched him from the little square
                    window over the carnation pots. She was a good soul, but she could not help a
                    thrill of longing to see how Bruno would down into the Lastra like a brown bull
                    gored and furious.</p>
                <p>âOnly the one that is in the right always gets the worst of it,â thought Teresina
                    (who had seen her seventy years of life), as the last star died out of the
                    skies, and she turned from the lattice to scrub out her pipkins and pans, and
                    fill her copper pitcher with water, and sweep the ants away with her reed besom,
                    and then sat down to spin on at Lisaâs bridal sheeting, glancing now and then at
                    the mountain, and wondering what would happen.</p>
                <p>What would happen?</p>
                <p>That was what tortured the little beating heart of Signa, as he ran out into the
                    lovely cold darkness of the dawn, as the chimes of the clocks told four in the
                    morning. He held his slice of melon and bread in one hand, and clasped the
                    violin and its bow close to him with the other. A<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7155-300"/> terrible sense of guilt, of uselessness, of injury to
                    others, weighed on him.</p>
                <p>Even Teresina, who was fond of him, had confessed that he was a burden to Bruno,
                    and a cause for strife at all times, and no better. Even Teresina, who was so
                    good to him, had said that he could do nothing unless he could get himself out
                    of the world.</p>
                <p>The words pursued him with a sense that the old woman would have bitten her
                    tongue through rather than have conveyed into the childâs mindâa sense of being
                    wanted by no one, useful to no one, undesirable and wearisome, and altogether
                    out of place in creation.</p>
                <p>He was old enough to feel it sharply, and not old enough to measure it rightly.
                    Besides Nita and Toto and Georgio and all of them, had told him the same thing
                    ten thousand times: what was said so often by so many must be true.</p>
                <p>To kill himself never entered his thoughts. The absolute despair which makes life
                    loathsome cannot touch a child. But he did think of running away, hiding,
                    effacing himself, as a little hare tries to do when the hounds are after it.</p>
                <pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7155-301"/>
                <p>He would go away, he thought; it was his duty; it was the only thing he could do
                    to serve Bruno, and he was ashamed of himself, and so sorrowful; and perhaps
                    people might be kind to him on the other side of the mountains where the sun
                    came from; perhaps they might when they heard the Rusignuolo. Other boys decide
                    to run away for love of adventure or weariness of discipline, but he resolved to
                    run away because he was a burden and brought wild words between two brothers,
                    and was good for nothing else.</p>
                <p>The curse of granted prayers lay heavy on his young frightened soul. The thing he
                    had desired was with him; the thing that he had thought was sweeter than food or
                    friends or home, or anything; and yet his feet were weary and his heart was sick
                    from the woe which it had brought upon him.</p>
                <p>âStill it is mineâreally mine!â he thought, with a thrill of happiness which
                    nothing could wholly stifle in him, as his hand wandered over the strings as he
                    went, and drew out from them soft sighing murmurs like the pipe of waking
                    birds.</p>
                <pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7155-302"/>
                <p>Meanwhile he was quite resolute to run away; down into Florence, he thought, and
                    then over to where the sunrise was. Of the west he was afraid; the sea was
                    there, of which he had heard terrible things in the winter evenings, and the
                    west always devoured the sun, and he supposed it was always night there.</p>
                <p>âI will just bid Gemma goodâbyeâjust once,â he thought, running one, stumbling,
                    and not seeing his way, because his eyes were so brimming with tears; but sight
                    did not matter much. He could find his way about quite safely in the darkest
                    night.</p>
                <p>The gates of the great gardens were open, for the labourers were already at work
                    there, and he ran into the shadowy, fresh, dewâwet place, looking for her.</p>
                <p>If he could find her without going to the cottage, he thought, it would be best,
                    because her father might have heard and might detain him, thinking to please
                    Bruno.</p>
                <p>He was not long before he saw her. Out of bed at daybreak, as birds are out of
                    their nests, lying on her back in the wet grass by the marble<pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7155-303"/> pond, where the red Egyptian rushes were in flower,
                    and muching the last atom of a hard black crust which had been given her for her
                    breakfast, while the big water lilies still were shut up, and the toads were
                    hobbling home to their dwellings in the bottom of the tanks.</p>
                <p>Gemma was one of those beautiful children, who, in the land of Raffaelle, are not
                    a fable. As they grow older, they will lose their beauty almost always; but the
                    few people who ever had time to look at Gemma, thought that she would never lose
                    hers.</p>
                <p>No doubt there was some strains of the old Goth or of the German blood in her
                    from the far times when Totila had tramped with his warriors over the ravaged
                    valleys, or Otho had come down like a hawk into the plains. She was brilliantly
                    fair; as she lay now on the grass on her back, with her knees drawn up and her
                    rosy toes curled, and her arms above her head, she shone in the sun like a
                    pearl, and her face might have come out of Botticelliâs choir, with its little
                    scarlet mouth and its wonderful bloom and its mass of lightest<pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7155-304"/> golden hair cut short to the throat, but falling over
                    the eyes.</p>
                <p>âGemma, I have brought you some more breakfast,â he said to the pretty little
                    child.</p>
                <p>She threw her arms round his neck, and set her pearly teeth into the melon. The
                    bread followed. When she had done both she touched his cheek with her
                    finger.</p>
                <p>âWhy are you crying?â</p>
                <p>âBecause I am no use to anyone. Because I bring trouble on everybody.â</p>
                <p>Gemma surveyed him with calm, serious eyes.</p>
                <p>âYou bring me good things to eat.â</p>
                <p>That was his use; in her eyes there could be no better.</p>
                <p>The tears fell down Signaâs face; he sobbed under his breath, and kissed Gemmaâs
                    light curling locks with a sorrow and force in his lips that she did not
                    understand.</p>
                <p>âI think I will go away, Gemma,â he said, with a sort of desperate resolve.</p>
                <p>Gemma, who was not easily excited, surveyed him with her blue eyes seriously as
                    before.</p>
                <p>âWhere?â</p>
                <pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7155-305"/>
                <p>âI do not know.â</p>
                <p>âThat is silly.â</p>
                <p>Gemma was a year younger than he. But she was not vague as he was, nor did she
                    ever dream.</p>
                <p>âI will go away, I and the Rusignuolo,â said Signa, with a sob in his throat. âIt
                    is the only way to be no burdenâto make peace.â</p>
                <p>Gemma pushed a lizard with her little rosy toes.</p>
                <p>âMimi does not bring me so much fruit as you do,â she said thoughtfully. Mimi was
                    a neighbourâs son, who was nine years old, and worshipped her, and brought her
                    such green plums and unripe apples as his fatherâs few rickety trees would
                    yield, by windfalls. She was wondering how it would be with her if she were left
                    to Mimi only.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps I will get you beautiful golden fruit where I go,â said Signa, who
                    always unconsciously fell into figures and tropes. âThe signore in the monastery
                    said my mouth would drop pearls. I have seen pearlsâbeautiful white beads that
                    the ladies wear. They are on the goldsmithâs bridge in the city. When my lips
                        make<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7155-306"/> them you shall have them round your
                    curls, Gemma, and on your throat, and on your arms; how pretty you will be!â</p>
                <p>He was smiling though his tears, and kissing her. Gemma listened.</p>
                <p>âWith a gold cross like Biceâs?â she said, breathlessly. Bice was a rich
                    contadina who had such a necklace, a string of pearls with a gold cross, which
                    she wore on very high feasts and sacred anniversaries.</p>
                <p>âJust like Biceâs,â said Signa, thinking of his own woe and answering to please
                    her.</p>
                <p>Gemma reflected: pushing her little foot against the wet gravel in lines and
                    circles.</p>
                <p>âRun away, at once!â said she suddenly, with a little shout that sent the lizards
                    scampering.</p>
                <p>âOh, Gemma!â Signa felt a sting, as if a wasp had pierced him. Gemma loved him no
                    more than this.</p>
                <p>âRun away, directly!â said the little child, with a stamp of her foot, like a
                    baby empress.</p>
                <p>âTo get you the pearls?â</p>
                <p>Gemma nodded.</p>
                <pb n="306" xml:id="VAB7155-307"/>
                <p>Signa sat still, thinking; his tears fell; his eyes watched a blue and grey
                    butterfly in the white bells of the aloe flower. He could not be utterly
                    unhappy, because he had the violin. If it had not been for that â</p>
                <p>âWhy do you not go?â said the little child fretfully, with the early sunbeams all
                    about her little yellow head in a nimbus of light.</p>
                <p>Signa got up; he was very pale; his great brown eyes swam in a mist of tears.</p>
                <p>âWellâI will goâI have got the Rusignuolo. Perhaps it is not true what the
                    signore saidâbut I will go and see. If I can get pearlsâor anything that is
                    goodâthen I will come back, and the Lastra will be glad of me, and I will give
                    everything to the Lastra, and to Bruno and you. Only, to go awayâit will kill
                    me, I think. But if I do die, I shall be no burden anymore then on anyone. And
                    if the signore spoke truth, and I am worth anything, then I will be great. When
                    I am a man I will come back and live here always, because no place can be ever
                    so beautiful; and I will make new gates, all of beaten gold; and I will build
                    the walls up<pb n="307" xml:id="VAB7155-308"/> where they are broken; and I will
                    give corn and wine in plenty everywhere, and there shall be beautiful singing
                    all the night and day, and music in all the peopleâs homes, and we will go out
                    through the fields every morning praising God; and then Signa will not be old or
                    forgotten any more, but all the world will hear of herââ</p>
                <p>And he went, not looking back once at the rushes and the waterâlily and the
                    little child; seeing only his own visions, and believing them;âas children and
                    poets will.</p>
                <p>But Gemma, pausing a moment, ran after him.</p>
                <p>âTake me, too!â</p>
                <p>âTake youâaway?â</p>
                <p>âYes. I want to go too.â</p>
                <p>Signa kissed her with delight.</p>
                <p>âYou are so fond of meâas that?â</p>
                <p>âOh, yes; and I am so tired of black bread, and Mimiâs plums are always
                    green.â</p>
                <p>Signa put her away a little sadly.</p>
                <p>âYou must not come. There is your father.â</p>
                <p>âYes. I will come. I want to see what you will see.â</p>
                <pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7155-309"/>
                <p>âBut, if you should be unhappy?â</p>
                <p>âI will come back again.â</p>
                <p>Signa wavered. He longed for his playmate. But he knew that she wished a wrong
                    thing.</p>
                <p>âI cannot take you,â he said, with a sigh. âIt would be wicked. Palma would cry
                    all the day long. Besides, I am nothingânobody wants me. I go to spare Bruno
                    pain and trouble; that is different. But you, Gemma, all of them love you.â</p>
                <p>âLet us go,â said Gemma, putting her hand in his.</p>
                <p>âBut I dare not take you!â</p>
                <p>âYou do not take me,â said Gemma, with a roguish smile, and the sophism of a
                    woman grown. âYou do not take me. I go.â</p>
                <p>âBut why? Because you love me?â</p>
                <p>Gemma ruffled her golden locks.</p>
                <p>âBecause they give me nothing to eat.â</p>
                <p>âThey give you as much as they have themselves.â</p>
                <p>âAh! but you will give me more than you have,â said Gemma, with the external
                    foolishness and internal logic of female speech.</p>
                <pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7155-310"/>
                <p>Signa put her away with a sigh.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps I shall have nothing, Gemma. Do not come.â</p>
                <p>Gemma stopped to think.</p>
                <p>âYou will always get something for <emph>me</emph>,â she said, at last. âTake
                    meâor I will go and tell Bruno.â</p>
                <p>Signa hesitated, and succumbed to the stronger will and the resolute selfishness
                    of the little child: they are more often feminine advantages than the world
                    allows.</p>
                <p>âYou will be angry with me, Gemma, in a day, if I let you have your way,â he
                    said, hanging his head in sad perplexity.</p>
                <p>Gemma laughed: she was so pretty when she laughed; Fra Angelico would have
                    delighted to paint her so.</p>
                <p>âWhen I am angry, I am not dull,â she said, with much foresight for her own
                    diversion. âThe boys slap me back again. But you never do. Let us goâor I will
                    run up and tell Bruno.â</p>
                <p>âCome, then,â said Signa, with a sigh; he knew that she would do what she said.
                        Gemma,<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7155-311"/> nine years old, was already a woman
                    in many ways, and had already found out that a determination to please herself
                    and to heed no one elseâs pleasure was the only royal road to comfort in earthly
                    life.</p>
                <p>And she was resolved to go; already she had settled with herself what she would
                    make Signa do, shaping out her projects clearly in the sturdy little brain that
                    lived under her amber curls.</p>
                <p>She was thought a beautiful child, but stupid; people were wrong.</p>
                <p>Gemma lying doing nothing under a laurel bush, with her angelic little face, and
                    her stubborn refusal to learn to read, or learn to plait, or learn to spin, or
                    learn to do anything, was as shrewd as a little fox club for her own enjoyments
                    and appetites. She lay in the sun, and Palma did the work.</p>
                <p>âWe will go to Prato,â said Gemma, all smiles now that her point was gained.</p>
                <p>âI thoughtâFlorence,â said Signa, who, in his own thoughts, had resolved to go
                    there.</p>
                <p>âChÃ¨!â said Gemma, with calm scorn. âBoys<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7155-312"/> never
                    think. You would meet Bruno on the road. It is Friday.â</p>
                <p>Friday is the market day, when all fattori and contadini having any green stuff
                    to sell, or grain to chaffer for, or accounts to settle with, meet in the scorch
                    of the sun, or in the teeth of the north wind, in face of Orcagnaâs Loggia; a
                    weatherâworn, stalwart, breezy, loquacious crowd, with eyes that smile like
                    sunny waters, and rough cloaks tossed over one shoulder, and keen lips at close
                    bargains either with foe or friend.</p>
                <p>âAnd there is a fair at Prato,â said Gemma, âI heard them saying so at the
                    millhouseâwhen I took Babboâs grain.â</p>
                <p>âBut what have we to do with a fair?â said Signa, whose heart was half
                    broken.</p>
                <p>Gemma smiled till her little red pomegranate bud of a mouth showed all her teeth,
                    but she did not answer him. She knew what they would have to do with it. But
                    heâhe was dreaming of gates of inlaid gold for the Lastra.</p>
                <p>What was the use of talking any sense to him? He was so foolish: so Gemma
                    thought.</p>
                <p>âPrato goes outâto the world,â she said, not<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7155-313"/>
                    knowing very well what she meant, but feeling that an indefiniteness of speech
                    was best suited to this dreamer with whom she had to do. âAnd if you want to get
                    away you must go there at onceâor you will have Bruno or Lippo coming on you,
                    and then there will be murder; so you say. Come. Let us run across the bridge
                    while we can. There is nobody here. Comeârun.â</p>
                <p>âCome, then,â said Signa, under his breath, for it frightened him. But Gemma was
                    not frightened at all.</p>
                <p>It was now five.</p>
                <p>The great western mountain had caught the radiance of the morning shining on it
                    from the opposite mountains, and was manyâcoloured as an opal; the moon was
                    blazing like a globe of phosphorous, while the east was warm still with rosy
                    light; all above them, hills and fields and woods and river and town, were
                    bathed in that full clear light, that coldness of deep dew, that freshness of
                    stirring wind, that make the earth as young at every summer sunrise in the
                    sough, as though Eos and Dionysius were not dead with all the fancies and the
                    faiths of men,<pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7155-314"/> and in their stead Strauss and
                    Hegel reigning, twin godhead of the dreary day.</p>
                <p>She took his hand and ran with him.</p>
                <p>Signaâs tears fell fast and his face was very pale; he kept looking back over his
                    shoulder at each yard; but the little child laughed as she ran at topmost speed
                    on her little bare toes, dragging him after her down the piece of road to the
                    bridge, and across the bridge, and so on to the hillside.</p>
                <p>âI know Prato is the other way of the mountains,â said Gemma, who had more
                    practical shrewdness in her little rosy finger than Signa in all his mind and
                    body. âI have seen the people go to the markets and fairs, and they always go up
                    herâup, upâand then over.â</p>
                <p>Signa hardly heard. He ran with her because she had tight hold of his hand; but
                    he was looking back at the gates of the Lastra.</p>
                <p>No one said anything to them. On the north side of the bridge no one had heard
                    the terrible story; and if they had heard, would not have had leisure to say
                    anything, because it was threshing time, and everybody was busy in one way or<pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7155-315"/> another with the cornâpiling it one the
                    waggons, driving the oxen out to the fields for it, tossing it into the barns or
                    the courtyards, banging the flails over it, or stacking the straw in ricks, with
                    a long pole riven through each to stay the force of the hurricanes.</p>
                <p>When the country side is all yellow with reaped grain, or all purple with
                    gathered grapes, Signa people would not have time to notice an emperor; their
                    hearts and souls are in their threshing barns and wineâpresses. When they are
                    quiet again, and have nothing to do but to plait or to loiter, then they will
                    make a mammoth out of a midge in the way of talk, as well as any gossippers
                    going.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
                <p><hi>THERE</hi> were many mules, and horses, and carts, and men, and women, and
                    asses rattling out over the cross roads from the many various villages and farms
                    towards Prato.</p>
                <p>In the ways of the Lastra itself dust was rising as the noisy ramshackle
                    baroccini were pulled out of their stables and got ready with any poor beast
                    that was at home. The cattle had all been driven over in strings the night
                    before from every part of the country, lowing, whinnying, and bleating as they
                    went.</p>
                <p>The road over the hill was thick with dust, and trampled with traffic as the
                    children climbed it, and many a ropeâharnessed horse and crazy<pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7155-317"/> vehicle flew by them in a cloud of white powder, the
                    driver shrieking, âVia, via, via!â</p>
                <p>âWe shall be seen and stopped,â said Signa, shrinking back; but Gemma pulled him
                    onward.</p>
                <p>âNonsense,â she said, steadily. âThey do not think about us; they think about
                    themselves and the fair; and where they will drink and eat, and how they will
                    cheat.â</p>
                <p>Gemma dwelt under the lemon leaves of lonely Giavola; but her experiences of life
                    had been sufficient to tell her, that when your neighbour is eating well and
                    cheating comfortably he will usually let you alone.</p>
                <p>She would not let him go back; she kept close hold of his hand, and trotted on
                    her rosy, strong little feet that tired no more than do a mountain ponyâs.</p>
                <p>She was right in her conclusions. The carts rattled by and no one took any notice
                    of them. Two children running by the wayside were nothing uncommon, that anyone
                    should remark on it and reflect about it; and one or two people who did look at
                    them and recognise them supâ<pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7155-318"/> posed that they
                    were going somewhere on some errand for Sandro or for Bruno.</p>
                <p>They went along unmolested till the sun rose higher and the glittering heavy dews
                    began to pass off from the earth as the day widened.</p>
                <p>They descended the hill and proceeded along the straight road of the plain; the
                    great line of the northern mountains unrolled before them in the morning light,
                    with airy grey summits high in the clouds, and the lower spurs purple with
                    shadow, and here and there the white gleam of a village dropped in a ravine, or
                    of a little town shining at the foot of a bold scarp. Monte Morello rose the
                    highest of all the heights, looking a blue, solemn, naked peak against the
                    radiant sky, keeping the secrets of his green oak forests and his emerald snakes
                    for such as have the will and strength to see him near. Beyond, in the distance,
                    far behind the nearer range, were the fantastic slopes of the mountains by the
                    sea, that saw the flames of Shelleyâs pyre rise on the solitary shore. They were
                    of faint rose hue, and had a silvery light about them. Signa looked at them;
                    they seemed to him like domes and towers.</p>
                <pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7155-319"/>
                <p>âAre those temples, do you think?â he said, in an awed voice, to Gemma.</p>
                <p>Gemma looked, and put her finger in her mouth.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps they are the tops of the big booths at the fair.â</p>
                <p>âOh, Gemma!â he said, with pained disgust, and would have loosened his hand, but
                    she held it too close and tight.</p>
                <p>âIf they are booths, we shall get to them in time,â she said.</p>
                <p>âI would rather they were temples, though we might never get to them,â said he,
                    with heat and pain.</p>
                <p>âThat is silly,â said Gemma.</p>
                <p>What use were those temples that one never got to;âor of any temples, indeed?
                    Nobody ever fried in them, or made sweetmeats.</p>
                <p>That is what she thought to herself, but she did not say so aloud. He was so
                    silly; he never saw these things; and she wished to keep him in good humour.</p>
                <p>In time they reached Poggio Caiano: they were used to run along dusty roads in
                    the sun<pb n="319" xml:id="VAB7155-320"/> and did not tire quickly. They could
                    both of them run a dozen miles or more with very little fatigue, but it was now
                    seven in the morning.</p>
                <p>âI am thirsty,â said Gemma. âI should like some milk. Ask for it.â</p>
                <p>There was a cottage by the side of the road with wooden sheds and cackling hens,
                    and bits of grass land under shady mulberries. She saw two cows there. Signa
                    hung back.</p>
                <p>âWe have nothing to buy it withânothing!â</p>
                <p>âHow helpless you are,â said Gemma, and she put her pretty golden head in at the
                    cottage door. There was a brown, kindlyâlooking woman there, plucking dead
                    pigeons.</p>
                <p>âDear mother,â said Gemma, coaxingly, âyou look so good, could you give us just a
                    little drop of water? We have been walking half the night. Father is gone to
                    Prato with a string of donkeys to sell, and we are to meet him there, and were
                    are soâoh, so thirsty!â</p>
                <p>âPoor little souls!â said the woman, melted in a moment, for all Italians are
                    kind in little things. âMy child, what a face you haveâlike the baby, Jesus!
                    Step in here and I<pb n="320" xml:id="VAB7155-321"/> will get you a draught of
                    milk. Is that your brother?â</p>
                <p>âYes,â said Gemma.</p>
                <p>âOh, Gemma! to lie is so wicked!â murmured Signa, plucking at her ragged
                    skirt.</p>
                <p>âIs it?â said Gemma, showing her pearly teeth; âthen everybody is wicked, dear;
                    and the good God must have his hands full!â</p>
                <p>The woman brought them out two little wooden bowls of milk.</p>
                <p>Gemma drank from hers as thirstily and prettily as a little snake could do. Signa
                    refused his. He said he did not wish for it.</p>
                <p>âPerhaps you are hungry,â said the woman, and offered them two hunches of
                    wholesome bread.</p>
                <p>Signa shook his head and put his hands behind his back.</p>
                <p>Gemma took both.</p>
                <p>âYou are so kind,â she said, winningly, âand we are hungry. My brother is shy,
                    that is all.â</p>
                <p>âPoor little dear!â said the good housewife, won and touched, so that she brought
                    out some figs as well. âAnd you have been walking far?<pb n="321" xml:id="VAB7155-322"/> and have so far still to go? Your father is
                    cruel.â</p>
                <p>âHe is very poor,â said Gemma, sadly, âand glad to get a copper driving the
                    asses. We come from Scandicci, a long way.â</p>
                <p>And then she threw her arms around the woman prettily, and kissed her, and
                    trotted on, hugging the bread and figs.</p>
                <p>The woman watched them out of sight.</p>
                <p>âA sweet child,â she thought. âIf the good Madonna had only given me the like!âah
                    me! I would have thanked her day and night. The boy is handsome tooâbut sulky.
                    Poor babies, it is very far to go.â</p>
                <p>And she called Gemma back and kissed her again, and gave her a little bit of
                    money, being a softâhearted soul and well to do herself.</p>
                <p>âIs it wicked to lie?â said Gemma to Signa, showing her white little teeth again.
                    âBut, look!âit does answer, you see!â</p>
                <p>âI cannot talk to you, Gemma,â said the body, wearily; âyou are so wrong, you
                    grieve me so.â</p>
                <p>Gemma laughed.</p>
                <p>âAnd yet it is me you always want to kissâ<pb n="322" xml:id="VAB7155-323"/> not
                    Palma. Palma, who never tells a lie at all!â</p>
                <p>Signa coloured. He knew that that was true. He went on silently, holding the
                    violin close to him, and not giving his hand to Gemma any more. She did not try
                    to take it; it was too far for him to turn back.</p>
                <p>They came to the royal gardens of the palace where once Bianca Capella reigned
                    and was happy, and studied her love philtres and potions for deathâs sleep. Some
                    great gates stood ajar; there were the green shade of trees and shadows of thick
                    grass.</p>
                <p>âLet us go in,â said Gemma; and they went in, and she sat down on the turf and
                    began to taste the sweetness of her figs.</p>
                <p>Signa stood by her, silent and sad. She was so wrong, and yet she was so pretty,
                    and she could make him do the things he hated, and he was full of pain because
                    he had left the Lastra and the hills, and went he knew not whither.</p>
                <p>âWhat are you doing there, you little tramps! Be off with you,â cried one of the
                    gardeners of the place, espying them.</p>
                <pb n="323" xml:id="VAB7155-324"/>
                <p>Gemma lifted to him her blue caressing eyes.</p>
                <p>âAre we doing wrong? Oh, dear signore, let us stop a little, just a very little;
                    we will into stir from here; only we are so tired, so very tired, and in the
                    road it is hot and dusty and the carts are so many!â</p>
                <p>The gardener looked at her and grumbled, and relented.</p>
                <p>âIf you do not stir you may stop a little whileâa very little,â he said at last.
                    âWhere have you come from, you baby angel?â</p>
                <p>âFrom Scandicci; and we go to Prato.â</p>
                <p>The man lifted his hands in horror, because Scandicci was a long long way, away
                    upon the Greve river.</p>
                <p>âFrom Scandicci! Poor children! Well, rest a little if you like.â</p>
                <p>And he left the gate open for them.</p>
                <p>âHave you beautiful flowers here?â said Gemma, softly, glancing through the
                    trees. âI do love flowers!â</p>
                <p>She did not care for a flower more than for a turnip, living amongst gardens
                    always, as she had<pb n="324" xml:id="VAB7155-325"/> done. But she knew flowers
                    went to market, like the butter and the eggs.</p>
                <p>âDo you? You are a flower yourself,â said the gardener, who had had three pretty
                    children and lost them. âWhat are you going to do, you and your brother?â</p>
                <p>âWe are going to play in Prato. We have no father or mother. He makes the music
                    and I dance,â said Gemma, who, though without imagination of the finer sort,
                    could ring the changes prettily in lying.</p>
                <p>âPoor little things; and what are your names?â</p>
                <p>âI am Rita; and he is Paolo,â said Gemma. âDo you think you could give me a
                    flowerâjust oneâto smell at as I go along?â</p>
                <p>âI will see,â said the man, smiling.</p>
                <p>Signa stood by mute, with a swelling heart. He knew that he ought to stop her in
                    her falsehoods, but he was afraid to vex her and afraid to lose her. He
                    listened, wounded and ashamed, and feeling himself a coward.</p>
                <p>âWhy do you do such things, Gemma?â he cried, piteously, as the gardener turned
                    away.</p>
                <p>âIt is no use telling you, you are so silly,â<pb n="325" xml:id="VAB7155-326"/>
                    said Gemma; and she ate fig after fig, lying on her back in the shade of the
                    trees where once Bianca and Francesco had wandered when their love and the
                    summer were at height; and where their spirits wander still at midnight, so the
                    peasants say.</p>
                <p>In a little time the gardener returned, bringing with him a basket of cut
                    flowers.</p>
                <p>âYou may like to sell these in Prato,â he said to the child. âAnd you will find a
                    peach or two at the bottom.â</p>
                <p>âOh, how good you are!â cried Gemma, springing up; and she kissed the flowers and
                    then the brown hand of the man.</p>
                <p>âYou have but a sulky companion, I fear,â said the gardener, glancing at the boy,
                    who stood aloof.</p>
                <p>âOh, no! He is only shy and tired. What is this great house?â</p>
                <p>âIt is a palace.â</p>
                <p>âAre there people in it?â</p>
                <p>âNo. Only ghosts!â</p>
                <p>âGhosts of what?â</p>
                <p>âOf a great wicked woman who lived here; and<pb n="326" xml:id="VAB7155-327"/>
                    her lovers. She was a bakerâs daughter, but she murdered many people, and got to
                    be a duchess of Tuscany.â</p>
                <p>âDid she murder them to be a duchess?â</p>
                <p>âThey say so; and to keep her secrets!â</p>
                <p>Gemma opened wondering eyes.</p>
                <p>âAnd she walks here at night?â</p>
                <p>âBy night; not that I can say I have ever seen her myself.â</p>
                <p>âI should like to meet her.â</p>
                <p>âWhy?â</p>
                <p>âPerhaps she would tell me how she did it.â</p>
                <p>The gardener stared,âthen laughed.</p>
                <p>âYou pretty cherub!âif you have patience, and grow a woman, you will find out all
                    that yourself.â</p>
                <p>âCome away,â said Signa, and he dragged her out through the open gates.</p>
                <p>She turned to kiss her hand to the gardener. Signa dragged her on in haste.</p>
                <p>âA rude boy that,â said the man, as he shut the gates on them.</p>
                <p>âThey are flowers worth five francs!â said<pb n="327" xml:id="VAB7155-328"/>
                    Gemma, hugging her basket of roses; âand you think it is no use to tell
                    lies?â</p>
                <p>âI think it is very vile and base.â</p>
                <p>âPooh!â said Gemma, and she danced along in the dust. She had got a basket worth
                    five francs, bread and fruit enough for the day, and some copper pieces as well;
                    all by looking pretty and just telling a nice little lie or two.</p>
                <p>He seemed very helpless to her. He had got nothing.</p>
                <p>âIt is very hot walking,â she said, presently.</p>
                <p>âYes,â said Signa. âBut we are used to it, you and I.â</p>
                <p>âI hate it, though.â</p>
                <p>âBut we must do it if we want to get to Prato.â</p>
                <p>âMust we?â</p>
                <p>She thought a few minutes, then looked behind her; in the distance there were
                    coming along a baroccino and an old white horse.</p>
                <p>Gemma gave a sudden cry of pain.</p>
                <p>âWhat is it, Gemma, dear?â cried Signa, melted in a moment and catching her.</p>
                <pb n="328" xml:id="VAB7155-329"/>
                <p>âI have twisted my foot on a stone. Oh, Signa, how it hurts!â</p>
                <p>She sat down on a log of wood that chanced to lie there, and rubbed her little
                    dusty foot dolefully. Signa knelt down in the dust, and took the little wounded
                    foot upon his knee and caressed it with fond words. He could see no hurt; but
                    then no one sees sprains or strains till they begin to swell.</p>
                <p>âOh, Signa, we never shall get on! It hurts me so!â she cried, and sobbed and
                    moaned aloud.</p>
                <p>The cart stopped; there were old people in it coming from the city itself, people
                    who did not know them.</p>
                <p>âIs there anything the matter?â cried the old folks, seeing the little girl
                    crying so bitterly.</p>
                <p>âShe has hurt herself,â said Signa. âShe has twisted her <choice>
                        <sic>ancle</sic>
                        <corr>ankle</corr>
                    </choice> or something, and we go to Prato. Oh, Gemma, dear Gemma, is it so very
                    bad?â</p>
                <p>Gemma answered by her sobbing.</p>
                <p>The old man and woman chattered together a little, then seeing the children were
                    so pretty and<pb n="329" xml:id="VAB7155-330"/> seemed so sad, told them there
                    was room in the cart; they themselves were going to Pratoâthere were eight miles
                    more to do; the boy might lift the girl in if he liked.</p>
                <p>Gemma was borne up and seated between the two old people; Signa was told that he
                    might curl himself, if he would, on the rope footâplace of the baroccino, and
                    did so. The white horse rattle onward.</p>
                <p>âYou are a pretty boy, too,â said the woman to Signa. âWhy do you not talk to
                    one?â</p>
                <p>âI have nothing to say,â he murmured.</p>
                <p>He would not lie; and he could not tell the truth without exposing Gemmaâs pretty
                    fables.</p>
                <p>âYou are more sulky than your sister; one would think it was your foot that had
                    been hurt,â said the old woman.</p>
                <p>It was the third time in half an hour that, through Gemma, he had been called
                    sulky. He hung his head, and was mute, taking care that Gemmaâs ankle should not
                    be shakened as they went.</p>
                <p>The way seemed to him very long.</p>
                <p>He could see little on account of the dust,<pb n="330" xml:id="VAB7155-331"/>
                    which rose in large quantities along the road, for the weather was dry and the
                    traffic to the fair was great. Now and then he saw the purple front of Monte
                    Morello and the towers of Prato, lying underneath it to the westward, and
                    farther in the dark quarried sides of the serpentine hills, with the crimson
                    gleam of jasper in the sun; and, much father still, Pistoia; that was all.</p>
                <p>Signa took her foot between his hands, and held it tenderly, so that the jolting
                    should not jar it more than he could help.</p>
                <p>Her sobs ceased little by little, and she chattered softly with the old driver,
                    telling him that she was going to Prato to sell flowers, and her brother to make
                    a few coins by playing if he could; they had no father or mother. She cried out
                    a little now and then, when the cart went rougher than usual over a loose
                    stone.</p>
                <p>âAre you in such pain, dear? Oh, if only I could bear it for you!â said Signa;
                    and the tears came in his eyes to think that she should suffer so much.</p>
                <p>âIt is better; do not fret,â said Gemma, gravely; and the old woman in the cart
                        thought<pb n="331" xml:id="VAB7155-332"/> what a sweetâtempered child it
                    was, so anxious to be patient and not vex her brother. For Gemma had the talent
                    to get credit for all the virtues that she had notâa talent which is of much
                    more use than any real possession of the virtues ever can be.</p>
                <p>The eight miles were very tedious and mournful even to Signa; he was full of
                    sorrow for her little bruised foot, and full of care for her future and his own,
                    and full of reproach to himself for having let her come with him.</p>
                <p>âWhatever will come of itâall is my fault,â he thought, tormenting himself whilst
                    the white horse trotted wearily over the bad road, and the clouds of dust blew
                    round them and obscured the green sunny valley and the shining Bisenzio
                    river.</p>
                <p>Gemma, moaning a little now and then, leant her curly head against the old
                    womanâs knee, and before very long fell fast asleep, her long black lashes
                    sweeping her rosy cheeks.</p>
                <p>âThe innocent lamb!â said the woman, tenderly, and covered her face from the sun
                    and from the flies.</p>
                <pb n="332" xml:id="VAB7155-333"/>
                <p>When the cart stopped at the south gate of Prato, the old woman woke Gemma
                    softly:</p>
                <p>âMy pretty dear, we cannot get the things out without moving you, but if you will
                    sit a bit in the shade by the wall there, we will take you up again in a minute,
                    and put you where you like; or maybe you will stay with us and have a taste of
                    breakfast.â</p>
                <p>Her husband lifted Gemma with much care down upon the stones, and set her on a
                    bench, Signa standing still beside her.</p>
                <p>âWhat is to be done, Gemma?â he said, with a piteous sigh. âTell these good
                    people the truth, dear, and they will take care of you, and drive you back again
                    to Giovoli, I am sure. As for me, it does not matter.â</p>
                <p>âYou are a <foreign xml:lang="ita">grullo</foreign>!â said Gemma, with calm
                    contempt, which meant in her tongue that he was as foolish a thing as lived.
                    âWait till they are not looking, then do what I do.â</p>
                <p>Soon the man and the woman had their backs turned, and were intent on their
                    cackling poultry and strings of sausages.</p>
                <p>âNow!â said Gemma, and she darted round a<pb n="333" xml:id="VAB7155-334"/>
                    corner of the gate, and ran swiftly as a young hare down the narrow street,
                    clasping her flowerâbasket close to her all the while.</p>
                <p>âBut you are not lame at all!â cried Signa, stupefied, when at length, panting
                    and laughing, she paused in her flight.</p>
                <p>Her azure eyes glanced over him with a smile of intense amusement.</p>
                <p>âLame! of course not! But we wanted a lift. I got it. That was all.â</p>
                <p>âOh, Gemma!â</p>
                <p>He felt stunned and sick. He could only look at her. He could not speak. He
                    thought the very stones of the street would open and swallow her for such
                    wickedness as this.</p>
                <p>Gemma laughed the more to see his face. She could not perceive anything amiss in
                    what she had done. It had been fun to see the peopleâs anxiety for her; and then
                    they had been carried the eight miles they wanted:âhow could anything be wrong
                    that had so well succeeded?</p>
                <p>Gemma, with her little plump bare shoulders and her ragged petticoat, reasoned as
                    the big world does:âSuccess never sins.</p>
                <pb n="334" xml:id="VAB7155-335"/>
                <p>Signa could not laugh. He would not answer her. He felt wretched.</p>
                <p>âYou are a killâjoy!â said Gemma, pettishly, and sat down on a doorâstep to tie
                    up her flowers and consider what it would be best worth her while to do.</p>
                <p>She decided that it was of no use at all to consult him. He was full of silly
                    scruples that grew naturally in him, as chokeâgrass in the earth.</p>
                <p>âIt is very nice to be away from everybody,â said Gemma, sorting her flowers, and
                    looking about her with keen pleasure in the sense of liberty and
                    strangeness.</p>
                <p>âOh, Gemma! It breaks oneâs heart,â murmured Signa, while the water swam in his
                    eyes. He thought his heart was broken. He felt powerless and utterly wretched. A
                    companion who would have clung to him and needed his protection and his aid
                    would have aroused his courage; but Gemmaâs hardihood and dauntlessness and
                    reckless wrongâdoing only seemed to crush him and bewilder him till he felt like
                    any frightened kid lost upon the mountains.</p>
                <pb n="335" xml:id="VAB7155-336"/>
                <p>When she rose, he rose also, and crept after her spiritless and weary.</p>
                <p>The bold craft of her practical mind and her little merciless words of worldly
                    wisdom beat into impotency all the finer impulses and higher intelligence of his
                    own. Moral impudence scourges spiritual beauty till it is cowed like a whipt
                    dog.</p>
                <p>Gemma, for her part, was indifferent; she felt herself the masterâmind of the
                    two; she was perfectly happy seeing strange things, and not knowing what new
                    turn fortune might not take any minute; she thought of Palma hoeing and toiling
                    amongst the cabbages at home with scornful pity, and said to herself, âhow nice
                    it is to be away and not have a soul to scold one!â When they came in sight of
                    the cathedral and the belfry, Signa, moved to sudden interest, pulled her
                    skirt.</p>
                <p>âLet us go and see the <foreign xml:lang="ita">sacra cintola</foreign>,â
                    whispered the boy, for he was a devout little fellow, and had heard all his days
                    from all the countryâside of the wonders of the holy girdle that Prato
                    enshrines.</p>
                <pb n="336" xml:id="VAB7155-337"/>
                <p>âWhat will the <foreign xml:lang="ita">sacra cintola</foreign> do for us?â said
                    Gemma.</p>
                <p>âNothing,â said Signa, sadly, ânothingânow we have told so many lies.â</p>
                <p>âThe girdle would not have had that cart,â said Gemma, with a smile that would
                    have been a grin only she was so pretty; and she let Signa draw her onward to
                    the square where the Duomo stands, because, as she thought to herself, there
                    would surely be the most people there, it being the hour of high massâpeople
                    always made themselves safe with heaven before they began to jump about and eat
                    and drink.</p>
                <p>âLook!â said Signa, forgetful one moment of his woes in his delight at looking up
                    at the great duomo of which so many legends were rife in the countryâside.
                    âLook! Gemma, look! There is Donatelloâs pulpit, where they used to show the
                    girdle to the people on the feast days; Donatello you know, who once was only
                    just a poor boy like me, and lived to make the marble speak; the signore at the
                    Certosa told me so; do you think they ever will talk of me hundreds of years
                    after I am dead and gone, as they do about<pb n="337" xml:id="VAB7155-338"/>
                    him? Oh, I think they will, because the music does last like the stone, though
                    no one can touch it and feel it like the stoneâand I am sure one day I will make
                    some music that they will care about. Oh, Gemma, you are not lookingâjust see
                    those beautiful children up there, all in the marble, with the white flowers!
                    And where is the mark of the manâs hand that was cut off for sacrilege, you
                    remember? Teresina has told us about it so often!âit was thrown up in the air,
                    you know, and the blood of it made a spot like an open palm on the grey wall up
                    above, that is always, always there; only surely the angles might wash it out
                        <emph>now</emph>; he must have suffered so much, and been so sorry by
                    this!â</p>
                <p>And Signa, trembling at his own vivid imaginations, stood still, gazing up and
                    trying to see the bloodâstain amongst the black and green serpentine of the
                    inlaying above Lucca della Robbiaâs Virgin, with her S. Stephen and S. Lawrence.
                    The story was so real to him, he could see the wicked monk going round and round
                    in the aisles, in the dark, with his stolen treasure, unable to find his way
                    out, and believing himself on<pb n="338" xml:id="VAB7155-339"/> the road to his
                    own monastery, and so striking the panels of the great door, and crying, âOpen,
                    open!â and thus calling down detection and chastisement with his own voice. He
                    could see it all, and he stood gazing up and looking for the bloodâstain above
                    Donatelloâs happy snow white children, till he trembled all over with the awe
                    and fever of his own visions. Gemma, not heeding at all and quite indifferent to
                    the sacred girdle, since it was nothing pretty to put on herself, sniffed with
                    her dainty little nose the various fumes of frying and stewing that came from
                    the open doors and windows of the houses in the square, and decided with herself
                    that it was high time to get something more to eat.</p>
                <p>It was noon, and breakfast was being prepared everywhere, and a slice of smoking
                    kid or a taste of boar stuffed with prunes were more to her taste than all the
                    stone children of Donatello. She had known what such dainties meant at fairs at
                    Signa and Impruneta, whither she had occasionally been taken by kindly
                    babyâloving women who pitied her because she had no mother.</p>
                <pb n="339" xml:id="VAB7155-340"/>
                <p>She pondered a little; smelling the fragrance of the soup pots, whilst the crowds
                    of people let loose from high mass, like boys from school, filled the piazza,
                    laughing, buzzing, chattering, pushing, loitering, with the broad bright sky
                    cloudless above their heads.</p>
                <p>Gemma went and looked wistfully in at an open arched entrance of a fruit shop;
                    beyond, she saw a kitchen with a plump motherly woman in an orange kerchief, who
                    was just taking off the fire a fryingâpan full of bacon and lard, browned and
                    ready for eating.</p>
                <p>âMight I just lay my flowers here in the shade one moment or two?â said little
                    Gemma, timidly slipping her basket on to the stone slab under the cool wet
                    leaves that kept the strawberries fresh. âMight I just leave them here one
                    moment with you, they will all fade away in the sun?â</p>
                <p>âCertainly, my pretty one,â said the woman. âBut where do you want to go?â</p>
                <p>Gemma looked very shy and sad.</p>
                <p>âOnlyâto seeâto buyâa little bit of bread. I have a centime, and I am so hungry
                    ââ</p>
                <pb n="340" xml:id="VAB7155-341"/>
                <p>âWhen did you eat last?â</p>
                <p>âYesterday at noon. Mother is just dead, and there was no more bread in the
                    house, and no money.â</p>
                <p>âPoor little soul!â cried the good woman, with her charity alive in a second;
                    human charity is a match that will strike light very quickly, only it will go
                    out again very nearly as rapidly. âPoor little sweet soul!â</p>
                <p>âIt shall never be said that I turned a hungry child empty away. Come in and eat
                    your fill. There is only my husband; and we are half famished too, for there has
                    been no getting a mouthful were it ever so, so busy as this morning has been;
                    there is scarce a stalk of fruit left, as you see, already. Come in, you pretty
                    morsel, and eat for two.â</p>
                <p>Gemma did eat for two, taking no remembrance of Signa outside by the cathedral in
                    the sun. He was well enough with his Donatello and his nonsense. Meanwhile she
                    stuffed her little round mouth full of crisp, brown, savoury bacon, and
                    swallowed her little glass of blue wine, and picked as many bigarreau cherries
                    as she chose, and<pb n="341" xml:id="VAB7155-342"/> touched to the quick the
                    hearts of her host and hostess, who were childless.</p>
                <p>They only let her go again with many promises that she would return, which indeed
                    she gave willingly, with every intention of keeping them if she found nothing
                    better to do. When she had got her flowers and ran out again to look for Signa,
                    she could not find him. That dismayed her, because he was her mine of money. She
                    pondered a little, selling some flowers in the square meanwhile, because, as she
                    reflected, however sorry one may be, pence are not the less sweetâsmelling for
                    that; then reasoned with herself that such a silly as he would be sure to be
                    inside the cathedral dreaming about the sacrilegious monk; and there, in truth,
                    did she find him, sitting on the lower step of the high altar, with the bronze
                    crucifix above him.</p>
                <p>Signa was very pale from weariness and long fasting; but his eyes were full of
                    brightness, and he was almost happy; someone had been playing on the organ
                    somewhere unseen, the church being empty and the custodians dozing in noonâtide
                    rest, and the noble silence around him and<pb n="342" xml:id="VAB7155-343"/> the
                    deep coolness and the beautiful colours and fuzes so lulled him, and yet excited
                    him, that he knew nothing of the flight of time.</p>
                <p>âAre you not hungry?â said Gemma, pattering up and dipping her golden head in
                    half impudent obeisance before the altar.</p>
                <p>âHungry? Oh, no!â</p>
                <p>The word seemed to him almost like a sacrilege; yet he was hungry, only he had no
                    leisure or sense for it.</p>
                <p>âI am,â said Gemma, knowing that her wants were the strongest levers to stir him
                    into movement.</p>
                <p>âAre you? I am sorry,â said Signa vaguely, half remorsefully, yet almost
                    incapable, in that beauty and holiness which were around him, of bringing his
                    mind wholly to any ordinary daily thing. âAre you, dear? I am sorry. What can we
                    do? But, oh, Gemma dear, can you feel <emph>very</emph> hungry in this place? Do
                    look at the paintings. Fra Lippi did them, someone said. He was a monk, I think.
                    And then look at those terrible grey faces and the tails like snakesâthey are
                    meant for Sins, are they not? It frightens one, and yet it is so beautiful, all
                    of it.â</p>
                <pb n="343" xml:id="VAB7155-344"/>
                <p>Gemma looked with a sort of scorn at the marble sphinxes with their serpent
                    bodies on Mino da Fiesoleâs pulpit. They did not move her.</p>
                <p>âSins are pleasant. Those are ugly things,â she said with a premature wisdom.
                    âAnd I am hungry. Come out.â</p>
                <p>Signa went lingeringly, reluctantly looking back into the calm eyes of the
                    sphinxes, and sorrowful to be forced out of that solemnity and stillness into
                    the noise and the confusion of the fair.</p>
                <p>âHow happy the man must have been who made all those things,â he said to himself,
                    with a dim perception of the beauty of ages in which labour was done for sake of
                    faith and country and Godâs will, and not for sake of gold alone.</p>
                <p>Gemma jogged his shoulder.</p>
                <p>âDo not go to sleep! Come close to me, and do what I ask youâthat is all.â</p>
                <p>Keeping tight hold of his violin and its bow, Signa obeyed her; the bright,
                    prompt, unswerving will of Gemma always bore him away with it, without any
                    volition of his own. The ascendancy<pb n="344" xml:id="VAB7155-345"/> of the
                    unscrupulous will tells, in small lives as in great.</p>
                <p>She led him through the flocking people, with the loud clanging bells and the hot
                    sunshine above them.</p>
                <p>The noble brown walls of Prato shut in that day a gay and noisy multitude. There
                    were unusual attractions in the way of shows and travelling actors. The country
                    folk had come in from the plain and from both sides of the mountains. The
                    copperâsmelters from the valley of the Bisenzio, the quarryâworkers from
                    Figlone, the potteryâpainters from Doccia, the strawâplaiters and redâcap makers
                    of the town itself, the villagers from all the little places round about for
                    twenty miles and more, all had contributed to swell the sum of the merrymaking
                    throngs that put on their best, and ate and drank, made love and bought trinkets
                    and shouted and sang under the frown of the old Ghibelline Castello and the
                    prison that was once a Guelph Palace. There were booths in the streets, flags on
                    the roofs, merry faces at the old grated casements; there was all the uproar of
                        lotteries,<pb n="345" xml:id="VAB7155-346"/> charlatans, cheapjohns, and the
                    players of puppets; asses brayed, children screamed, maidens laughed, mandolines
                    twanged, kids and pigs were roasting whole in the streets, mounds of plums and
                    cherries reddened the stones with their juice, barrels of wine ran in a hundred
                    dark old kitchens and at many a quaint corner under a terraâcotta shrine in the
                    wall; and above all the happy breathless turmoil rose bellâtower and cupola and
                    fortress and monastery, and above them again the fair blue sky.</p>
                <p>Gemma slipped in amongst the multitude, keeping one of Signaâs hands in hers.</p>
                <p>She watched her opportunity. There was a pause. One puppetâshow had just ended;
                    the tombola had not begun. She let go his hand.</p>
                <p>âPlay,â she said, simply.</p>
                <p>âPlay!â echoed Signa, with his beaming eyes full of pain. âOh, Gemma! how can I
                    play! so wretched as I am, and away from the Lastra; and Bruno hating me,
                    perhaps; and Nita blind; and all through my own wickedness!â</p>
                <p>âChÃ¨!â said Gemma, with serene contempt; âstanding crying never mended a broken
                        pot<pb n="346" xml:id="VAB7155-347"/> yet; Babbo says so a dozen times a
                    week. I want some sweet cakes, and you have got to get them. How shall we keep
                    ourselves if you do not play? It is all you are good for.â</p>
                <p>âHow cruel you are!â sobbed the boy, his heart in revolt at his little tyrant,
                    yet his courage weak against her.</p>
                <p>âOh, you silly!â laughed Gemma, and pulled his curls. âLet us dance, thenâdo as I
                    doâdance the saltarello that old Maro from the Marches taught us last yearâthat
                    will make you merrier.â</p>
                <p>And Gemma began to dance herself, in the agile lithe postures that an old
                    wandering fiddler had taught to the children of the Lastra; for Tuscany has no
                    dance of its own except the droll trescone, which resembles the hopping of
                    frogs.</p>
                <p>âDance, and play the tune!â said Gemma, imperiously, looking like a little white
                    flower blowing up and down in the wind, as her white arms went up above her
                    head, and her small naked feet twinkled on the stones.</p>
                <p>Signa, by sheer instinct, obeyed her as a<pb n="347" xml:id="VAB7155-348"/>
                    poodle would have done, making the tune come off the strings of his Rusignuolo,
                    and moving wearily to her lithesome invitation, his head hanging down, and his
                    feet feeling like lead, and the big tears coursing down his cheeks.</p>
                <p>âOh, the little love, let one look at her!â said a woman or two, and cleared a
                    space; and others gathered about, and a ring was made, and one score of people,
                    and then another, and then another, gradually grew together, and watched Gemma
                    in the saltarello, which no busked maiden from the wet green woods of the
                    Marches, and no Roman child under the vinehung loggia of a Trastevere winehouse,
                    ever danced with more spirit or more grace.</p>
                <p>Gemma was at home in the air, like a butterfly; and untiring she whirled around,
                    and spurned the pavement, as if her little dusty toes had the wings of
                    Mercury.</p>
                <p>âOh, the beautiful little angel!â cried the women, when at least she ceased, hot,
                    and breathless, and panting, with all her yellow hair blown back; and they
                    kissed her, and worshipped her,<pb n="348" xml:id="VAB7155-349"/> and loaded her
                    with sweetmeats, and cheap trinkets, and playthings.</p>
                <p>Signa stood apart, with swollen eyes and a swelling heart.</p>
                <p>âWhat fun it is!â said Gemma to him, with her little skirt full of spoils.</p>
                <p>Signa was silent.</p>
                <p>âA sulky boy,â said the women. âIs he your brother, my dear?â</p>
                <p>âYes, and he plays so beautifully,â said Gemma. âHe was too tired to dance well.
                    Play, dear, play for these good kind people, who have given us such lovely
                    things.â</p>
                <p>The words were simple, and she caressed him as she spoke, but in his ear she
                    whispered: âPlay, and get some money; or I will tell the guards, and send you
                    back to Lippo.â</p>
                <p>Signa was helpless in her hands.</p>
                <p>If he were sent back, there would be woeâand the galleys for Bruno.</p>
                <p>He obeyed her, and drew the bow across the strings, and played his old favourite
                        <bibl><title>Misero Pargoletto</title></bibl>, of Leo, which he had played so many times,
                    that it came to him by sheer instinct<pb n="349" xml:id="VAB7155-350"/> and
                    habit. He could not play amiss, even when he was not thinking what he did, his
                    hands found the true place, and struck out the true music.</p>
                <p>Insensibly, the sweet accustomed sounds soothed him, drove away his pain, and
                    calmed his sense of desolation and danger.</p>
                <p>Insensibly, he went on from one thing to another, and the melody gained on the
                    people. They are sure judges of what is pure and excellent. Their ear is
                    accurate; their feelings unerring. The little figure in their midst, with the
                    sweet and serious face, and the small brown hands, that moved so perfectly,
                    touched and won them. Muledrivers, copper miners, potteryâpainters, peasants,
                    townsfolk, merryâmakers, gathered together, and listened to the child, till
                    silence fell on the crowded square, and Gemma, seizing the moment, slipped in
                    from one to another, holding out her little empty palm, and whispering, while
                    her pockets were full of halfâpence, and her ears were full of praises: âWe are
                    so hungry, my brother and I!â</p>

                <p><hi>AS</hi> it chanced that day Bruno heard nothing. He did not leave his fields,
                    the week being the threshing time, and he having a man to help him whom he had
                    to pay, and being anxious to do all his grain and stack the straw entirely
                    before the Sunday. And down in the Lastra, Lippo, whose courage though not his
                    wrath had cooled, found excuse to go up to his sheep who were ailing, and got
                    out of reach of his wifeâs tongue, and spent the day in pondering how best he
                    could compass the getting back the money without rousing the ire of his brother
                    too hotly on his own person. He held Bruno by a chain indeed, but he had a
                    foreboding that under too severe a strain the chain would snap, and he<pb n="351" xml:id="VAB7155-352"/> repented him of the impolitic passion into
                    which his wife had hurried himânine years of prudence and hypocrisy had been
                    undone in five minutesâ rage!</p>
                <p>It was eight in the evening. There was red still in the sky, but the sun had gone
                    down. Bruno had set a torch in the ring in the wall of his stone stable, and was
                    still threshing by its light with the peasant whom he had hired to help him.
                    Unless they worked late and early there could be no chance of finishing the
                    grain by the Sunday morning; and he wanted it threshed and done with, that he
                    might have all his time for his maize and vines, and begin the ploughing
                    forthwith.</p>
                <p>The ruddy light gleamed on and off; the flails rose and fell; the floor was
                    golden; the walls were black; the air blew in, fragrant with the smell of the
                    meadowâmint in the fields and the jessamine that clung to the arched doors, and
                    the stoneâpines that dropped their cones on the grass above where the hill was
                    rock.</p>
                <p>Bruno was very tired and hot; he had worked all day on a drink of sharp wine from
                    four of the<pb n="352" xml:id="VAB7155-353"/> morning, and had only stretched
                    himself on the bench for an hourâs sleep at noon. Nevertheless he went on
                    belabouring the corn with all his will, and in the noise of the flail and the
                    buzz of the chaff about his ears, he never heard a voice calling from outside,
                    coming up the fields; and a child was standing at his side before he knew that
                    anyone was there.</p>
                <p>Then he left off, and saw Palma, Gemmaâ s sister.</p>
                <p>âDo not come lounging here. You will get a blow of the flail,â he said
                    roughly.</p>
                <p>âSigna!â panted Palma, who was crying. She had been crying all the way up the
                    hill.</p>
                <p>âIf you want the boy he is in the Lastra. Get out of the way.â</p>
                <p>âIs he not here? We were sure they were here,â said Palma, with a sob, kneeâdeep
                    in the tossing straw.</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Bruno, whirling his flail about his head. âBe off with you. I can have
                    no brats idling here.â</p>
                <p>âBut Signa is lost, and Gemma was with him!â said Palma, with wideâopen black
                    eyes of abject terror.</p>
                <pb n="353" xml:id="VAB7155-354"/>
                <p>âLost! what do you mean? The boy is somewhere in the Lastra, doing Lippoâs
                    work.â</p>
                <p>âNo,â said Palma, with a sob. âThey were in the garden at Giovoliâvery earlyâMimi
                    saw themâand they went away togetherâvery fastâover the bridge. And Babbo sent
                    me to ask youâhe was sure that they were here. But old Teresina says that Signa
                    must have run away, because Lippo and Nita beat him horriblyâabout a fiddleâI do
                    not knowâand all the town is talking because Signa hit Nita in the eyes; and I
                    know she was cruel to him always, only he never, never would tell you.â</p>
                <p>Bruno flung down his flail with an oath that made the little girl tremble where
                    she stood in the gold of the corn.</p>
                <p>âStay till I come, Neo,â he said quickly to the contadino working with him, and
                    caught his cloak from a nail, and without another word or a glance at the
                    sobbing child, strode away through his vines in the twilight.</p>
                <p>Palma ran with him on her sturdy little legs, telling him all she knew, which was
                    the same<pb n="354" xml:id="VAB7155-355"/> thing over and over again. Bruno
                    heard in unbroken silence.</p>
                <p>His long stride and the childâs rapid little trot kept them even, and took them
                    fast into the road and on to the bridge. At the entrance of this bridge Sandro
                    met them: though the children were always together, Sandro knew little of Bruno,
                    and was afraid of the little he did know. But the common bond of their trouble
                    made them friends. He seized hold of Bruno as he went to the bridge â</p>
                <p>âDo not waste time in the Lastra. He is not in the Lastra. There was some horrid
                    quarrelâso they say, Nita knocked the body downâall about that fiddle and the
                    quantity of money. The boy has run away, and my Gemma with himâmy pretty little
                    Gemma!âand a minute ago there came in Nisio with his baroccino; he has been to
                    Prato, and he says he saw them there, and thought that we had sent themâthere is
                    a fair. You can see Nisio; he is stopping at the wineshop just across. That was
                    at four in the day he saw them. The boy was playing. Will you go? I do not see
                    how I can goâthey will<pb n="355" xml:id="VAB7155-356"/> turn me away at Giovoli
                    if I goâall my carnations potting and all my roses buddingâand then the goat is
                    near her labour, and nothing but his child to see to her or to keep the boys in
                    orderâand what the lad could take Gemma for, if he would run away, though she
                    was only a trouble in the house, and a greedy poppet always, stillââ</p>
                <p>Bruno, before half his words were done, was away over the bridge, and had reached
                    the wineshop, and had confronted NisioâDionisio Riggo, a chandler and
                    cheesemonger of the Lastra, who had a little bit of land out Prato way.</p>
                <p>âYou sawâthe boyâin Prato?â</p>
                <p>Nisio grinned.</p>
                <p>âI saw Lippoâs foundling in Prato. Is that much to you? Nay, nay! I meant no
                    offence indeed. Only you are so soft upon the boyâpeople will talk! Yes, he was
                    there, playing a fiddle in a crowd. And the little girl of Sandroâsâthe pretty
                    white oneâwith him. Only a childâs freak, no doubt. I thought they were out
                    there for a holiday. Else I would have spoken, and<pb n="356" xml:id="VAB7155-357"/> have brought them home. But they can take no
                    harm.â</p>
                <p>Bruno left him also without a word, and went on his way as swiftly as the wind up
                    to the house of Lippo.</p>
                <p>Old Baldo was working at a boot at his board before his door. Lippo, who had just
                    come down from the hills, was standing idling and talking with his gossip the
                    barber. His wife was ironing linen in an attic under the roof, her eyes none the
                    worse, though she had bound one up with a red handkerchief that she might make
                    her moan with effect to the neighbours.</p>
                <p>Brunoâs hand fell like a sledgeâhammer on his brotherâs shoulder before Lippo
                    knew that he was nigh.</p>
                <p>âWhat did you do to the boy?â</p>
                <p>Lippo trembled, and his jaw fell. People came out of the other doorway. Old Baldo
                    paused with his awl uplifted. Children came running to listen. Bruno shook his
                    brother to and fro as the breeze shakes a cane by the river.</p>
                <p>âWhat did you do to the boy?â</p>
                <p>âI did nothing,â stammered Lippo. âWe<pb n="357" xml:id="VAB7155-358"/> were
                    vexedâall that moneyâand nothing but a fiddle to show. That was natural you
                    knowâonly natural was it? And then the child grew in a dreadful passion, and he
                    flew on my poor good Nita like a little wild cat, and blinded herâshe is blind
                    now. That is all the truth, and the saints are my testimony!â</p>
                <p>âThat is a lie, and the devils are your sponsors!â shouted Bruno, till the shout
                    rang from the gateway to the shrine. âIf harm have come to the child, I will
                    break every bone in your body. I go to find him firstâthen I will come back and
                    deal with you.â</p>
                <p>He shook Lippo once more to and fro, and sent him reeling against the cobblerâs
                    board, and scattered Baldoâs boots and shoes and tools and bits of leather right
                    and left; then without looking backward or heeding the clamour he had raised, he
                    dashed through the Lastra to get home, and fetch money, and find a horse.</p>
                <p>Old Baldo did not love his sonâinâlaw. His daughter had been taken by Lippoâs
                    handsome, soft, pensive face, and timid gentleness and suavity of ways, as
                    rough, strong, fierceâtempered<pb n="358" xml:id="VAB7155-359"/> women often
                    are; and Baldo had let her have her way, though Lippo had brought nothing to the
                    common purse. It was a bad marriage for Nita, the sole offspring of the old
                    cobbler, who owned the house he lived in, and let some floors of it, and was a
                    warm man all the Lastra said, with cosy little bits of money here and there, and
                    morsels of land even, bought at bargains, and a shrewd head and a still tongue,
                    so that he might be worth much more that even people fancied, where he sat
                    stitching at his door, with a red cap and a pair of horn spectacles, and a
                    wicked old tongue that could throw dirt with any manâs or womanâs either.</p>
                <p>Lippo stood quivering, and almost weeping.</p>
                <p>âSo good as we have been!â he moaned.</p>
                <p>âYou whiteâlivered cur!â swore old Baldo, who had been toppled off his stool, and
                    was wiping the dust off his grey head, and groping in the dark for his horn
                    spectacles, with many oaths. âYou whining ass! Your brother only serves you
                    right. It is not for me to say so. It is ill work washing oneâs foul linen in
                    the town fountain. But if Bruno break your neck he will<pb n="359" xml:id="VAB7155-360"/> serve you rightâtaking his money all these years, and
                    starving his brat, and beating it;âpah!â</p>
                <p>âAnd what would you have said if I had pampered it up with dainties?â said Lippo,
                    panting and shivering, and hoping to heaven Nitaâs hands were in the starch, and
                    her ears anywhere than hearkening out of the window.</p>
                <p>âThat is neither here nor there,â said old Baldo, who, like all the world,
                    detested the <foreign xml:lang="lat">tu quoque</foreign> form of argument. âThat
                    is neither here nor there. The pasticcio was none of my making. I said there
                    were brats too many in the house. But you have got good pickings out of it, that
                    is certain; and it is only a raging lion like Bruno, a frank fool, and a
                    wrathful, and for ever eating fire and being fleeced like a sheep, that would
                    not have seen through you all these years.â</p>
                <p>Lippo upset the stall again by an excess of zeal in searching for the spectacles,
                    and prayed the saints, who favoured him, to serve him so that, in the noise of
                    all the falling tools, his terrible fatherâinlawâs revelations might not reach
                    the listening barber.</p>
                <pb n="360" xml:id="VAB7155-361"/>
                <p>Rage in, wit out:âLippo sighed to think that his lot fell for ever amongst people
                    who saw not the truth and wisdom of this saying.</p>
                <p>He found the spectacles, and then gathered himself together with a sigh.</p>
                <p>âMy brother shall not go alone to seek the boy,â he said with gentle courage and
                    a sigh. âI thought the child was safe upon the hill, or elseâHarm me?âoh, no!
                    Poor Bruno is a rough man; but he owes me too muchâbesides, he is not bad at
                    heartâoh, no! Perhaps I was hasty about that money. After all, it was the
                    childâs. But when people are poor, as we all are, and never taste meat hardly
                    twice a year, and so much sickness and trouble everywhere, it overcomes one. So
                    much money for a toy!âfor, after all, an old lute does as well. Tell Nita I am
                    gone to look for Signa, and may be out all night.â</p>
                <p>âHe is a good man, and it is a shame to treat him so,â said the women at the
                    doors.</p>
                <p>Old Baldo picked up his waxed thread, and made a grimace to himself, as he went
                    to his work again, with a lanthorn hung up above him<pb n="361" xml:id="VAB7155-362"/> on a nail. But it was not for him to show his
                    daughter, or her husband, in the wrong. Besides, popular feeling, so far as it
                    was represented in the lane between the gateway and the shrine, was altogether
                    with Lippo.</p>
                <p>He had struck a chord that was sure to answer. People who lived on black bread
                    and cabbages, and had a good deal of sickness, and laboured from red dawn to
                    white moonlight to fill empty mouths, were all ready to resent with him the
                    waste of gold pieces on a child and a fiddle.</p>
                <p>He knew the right key to turn to move his little world.</p>
                <p>Good man as he was, he went down the lane with an angry heart, saying, as old
                    Vasari has it, things that are not in the mass; but he said them to himself
                    only, for he had a character to lose.</p>
                <p>Under the light of the lamp that jutted out from the east gateway, where the old
                    portcullis hangs, he saw Bruno. He was putting a little, rough, short pony into
                    a baroccino, having hired both from a vintner, whose tavern and stable were open
                    on to the street.</p>
                <pb n="362" xml:id="VAB7155-363"/>
                <p>The baroccino was the common union of rope and bars and rotten wood and huge
                    wheels, which looks as if it would be shivered at a step, but will in truth
                    whirl unbroken over mountainâheights, and fly unsinking over a morass. The pony
                    was one of those sturdy little beasts which, with a collar of bells and a
                    headâdress of foxâtails, fed on straw and on blows, and on little else besides,
                    will yet race over the country at that headlong, yet sureâfooted, speed, which
                    Tuscans teach their cattle, heaven knows how. Bruno had hired both of the
                    vintner, to save the time that his return home would have taken him.</p>
                <p>The street was quite dark. The lamp in the gateway shed a flickering gleam over
                    Brunoâs dark face and the brass of the ponyâs headstall.</p>
                <p>Lippoâs heart stood still within him with fear. Nevertheless, he went up to the
                    place. He had a thing to say, and he knew he must say it then or never.</p>
                <p>âBruno, give me one word,â he said, in a whisper, touching his brother on the
                    arm.</p>
                <p>Bruno flashed one glance at him, and went on buckling the straps of the
                    harness.</p>
                <pb n="363" xml:id="VAB7155-364"/>
                <p>âAre you going to quarrel with meâabout the boy?â</p>
                <p>âAs God lives, I will kill you if harm come to him.â</p>
                <p>Lippo shivered.</p>
                <p>âBut if you find him safe and soundâboys are always safe and soundâdo you mean to
                    quarrel with me?âdo you mean to take him away?â</p>
                <p>âIf you have dealt ill with him, it will be the worse for you.â</p>
                <p>Lippo knew the menace that was in his brotherâs voice, though Bruno did not look
                    up once, nor leave off buckling and strapping. And he knew that he had dealt
                    illâvery ill.</p>
                <p>âListen, Bruno!â he said, coaxingly. âHe will tell you things, no doubt; children
                    always whine. We have punished him sometimes;âone must punish children, or what
                    would they be? If you listen, he will tell you things, of course. Children want
                    to live on clover, and never do a stroke of work.<choice>
                        <corr>â</corr>
                        <sic>'</sic>
                    </choice></p>
                <p>Bruno freed his arm from his brotherâs hand, with a gesture that sent the strap
                    he was fastening backward up into Lippoâs face.</p>
                <pb n="364" xml:id="VAB7155-365"/>
                <p>âYou have hurt him, and you have lied, and you have betrayed me and cheated me,â
                    he said between his teeth. âI know thatâI know that! Well, your reckoning will
                    waitâtill I have found the child.â</p>
                <p>Lippoâs blood ran very cold. Concealment, he saw, was impossible any longer. If
                    the boy were found, he knew that he would have scant mercy to look for from
                    Brunoâs hands.</p>
                <p>âBut hear a word, Bruno,â he said; and his voice shook, and his fingers trembled
                    as they clutched at Brunoâs cloak, as the latter took the ropes that served for
                    reins and put his foot on the step of the baroccino. âJust a wordâjust a word
                    only. Will you take him away? Will you cease to pay? Will you break our compact?
                    Is that what you mean?â</p>
                <p>Bruno sprang on the little cart, and answered with a slash of his whip across
                    Lippoâs mouth.</p>
                <p>Lippo, stung with the pain of the blow, and goaded by a laugh that he caught from
                    the vintner, who stood watching in his tavern doorway, sprang up also on the
                    iron bar that serves as footboard to the little vehicle.</p>
                <pb n="365" xml:id="VAB7155-366"/>
                <p>âTake care what you do!â he hissed in his elderâs ear. âTake care! If you cease
                    to payâif you take the childâI will say what I said. I will make him hate you; I
                    will tell him who he is; I will tell him how you stabbed his mother at the fair;
                    I will tell him how youâyouâyou left her alone dead for the flood to take her,
                    and maybe had murdered her, for aught I know. And see how he will love you then,
                    and eat your bread. Now strike me again, if you like. That is what I shall say.
                    And what can you do? Tell me thatâtell me that! Now go and ride out all the
                    night, and think and choose. How weak you are!âah, ah! How weak you are against
                    me now!âhow weak, with all your rage!â</p>
                <p>Bruno struck him backwards off the step. The pony dashed away into the darkness.
                    Lippo fell in the dust.</p>
                <p>When the tearing noise of the wheels and the hoofs flying away into the night
                    over the stones had died away, Lippo lifted his head to the vintner, who had
                    raised him from the ground, and had poured some wine into his mouth.</p>
                <pb n="366" xml:id="VAB7155-367"/>
                <p>âGood friend,â said gentle Lippo, with faltering breath, wiping the dust and a
                    little blood from his forehead; âgood friend, say nothing of thisâit would only
                    bring trouble on Bruno. I would have gone with him to find the boy, but you saw
                    what his passion was. He thinks me to blame; perhaps I was. So much money thrown
                    away on a toy of music for a child, when a pipe cut in the fields does as well,
                    and it might have been laid aside for his manhood! And so much want as there is
                    in the world! But never mind that; say I was wrongâonly do not tell people of
                    Bruno. You know he is brawling always, and that gets him a bad name; and not for
                    paradise would I add to it. He is too quick with his hands, and will take life,
                    I always fear, one day; but this was an accidentâa pure accident only! Oh, I am
                    wellâquite well; not hurt at all. And your wine is so pure and good.â</p>
                <p>And he drank a little more of it, and then went away home; and the vintner
                    watched him, going feebly, as one bruised and shaken would do; and shook his
                    head, and said to three or four others who came in for a flask and a turn at<pb n="367" xml:id="VAB7155-368"/> dominoes, that that beast Bruno had wellânigh
                    killed his brother and driven over him; and that it would be well to give a hint
                    of the story to the Carabineers when they should next come by looking after bad
                    men and perilous tempers.</p>
