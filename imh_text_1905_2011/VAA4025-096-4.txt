            The Gas Boom in East Central Indiana
            James A. Glass∗
            
            East central Indiana is known for its mixture of agricultural production, medium-sized industrial
                    cities, and small towns with turn-of-the-century architecture. The production of corn, cereal
                    grains, and livestock in the region goes back to the beginnings of settlement before the Civil War.
                    The industrial characteristics were brought about by one of the great booms of the late nineteenth
                    century in the Midwest: the discovery of natural gas. The eruption of real estate speculation,
                    industrial development, commercial expansion and population growth transformed a 2,500-square-mile
                    portion of the state from a landscape of farms, forests, and agricultural villages into a territory
                    in which cities and boom towns dominated, each teeming with factories, neighborhoods, and commercial
                    districts. Between 1886 and 1901, an eleven-county area in the east central portion of the state
                    became one of the leading centers of heavy industrial production in the 
                        United States
                     and the principal manufacturing region of Indiana. Although gas ran out after the turn
                    of the century, thereby greatly diminishing the economic vitality and size of many boom towns, the
                    principal cities created by the boom persevered and used the industrial foundation bestowed by
                    natural gas to lure additional factories and commerce. In the smaller cities and towns of the area,
                    the gas boom left a few factories, distinctive brick commercial business districts, and attractive
                    residential neighborhoods.
            In 1886, east central Indiana contained some of the richest farmland in the state. Interspersed with
                    the fields were remnants of the hardwood forests that once covered much of the state. County seats,
                    the largest communities in each county, contained a modest number of stores, lawyers'
                    offices, grain elevators, and furniture or wagon plants. There were a few neighborhoods containing
                    Italianate-style houses erected by well-to-do farmers or merchants and a few churches representing
                    the principal Protestant denominations. The populations of the county seats rarely exceeded 2,500
                    people. There were

                     also crossroads villages of not much more than an elevator, a
                    general store, and a gridiron plat of streets lined with houses belonging to farmers in the
                    surrounding district.1
            
            In the county seats there were frequently a couple of wealthy men who had made modest fortunes after
                    the Civil War with small manufacturing operations that utilized the surrounding hardwood forests or
                    agricultural produce. Others had made money in banking, real estate, or by luring railroads to run
                    through their town. In 
                        Muncie
                     the wealthiest man in the 1870s and early 1880s was James Boyce, who gained a small
                    fortune operating a bag plant and a handle factory. In Anderson the McCullough family and Major
                    Charles T. Doxey made their money in banking and in real estate respectively.2
            
            There were four major railroad lines that crossed the region in 1886—the
                            
                  Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago
                & 
                        St. Louis
                     Railroad ("Big Four"); the 
                  Chicago, St. Louis
                & 
                        Pittsburgh
                     ("Panhandle"); the 
                  Cincinnati, Wabash
                & 
                        Michigan
                    ; and the 
                  Toledo, St. Louis
                & 
                        Kansas
                     City ("Clover Leaf"). Most of the county seats had managed to
                    persuade at least one major railroad to run through their communities by the mid-1880s. Several
                    large towns, such as 
                        Muncie
                    , Anderson, 
                        Marion
                    , and 
                        Kokomo
                    , boasted three or more railroads. Some smaller towns in each county were also located
                    on rail lines. The railroads connected the area with markets for agricultural and forest
                        products.3
            
            In 1886, the discovery of the Karg well in Findlay, 
                        Ohio
                    , signaled the end of the slow-paced agricultural life of east central Indiana. Natural
                    gas had previously been found in large quantities in western 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and had revolutionized the iron, steel, and glass industries of 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , as industrialists adapted their factories to use the natural gas in place of the more
                    expensive coal. The Karg well demonstrated that gas existed in substantial quantities in the Trenton
                    limestone beneath northwestern 
                        Ohio
                    , and a speculative frenzy ensued, as gas companies drilled and real estate speculators
                    drove up the prices of land in anticipation of factories locating in the new boom area.4

            Within a short time, hometown investors in several Indiana communities also began to drill,
                    anticipating gas in the large Trenton limestone belt that extended into the north central portion of
                    the state. Gas was first struck at 
                        Portland
                    , Indiana, in March 1886. The first well to produce enough gas to make a profit was sunk
                    at Eaton, Indiana, a small town north of 
                        Muncie
                    , in October 1886. The principals involved—George W. Carter, a businessman
                    from Eaton; William W. Worthington, superintendent of the 
                  Fort
                            Wayne, Cincinnati
               , & 
                        Louisville
                     Railroad; and State Senator Robert C. Bell of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    — hired gas driller A. H. Cranell to sink the bore. Gas was struck at 922
                    feet below grade. The flame emitted by the well when it was piped and lit rose ten feet in the air
                    and could be seen in 
                        Muncie
                    , twelve miles to the south. The sight of the flame, burning brightly and seemingly
                    inexhaustibly, drew crowds of people for many weeks.5
            
            The sensation caused by the Eaton discovery spurred the organization of drilling companies all over
                    the state. In November 1886, gas was discovered at the end of East Jackson Street in 
                        Muncie
                     and in several locations south of Wild Cat Creek in 
                        Kokomo
                    . Successful drilling took place in Anderson and 
                        Marion
                     early in the spring of 1887. Between 1886 and 1889, local businessmen and farmers in
                    much of the state sank their own wells. In 1889, S. S. Gorby, the Indiana state geologist, reported
                    that gas had been found as far north as 
                        Auburn
                     in 
                        DeKalb
                     County, as far south as 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     in 
                        Dearborn
                     County, as far east as 
                        Portland
                     in 
                        Jay County
                    , and as far west as 
                        Kokomo
                     in 
                        Howard County
                    . The initial territory in which gas was reported covered 5,000 square miles. In 1892,
                    the state supervisor of natural gas reported that the area in which profitable wells could be
                    located embraced about 2,500 square miles, the largest gas field known in the world at the time and
                    larger than the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     fields combined.6
            
            The sequence of events in the county seats assumed a familiar pattern: a group of local businessmen
                    formed a gas exploration company and proceeded to drill until a series of profitable wells were
                    located. They then built gas mains in the principal streets and piped gas to local businesses and
                    homes. Local and out-of-state investors bought land around the platted area of town as sites for
                    factories and for expansion of the town. Prices in land doubled and tripled as a

                     real estate frenzy gripped the town. The speculative craze
                    ended in most of the county seats by 1890, as investors realized that real estate prices far
                    exceeded the income potential of most of the property. Local business leaders also began campaigns
                    to attract factories to their communities. The successes in luring factories led to rapid increases
                    in population as workers moved to the county seats for employment and to substantial boosts to the
                    local economies. The four major county seats grew into the region's first cities during the
                    first five or six years of the gas boom.7

                        Kokomo
                     serve as apt illustrations of the transformations that happened to other communities
                    between 1886 and 1893. In 
                        Muncie
                    , the seat of 
                        Delaware
                     County, several local investors organized a gas exploration company and located gas in
                    November 1886. This company was soon superseded by gas-supplying firms organized by local
                    businessmen, among them Boyce. By the spring of 1887 the 
                        Muncie
                     Natural Gas Company had laid gas mains to most sections of town and was piping gas at a
                    low, flat annual rate to individual households and businesses. Within a year, the use of coal had
                    nearly vanished, and 
                        Muncie
                     enjoyed emancipation from the soot, ash, and high costs of coal.8
            
            Some of the same local investors purchased farmland all around 
                        Muncie
                     as potential sites for industry and residential additions. As real estate prices rose,
                    a syndicate of investors from 
                  Ohio, New Jersey
               , and 
                        New York
                     organized the 
                        Muncie
                     Natural Gas Land Company. Led by Leon Abbett, a former governor of 
                        New Jersey
                    , and a blue-ribbon board of directors from the East, the company purchased a large
                    tract of open land south and southeast of the city limits. The concern issued a prospectus for
                    investors in 1889 that extolled the growth potential of 
                        Muncie
                     as a Midwestern metropolis and its attraction for factory owners in coal-burning areas
                    of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and eastern 
                        Ohio
                     who could cut their operating costs and compete more successfully with gas-fueled
                    factories. The company offered free land and nearly free gas for factories and issued a plat of
                    house lots for factory workers covering several miles south of the city. A competing company of
                    investors from

                     8 Throughout the fifteen-year period of the Indiana gas boom, the gas
                            companies supplied their domestic, commercial, and industrial customers at flat annual
                            rates, rather than on a metered basis measuring the amount of gas actually used. This system
                            was possible because the gas required no processing or refining and appeared to companies
                            and customers alike to be available in inexhaustible supplies from the wells. See

                        Delaware
                     County Land Improvement Company purchased land west of 
                        Muncie
                     and platted residential lots and factory sites in anticipation of a surge of investors,
                    factory locations, and residential lot buyers.9
            
            Despite the ballyhoo of the two syndicates, most of the early industrial growth of the gas boom in 
                        Muncie
                     occurred closer to town at the behest of local business leaders. A board of trade
                    organized in 1887 solicited industrial firms from the East to locate in 
                        Muncie
                     by offering free land and gas as inducements. Boyce, a leader in the board of trade,
                    was probably the most active figure. He was instrumental in persuading Frank C. Ball, president of
                    the Ball Brothers Company, to relocate his fruit jar factory from Buffalo, 
                        New York
                    , to a site southeast of the city. Boyce and the board of trade offered Ball eight acres
                    of land, a gas well, and five thousand dollars as inducements. A natural promoter, Boyce also
                    negotiated the location of the Over window glass plant and the Hemingray bottle plant in the new
                    "Industry" suburb just east of Ball Brothers and the relocation of the Maring,
                    Hart and Company window glass plant from Bellaire, 
                        Ohio
                    , to a new suburb that Boyce platted east of 
                        Muncie
                     called Boyce-ton. Other plants that manufactured bridges, nails, rubber, paper,
                    straw-board, and bricks moved to 
                        Muncie
                     in the midst of the real estate speculations of the late 1880s. By 1890, 
                        Muncie
                     had grown from a population of about 5,500 in 1886 to 11,345 and was becoming the
                    largest city in the Indiana gas belt.10
            
            In Anderson, the seat of 
                        Madison
                     County, the discovery of gas in March 1887 sparked a "frenzy" of real
                    estate speculation. Two gas supply companies competed for Anderson's domestic and
                    commercial customers, one of which was led by Doxey and Neal C. McCullough. Shortly after the
                    discovery of gas in March, McCullough found more gas on the east bank of White River in Anderson.
                    The resulting well, dubbed "Vesuvius," was one of the largest of the Indiana gas
                    belt. McCullough arranged for excursion trains of curiosity-seekers to see Vesuvius, and, in the
                    years that followed, groups of investors regularly traveled to see the big well gushing lighted gas,
                    a testament to the abundance of gas for industry.11

            In May of 1887, leading local businessmen formed a board of trade. This board offered the inducements
                    of free land and gas to outside industrial concerns and "landed their first factory, the
                    Fowler Nuts and Bolts Company from Buffalo, 
                        New York
                    , in late 1887. In rapid succession throughout 1888 and into 1889 came the J. W. Shefton
                    Butter Dish Company; American Wire and Nails Company from 
                  Covington, Kentucky
               ;
                    Anderson Flint Bottle Company from 
                  Butler, Pennsylvania; Pennsylvania
                Glass Company from Meadville, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    ; Union (later American) Strawboard Company from 
                        Ohio
                    ; and the Knife and Bar Company works from 
                  Dayton, Ohio
               . All were
                    attracted by cheap or free natural gas, donated land, and the position of Anderson at the juncture
                    of four railroads. The firms located their plants on undeveloped sites along the northern edge of
                    the business district, the southern edge of the city limits, or along the west bank of White River
                    southeast of the courthouse square.12
            
            After the initial flush of speculation had passed, local investors in Anderson platted factory
                    suburbs and nearby residential additions. Charles Henry, a local businessman, and Philip Matter, an
                    investor from 
                        Marion
                    , platted the suburb of North Anderson in 1890, about a mile north of White River and
                    the town limits, and by the early 1890s had attracted four factories: Anderson Glass Company, Wright
                    (later Ames) Shovel Works, North Anderson Pressed Brick Works, and the Anderson Window Glass
                    Company. Former Indiana Lieutenant Governor Will Cumback laid out the Shadeland Addition southwest
                    of the city in the early 1890s as a high-grade residential section, while other investors platted
                    the Hazelwood Addition and Park Place to the south as neighborhoods for both working-class and
                    middle-class houses.13 With the operation of the new factories, the population
                    in Anderson grew rapidly. The 1890 census reported 10,741 people in the city, an increase of some
                    6,000 since 1887.14
            
            During the late 1880s and early 1890s some of the most extravagant real estate speculations and
                    promotions of the gas belt occurred in 
                        Marion
                    . Soon after gas was discovered in February 1887, two experienced
                    "boomers" from Findlay, 
                        Ohio
                    , named Gray and Dodds purchased land north of the Mississenewa
                    River, which was then the northern border of the town. Gray and Dodds called their suburb
                    North 
                        Marion
                     and within two years had attracted the North

                     Paper Company to sites located on rail spurs running to the three major railroads that
                    intersected in 
                        Marion
                    . In 1889 a separate real estate syndicate, the 
                        Marion
                     Real Estate Company, purchased a tract of land about one and a half miles northwest of
                    the 
                        Grant County
                     courthouse, west of the Mississenewa. In the next three years, eleven factories were
                    attracted to sites in the 
                        Marion
                     Real Estate tract, including the Canton Glass Works from Canton, 
                        Ohio
                    , makers of bar and prescription glassware, pressed glass, and skylight windows.15
            
            Approximately three miles south of the center of town, real estate investors Winchel and Webster laid
                    out a third factory suburb, South 
                        Marion
                    , in 1888. This separate town, connected to 
                        Marion
                     by a streetcar line, contained its own business district, residential plat for
                    workers' cottages, and factory sites. The promoters were particularly successful in
                    attracting glass factories such as the 
                        Marion
                     Fruit Jar Company of J. L. McCullough and J. Wood Wilson; the Stewart-Estep Company;
                    and the Estep Window Glass Company.16
            
            The grandest of all of the promoters in 
                        Marion
                     and in the gas belt as a whole was George L. Mason. Mason arrived in 
                        Marion
                     within two years of the discovery of gas and billed himself as the guiding force behind
                    the booming of Birmingham, 
                        Alabama
                    , a major iron city of the 1880s. He and his partners, William H. Wiley and Thaddeus 
                        Butler
                    , bought 500 acres west of the city limits, which they laid out in several real estate
                    additions. The gridiron plats featured street names from cities in Mason's home state of 
                        New York
                     and a long diagonal Mason Avenue. The senior partner showed his genius for booming in
                    1890 and 1891 when he advertised in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper,
                    a national weekly with wide circulation in the East, and announced in big, multiple-page articles
                    the wonders of both the additions and his adopted city, which he called "Marvelous 
                        Marion
                    ." The advertisements served primarily as a means for reaching industrial plant
                    owners in eastern states that were running out of natural gas. They also served to announce regular
                    excursion trains, which Mason ran monthly from Buffalo, 
                        New York
                    , to 
                        Marion
                    . He would transport visiting capitalists to his additions on the 
                        Queen City
                     streetcar line that he had built, lavishly entertain them at the York Inn, a showplace
                    hostelry built especially for that purpose, and give them tours of the new factories that were being
                    steadily erected between 1889 and 1892 near the hotel.17

                        "discovering" Mason and providing an informative account of the
                        promoter's 
                            Marion
                         period. Richard S. Simons, "Boom Days
            
            
            Among the major heavy industries that Mason and his partners attracted were the Westerman Rolling
                    Mill, Sweet and Clark Malleable Iron Company, 
                        Marion
                     Rolling Mill, and 
                        Marion
                     Cornice and Sheet Metal Works. His biggest promotional stunt, fully advertised in Leslie's Weekly, came in 1891 when Mason erected a pavilion near the York
                    Inn to house the "Gas Belt Exposition," which was to showcase the varied marvels
                    of natural gas and industrial products produced in 
                        Marion
                     and east central Indiana. At the height of the Mason promotions, lots in the
                    partnership's additions were selling for $225 to $1000.18
            
            A final boon to 
                        Marion
                     of the gas boom was the establishment by the federal government of a National Soldiers
                    Home southeast of the city limits. The home was obtained for the city in 1889 through the influence
                    of George W. Steele, an Indiana congressman, on the ground that the cheap natural gas available
                    there would make operating costs much lower than elsewhere in the nation. By 1900, the home had
                    grown to include some two thousand veterans, who resided in substantial brick buildings standing in
                    a carefully landscaped setting.19 As a result of all these developments, 
                        Marion
                    's population rose from approximately 3,500 people in 1887 to 8,769 in 1890.20
            
            In 
                        Kokomo
                    , the seat of 
                        Howard County
                    , two young businessmen, A. Y. Comstock and D. C. Spraker, organized a subscription
                    drive in the spring of 1886 among local citizens to raise capital to drill for gas. On October 6,
                    they struck gas in a cornfield just south of Wild Cat Creek. When a second well near the first
                    confirmed an abundant supply, boom times took over in 
                        Kokomo
                    . In the spring of 1887, real estate syndicates made up of outside investors bought most
                    of the property in and around the town. Local businessmen joined the competition for real estate in
                    anticipation of a demand for factory sites and residential additions. Other investors leased large
                    tracts of farmland to drill for gas. The 
                        Kokomo
                     Natural Gas and Oil Company was organized soon after the initial discoveries to supply
                    the city of 
                        Kokomo
                    . Other companies provided fuel to communities outside

                    .21
            
            As in other county seats, attention soon turned to attracting factories. Local businessmen formed the 
                        Kokomo
                     Improvement Company in 1887 to offer incentives for industrialists to locate plants in

                    cash subsidies and assistance in acquiring sites. 
                        Kokomo
                    , like other county seats, could also offer access to three major regional railroads.
                    The first factory to be attracted was the 
                        Kokomo
                     Window Glass Company, which received a free site at the intersection of North Street
                    and the Lake Erie and Western Railroad and a cash bonus raised by subscriptions. Later in 1887, two
                    businessmen, Seiberling and Williams, organized the 
                        Kokomo
                     Strawboard Company and constructed a plant southeast of the city. The 
                        Kokomo
                     Improvement Company provided the investors with $2,000, which they used to
                    purchase ten acres of land for the site. Within the next two years, two other mills manufacturing
                    paper products, the G. P. Wood woodpulp mill and the 
                        Kokomo
                     Paper Company, located near the strawboard factory. In 1888 the owner of a bit factory
                    in Rock-ford, 
                        Illinois
                    , William C. Smith, solicited a site for relocating his plant. A local speculator
                    donated six acres south of the city limits.22
            
            The Diamond Plate Glass Company of 
                        Pittsburgh
                     constructed the largest factory in 
                        Kokomo
                     during the late 1880s. Led by its president, Akron industrialist Colonel Arthur L.
                    Conger, the company sent the Seiberling brothers, 
                        Monroe
                     and James H., to build and manage one of the most substantial factories in the gas
                    belt. The brick plant the Seiberlings erected at the intersection of Vaile Avenue and the
                            
                  Pittsburgh, Chicago
               , and 
                        St. Louis
                     Railroad, southeast of the center of town, covered approximately thirteen acres and
                    employed 750 men by 1893. It helped establish 
                        Kokomo
                     as a major industrial city of the belt.23
            
            As the industrial plants began operation, the holders of adjacent real estate divided it into
                    gridiron additions with lots for workers' cottages. Situated between the plate glass
                    factory southeast of town and a strawboard plant to the southwest, the farmland south of Wild Cat
                    Creek filled with residential neighborhoods. West of the downtown, fine residences rose for the
                    managers of plants, real estate and gas investors, and retailers. As these transformations occurred, 
                        Kokomo
                     increased in population from some 4,000 people in 1886 to 8,261 in 1890.24

            The smaller villages and country towns of the gas belt were overshadowed by the county seats during
                    the first three to four years of the gas boom. But by the early 1890s, both gas belt businessmen and
                    outside investors began to shift attention to developing the many small communities in east central
                    Indiana. Often the impetus for promotion and speculation came from the same investors who had
                    previously participated in the development of the county seats.
            In 1891 four Anderson businessmen together with five outside investors organized the 
                        Alexandria
                     Land Company in the small 
                        Madison
                     County town of 
                        Alexandria
                    .25 They purchased large tracts of farmland on the west, south, and
                    east sides of 
                        Alexandria
                     and filed plats for the land, dividing it into residential lots with several
                    reservations for factory sites. After aggressive promotion, the 
                        Alexandria
                     Land Company attracted some of the largest businesses in the gas belt: the DePauw Plate
                    Glass Company and DePauw Window Glass Company from New 
                        Albany
                    , Indiana, the 
                        Alexandria
                     Window Glass Company, the Kelly Axe Company, the Lippincott Lamp Chimney works, the
                    Union Steel Company works, and the Indiana Brick Works. 
                        Alexandria
                     mushroomed in size from a population in 1891 of 500 people to 5,000 by the late
                        1890s.26
            
            In 
                        Elwood
                    , just west of 
                        Alexandria
                    , at the western edge of 
                        Madison
                     County, two prominent local families, the Callaways and the DeHoritys, led the way in
                    setting up land companies to promote the town for industrial plants. In 1889 A. L. Conger, who had
                    already constructed a large plant in 
                        Kokomo
                    , decided to build a factory of similar size in 
                        Elwood
                    . The fourteen-acre plant was to be one of the largest plate glass factories in the
                    country. Another impressive industrial arrival was the plant of the American Tin Plate Company,
                    which was organized in 1891-1892 by two 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, capitalists, Daniel G. Reid and William B. Leeds. The 
                        Elwood
                     plant of American Tin Plate soon became the largest tin plate factory in the 
                        United States
                    , employing two thousand workers. In 1890 a third major plant was attracted to the
                    northwest part of the town: the George A. Macbeth Lamp Chimney Works, one of the principal American
                    firms manufacturing glass chimneys for kerosene lamps. As a result of these industrial arrivals, 
                        Elwood
                     by the mid-1890s became the fifth largest city in the Indiana gas belt.27
            
            
               
                  25 The businessmen were Doxey, Lovett, Kilgore, and Nichol.

            In southeastern 
                        Grant County
                    , outside investors turned the tiny hamlet of 
                        Harrisburg
                    , located on the east bank of the Mis-sissinewa River, into a boom
                    town with a new name. Gas City was the brainchild of the Seiberlings, managers of the Diamond Plate
                    Glass plant of 
                        Kokomo
                    , and John E. Miller of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Railroad, which had a rail line through the town. In 1890-1891, the Seiberlings
                    transferred the natural gas leases that they held on a large tract east of the river to the new Gas
                    City Land Company. The land company, which had been organized by Miller on behalf of the railroad,
                    platted the tract in the familiar gridiron pattern, gave 
                        Harrisburg
                     its new name, and began distributing promotional circulars to industrial prospects.
                    Within two years, Gas City boasted five glass plants, a tin plate factory, an iron and steel works,
                    and a strawboard manufacturing plant. Employment of workers, many of whom were skilled laborers
                    imported from the East, rose to over four thousand.28
            
            As every small town learned promotional techniques and began to outbid each other in the inducements
                    they offered outside industrialists, the established gas boom cities of 
                        Muncie
                    , Anderson, 
                        Marion
                    , and 
                        Kokomo
                     found themselves pressed to maintain their rates of growth. In addition, the economic
                    panic of 1893, although cushioned somewhat by the low cost of fuel in Indiana, caused several banks
                    and factories to close or suffer losses. Each of the four cities responded forcefully to these
                    challenges to its economic dominance. In 
                        Muncie
                    , Boyce and George F. McCulloch led other local businessmen in forming the 
                        Muncie
                     Citizens Enterprise Company in 1891 as a fund-raising organization for promoting the
                    city. By 1893 local businesses had subscribed $211,000, a huge sum for a city of
                    approximately 15,000 people, as a fund from which bonuses could be paid to the owners of new
                        plants.29
            
            The Enterprise Company secured four large iron and steel and machinery factories for the city in 1892
                    and 1893: the Whiteley Reaper Works, the Midland Steel Company, the Common Sense Engine Company, and
                    the Indiana Iron Works. In the next few years, the company also attracted the Whiteley Malleable
                    Iron Works, the 
                        Muncie
                     Wheel Company, and the

            In Anderson, the local leadership continued to advertise the attractiveness of the city for new
                    industrial development during the 1890s and managed to lure the Anderson Malleable Iron
                    Manufacturing Company, the Gould Steel Company, the Haugh-Kurtz Steel Company, and the Cathedral
                    Glass Company to sites along the west, southwest, and south sides of Anderson. The plants in North
                    Anderson thrived throughout the decade, and in 1894, the American Tin Plate Company, already in
                    operation in 
                        Elwood
                    , opened another plant in the northern suburb.33

                        Marion
                    , Mason's economic fortunes declined with the panic of 1893. The extravagantly
                    priced residential lots in the west side additions went begging, the York Inn closed, and, by 1901,
                    much of the platted area was used for farming. The factories in Mason's additions and those
                    in both North and South 
                        Marion
                     continued to operate, fueled by cheap gas and ready labor supply. The chastened
                    business leadership, which included Mason's former partner Wiley, sought to attract more
                    industries. In the late 1890s the Thomas Evans Company, a manufacturer of kerosene lamp chimneys,
                    and the Indiana Brewing Association moved onto sites southeast of the city center near the

                        Kokomo
                     Enterprise Company promoted the availability of a free natural gas line for new
                    manufacturers, who would be supplied by a gas trust elected by businessmen of the city. During the
                    middle and late 1890s, the enterprise company stimulated the establishment of the Great Western
                    Pottery Works northwest of the central business district, the 
                        Kokomo
                     Rubber Works on the south side of the city, and the Globe Stove and Range Works on the
                    near north side.35
            
            In each of the four leading gas belt cities, the business leadership also sought to reinforce their
                    community's position as an attractive place for industrial investment by building belt
                    railways connecting 
                  
                     31 Conger was also persuaded by the Enterprise Company to build the
                            Indiana Iron Works, which became the source of employment for many of the workers in
                            Congerville, Indiana. See Kemper, History of

                     all the major railroad lines and providing convenient access
                    for plants located on the belt or adjacent rail spurs. In 
                        Muncie
                    , two railroad companies constructed a belt line railroad in 1889 along the east and
                    south edges of the city. The belt ran between the east-west Big Four Railroad and north-south Lake
                    Erie and Western Railroad. In 
                        Marion
                    , by 1890 three railroad firms had built a belt railway through the city that extended
                    twelve miles from the 
                        Marion
                     Real Estate Addition northwest of the city south to Mason's additions and then
                    east. The belt railroad constructed in Anderson during the 1890s ran west three miles along the
                    south edge of the city, from the intersection of the Big Four and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Railroads to the Cathedral Glass Works. Finally, in 
                        Kokomo
                     the railroads constructed a belt railway around the south side of the city providing
                    access for the Diamond Plate Glass Works southeast of Wild Cat Creek and several other major
                        factories.36
            
            The gas boom continued to sustain existing industrial plants and to stimulate construction of
                    additional plants in nearly every town and city of the gas belt until 1900. That year Indiana was
                    producing the most natural gas in the 
                        United States
                    , with $7,254,539 worth of gas produced and $5,412,307 consumed in
                        Indiana.37
            
            The boom also was responsible for stimulating industrial and community growth in cities outside the
                    gas belt. As early as 1887, several 
                        Indianapolis
                     gas companies and the Standard Oil Company had sunk gas wells in northeastern 
                        Marion
                     County and in 
                        Hamilton
                     County, with the intention of supplying 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Although in the early years of the boom 
                        Hamilton
                     County proved to be a heavy producer of gas, its towns experienced relatively modest
                    growth during the 1890s. Most of the gas from 
                        Hamilton
                     County was piped south to serve the industrial and domestic customers of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     gas companies. Much of 
                        Indianapolis
                    's impressive industrial growth from 1889 to 1900 and its status as the largest
                    city in the state at the end of that decade can be attributed to the availability of cheap gas and
                    free land along the city's belt railroad. Techniques similar to those in the gas belt were
                    employed in the capital city, as exemplified in an 1889 article in Leslie's
                        Illustrated Newspaper extolling the potential of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and an 1893 advertisement by the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Improvement Company in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     city directory, offering free land and gas at special flat rates to firms that located
                    along the belt railroad.38

            Another early beneficiary of gas outside the belt was the city of 
                        Richmond
                     located about fifteen miles southeast of the eastern limits of gas-yielding Trenton
                    limestone. C. T. Doxey, one of the pioneering gas entrepreneurs in Anderson, sank a successful well
                    at Chesterfield, a little village east of Anderson, and organized the 
                        Richmond
                     Pipeline Company to supply the eastern city.39
                    
                        Richmond
                    's industries benefited from cheap gas throughout the boom.40 Likewise, investors in 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , Bluffton, 
                  Huntington, Wabash

                        Crawfordsville
                     all leased or purchased gas-producing farmland in the portions of the gas belt nearest
                    to their customers by the early 1890s and piped gas to the homes, businesses, and factories in their
                        cities.41
            
            Establishing hundreds of factories in some fifty Indiana cities and towns supplied by natural gas
                    produced a startling economic impact on the state by 1900. The 
                        United States
                     Census Manufactures report for that year noted that Indiana ranked
                    second among all the states in the production of glass, third in wagons and carriages, fourth in
                    iron and steel products, fifth in agricultural implements, ninth in paper and wood pulp, and tenth
                    in foundry and machine shop products.42 Especially with respect to glass and
                    iron and steel products, the state had gone from a minor role in those industries in 1886 to a
                    prominent position in 1900. For example, in 1890, three years after the discovery of gas, Indiana
                    produced $2,995,409 worth of glass, about 7.3 percent of the total value in the 
                        United States
                    . Ten years later, the state's glass factories produced $14,757,883
                    worth of glass, 26 percent of the total value. Similarly, the monetary value of iron and steel
                    products rose in Indiana from $3,063,853 (0.7 percent) in 1890 to $19,338,481
                    (2.4 percent) in 1900.43

            The 1900 census reports also showed some dramatic increases in other statistics for Indiana cities
                    supplied by natural gas. 
                        Muncie
                     and Anderson, the two largest cities in the gas belt by 1900, had grown from
                    populations of 11,345 and 10,741, respectively, in 1890 to 20,942 and 20,178 a decade later. 
                        Muncie
                     in 1900 boasted 138 manufacturing plants, 5,756 manufacturing workers, and a
                    manufacturing production value of $7,641,567. Anderson in 1900 had 131 manufacturing
                    plants, 3,888 manufacturing workers, and a manufacturing production value of $9,519,854. 
                        Indianapolis
                    , outside the belt but supplied with natural gas, saw its number of manufacturing plants
                    rise from 657 in 1890 to 914 in 1900, its number of manufacturing workers from 13,441 in 1890 to
                    22,264 in 1900, and its manufacturing production value from $32,098,487 to
                        $61,535,557.45
            
            Smaller cities and towns throughout the belt shared in the industrialization and were important
                    contributors to the total manufacturing output of the state. For example, the American Tin Plate
                    Company plants in 
                        Elwood
                    , Anderson, Gas City, 
                  Middletown,
                            Atlanta
                (Ind.), and Montpelier comprised a
                    commanding part of the total tin plate manufactured in the 
                        United States
                     by 1899. The American Window Glass Company, a large trust of window-glass manufacturers
                    formed in the late 1890s, operated thirty-six factories in both large cities and small towns in the
                    Indiana gas belt by 1900.46

            This astounding growth in industry, commerce, population, and size came at a
                    price—depletion of the natural gas supply. As early as 1889, state geologist S. S. Gorby
                    noted in his annual report that, although the supply of natural gas in the newly-discovered Indiana
                    belt was huge, an average of one hundred million cubic feet of gas were being wasted each day
                    through wells and flambeaux burning day and night as promotional devices. By the early 1890s, the
                    Find-lay gas field in 
                        Ohio
                     and the gas field in western 
                        Pennsylvania
                     had both become nearly exhausted due to overuse, and E. T. J. Jordan, holder of the new
                    position of natural gas supervisor in Indiana, alluded in his report for 1893 to the pattern of
                    extravagant consumption and failure in 
                  Ohio.
                            Jordan
                reported that in Indiana gas pressure had
                    declined from 325 pounds per cubic inch in most locations in 1887 to between 200 and 290 pounds per
                    cubic feet in 1892. Using the 
                        Ohio
                     experience as a model, 
                        Jordan
                     proposed several conservation measures: a new law prohibiting the burning of flambeaux
                    should be enforced; wells should be carefully packed after drilling to avoid unnecessary escape of
                    gas; the flat fee contract system of selling gas should be replaced with a metered system that
                    rewarded conservation; and more efficient mixes of gas and oxygen should be used by consumers in
                    their gas burners.47
            
            Despite annual exhortations by the natural gas supervisor against waste and despite additional
                    legislation by the Indiana General Assembly to penalize wasteful practice, gas producers and large
                    consumers of the gas belt paid little heed to the alarms and the legislation through most of the
                    1890s. Many towns and individual well owners continued to burn flambeaux three to four years after
                    the torches were prohibited in 1891.48 After several cities supplied by the gas
                    belt experienced shortages during the winter of 1892-1893, most owners finally acknowledged the
                    legitimacy of the supervisor's warnings, and flambeaux-burning declined. With respect to
                    the other conservation measures, however, most producers and consumers refused to give up the low
                    prices that seemed to be the basis for the continuing commercial and industrial prosperity. As long
                    as gas continued to be available at low prices, most consumers were slow to adopt conservation
                        measures.49
            
            Even with all of the waste caused by flambeaux, flat prices, and inefficient burning apparatuses, the
                    gas in the Indiana Trenton field would probably have lasted well into the new century had not so

                     much of the fuel been pumped to locations outside east central
                        Indiana.50 By the late 1880s, the Indiana Natural Gas Company had
                    constructed a pipeline approximately one hundred and twenty miles in length from 
                        Howard County
                     to 
                        Chicago
                     and was pumping millions of cubic feet of natural gas from Indiana to consumers in the
                    largest city of the Midwest.51 As natural gas production declined in
                    northwestern 
                        Ohio
                     due in part to waste during the 1880s, 
                        Ohio
                     gas companies tapped into wells located in the Indiana gas belt to supply factories and
                    domestic customers in Findlay and other cities. By 1900, nearly $2 million of the
                    $7.2 million monetary value of gas produced in Indiana was leaving the state and going
                    either to 
                        Chicago
                     or northwestern 
                        Ohio
                    .52
            
            As the pressure at the wells dropped below 175 pounds of pressure in 1898-1899, pipeline gas
                    companies and factory owners began to build pumping stations to increase the gas pressure. J. C.
                    Leach, the natural gas supervisor in 1900, reported that, by the end of the 1890s, the unity of the
                    Indiana gas field as a single large reservoir had disintegrated because of the encroachment of salt
                    water into the gas-bearing limestone rock.53 Gas pressure dropped below 100
                    pounds in 1901, and producers abandoned many wells thereafter. After 1901, few factories in the belt
                    could obtain natural gas, since gas companies reserved available supplies for domestic customers.54
            
            The gas boom came to a dramatic end. Most of the small boom towns in the gas belt experienced an
                    economic bust after 1901. A few of their factories hung on, hoping for new gas supplies or
                    converting to other fuels. By the 1920s, most of these had closed. Communities such as Windfall,
                    Ingalls, Greentown, Converse, Upland, Sweetser, Eaton, Frankton, Matthews, 
                        Fairmount
                    , and Redkey shrank from one-third to one-half their preboom size. Many plants in each
                    community shut down at the first failure of the gas supply, and the temporary timber and corrugated
                    iron buildings were dismantled.55 With no factories, workers and their families
                    left, and sections resembled ghost towns for several years.56 Medium-sized
                    cities, such as

                    , struggled into the twentieth century with three or four of their large factories in
                    operation. The other plants closed and were removed. In 
                        Alexandria
                    , large sections of neighborhoods containing workers' cottages and saloons were
                    abandoned. The expansive plats laid out by the land boom companies returned to farmland in several
                        locations.57

                        Kokomo
                    —felt a momentary shock from the failure of gas, and each lost several major
                    plants. The business leadership in each city organized new campaigns to lure new industries to
                    replace the old. In addition, several major factories converted to alternative fuels, such as
                    manufactured gas or coal.58 In 
                        Muncie
                    , the Ball Brothers Company, which had become the largest producer of glass fruit
                    canning jars in the world by 1900, converted to coal soon after the turn of the century. In
                    Anderson, the American Steel and Wire Company, the Sefton Manufacturing Company, the Wright Shovel
                    Company, and the Anderson Knife and Bar Company all converted to coal. In 
                        Kokomo
                     and 
                        Elwood

                        Pittsburgh
                     Plate Glass Company plants (formerly Diamond Plate Glass) switched to coal, as did the
                    American Tin Plate Company and Macbeth-Evans Lamp Chimney Works in

            Many factories stayed because of the advantages of location. Stimulated in part by the gas boom, the
                    major railroads serving Indiana had built additional tracks that honeycombed east-central Indiana
                    and provided convenient access to coal, raw materials, and markets for finished manufactured
                        products.60 Also, many of the remaining industrial plant owners had made
                    substantial capital investments, particularly in the glass industry, which experienced significant
                    mechanization of production during the 1890s. In order to stay competitive large Indiana glass
                    plants had installed continuous tank furnaces and annealing lehrs to replace less efficient pot
                    furnaces and tempering ovens. Iron and steel companies spent considerable capital

                     58 Indiana State Geologist W. S. Blatchley had suggested as early as
                            1898 that gas belt factories adapt their plants to manufactured gas from coal or to coal
                            itself, which was available abundantly in southwestern Indiana. See W. S. Blatchley,

                    muck mills, and finishing mills. These investments persuaded some industrial firms to stay in
                    Indiana and pay more for fuel, rather than relocate to new natural gas fields in West

            The boards of trade and commercial clubs in the four principal cities continued to promote the
                    manufacturing advantages of their communities: existing plants, skilled workers, excellent rail
                    connections and rates, and reasonable fuel costs. In 
                        Muncie
                    , the Kitselman brothers from 
                        Ridgeville
                    , Indiana, constructed two factories in 1901 and 1904. The brothers built the Indiana
                    Steel and Wire Company in the old suburb of Boyceton, where the Maring, Hart and Company glass plant
                    had been abandoned. Thomas W. Warner formed the Warner Arc Lamp Company in 1901 and Warner Gear
                    Company in 1903, both of which grew from small machine shops into large plants tied to General
                    Motors and the Borg-Warner Corporation, respectively. In 1900 the American Lawn Mower Company of 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, moved its manufacturing operation to the former Common Sense Engine Company
                    plant on the south side of

            In Anderson, a new commercial club formed in 1905 and set out to retain existing plants and bring in
                    new ones. The Remy brothers' Remy Electric Company, a machine shop specializing in
                    "magnetos" for automobile engines, was persuaded to remain in 1900 and grew into
                    the immense Delco-Remy factory of General Motors. In north Anderson, the Lynch Glass Machine Company
                    moved into the plant of the former Ames Shovel Company.63 In
                            
                  Kokomo, Elwood
                Haynes, who had gotten his start as an engineer analyzing the
                    potential for natural gas, founded a motor car company and helped stimulate the formation of the
                    competing Apperson company. These local concerns eventually spurred the arrival of Chrysler
                    Corporation and General Motors plants. The Kingston Company, founded after 1900, manufactured
                    carburetors, spark coils, and magnetos, while local businessmen organized the 
                        Kokomo

                        Marion
                     Insulated Wire and Rubber Company. Eventually the city found an industrial base in the
                    automobile industry.64 Small automobile manufacturing plants also sprang up in
                    the first two decades of the century in the former gas boom communities of 
                  Indianapolis, Richmond,
                            Fort Wayne
               , Peru,

               ,
                    and Converse.
            The gas boom was thus responsible for the creation of the general industrial base of both the gas
                    belt and, to a significant degree, the cities that drew natural gas from the belt. Although east
                    central Indiana's status as the manufacturing center of the state declined after the
                    failure of natural gas, the principal cities remained centers of industrial production and economic
                    prosperity during much of the twentieth century.65

                  65 The boom also shaped the physical character and atmosphere of its
                        cities and towns. Although most of the factories of the boom have long since been dismantled or
                        demolished, many commercial districts and neighborhoods remain. The trademark architecture of
                        the gas boom is present in the brick buildings with Romanesque arcades along upper stories and
                        corbeled battlements. In the neighborhoods where the industrialists, merchants, and wealthy
                        farmers lived, Queen Anne-frame houses predominate, with irregular masses, turrets, and
                        wrap-around porches. The cottage design workers' homes are usually one or one and
                        one-half stories with wooden frames, gable roofs, and expansive porches.

            This article describes a moment in Indiana's history when many institutions united in a vast

                    of State Chanties, the progressive forces in philanthropic work self-consciously set out to steer
                    Indiana away from a patchwork system of poor relief and toward a bureaucratic, organized, and
                    efficient system of preventive measures. Their efforts, spanning the last decade of the nineteenth
                    century and the first two decades of the twentieth, proved so successful that the movement was
                    eventually deemed unnecessary and the massive educational front it organized was neglected.
            There are at least two reasons why a study of this process is necessary. A standard history of
                    philanthropy like Robert Bremner's American Philanthropy chronicles the
                    shift from charity to organized philanthropy and from amateur almsgiving to scientifically managed
                    care, but it does not explain how this shift came about. If it is true that "it was the
                    spread of this scientific approach" that impressed reformers as "the great
                    humanitarian achievement of their day," then it would seem important that the historian
                    investigate how this spread was accomplished.1 A second reason is the uniqueness
                    of the Indiana situation. While charity organization was a national movement, its remarkable success
                    in Indiana suggests that at least in this regard progressivism was more potent than standard
                    accounts have noted. The "Indiana way" may indeed be moderation in all things with
                    a tendency to round off the corners and blunt the sharp points of dispute, but the charity reformers
                    of Indiana were notable not so much for their moderation as for their zeal. Their success suggests
                    that the much-touted Indiana love of tradition might need to be qualified, at least for this period,
                    with an equally strong emphasis on innovation. Robert Crunden has suggested the term
                    "innovative nostalgia" as a label for the mindset of progressive reformers. This

                     article demonstrates the validity of such a paradoxical
                    description of organized giving in Indiana.2
            
            While organized concern for the general welfare in Indiana extends back at least to the original 1816
                    state constitution, which contained notably "progressive" educational and prison
                    clauses, it was 1889 which saw the beginning of the most effective instrument for organizing
                    Indiana's benevolent work, the Board of State Charities. The brainchild of prominent
                    Indiana citizens Timothy Nicholson and Oscar Carleton McCulloch, the board sought to organize
                    Indiana's charitable and correctional institutions along scientific principles and served
                    as the transitional force from the largely private nineteenth-century efforts to twentieth-century
                    government operations.
            Nicholson, dubbed "master 
                        Quaker
                    " by his biographer, was beyond question the grand old man of organized charity
                    in Indiana. He was by profession a bookseller in 
                        Richmond
                    , where he served as a trustee for forty-nine years at Earlham College. After the Civil
                    War he embarked on a long career of social action as a leader in administering 
                        Quaker
                     relief to freedmen. In 1867 he joined the Indiana Yearly Meeting's committee
                    on prison reform, which began his forty-year campaign to regularize and humanize Indiana's
                    correctional facilities. He served on the Indiana Board of State Charities from 1889 to 1908 and in
                    1901 was elected president of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections.3
            
            If Nicholson personified the board's history, McCulloch represented its vitality. In 1870 he
                    gave up a lucrative career in drug sales to attend the 
                        Chicago
                     Theological Seminary, from which he was graduated in 1873. After serving for four years
                    as a Congregational minister in Sheboygan, 
                        Wisconsin
                    , McCulloch moved to the 
                        Plymouth
                     Church in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . By 1884 he had built one of America's first and most successful
                    "institutional churches," where creeds were replaced by lecture courses, savings
                    and loan offices, and organized charity. With 
                        Plymouth
                     as his base, McCulloch created a wide array of philanthropic organizations, including
                    the Charity Organization Society (1878), the Children's Aid Society (1881), Flower Mission
                    Training School for Nurses (1882), the Dime Savings and Loan Association (1885), and the Summer
                    Mission for Sick Children (1890). He was president of the National Conference of Charities and
                    Corrections in 1891 and is perhaps best known for his six-generation study called "the
                    Tribe of Ishmael," charting the heritability of "feeblemindedness" and
                    associated behavioral abnormalities. His work was

                     first published in the national conference proceedings for 1888
                    and subsequently disseminated throughout the nation in state and county publications. McCulloch
                    drafted and was largely responsible for the passage of the law that created the Indiana Board of
                    State Chanties and by his death in 1891 had gained a reputation of near mythic proportions among
                    Indiana reformers.4
            
            The first secretary of the state board and one of the most tireless workers in organized giving was
                    Alexander Johnson. Born in 
                        England
                     to a respectable Baptist merchant family, Johnson immigrated in 1869 to 
                        Canada
                     and then to 
                        Chicago
                     and 
                        Cincinnati
                    , following the cloth manufacturing trade. But in 1882 he volunteered with the 
                        Cincinnati
                     Associated Charities, and by 1884, when he became secretary of this organization, he
                    had dedicated himself to professional social work. After serving as secretary of the 
                        Chicago
                     Charity Organization Society, he became secretary of the newly created Board of State
                    Charities. His specific interest in the "feebleminded" led to his appointment in
                    1893 as superintendent of the Indiana State School for the Feeble-minded at 
                        Fort Wayne
                    .
            Johnson's work with the National Conference of Charities and Corrections was considerable.
                    He served as secretary from 1890-1893, in 1900, and again, this time with salary, from 1904-1912. He
                    was elected president of that organization in 1897. Though he also became active in the American Red
                    Cross, he maintained a visible presence and palpable influence at the national conference until his
                    death at the age of 94.5
            
            The board these men created and governed disbanded in 1936 when the Indiana legislature created the
                    Department of Public Welfare, but during its forty-seven-year history it revised the way many
                    Indiana citizens thought about and practiced charity, and it provided opportunities in the form of its Annual Report and its annual conference for like-minded individuals to
                    network, share ideas, and strategize for political and educational action.6

                    have demurred, Emma Lou Thornbrough's generalization
                    that mid-nineteenth-century Hoosiers tended to be reluctant to spend on public services, opting
                    instead to "maintain law and order through private efforts," captures well the
                    perception of the Indiana mind held by reformers.7 It was this longstanding
                    belief in self-help, frontier individualism, ad hoc charity, antiplanning,
                    antibigness, and anticontrol that the men who masterminded the Board of State Charity sought to
                    change. They wanted to replace amateur giving with professional management, to shift the emphasis of
                    charity from body to soul and from treatment to prevention, and to prove to the rest of the country
                    that Indiana was no longer backwards and backwoods but in the forefront of corrective planning and
                    organizing.
            Perhaps the most visible element in the ideology of progressive charity organizers was the desire to
                    have Indiana switch from outdoor to indoor relief. While outdoor relief supplied handouts freely to
                    beggars or to those in need, indoor relief consisted of institutionalized care properly managed and
                    overseen. It was the firm conviction of members of the board and their supporters that almsgiving
                    meant misfortune for the recipient. The rhetoric on this topic could get quite heated, as comments
                    from W. C. Smallwood of 
                        Terre Haute
                    's Society for Organized Charity make clear: "Finally, my co-workers
                    and friends, if you have not…the heart to say 'No' when found
                    'not worthy,' then stay out of the charity work and stop creating paupers and
                    encouraging professionals." Sydney B. Davis, president of the Third State Conference of
                    Charities, expressed the same sentiment: "Much harm to the individual and the community
                    comes from misdirected, ignorant, careless, misnamed charity. Much of our so-called charity is only
                    laziness and selfishness. The man who gives to the vagrant is a public enemy. If there was no
                    back-door giving there would be no tramps."8
            
            Essential to the idea of indoor relief was the principle of cooperation for prevention. For indoor
                    relief to work, every citizen and every organization had to present a united front against
                    almsgiving. C. E. Prevey, secretary of Associated Charities in 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , explained cooperation as "the centralization of the philanthropic forces of
                    the city corresponding to the centralization which has taken place in the industrial
                    world." These groups needed to unite in a common mission to eradicate handouts, for as
                    Johnson noted, "one of the effects on a thinking mind of many years of varied social work
                    is a profound distrust of relief in every form; a positive conviction that its complete eradication,
                    except in the presence of overwhelming disaster, would be a great social gain."9

            Along with the idea of prevention was the replacement of concern over bodily suffering with care of
                    the inner person or what came to be called "mental hygiene." Father John R.
                    Quinlan of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul made the connection explicit: "Too many
                    engaged in charitable work are satisfied with relieving without trying to reform. It is more
                    charitable to reform the degradation of heart and soul than to relieve bodily wants."
                    McCulloch, founder and guiding spirit of the consolidation movement, agreed: "life is
                    spiritual and not material…[,] it is our souls, not our bodies, which are the significant
                    things of life." The care of the soul of the weak person was not the sort of thing just
                    anyone could do, so it is not surprising to find reformers advocating the establishment of
                    professional standards for care-givers over the traditional practice of granting such posts as
                    political favors. Board secretary Ernst Bicknell looked forward to the day when "wards of
                    the State will be entrusted only to officers of recognized training and fitness."10
            
            At the heart of charity ideology was a desire to replace unorganized almsgiving with organized work
                    guided by professionals who would seek to prevent poverty by altering the soul such that the
                    individual would become a productive member of society. The motivations behind such a perspective
                    were diverse and contradictory. As the foregoing quotations demonstrate, a religious spirit
                    permeated the rhetoric. Most of the members of the board and a high percentage of those attending
                    the annual conferences were either members of the clergy or active in local churches. Yet many were
                    businessmen as well, and pecuniary motivations surfaced nearly as frequently as religious ones.
                    Johnson frankly noted the construction of poor asylums served as both "an insurance of
                    every citizen against death by destitution, and … a protection of the well-to-do against
                    the assaults of those who might be made desperate by suffering." W. C. Ball, speaking at
                    the eighth annual conference in 1899, agreed that the poor person "must be helped, or
                    assisted to help himself, lest he keep himself rather wastefully at our expense. Either this or he
                    must be disposed of as Cain disposed of Abel."11
            
            Nor does this practical theme exhaust the motives of the reformers. Pervading their discussions was a
                    keen self-consciousness of the position of Indiana relative to that of other states. The state board
                    and the state conference were only one subdivision of a national movement with its own organizations
                    and conferences, and the representatives

                    of Indiana wanted their state to look good in the eyes of
                    everyone else. Nicholson remarked that "Indiana seems to have been a slow state
                    …. But it has been very remarkable how soon our state has come up with the
                    others." Johnson could boast in 1893 that "In many respects the institutions of
                    the State of Indiana and the laws upon her statute books which govern them, compare very favorably
                    with those of the most enlightened and progressive States of the American Union."12 One particular reform effort that was of special concern to Johnson and of
                    which Indiana may justly be said to have been in the vanguard was the issue of sterilization for
                    eugenic purposes. Indiana passed the first law in the nation legalizing sterilization in 1907,
                    though it seems that the procedure had been performed by Dr. Harry Sharp at the Indiana Reformatory
                    since 1899. The law was strengthened in 1927 and made more explicit in 1931. L. P. Harshman reported
                    that by 1935, 168 individuals had been sterilized under these laws, though the actual number was
                    probably larger when unreported cases, especially those before 1907, are taken into
                        consideration.13
            
            Among progressive charity organizers, the issue of forced sterilization produced much discussion and
                    controversy. Johnson, for example, argued strongly against the practice for a time, advocating
                    instead the total institutionalization of all "feeble minded" persons throughout
                    their childbearing years, even though it was clear that a surgical procedure was more economical
                    than expensive boarding. In 1912 Johnson reluctantly reversed himself on the issue: "the
                    number of the idiots, imbeciles, and epileptics is so appalling that I fear only the method of
                    sterilization is equal to the need." This opinion found ready assent among the majority of
                    his colleagues and proved to be the dominant view until new research in the late 1930s began to
                    suggest the possibility that feeble-mindedness has an environmental rather than an hereditary
                        cause.14
            
            But for at least the first three decades of the twentieth century, there existed a consensus among
                    charity organizers on the question of eugenics. Their problem then became how to persuade voters on
                    this question. They had to convince their fellow citizens that "a nation which fosters and
                    cares for its good-for-nothings will sooner or later become a good-for-nothing nation" and
                    that "the remedy lies in selective

                    service possible to the defective, namely, the prevention of his coming into existence."
                    The answer, it seemed, was "by the diffusion of sound information and the enlightenment of
                    public opinion," which would insure that marriages between mental incompetents
                    "could be made as odious in the mind of the general public as they are now to those who
                    have studied and thought upon the question."15
            
            The charity reformers had set for themselves the difficult task of changing the thoughts and
                    behaviors of the majority of Indiana's citizens on a series of issues that penetrated to
                    the deepest assumptions about the nature of the person, the responsibility of the individual to
                    further the general good, the method of stewardship, and the procedures of generosity. Success, they
                    came to realize, would require the coordinated effort of many institutions tirelessly serving over a
                    long period of time. In short, educational success would require exactly the same sort of organized
                    effort that they were preaching for philanthropy itself. And so they set themselves to the task.
            At the turn of the century churches still played a powerful role in shaping the opinions of most
                    citizens, and therefore the reformers turned especially to the pulpit for assistance. At the fourth
                    conference in 1895 W. C. Smallwood asked, "how can the Church help the poor from a charity
                    organization standpoint?" and answered, "if the ministry would at least once a
                    month deliver a lecture on scientific giving, would not the effect be felt?" The proposal
                    here only expanded the program already in effect that asked Indiana pastors to set aside the last
                    Sunday of October as "Prison Sunday." Since 1890 the board had been sending out
                    literature to churches across the state prior to the Prison Sunday sermon "for the purpose
                    of supplying hints and illustrations for such discourses."16
            
            Attendees of the annual state conferences began to utilize the pulpit more directly as well. Some of
                    them were pastors in their own right, but even those who were not would often preach as guests,
                    especially on the Sunday after the conference. On this day nearly every pulpit in the town hosting
                    the conference would be filled by some guest speaker fresh from a weekend's collegial
                    stimulation. This tradition of guest-preaching persisted until 1933, when the conference organizers
                    finally capitulated to increasing diversity and decided to hold the conference during the week so as
                    not to offend Jewish delegates or secular persons.
            Another educative institution the charity reformers seized upon was the press. From the
                    board's very beginnings the press had been

                     a crucial element in its strategy. Johnson, who recognized the
                    influence the press exercised on politics, utilized it for the board's purposes.17 Johnson was able to count on the support of the leading men of various
                    professions for plans that had been worked out collectively by such literary groups as the
                    Fortnightly Literary Club and the Commercial Club. In these clubs prominent 
                        Indianapolis
                     newspapermen like Bicknell and William Fortune swapped ideas with the charity
                    organizers and in so doing picked up a "scoop" or two, interpreted of course with
                    the most congenial spin. Fortune used his partnership with Colonel Eli Lilly and his own position at
                    the News, to create "civic projects aimed at making 
                        Indianapolis
                     into a progressive, modern city which would keep pace with the changing world around
                    it." Included in this modernization project was the organization of the city's
                    philanthropic resources, perhaps most notably in response to the depression of 1893-1894, but also
                    later with the Indiana War Chest, which would eventually become the Board of Public Welfare, of
                    which Fortune would become the first chairman. Surely Johnson spoke from experience when noting that
                    "the enviable reputation of Indiana in social work is largely due to the way the Board of
                    State Charities has made known and has carried into effect, the wishes and desires of the best
                    people of the state."18
            
            The press was an early ally to the charity reformers, and the relationship continued for several
                    decades. Bicknell was surprised and delighted to learn that his early association with the board as
                    an 
                        Indianapolis
                     newspaperman resulted in his unanimous election as secretary to replace Johnson. Thus
                    the tradition of a close relationship between board and press was continued and even strengthened as
                    the man at the helm combined an insider's knowledge of both domains. In his 1915 address to
                    the state conference entitled "The Newspaper as an Interpreter of Social Welfare,"
                    Tom S. Elrod made this connection clear, stating that "there is a vast difference between
                    printing something about poverty, crime or mental sickness, and printing something that is strong
                    enough to arouse the public to a point where the removal of unnecessary causes will be
                    demanded." This close association was to continue throughout the board's
                    existence. Even in its final years one could find newsmen such as Harold C. Feightner of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News speaking regularly at the annual conference.19
            
            Perhaps the most powerful educational forces for organized philanthropy were the board's own
                    initiatives. One of the major provisions

                     of the board's charter was the production by the
                    secretary of an annual report. Under Johnson's administration this report quickly became
                    much more than merely a compilation of the board's minutes or a summation of expenditures.
                    Johnson and his successors Bicknell and Amos W. Butler used the report as a pulpit for proclaiming
                    the gospel of charity organization in ways analogous to Horace Mann's famous reports for
                    the 
                        Massachusetts
                     Board of Education. "There is probably no other part of the work of the Board
                    more likely to subserve the end for which it was created," Johnson stated, "than
                    the plentiful distribution of well chosen literature." Johnson also expanded the role of
                    secretary by advising and suggesting improved methods, speaking at public meetings, and promoting
                    the cause of charity. "In these ways," he concluded, "I have done
                    something towards popularizing the methods of charity which this Board stands for [….
                    which] may be stated in the two words, efficiency and economy."20
            
            The greatest instrument of education employed by the Board was its annual State Conference of
                    Charities and Corrections, explicitly modeled on the national conference. Johnson had noted early
                    the significance of the national conference: "There is nothing more useful to the members
                    of a Board of Charities, in qualifying them to perform their responsible duties to the State, than
                    attendance upon the meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections." In
                    1890 the first state conference, held in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , was attended by over one hundred and fifty people.
            Delegates to the annual conference had the opportunity to meet others, to hear reports of the latest
                    advances in various fields, to be inspired by nationally known figures, and to have their resolve
                    steeled and their doubts assuaged by the solidarity prompted by the event. Perhaps one of the most
                    important functions of the conference was to provide participants a larger narrative of progress
                    within which each participant could place his or her own struggles. Very quickly the presidential
                    address at the annual conference resembled a grand review, an attempt by a state leader to provide
                    the group with a collective and useful past. Thus every annual presidential address gradually took
                    on the same general tenor, since the familiar story of Indiana's rise from the mire of a
                    past of unorganized charities to the stunning prospects of the current day's heights was
                    told over and over again.
            Once this history was formalized it found its way into offical printed publications of the society,
                    the most notable of which was 
                        Butler
                    's A Century of Progress. By the time 
                        Butler
                    's book was published, the founders McCulloch and Nicholson had joined early
                    secretaries

                     Johnson, Bicknell, and 
                        Butler
                     himself as a holy patriarchy of the movement, and the history 
                        Butler
                     relates is generous in its praise of these figures. The document itself was displayed,
                    sold, and given away at the state conference year after year and was in such demand that by 1916 
                        Butler
                     had revised it three times. His account has been followed by every successive
                    chronicler of the state board, leaving behind an educational legacy the reach of which has been
                    unquestionably broad and the therapeutic effect of which on the state's charity workers
                    must surely have been significant.21
            
            Just how much impact did the ideas of charitable organizations have on reform practices? Throughout
                    the board's existence attendance at the conferences continued to increase, reflecting an
                    increasingly broad reach into various

                     County Children's Home Association and the Indiana Board of State Charities
                    shared a common Progressive Era perception of dependent children as having only tenuous ties to
                    their parents that could be snipped and reattached permanently to good substitute
                        families."22 Such work begins to demonstrate the relationship
                    between idea and activity and between the intellectual and social histories of welfare policy and
                    practice.
            The 1930s saw many changes in organized benevolence. The state conference, reflecting increased
                    professionalization and the resultant concern for proper nomenclature, had changed its name to the
                    State Conference on Social Work as early as 1925. In 1932 the usual full coverage given of the
                    conference was replaced in the Bulletin of Charities and Corrections by short
                    summaries of all but the major addresses, a move that coincided with the changing nature of social
                    service as a profession. The next year the Board of State Charities reorganized as the Indiana
                    Department of Public Welfare. In 1936 the Bulletin was discontinued and the Indiana Welfare News replaced it. The stated goal of this new publication was
                    "PROMOTION of social betterment among our aged, or physically and mentally handicapped, our
                    wayward and dependent and other wise less fortunate fellow citizens, at the least possible expense
                    to the taxpayers OF THE STATE."

            All in all the new publication was a more popular affair, seemingly intended for leisurely perusal by
                    professional social workers rather than by the "leading citizens of the state."
                    There were sections written in the style of Reader's Digest, which
                    related anecdotes of the humorous experiences of regional social workers or that presented in
                    colloquial dialect some of the grammatical, Freudian, and other slips of uneducated clients of the
                    state. As the years passed the intellectual content of the magazine grew increasingly thin while the
                    production quality rose, as glossy pictures and elegant layout replaced the homespun style of
                    earlier issues. All of this reflected national trends, to be sure, but it also suggests that the
                    movement could afford to dispense with the fundamentally intellectual concerns of explaining and
                    justifying its mission, because its mission had in large measure been accomplished. By the 1950s
                    there was no longer pressing need to expound the message of organized giving. Having no opposition
                    to identify and censure, at length even the flimsy Indiana Welfare News was
                        discontinued.24

            "His Valorous Conduct": The Story of a Hoosier Hero in the Korean War
            Randy K. Mills and Roxanne Mills∗
            
            Among the many episodes of the Korean War stands the nearly forgotten tale of one of the 
                        United States
                    ' most bitter military blunders: the defeat of elements of the U.S.
                    Army's 7th Infantry Division by Chinese forces in the winter of 1950.1
                    "It would be hard," notes historian Roy Appleman, "to find a more nearly
                    hopeless or tragic story in American military history."2 The swift and
                    overwhelming nature of the defeat left little time for detailed official records, causing many of
                    the specifics of the event to be forever lost. Luckily a few survivors took notes immediately after
                    the action. These fragmented testimonies give vivid proof of the ferocity of the struggle and show
                    that during this defeat came acts of extraordinary heroism.3 Among these is the
                    story of a low-ranking assistant motor pool sergeant and high school dropout from southwest Indiana
                    named Charles Garrigus, Jr. Why Garrigus stayed and fought with a doomed convoy of wounded GIs while
                    so many of his comrades ran to the safety of the nearby Marine Corps lines can perhaps be best
                    understood by looking at the Hoosier environment that shaped this gallant and humble soldier.
            At the height of the depression in 1937, the Garrigus clan journeyed southward from Yeddo, near 
                        Terre Haute
                    , to Francisco, Indiana, where Charles Garrigus, Sr., worked in the nearby
                    King's coal mine. The Garrigus sons were also expected to work and soon were hired by local
                    farmers, who paid them as often in produce as in money.

                     Gladys Garrigus and her daughters cooked, cleaned, and washed
                    daily for the large family.
            Just eleven years old when his family moved to rural 
                        Gibson County
                    , Garrigus did discover some pleasures in spite of the hard times. The boy, whom his
                    sisters teasingly called June Bug, possessed a shy smile and loved to spend his free time tinkering
                    with engines or driving farm vehicles down the dusty lanes that crisscrossed the Hoosier
                    countryside. School work often got in the way of Garrigus's desire to work with engines,
                    and, like many young males of his day, Garrigus dropped out of school before receiving a high school
                    diploma, content to work with farm vehicles. The onset of World War II, however, changed
                    Garrigus's life forever.
            Serving in the military brought many young men who grew up in the harsh poverty of depression a
                    stability they had not known before. When Garrigus was honorably discharged in November of 1946
                    "by reason of demobilization," the twenty-two-year-old Hoosier traveled to Gary,
                    Indiana, where he tried his hand as a heavy equipment operator. Civilian life, however, lacked the
                    predictability he had come to know in the army, and like many others he soon reen-listed.4 The strapping six-footer looked forward to having a career in the army, where
                    he would be able to work with and drive trucks and heavy equipment. When North 
                        Korea
                     launched an unexpected attack on South 
                        Korea
                     on June 25, 1950, Garrigus was serving as an assistant motor pool sergeant in 
                        Japan
                    . Again he found his life shaped by world events far beyond his control. The surprise
                    invasion fell, said Newsweek, "like lightening from a clear
                        sky."5 Although Garrigus had been scheduled to return home on June
                    26, he was quickly sent into 
                        Korea
                     with the first American troops.
            Throughout July and August of 1950, meagerly armed and mostly unprepared American fighting men held a
                    small and vulnerable perimeter around the southern Korean seaport of Pusan. Primarily clerks and
                    truck drivers like Garrigus, many of these initial troops had hardly handled a rifle.6 By the end of July when the military situation had deteriorated to the point of
                    desperation, Americans began to fear the worst. One national magazine demanded to know
                    "Why… US. Troops [are] being pushed around in a place called 
                        Korea
                    ?"7 But the circumstances changed dramatically in
                    mid-September when U.S. Army and Marine units landed at the western seaport of Inchon and quickly
                    threatened to cut off the North Korean Army pressing in on the Pusan lines. Sensing that the
                    American, South Korean, and other United Nations (UN) forces would soon be

                     closing in, the North Koreans retreated northward.8 UN troops quickly followed.
            The crossing of the thirty-eighth parallel by UN forces did not go unnoticed by North 
                        Korea
                    's neighbors.9 Gen. Douglas MacArthur, however, guaranteed
                    that neither Russia nor 
                        China
                     would come into the war now that North 
                        Korea
                     was obviously defeated. Because of his past successes, MacArthur's
                    pronouncements carried significant weight. Time declared that one of the primary
                    reasons for the "final victory" in 
                        Korea
                     was "Douglas MacArthur's vast superiority over the enemy generals in
                    strategic planning."10 By early October, folks back home like the
                    Garrigus family heard wonderful news from the press about the war's glorious finish. US. News and World Report bragged in a sudden burst of hubris that the 
                        United States
                    , by "winning" in 
                        Korea
                    , "was again top dog in the world."11
                    Newsweek expressed a similar view, observing happily that "everybody
                    loves a winner." In an eerily prophetic vein, however, that same issue noted the surprise
                    shift in fortune "seemed almost too good to be true."12
            
            MacArthur's plan for ending the war called for the Eighth Army, under Lt. Gen. Walton
                    Walker, to move northwest from Seoul and capture the North Korean capital. X Corps, under Lt. Gen.
                    Edward Almond, would land on the eastern side of North 
                        Korea
                     at the seaports of Wonson and Iwon and move northward and eastward to link up with the
                    Eighth Army before both moved to the Yalu River and the Manchurian frontier.13 Garrigus's unit was the Seventh Army Division, 32nd Regiment.
                    Originally a part of the Eighth Army, the 7th Task Force, made up of about 3,000 men, was sent from
                    the western to the eastern side of 
                        Korea
                     to join X Corps after North 
                        Korea
                    's capital fell so quickly. Garrigus's outfit was to protect X
                    Corps's flank in the closing campaign in the war. Because of the success of the campaign
                    MacArthur told an assistant that "the boys…will be home by Christmas."
            Strung out along a single precarious mountain road, X Corps was particularly vulnerable to entrapment
                    and possible annihilation. The Marine Corps component of X Corps under Maj. Gen. O. P. Smith had
                    wisely established several bases of supplies and men along the single narrow supply route, with the
                    primary bases located at Kotori 
                  
                     8 The vast bulk of troops, equipment, and financial support for the UN
                            effort in Korea came from the 
                                United States
                            .
                  
                     9 The thirty-eighth parallel was arbitrarily chosen to divide 
                                Korea

                     and Hagaru near the southern end of the sprawling Chosin
                    Reservoir. Highly organized and trained to fight under the most severe of conditions, marine units
                    also stayed in contact with one another. The fragments of the 7th Division, however, lacked the
                    organization of Smith and his marines.
            Back in Indiana, Gladys Garrigus read the uplifting news of the war's sure end but still
                    harbored great fears concerning her son's safety. She wrote Charles and pleaded with him to
                    send any information he could regarding what he was doing in 
                        Korea
                    . Garrigus sent his mother a letter in response to her request. Enclosed was a snapshot
                    of himself standing beside two three-quarter-ton trucks mired in heavy mud. It was typical, he

            On Thanksgiving Day 1950, marines of the 5th Division enjoyed a hot meal while occupying the eastern
                    side of the Chosin Reservoir. The next day they received orders to leave their positions, proceed
                    south to Hagaru, and then head west to Yudam-ni on the opposite side of the Chosin where a larger
                    group of marines waited. MacArthur's plan eventually called for the marines at Yudam-ni to
                    wheel west and hook up with the Eighth Army. To protect the marines' flank from possible
                    attack, the army group of about 3,000 men, led by Col. Alan MacLean, arrived on the eastern side of
                    the Chosin. The colonel and his 31st Regiment team were to link up with Garrigus's unit of
                    the 32nd Regiment, commanded by thirty-two-year-old Lt. Col. Donald Faith of 
                        Washington
                    , Indiana. From their Chosin base, these two 7th Division army units were to protect the
                    flank of the UN forces' main thrust up the western side of the peninsula.15 Hidden in the mountains that surrounded the Chosin, however, waited tens of thousands of
                    Chinese troops.
            Had the Chinese not come into the war, it is likely that members of X Corps would still have
                    remembered the terrible conditions of that winter. By late November, temperatures dropped to minus
                    35 degrees, without factoring wind chill. Inactive soldiers often froze to death in their fox holes.
                    Truck drivers like Garrigus found themselves struggling to carry out their jobs in the most
                    difficult of circumstances, for the roads in the Chosin campaign "were among the poorest
                    and most precarious of any used in war by American forces." No American armies, notes
                    Appleman, "before or since have fought in as harsh or hostile environment."16
            
            The Chinese sprang their trap in late November. As the temperature dropped dramatically and heavy
                    snow fell, X Corps, including the

                     15 The 7th Division was not completely together on the eastern side of
                            the Chosin. Task Force MacLean was made up of the 1st Battalion of the 32nd Regiment, the
                            3rd Battalion of the 31st Regiment, and the 57th Field Artillery minus C Battery.

                     3,000 members of Task Force MacLean, found themselves
                    surrounded by at least 120,000 battle-tested Chinese soldiers. To the west the Eighth Army
                    confronted an equally large number of Chinese and quickly fled southward in what would become the
                    longest military retreat in 
                        United States
                     history. The American leadership was stunned by the staggering change in events.
                    "The Chinese," MacArthur wired President Harry Truman, "have come in with
                    both feet." Truman quickly called a meeting of his staff and reported that
                    "we've got a terrific situation on our hands."17 For
                    Americans like the Garrigus family who had loved ones fighting in 
                        Korea
                    , the abrupt and shocking information delivered by newspaper accounts could not have
                    painted a grimmer picture. The 
                        New York
                    
                    Times, for example, spoke of "hordes of Chinese Reds" sweeping
                    down upon vastly outnumbered U.S. troops.18 The primary paper for the region in
                    which the Garrigus family lived, the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Courier, also offered a gloomy assessment of the situation in northeast 
                        Korea
                    . One headline noted that Garrigus's group was now "trapped by perhaps
                    as many as 300,000 Chinese.19 The next day the same paper announced that the
                    31st and 32nd Regiments were surrounded and their only supply route had been cut.20 Because communication from this front had virtually ceased, Garrigus and the other members
                    of MacLean's group seemed to have disappeared. A telegram informed the Garrigus family that
                    their son was listed as missing in action as of November 27. In fact, their son was just beginning a
                    cruel five-day struggle for survival.
            On November 27 the Chinese struck in below-zero weather, blowing horns, bugles, and shooting flares.
                    Because of the lack of communication, the scattered elements of Task Force MacLean "fought
                    separate and desperate actions."21 On the 32nd's perimeter the
                    fighting was fierce as well. On the days of the first attack, MacLean held a position at an inlet of
                    the Chosin while Faith's 32nd Regiment had established a perimeter a mile or so away.
            Fearing air strikes, the Chinese pulled back the next morning, and the scattered groups of GIs
                    reformed their perimeters. Oddly, the commander of X Corps, Lieutenant General Almond, did not seem
                    greatly concerned about the initial Chinese attack. From Hagaru, Almond helicoptered into
                    Faith's perimeter on November 28 and talked over the situation with Faith and others, while
                    nearby Garrigus tended his trucks. Almond had come to confer with and encourage the leaders of the
                    beleaguered task force, by disparaging the enemy as "nothing more than the remnant of
                    Chinese divisions fleeing north….don't let a bunch of Chinese laundrymen stop
                        you."22

            The struggle that took place on the evening of the 28th proved to be even more brutal and intense
                    than the first night's action, as MacLean's camp was almost overrun. The situation
                    was so serious that many units did not "take time to carry rations to the front line. When
                    the food did reach the soldiers after dark, it was frozen and the men had no way to thaw it except
                    by holding it against their bodies."23 Faith's group, which
                    included Garrigus, fared little better than MacLean's. The next day MacLean decided it
                    would be best for Faith's regiment to consolidate with his group. In carrying out the
                    request to move, Faith ordered several trucks to be unloaded so that the rapidly mounting number of
                    wounded could be carried out in three-quarter-ton trucks. At dawn on November 29, about sixty
                    vehicles began the dash through heavy enemy fire. As the column crossed a final bridge to arrive in
                    MacLean's perimeter, Chinese fire increased, and two American trucks carrying ammunition
                    and rations were hastily left behind by nervous truck drivers. Later that same day Garrigus gazed
                    across the bridge and saw enemy soldiers approaching the abandoned supply trucks. "On his
                    own initiative," the ht sergeant decided to return for the trucks. Unarmed and dashing
                    "across…300 yards of open snow covered ice," Garrigus brought the first
                    truck across the bridge to safety; then he ran back to get the second truck. His second trip drew
                    the unwanted attention of even more Chinese. As he maneuvered the lumbering truck over the frozen
                    ground, bullets whizzed by and smacked into the truck's body. Somehow the truck made it
                    into the safety of the American lines, stalling as it rolled into the perimeter. Here the sound of
                    the dying engine gave way to the hurrahs of GIs. These soldiers had taken some hard hits from the
                    Chinese, and the sergeant's surprising stunt greatly lifted their morale. "Through
                    Garrigus' quick thinking actions…the supplies were taken from the very grasp of
                    the enemy."24
            
            That same morning MacLean was either killed or captured by Chinese whom he had mistakenly identified
                    as Americans. Now Faith found himself in charge of the Task Force.25 On November
                    30, General David 
                        Barr
                    , commander of the 7th Infantry Division, came by helicopter to Faith's
                    headquarters, where he learned of MacLean's disappearance. Although their conversation was
                    not recorded, Faith probably told 
                        Barr
                     of his plans to break out of the trap by dashing several miles over a narrow mountain
                    road to the more secure marine base

                            as a brigadier general. For his actions in the battle east of the Chosin, Faith would
                            receive the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously.
               
                     at Hagaru.26 Faith further planned to load
                    the five hundred or so wounded in trucks and jeeps and bring them out as well. Given the horrible
                    conditions of the road, the bitterly cold and snowy weather, and the thousands of Chinese who
                    occupied the hills, the breakout plan seemed an impossible task. Yet more shocking news came to
                    Faith at this time. The beleaguered marines would not be able to send any men to help
                    Faith's party move southward. Other than daily air support from a handful of planes, Task
                    Force Faith, as it was now unofficially dubbed, would be on its own.
            The night before the attempted breakout was brutal. Shortly after midnight the Chinese attack built a
                    greater intensity than all other previous attacks. "All through the night,"
                    recalled one survivor, "we heard the cries from our friendly wounded within the perimeter
                    who were suffering from the cold."27 Desperately needed medical
                    supplies were completely exhausted by the next morning. Thus the condition of Faith's group
                    on the morning of the attempted breakout was especially poor. A surviving officer described the
                    hellish scene: "By dawn on December 1 members of the Task Force had been under attack for
                    80 hours in sub-zero weather. None had slept much. None had washed or shaved, none had eaten more
                    than a bare minimum." To make things worse, most of the men were wounded or crippled by the
                    bitter cold. "Everyone seemed to be wounded in one fashion or another…frozen
                    feet and hands were common."28 Just as discouraging on that bleak dawn
                    was the rapidly deteriorating weather.
            Garrigus was probably given much authority over the trucks in the convoy, most of which were heavily
                    loaded with the wounded. Vehicles typically carried fifteen to twenty injured men, though some had
                    as many as fifty on board. Just as the convoy began to take off, Chinese troops overran several key
                    defensive machine gun positions at the edge of the perimeter and used those weapons to rake the
                    American lines. Rallying "a group of soldiers," Garrigus led "a daring
                    charge, regained the machine guns…" and immediately turned the weapons
                    "on the enemy, killing 60 or so and wounding many others."29
                    Chinese firing died down, and the perimeter was safe once more because of Garrigus's bold
                    actions. The convoy could continue.
            Given the lack of communication and the loss of leadership, it is not surprising that the moving
                    column soon became a disorganized fight for survival. One major noted that once started, the troops
                    "flooded down the road like a great mob and tactical control broke down almost immediately.
                    Officers tried frantically to re-establish control and to order men up on the high ground where they
                    could protect the truck

                    men began to wander off from the wounded men in the trucks and toward the southern end of the frozen
                    reservoir and the safety of marine lines. Meanwhile, Chinese firing waxed and waned as the
                    strung-out caravan snaked through the barren hills. Often groups of GIs with the convoy would charge
                    a particular hill or roadblock to drive the enemy away and then head overland for Hagaru.
            At about 3 p.m. the convoy came to an unexpected roadblock— a blown bridge. The trucks
                    were forced to go down into a muddy stream bed in order to bypass the blockage. The Chinese brought
                    down especially heavy fire as the vulnerable trucks struggled to churn through the mud below the
                    destroyed span. Many of the men operating the trucks were inexperienced with such deplorable driving
                    conditions and soon were mired in the mud. This circumstance threatened to stop the column in its
                    tracks. Once more Garrigus rose to the occasion. The resourceful motor pool sergeant was able to put
                    his long hours of driving vehicles through muddy Indiana farm fields to good use. "Under
                    intense enemy fire," he brought "several trucks across and out of a deep mud hole
                    in the bed of the stream."31 Pvt. Alan Cork recalled examining the
                    trucks after they had passed the blown bridge and found that it was impossible to place his hand
                    anywhere upon any of the vehicles without touching a bullet hole.32
                    Unfortunately for the convoy, it took several hours of precious time to get all the trucks of
                    wounded GIs to the other side of the destroyed bridge. It was dangerously dark, and marine air
                    support could no longer protect the men and trucks who struggled down the icy Korean dirt track.
                    About the time dusk fell at 5 p.m. only twenty-five of the original thirty-five vehicles remained in
                    the column. Garrigus, perhaps because of his actions back at the blown bridge, drove the lead truck
                    of the vulnerable convoy. As the vehicles inched forward in low gear, more able-bodied men continued
                    to leave the column, but not Garrigus.
            Around midnight the convoy approached its final destination, five short miles from the marine lines
                    at Hagaru. Enemy fire and mechanical breakdown had knocked out most of the trucks during that long
                    afternoon. Only fifteen bullet-ridden vehicles remained, packed with wounded men. Faith had already
                    died from wounds, and his body sat frozen in the cab of one of the trucks. Maj. Crosby Miller, who
                    had barely been able to cling to the hood of a jeep, recalled what happened next. When the column
                    paused to regroup, the silence was suddenly broken "by two mortar rounds burst[ing] to the
                    right of the road opposite the truck column about 100 yards away." Miller doubted whether
                    the convoy would be able to continue. Before the

                     first mortar rounds came, Garrigus had left the cab of the lead
                    truck and "moved a 100 yards [ahead] and had not seen or heard any movement." When
                    Garrigus returned to the trucks, he offered to lead the convoy in a last-ditch effort to get the
                    trucks and wounded to Hagaru. Upon Miller's instructions to "move out,"
                    word was passed back to prepare for a final run.33
            
            Two hundred yards down the road "a terrific blast of…machine gun fire
                    hit" the lead truck, causing it to pile into a ditch and effectively block escape for the
                    rest of the convoy.34 Garrigus died at the wheel of his vehicle. The Chinese
                    fell on the remaining trucks and their helpless human cargo. For all purposes, Task Force Faith
                    ended here. "At the end," notes Appleman, "each man had his own
                    adventure, and some lived to tell them."35 Garrigus and the others of
                    Task Force MacLean-Faith would not suffer or die in vain. Their efforts kept a large number of
                    Chinese tied down for five crucial days, allowing the marines at Yudam-ni to fight their way down to
                    Hagaru where marines and surviving elements of the Seventh Army Infantry Division were then able to
                    carry out their now famous retreat. During this advance to the rear, U.S. forces inflicted
                    tremendous losses upon the Chinese with concentrated artillery fire and air strikes before
                    evacuating the northeast Korean coast at Hungnam. By April of 1951, the Chinese drive had been
                    halted, and by June the war became a grinding, static struggle along the thirty-eighth parallel. By
                    the time the war ended in July 1953, over fifty-four thousand American troops had died.
            For several months Gladys and Charles Garrigus, Sr., were told that their son was missing in action,
                    but by early April 1951, the army had pieced together enough fragmented information from the
                    accounts of survivors to be certain that Charles Garrigus, Jr., had indeed died while leading the
                    final breakout attempt. In a letter that April, addressed to Gladys Garrigus, General MacArthur
                    wrote that he hoped Gladys could find "some measure of comfort" knowing that her
                    son died "in the service of his country and in the defense of a peace loving
                        people."36 The fragmented accounts concerning the five-day struggle
                    east of the Chosin also shed light on Charles Garrigus's heroic efforts, and on August 7,
                    1951, the young Francisco, Indiana, man posthumously received the Distinguished Service Cross,
                    America's second highest military honor, "for his valorous conduct."37 No other 
                        Gibson County
                     soldier has received so prestigious an award. Garrigus's body, like so many

               Sex the Measure of All Things: A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey. By Jonathan
                    Gathorne-Hardy. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 2000. Pp. xi, 513. Illustrations, appendices, notes,
                    bibliography, index. $39.95.)
            Alfred C. Kinsey, whose "Kinsey Reports," Sexual Behavior in the Human
                        Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), made Indiana
                    University into a center for research on human sexual behavior, was a controversial figure in the
                    1950s because of his outspoken challenges to official codes of sexual conduct. His success depended
                    upon staunch support from Indiana University president Herman B Wells and the financial backing of
                    the National Research Council and the Rockefeller Foundation. Voted "Hoosier of the
                    Year" by the Sons of Indiana in 1954, Kinsey convinced leading scientists that human sexual
                    behavior could and should be studied scientifically and that the results should inform discussion of
                    public policy. At the end of the twentieth century, however, Kinsey remains a polarizing symbol. He
                    has become the patron saint of gay liberation for his outspoken defense of homosexual acts and, in
                    turn, is demonized by Christian fundamentalists as a sexual predator who used the cloak of science
                    to legitimate personal misconduct.
            Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy's biography of Kinsey, first published in Great Britain in 1998,
                    reflects the contemporary struggles to expropriate Kinsey for service in our culture wars.
                    Apparently Gathorne-Hardy's goal is to explain and defend a "great man"
                    whose work remains the best that we have on human sexual behavior. Following in the wake of James H.
                    Jones's deeply researched Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public l Private Life
                    (1997), Gathorne-Hardy has few facts to add to the record, but he seeks to counter scholars who have
                    written about Kinsey and failed to appreciate him with adequate enthusiasm. The result is a chatty
                    biography in which the narrative is often interrupted both by critiques of Jones and Paul Robinson
                    (whose The Modernization of Sex [1989] included an interpretation of Kinsey) and
                    by amateurish forays into the philosophy of science. Gathorne-Hardy's case for Kinsey is
                    strong on some issues, including Kinsey's methodology and the place of his increasingly
                    compulsive personal sexual conduct within his research, but the argument is weak on the
                    institutional and social contexts that Jones carefully explains and that are essential to this
                    story.
            Gathorne-Hardy justifies another long biography of Kinsey by claiming that "Jones'
                    Kinsey was a man appallingly warped and distorted, driven by vicious personal
                    'demons,' to such a degree and in so many ways that eventually he almost ceased to
                    be a moral being, and largely ceased to be an objective researcher, his data
                    'skewed' and 'flawed' to such an extent that, in effect,
                    essential parts of his  science were fraudulent" (p.
                    viii). However, Gathorne-Hardy's "totally different Kinsey" is basically
                    the same man as the one portrayed by Jones. Jones certainly tried to make clear his respect both for
                    Kinsey the pioneer sex researcher and for the man whose "great accomplishment was to take
                    his pain and suffering and use it to transform himself into an instrument of social reform
                    …." (Jones, p. 772). Gathorne-Hardy is clearly more sympathetic to the private
                    Kinsey whose homosexual and masochistic acts posed dangers for his research project and ultimately
                    his health, but that special empathy is a poor substitute for the critical perspective that Kinsey
                    commands as one of the modern world's most important advocates of sexual reform.

               Henry Clay the Lawyer. By Maurice G. Baxter. (

                    : University Press of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 2000. Pp. x, 141. Appendix, notes, selected bibliography, index. $24.95.)
            This is a slim monograph and properly so, for there is not much to be said for Henry Clay's
                    legal career. He practiced intermittently in 
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               , from 1798
                    to 1852, dealing mostly with routine land disputes and debt collection. Though he was a skilled
                    practitioner who won a number of cases in the state and federal courts, it does not appear from
                    these pages that he trained any lawyers in his office or made much of an impression during his brief
                    stint as a lecturer on law at Transylvania University. Nor did he achieve distinction as a legal
                    writer or expositor of the Constitution. His greatest claim to fame as a lawyer probably rests on
                    his victories in the Supreme Court in four landmark constitutional cases—Osborn v. Bank of U.S. (18241, Ogden v. Saunders (1827),
                        Briscoe v. Bank of 
                            Kentucky
                        
                (1837), and Groves v. Slaughter (1841).
            In truth, 
                        Clay
                     was a consummate politician who did not much enjoy lawyering, let alone the science of
                    law. Maurice G. Baxter does not pinpoint the dates, but between 1812 and 1820, and again from 1825
                    to 1829, 
                        Clay
                     abandoned the practice of law. When he left his post as secretary of state in 1829, he
                    remarked that he was determined "not to return to the practice of my old profession, and
                    nothing but necessity will compel me to put on the harness again" (p. 12611). Always
                    "interested in his remuneration" (p. 109) as Baxter kindly puts it, 
                        Clay
                     continued to dabble in law after returning to Congress, "though compared with
                    the incomes of other prominent lawyers, his remuneration was modest" (p. 59). In his last
                    letter to his wife, which epitomizes his mercenary zeal for the law, he proudly reported that he had
                    received a handsome fee of $2,500 for winning a case in the Supreme Court.
            
            In general, 
                        Clay
                    's legal career, like his political one, was marked by inconsistencies and
                    compromises of principle. His flipflops on the central question of states' rights during
                    the early nineteenth century is one of many examples cited by the author. Throughout his life, 
                        Clay
                     often declared his allegiance to the 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Virginia
                     Resolutions of 1798, which called for strict interpretation of the Constitution and
                    limited government and affirmed the coequal right of the states to expound the Constitution and
                    challenge the constitutionality of federal laws. 
                        Clay
                     was nevertheless the chief architect of the American System that relied upon a broad
                    interpretation of the commerce clause and advocated internal improvements, protective tariffs, and
                    national banks. In the Osborn case, which involved the question whether 
                        Ohio
                     could tax branches of the 
                        United States
                     Bank, the 
                        Ohio
                     legislature, supported by Indiana, 
                  Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Virginia
               , and 
                        Georgia
                     repudiated the Supreme Court's famous ruling in McCulloch v.
                        
                        
                            Maryland
                        
                     (1819) forbidding such taxes, and cited the 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Virginia
                     Resolutions as authority. 
                        Clay
                    , later joined by Daniel Webster, represented the Bank of the 
                        United States
                     to defeat 
                        Ohio
                    's claim that it had a coequal right to interpret the fundamental law.
            Though repetitive at times, the author has given us a readable and informative account of 
                        Clay
                    's law practice. It is unfortunate, however, that he did not integrate 
                        Clay
                    's legal activities more fully into the broader spectrum of his political and
                    constitutional policies as a member of Congress. This would have added interest and meaning to the
                    subject.

            Robert Owen's communitarian experiment at 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, (1824-1828) attracted a wide variety of participants. Most historically
                    significant were the scientists and educators led by William Maclure, an early nineteenth-century
                    philanthropist and pioneer in natural science and education. Among Maclure's scientists
                    were Thomas Say, Gerard Troost, and Charles-Alexandre Lesueur. Currently, these individuals have
                    been relegated to secondary or minor roles in mainstream American history. Lesueur deserves more
                    than a brief historical notation. His work in archaeology and natural  science, extending well beyond 
                        New Harmony
                    , helped to lay the foundations of scientific research in both Europe and America.
            Josephine Mirabella Elliott and Jane Thompson Johansen examine the life and work of Lesueur
                    (1778-1846), a many-faceted archaeologist, geologist, zoologist, ichthyologist, ornithologist,
                    lithographer, and artist. They craft a narrative and visual portrait of Lesueur through biography, a
                    summary of his work as a natural scientist, excerpts from his letters and notes, and very
                    importantly, through his artistic sketches, drawings, and scientific plates. Their research has been
                    truly trans-Atlantic, ranging from 
                        New Harmony
                     to Le Havre, 
                        France
                    , where Lesueur was curator of the natural history museum.
            The book is divided into four sections. Part I, a biographical sketch, begins with Lesueur's
                    first expedition, a voyage to 
                        Australia
                     in 1800 commissioned by Napoleon, which resulted in an extensive collection of
                    scientific specimens and a publication on Australian ethnography and natural science. In 1815 he
                    accompanied Maclure on expeditions to the West Indies and the Great Lakes. Active in the 
                        Philadelphia
                     Academy of Natural Sciences, Lesueur joined Maclure's scientists and educators
                    at Owen's community at 
                        New Harmony
                     in 1825. He returned to 
                        France
                     in 1837 and became curator of the museum at Le Havre in 1846.
            Part II examines Lesueur as a pioneering archaeologist. His field studies unearthed collections of
                    artifacts, many of which were sent to Le Havre. A skilled artist, Lesueur's sketches
                    illustrated his archaeological discoveries in natural science, especially ichthyology. Resembling a
                    museum catalog, this section provides a framework for further research on Lesueur as an
                    archaeologist.
            Excerpts from Lesueur's research notes and letters to Maclure and other associates, in Part
                    III, offer insights into Lesueur's dedication to his work. A sensitive observer of the
                    plight of the Native Americans, Lesueur observed that "Civilization should have made
                    friends of them, but civilization is still enveloped in this mantle of barbarism
                    …" (p. 19).
            Part IV consists of forty-seven plates and illustrations, most of which are Lesueur's
                    drawings and lithographs. An extensive bibliography lists important manuscript collections and
                    sources on Lesueur.
            Elliott and Johansen succeed in moving their subject into the mainstream, especially in the history
                    of natural science. Indeed, Elliott, who is the definitive historian of the Maclure period at 
                        New Harmony
                    , again accomplishes her objective of moving 
                        New Harmony
                    's notables into a larger historical perspective. Elliott's and
                    Johansen's well-designed and beautifully illustrated volume gives Lesueur a larger place in
                    historical memory.

            Published in conjunction with the Osnabrück- and Quakenbrück-sponsored exhibit
                    by the same title, this attractively illustrated bilingual hardcover book is a welcome addition to
                    the literature on nineteenth-century German immigration to the 
                        United States
                    . Next to Baden, Wurttemberg, and Hesse, the German Northwest with its
                    Osnabrücker Land provided a major share of immigrants to Indiana.
            Peter Marschalck of the Institute for Migration Research and Intercultural Studies at the University
                    of Osnabrück contributes the opening chapter on "Population and Social
                    Structure." In it the human conditions, especially of the lower strata, are related to
                    economic developments in post-Napoleonic times, presenting a number of causes for massive
                    emigration. In Tecklenburg County, e.g., some 2,900 persons left for America "between 1832
                    and 1848, about one third of those without the consent of the authorities" (pp. 21-22).
                    Those with little familiarity with peculiar northwest German socioeconomic terminology will benefit
                    from the translation of words such as Heuerleute (poor tenant farmers), Colonen (farm proprietors), Hollandgängerei (seasonal
                    migration work in Holland), and others.
            Birgit Nolte-Schuster, a social historian at the University of Osnabrück, who developed
                    the concepts for the permanent exhibit on "Heuerleute und Farmer" and the travel
                    exhibit on "Amerika uber 
                        Bremen
                    ," writes the chapter on "Ships and Agents." In it she
                    describes the means of transportation to America, roles and types of legal and illegal agents,
                    governmental regulations, hidden agendas of communities supporting poor or undesirable
                    emigrants' passages, and the price tags for different accommodations, a fine travel
                    supplement to the history of the emigration of families.
            Immigration historian Walter Kamphoefner contributes a chapter entitled "Chain Migration,
                    Settlement Patterns, Integration" that reflects his long scholarly interest in German
                    migration. While new settlers quickly adapted to proven American building and farming practices, for
                    quite some time their interaction with Anglo-Americans was mainly economic rather than social. Among
                    northwest Germans ethnic cohesion continued for the first three generations through homogenous
                    settlement and the retention of cultural and religious heritage by maintaining German-language
                    churches and parochial schools well beyond World War I. In 
                        Missouri
                     and elsewhere it is not uncommon to still hear Plattdeutsch (Low
                    German) spoken in the fifth generation.
            
            The last part of this volume is the nicely illustrated biography of an emigrant: "From
                    Gehrde to 
                        New York
                    —and back," adding a concrete family case showing the hopes, joys,
                    and sorrows of migration. The volume achieves a fine balance of scholarship and readability. It is
                    well suited for the genealogy section of public libraries.

            The familiar images of "Bleeding 
                        Kansas
                    ," black slaves in chains, whippings and psychological abuse, and the beating
                    of Charles Sumner by Preston Brooks on the floor of the Senate chambers have all underscored the
                    extent to which violence characterized the struggle over slavery in the 
                        United States
                     between the 1830s and the outbreak of the Civil War. John Brown has served as the
                    dramatic symbol of those abolitionists who resorted to violence. Until recently, Brown has stood as
                    an anomaly within a movement that has historically been largely perceived as nonviolent. Less well
                    understood, therefore, is how many abolitionists, white and black, male and female, accepted
                    violence as a legitimate antislavery tactic.
            In this collection of essays, historians explore various manifestations of violent antislavery action
                    by whites, slaves, former slaves, and free blacks from the late eighteenth century to 1860. In so
                    doing, they challenge the prevailing myth that the movement was primarily a pacifist crusade until
                    the 1850s, the height of antislavery militancy. The book is divided into two parts. Part one
                    examines efforts by blacks, both slave and free, to use violence as a means of resistance to
                    slavery. Such action ranged from slave revolts to the participation of free blacks in vigilance
                    committees, which were organized after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850 to combat
                    fugitive slave recapture and the kidnapping of blacks. Part two illustrates the various dimensions
                    of white abolitionists' use of violence. Radical white men like Joshua Giddings and Charles
                    Sumner, for example, used their positions as politicians to engage, enrage, and embattle proslavery
                    representatives on the floor of Congress, an opportunity that was denied to all women, most
                    rank-and-file white male abolitionists, and even the best-known black abolitionist men like
                    Frederick Douglass. Other essays in this section illustrate how white abolitionists'
                    discussions over the most effective antislavery tactics were part of a much broader debate about
                    American cultural identity, which included such issues as Christian evangelicalism and  American norms of masculinity and femininity. That these issues took on
                    regional dimensions, as reflected in the conflict between southern honor and Yankee evangelical
                    conscience (p. 168) in the Congress and in the small towns in the Western Reserve, underscores how
                    much antislavery violence reflected sectional strife over what would constitute
                    "American" institutions and cultural values.
            Given the complexity of abolitionist violence, then, it is surprising that the book is organized into
                    two sections, based upon racial difference, especially given that one of the stated points of the
                    book is to break away from the tendency of historians to assume "irreducible differences
                    between black and white abolitionists" (p. 2). While illustrative of distinctive
                    experiences of black and white men and women in the movement, the editors' decision to
                    divide the book along racial lines unfortunately masks what the essays themselves
                    reveal—that abolitionists were engaged in an intense internal struggle over the use of
                    violence as a tactic at the same time that they negotiated race and gender relations and prevailing
                    conceptions of masculinity and femininity. These themes run through the entire collection and
                    clearly challenge the organizational structure of the book. John Stauffer's essay, for
                    example, seems out of place in part two, a section devoted to white abolitionist activities. This
                    study goes beyond the black/white dichotomy that has characterized studies of abolitionism by
                    illustrating the ways that both black and white abolitionists deployed prevailing images of native
                    peoples as savages in order to justify violent antislavery action.
            
               Antislavery Violence provides the reader with a broader understanding of the
                    various forms of violent antislavery activism, the particular ways in which blacks and whites
                    participated, and the geographic scope of that activism. Like any good anthology, it is also packed
                    with themes that inspire further study, as historians continue to bring clarity to both the history
                    of U.S. abolitionism and the nineteenth century.

               The Union Image: Popular Prints of the Civil War North. By Mark E. Neely, Jr.,
                    and Harold Holzer. (
                        Chapel Hill
                    : University of 
                        North Carolina
                     Press, 2000. Pp. 266. Illustrations, notes, index. $45.00.
            The Union went to war in 1861 armed not only with bullets and bayonets but with popular prints.
                    Prints fell between oil painting, which enjoyed special cachet as an elite medium, and photography,
                    which still wore the attraction of novelty. Printmaking, as Mark E.  Neely, Jr., and Harold Holzer demonstrate, traded in cheap
                    sentimentality and vast marketability and concentrated more on shaping events to the moral
                    expectations of the purchaser than in transcribing an accurate historical record.
            But at the same time, prints succeeded in encoding a record of popular culture. Based on Robert
                    Philippe's Political Graphics: Art as a Weapon (1980), Neely and Holzer
                    observe that "what popular prints illustrate is not events or personalities but the popular
                    culture of the times" (p. 17). This is particularly clear in prints devoted to the two
                    themes that dominated the Civil War experience—patriotism and domesticity (the wife
                    surrenders the husband to enlistment, the heroic soldier carries the flag in pursuit of the
                    disheartened rebels, the widowed mother and the orphaned children endure loss, the angelic nurse
                    restores the wounded, the joyful party greets the returning soldier). In that sense, these prints
                    are relentlessly hortatory in nature. As we know from other studies of the Civil War homefront, it
                    was the decay and dissolution of precisely the stereotypes the prints celebrated that was most
                    greatly feared. Although Neely and Holzer fail to make the point, what actually lies behind many of
                    these boisterously assertive prints is an uneasiness that the sentimental ideals the printmakers
                    promoted were threatened by the war.
            Neely and Holzer are at their strongest in sorting the prints and printmakers into the various genres
                    that constitute the bulk of Civil War print productions. Certainly the largest category of prints is
                    portraiture. In addition to print portraits, Holzer and Neely also deal effectively with 1864
                    electoral campaign cartoon prints; the great prints on army life which emerged from the work of J.
                    Nep Roesler, Winslow Homer, Alfred Matthews, and Edwin Forbes; and the increasing inclusion by 1865
                    of African-Americans in what had previously been all-white scenarios. Ultimately, the most
                    successful of all Civil War prints were the postwar chromolithographs, which began to utilize color.
                    The chromolithographs, especially the Louis Prang series, which employed Julian Davidson and Thure
                    de Thulstrup as artists, were some of the most impressive pieces of combat art to emerge from the
                    Civil War experience.
            This is, in every way, a lovely book. The illustrations and plates are beautifully reproduced, and
                    the essays are invariably perceptive and detailed. As difficult as it was for Neely and Holzer to
                    outdo themselves after producing such landmark collections of Civil War iconography as The Lincoln Image (1984), The Confederate Image (1987), and Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory (1991), they have nevertheless succeeded here once more.

            In this social-demographic history, Walter Nugent tells "how the West got its people: why
                    they came and mostly stayed." He describes "the myths, ideals, and
                    dreams" of the West in a narrative that runs from prehistoric times to the present (p.
                    xviii). Admitting that the location of the American "West" is a matter of
                    definition, Nugent defines the West as the "Plains-to-Pacific West, the census's
                    West plus the Great Plains" (p. 17). He also describes five basic "motivators of
                    migration to the West." The first of these was land hunger, typified in the American
                    experience by the "Homestead Ideal" or "Agrarian Myth." In
                    addition was the desire to find and exploit a "valuable resource." Other migrants
                    sought a "better quality of life." Less potent but still powerful has been
                    nostalgia, a lure for the back-tracker and also for those who associate the West with romance, the
                    alleged traits of the cowboy, and with other colorful western types. "Most historically
                    universal of all," argues Nugent, was the desire for self- and family improvement (pp.
                    4-6).
            Nugent presents his narrative in chapters two through nine, breaking them chronologically at 1848,
                    1889, 1913, 1929, 1941, 1965, and 1987. In chapter two he surveys demographic trends in the American
                    West from the prehistoric era until 1848. He follows with an examination of the
                    "capture" of the West by Americans, organizing the chapter around the gold rush
                    era, the agricultural settlement frontiers, the unique 
                        California
                     experience, and the emergence of an urban West. Chapters covering the years of the late
                    nineteenth-century depression and the "golden twilight of the settlement frontier"
                    bring the story to 1913. Tourism, settlement stories, and population flows from Mexico are the most
                    notable elements in his account of the years from the latter date to 1929. Next come chapters on the
                    Dust Bowl and Great Depression years and on World War II, the baby boom, and the demographic
                    elements and social conditions that led to the uprising in the Watts area of metropolitan 
                        Los Angeles
                    . In chapter nine Nugent chronicles the collapse of the baby boom, the Immigration Act
                    of 1965, the role of counter cultures, environmental issues, and the impact of metropolitan society
                    on demographic developments. He concludes the book with a chapter focusing on the years 1987-1998,
                    in which he discusses current and possible demographic trends, the Immigration Act of 1986, and the
                    faded blooms of the 
                        California
                     rose, also venturing some postmillennial projections.
            In his chapters, Nugent describes population flows and trends ranging from massive to minute, relates
                    them to national, regional, and sometimes local, economic and social developments, takes the reader
                    in most chapters on a regional tour to illustrate the demographic developments of the years under
                    study, and leavens his  narrative with many thumbnail sketches
                    of movers and leavers, winners and losers. The narrative is multicultural, and the reader usually
                    finds something new or fresh in Nugent's accounts of even the more familiar stories of
                    western people—the Dust Bowl migration, the baby boom, or the forced migration of Native
                    Americans. As in his treatment of Filipino repatriation, he incorporates many less well-known
                    aspects of western population history in his narrative. The demographic theory component is
                    unobtrusive in this book, but Nugent obviously has a sophisticated understanding of it. Demographers
                    sometimes produce exquisitely dull prose. Not so Nugent, however; his clear text, sprinkled with his
                    personal experiences, sardonic opinions, and turns of speech, successfully counters the impact of
                    the great many numbers in the book. Perhaps fancy ran too free when he compared the railroad
                    companies' practice of establishing station hamlets along its lines to the activities of a
                    "great ambulant egg-laying duck." This, however, is a very readable volume that
                    also includes comprehensive but concise documentation (p. 147).
            In sum, Into the West is a magnificent book. Anyone interested in American history,
                    whether teacher or general reader, should have a copy on the office or family bookshelf.

               Mark Twain: A Literary Life. By Everett Emerson. (

            Everett Emerson has written books on Mark Twain and other American literary figures, and he is the
                    founder of the Mark Twain Circle of America. Emerson writes with an understanding of Samuel
                    Clemens's life as Mark Twain that only a scholar who has lived with this enigmatic man for
                    years can interpret and successfully convey to readers.
            Emerson first published a literary look at Mark Twain's life in 1984, The
                        Authentic Mark Twain. In this new volume he continues this investigation of how
                    Twain's writings reflect his private life. Twain liked to say that biography was but
                    "the clothes and buttons" of the man, for he felt that no true biography of a
                    person could be written. Emerson shows that biography consists of the writings of the man or, as he
                    says in the preface, "The assumption behind this book is that one can understand virtually
                    all of Mark Twain's works better if one can read them in their biographical
                    context" (p. ix).
            What goes on in authors' lives spills over into their literary works. Emerson has done his
                    research in the mountainous volumes of writings left by Twain—the letters, notes,
                    published and unpublished manuscripts. He lets Clemens, and thus Twain, tell his life's
                    story in his own words.
            
            Emerson accurately points out that this most beloved American writer and humorist is not always the
                    Twain that America has embraced as its own. In good American fashion, Clemens was a contradiction
                    and, ultimately, a man who kept reinventing himself. Born in a log cabin to a poor family, he grew
                    up in a Missouri river town which supplied him with characters and incidents
                    for his writing career. He was a typesetter, river pilot, prospector, journalist, and lecturer
                    before he became a writer of fiction. In his later life, in his quest to fulfill his American dream
                    of being rich, he was also a publisher and an investor. He married wealthy, refined Olivia Langdon
                    of Elmira, 
                        New York
                    , and chose to live in 
                  Hartford, Connecticut
               , often in a fashion above his means.
                    When money pressures got too great, he went to Europe to save on expenses and to find inspiration
                    for the books that sold best during his lifetime, his travelogues.
            Clemens would probably be amused that he continues to be talked of, written about, read, and that he
                    can still stir up controversy. He would be pleased that scholars such as Emerson go back to his own
                    words as a source of the truth about his life.

            One of the most significant population movements in midwestern history was the migration of white
                    southerners to the Great Lakes states during the twentieth century. Some histories have touched on
                    this subject, but Southern Migrants, Northern Exiles is the first attempt to offer
                    a book-length account of the phenomenon. The grandson of southern migrants to Indiana, 
                        Chad
                     Berry offers a sympathetic and insightful study of the northward movement and its
                    consequences. Believing that the migration story needed to be told from the viewpoint of the
                    migrants themselves, Berry conducted a long list of interviews, and he quotes at length from these
                    personal reminiscences. Some may take exception to the subjectivity of this approach, but none can
                    legitimately deny that Berry's study admirably illuminates a major development in the
                    history of Indiana and adjoining states.
            Berry begins by discussing the World War I era and the 1920s, when the first wave of white migrants
                    came north to find jobs in the booming factories of the Midwest. During this period and later
                    decades, the appeal of the industrial Midwest was economic. Southerners sought better-paying jobs
                    and found them in Akron, Flint, 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and 
                        Muncie
                    . Yet they also suffered homesickness, and this yearning to return home is a persistent
                    theme in Berry's book. Despite  good wages in the
                    North, many lonely and disenchanted whites returned to the South either temporarily or permanently.
            During the early 1930s many more returned home, as the Great Depression reduced the supply of jobs,
                    the Midwest's chief attraction. By the late 1930s, however, the northward migration of
                    white southerners resumed and accelerated during World War II and the postwar period of prosperity,
                    reaching a peak in the 1950s. In the process, southern whites transplanted much of their culture in
                    northern communities. Berry specifically considers the transplantation of southern religious and
                    musical culture, discussing the rise of the Southern Baptist Church north of the Ohio
                        River and the importance of country and western music in the lives of the newcomers
                    to the Midwest.
            Berry finds that throughout these years prejudice against the migrants was widespread, spawning
                    negative stereotypes regarding the supposed ignorance, poverty, and violence of southern whites. As
                    the elimination of poverty rose to a place of prominence on the national agenda during the 1960s,
                    well-meaning social scientists and social welfare agencies reinforced these stereotypes when they
                    focused new attention on the hillbilly ghettoes of midwestern cities. Berry, however, emphasizes
                    that white southern migrants, though largely blue collar, were not necessarily poor. Instead, he
                    contends that most of them achieved their economic goals and found relative prosperity in their new
                    homes. Yet, not all wanted to remain in 
                        Ohio
                    , Indiana, 
                        Michigan
                    , or 
                        Illinois
                     for the rest of their lives. Thus Berry concludes with a short discussion of those who
                    returned to the South after retirement. By the end of Berry's book, however, the reader is
                    aware that even the white migrants who returned to the South left their mark on the history of the
                    Midwest.

            The Kerner Report will insure that the name of Otto Kerner will not be forgotten. The report remains
                    a seminal statement on American race relations more than thirty years after its release. Yet it is
                    striking how little Americans—even most American historians—know about Kerner,
                    the governor of 
                        Illinois
                     from 1961 to 1968 and the chairman of the commission that prepared the famous report.
            Bill Barnhart and Gene Schlickman have helped repair this deficiency with their new biography, the
                    first full study of this significant politician. Theirs is a sympathetic portrait, covering the  important phases of his life but ultimately fixated on
                    explaining the sad conclusion of his public career.
            Kerner, Barnhart and Schlickman show, was a reluctant politician despite familial advantages. He was
                    born in 1908 into the Czech community in 
                        Chicago
                    . His father, a lawyer on the rise, served as an alderman before ultimately gaining an
                    appointment as a federal judge. In 1934, Otto, Jr., married the youngest daughter of Anton Cermak,
                    the late mayor of 
                        Chicago
                     and architect of the city's modern Democratic party organization.
            The polished young Kerner—educated at 
                        Brown
                     University and Northwestern University Law School—was, however, more
                    interested in the 
                        Illinois
                     National Guard than in 
                        Illinois
                     politics. His service in the guard led to a commission in the army during World War II.
                    He saw action in North Africa, Sicily, and the Pacific theater.
            During the war, Kerner impressed Jacob Arvey, his commanding officer in the guard and a leader in the
                    Cook County Democratic Party, who encouraged the decorated veteran's entrance into state
                    politics. Kerner's vote-getting ability attracted the attention of Richard Daley, who
                    successfully backed Kerner as the Democratic nominee for governor in 1960.
            At this point, Barnhart and Schlickman back away from a chronological approach and feature
                    Kerner's most notable work as governor: mental health reform, death penalty commutations,
                    open housing issues, and the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders that produced the
                    Kerner Report. This informative topical approach reveals much about public policy in a midwestern
                    state in the 1960s, but it does not produce a comprehensive evaluation of Kerner's two
                    terms as governor.
            The most distinctive feature of this biography is its extensive examination of the context of
                    Kerner's conviction for fraud and other charges in 1973 while he was a federal judge. The
                    history of corruption in 
                        Chicago
                    , the horse racing scene in 
                        Illinois
                    , the rising power of the Internal Revenue Service, the growing distrust of public
                    officials in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and much more are covered in great detail.
            Barnhart and Schlickman argue that Kerner's conviction was unfair and that it would have
                    been overturned had he lived longer. (He died of cancer in 1976 not long after his release from
                    prison.) Their brief is persuasive, but even at the end of this thoroughly researched biography
                    based on dozens of interviews and manuscript collections, Kerner's inept defense against
                    federal charges is striking. This points to a characteristic of this study: though it will likely be
                    the definitive biography of the 
                        Illinois
                     politician, the inner Kerner remains elusive.
