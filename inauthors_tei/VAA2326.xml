                <p TEIform="p">THIS little book is not supposed to contain any new information. It is made up of plain
                    observations concerning people who live just around the corner. If the reader will bear in mind that
                        <hi rend="i" TEIform="hi">only</hi> the people who live around the corner are discussed in this
                    volume, there will be no chance for painful misunderstandings. I have no desire to rub the wrong way
                    anyone who proves his true friendship by purchasing a copy of this Work. It may be advisable to
                    explain that these Fables are written in the colloquial American language. The vocabulary employed
                    is one that has become familiar to the ear, although it is seldom seen on the printed page. In other
                    words, this volume contains a shameless amount of slang. If any part of it is unintelligible to the
                    reader, he should be glad that he has escaped what seems to be an epidemic.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">ONCE there was an Indian who had a Way of putting on all his Feathers and breaking out of
                    the Reservation. For three Weeks at a Stretch he gave a Correct Imitation of the Shining Light who
                    passes he Basket and superintends the Repairs on the Parsonage. He was entitled to a Mark of 100 or
                    Deportment. With his Meals he drank a little Polly. After Dinner he smoked one Perfecto and then,
                    when he had put in a frolicsome Hour or so with the North American Review, he crawled into the Hay
                    at 9.30 P.M.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At last he accumulated a Sense of Virtue hat was hard to carry around. He was proud of
                    himself when he counted up the number of &apos;days during which he had stuck to the Straight
                    and Narrow. It seemed to him that he deserved a Reward. So he decided to buy himself a little
                    Present, something costing about 15 cents. He picked out a First-Class Place <pb id="VAA2326-009"
                        n="14" TEIform="pb"/> where they had Electric Fans and Pictures by the Old Masters. He poured
                    out a Working-man&apos;s Sizethe kind that makes the Barkeep stop wiping up and look unfriendly
                    for a Moment or two.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Then he remembered that a Bird cannot fly with one Wing, so he gently raised the Index
                    Finger and gave the Prescription Clerk a Look, which in the Sign Language means, &quot;Repeat
                    the Dose.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">It is an Historical Fact that when a Mas falls backward from the Water Wagon he always
                    lands in a Crowd. The full Stage Setting, the Light Effects and the Red Fire were all ready to make
                    it a Spectacular Affair. Just after he had mowed away No. 2 and had stopped worrying about the
                    Winter&apos;s Coal, he began to meet Friends who were dying of Thirst. Then the atmosphere began
                    to be curdled with High Balls and Plymouth Sours and Mint Smashes, and he was telling a Shoe Drummer
                    that a lot of People who had been knocking him would probably be working for him before the Year was
                    out.</p>

                    something out of Whack with the Steering Gear, for instead of bringing up at his Hoarding House he
                    found himself at another Rum Parlor. The Man who owned the Place had lost the Key and could not lock
                    up. Here he met several Delegates to a State Convention of a Fraternal Order having for its Purpose
                    the uplifting of Mankind. They wore Blue Badges and were fighting to get their Money into the Cash
                    Register. In a little while he and a red-headed Delegate were up by the Cigar Counter singing,
                    &quot;How can bear to leave thee?&quot; He put in an Application for Membership and then the
                    next Picture that came out of the Fog was a Chop Suey Restaurant and everybody breaking Dishes.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Soon after, the Lights went out and when he came back to Earth he was lying the wrong way
                    of his Bed with Blue Badges all over him, trying to swallow a Bath Towel, which he afterward
                    discovered was his Tongue. By getting <pb id="VAA2326-012" n="[17]" TEIform="pb"/>

                    then he sat on the edge of the Bed and called himself Names. He had nothing left over except the
                    Cards given to him by the Brothers from up State somewhere. He had a dim and sneaking Recollection
                    that he had given his address and Phone Number to the whole Tribe and begged them to look him up.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Not any more in Mine,&quot; said he, as he held a Towel under the

                    Trouble. I wonder if I&apos;ll live through the Morning.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">That, Day he lived on Bromo and Ice, and the only Satisfaction this Life offered was the
                    Fact that he was a Reformed Man.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">On the Second Day he could look at Solid Food without having a Spasm. His Hair stopped
                    pulling and he began to speak to the People he met. When asked to step out for a little while, he
                    lost his Temper and made a little Talk on the Subject, proving conclusively that there was Nothing
                    in it.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Why can&apos;t they pass it up, the same as I do?&quot; he asked

                <p TEIform="p">It was an actual Mystery to him that any one could dally with a Dry Martini while there
                    was a Hydrant on every Corner.</p>

                    him. And he said it was a Queer Thing, but he couldn&apos;t bear the Sight of it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">While on the fourth Evening he confessed to some nice People he met at a Church Social
                    that at one time he had allowed himself to he be coaxed into taking an occasional Nip but he
                    reasoned it all out and decided it was a Bad Thing and simply Chopped it right off. They told him it
                    was wonderful how much Will Power he had and asked him if he ever felt the Old Craving coming back
                    on him, and <pb id="VAA2326-016" n="21" TEIform="pb"/> he said he could see it splashing all around
                    him and not have the faintest Desire to dip in.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He was so stuck on himself that he went around to call on all his Friends who kept it on
                    the Table so that he could wave it to one side and tell how he despised it. He sat there and pitied
                    those who were inhaling it. Every Morning when he arose he would throw kisses to himself in the
                    Glass and exclaim: &quot;Aha! The Head as clear as a Bell this A.M. I&apos;ll bet
                    I&apos;m the cleanest and nicest Young Fellow in this Town. Any Girl that picks out a Sober and

                <p TEIform="p">As Narrated at the Beginning, for three weeks he worked hard at the Job of being an
                    Abstainer. And at last he accumulated a Sense of Virtue that weighed over 200 Pounds. He knew that
                    he was entitled to a Reward, so he decided to buy himself a little Present. Just a wee Reminder of
                    by-gone Days and then back to Sarsaparilla. But he fell into a Crowd. There was another State

                    invariably was first over the Fence in the Mad Pursuit of Culture. She loved to fill her Front Rooms
                    with Folks who wore 7 3/4 Hats and read Norwegian Novels that no one else ever heard anything about.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">On the Evening already mentioned she had a Cluster of Geniuses on hand. They were
                    expected to Talk for a couple of Hours, so as to work up an Appetite for Neapolitan Ice-Cream and
                    Lady-Fingers. In the course of time they got around to the Topic of Modern Music. All agreed that
                    the Music which seemed to catch on with the low-browed Public was exceedingly punk. They rather
                    fancied &quot;Parsifal&quot; and were willing to concede that Vogner made good in Spots, but
                    Mascagni they branded as a Crab. As for Victor Herbert I and J. P. Sousaback to the Water-Tanks!</p>

                    have Something on the Piano. They gathered around the Stack of Music and then Vogner went into the
                    Discard and Puccini fell to the Floor unnoticed and the Classics did not get a Hand. But they gave a
                    Yelp of Joy when they spotted a dear little Cantata about a Coon who carried a Razor and had trouble
                    with his Wife. They sang the Chorus 38 times and the Young Lady wore out both Wrists doing Rag-Time.</p>

                    every Friday Afternoon. The much-mooted Question as to which does the greater Damage, Fire or Water,
                    had been carefully gone over by the Squabs. Also who was the heftier Proposition, Napoleon or
                    Washington? But the original Stand-by was as follows: &quot;Resolved, that Education is better
                    than Wealth.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Corporate Interests got many a Whack here in the Knowledge Works. Most of the
                    Children wanted to grow up and be like Galileo. They claimed that mere Wealth could not purchase
                    Happiness. The only genuine Peace of Mind came from being able to call off the Geological Periods

                    was the Boy who took the Affirmative side on Friday Afternoon. Ole firmly believed that Learning was
                    the most valuable asset that a Alan could tuck away. Brad was for the Money End of the Game, hot hen
                    he got alt to make his Talk his Vocabulary would become jammed up and caught crossways in the Flue
                    and teacher would motion lout hack to his Seat. Otis, however, could tell in well-chosen Phrases why
                    the Scholar was a better and happier Man Bum the Millionaire and so he always received the Vote of
                    the Judges.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Now, Brad was done up but unconvinced. He could not stand up before the District School
                    and tell why it was good policy to corral the Coin, but he had a secret Hunch that it would be no
                    Disgrace for him to go out and do the best he could. Brad had a bull-dog Jaw and large blood-shot
                    Hands and a Neck-Band somewhat larger than his Hat-Band. He jumped the Stockade when they started to
                    teach hint Botany. He weighed 180 and he <pb id="VAA2326-024" n="29" TEIform="pb"/> thought he was
                    too large to sit around and count the Petals of the Ox-Eve Daisy when he might be out selling
                    Lightning Rods to the Yaps and waking jug-handled Contracts. Accordingly he Dug.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Bradford is making a great Mistake,&quot; said Otis, as he saw his Friend

                    short-changing the Farmers and buying 8 per cent. Mortgages, Otis was working his way through
                    College and living on Oatmeal except on Holidays and then Primes. He was getting round-shouldered
                    and wore Specs and was all gaunted up, but he never weakened. He was pulling for the Laurel Wreath
                    of Scholarship, or in other words, the Degree. After humping it for 4 years he passed his final Exam
                    and the Faculty decided that he was a Bachelor of Arts.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">That was the Day when he had the Laugh on Brad.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In the meantime, Bradford had been choking various People and taking it away from them.

                    as Instructor in the College at a Salary of $55 a Month with a promise of $5 raise at the end of

                <p TEIform="p">Often while he was burning the Midnight Oil and grinding out Jaw-Breakers, so as to
                    qualify tin the Master&apos;s Degree, he reflected as follows: &quot;It is true that Brad is
                    making it Hand over Fist and wears $6 Shirts and rides in a State-Room on the Pullman, but he is not
                    a Bachelor of Arts. And some day when he is a Multi-Millionaire I can still look down on him, for
                    then I shall be a Master of Arts. I have known since Childhood that Education is more desirable than
                    Paltry Gold. Although the Newspapers and the General Public do not seem to he with me to any Extent,
                    it is better to hob-nob with the Binomial Theorem than to dally with the Champagne Supper.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In due time the Faculty gave the Degree of M.A. to what was left of Otis and still his
                    Ambition was not satisfied. He wanted to land a Doctor&apos;s Degree. He knew that any one who
                    aspired to this Eminent Honor had <pb id="VAA2326-028" n="33" TEIform="pb"/> to be a Pippin. But he
                    hoped that he could make some Contribution to the World of Thought that would jar the whole
                    Educational System and help him to climb to the topmost Pinnacle of Human Greatness.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Professor Otis did the Dig Act year after year. At the age of 49 he was still M.A. and
                    owned a House with a Mortgage on it. In the Meantime there had been revolutionary Changes in the
                    World of Finance. Everything on Earth had been put into a Pool. Each Smooth Citizen who had
                    something that was of no particular use to him went to work and Capitalized it. Brad closed out his
                    Interests for so much Money that any one else would have been ashamed to take it. Then he and some
                    other Buccaneers went down to Wall Street to have fun with several dignified Gentlemen whom Brad
                    described as Them Fly Eastern Mugs. They succeeded in putting the Skids under a number of Persons
                    who did not care to meet them Socially.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When Brad walked around in his Million Dollar Hut he had to step high to avoid <pb
                        id="VAA2326-029" n="34" TEIform="pb"/> stumbling over Bundles of the Long Green; but he never
                    had made any further headway with his Botany.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">It happened one Day that Brad was out Muting and he dropped in at the Colley where his
                    Boyhood Friend was now the Professor of Dipsicology and Plamazzus.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;This is a likely-looking Plant,&quot; said Brad, as he sized up the Campus.
                    &quot;I like to encourage these Joints because they help to keep a lot of Young Fellows away
                    from Business Offices. I find that I have here in my Vest Pocket a measly $50,000 that I have over
                    looked in changing my Clothes. Give it to the Main Cheese and tell him to have a Laboratory on
                    me.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When the News got out all the sis-boom-ah Boys gave a Parade in their Nighties. The
                    Faculty called a Special Meeting and made Brad a Doctor of Philosophy.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Next Year he put up for a Gym and the made him a Doctor of Divinity.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Year Following he handed them a Telescope and became an LL.D.</p>

                <head TEIform="head">The Night-Watch and the Would-Be Something Awful</head>
                <p TEIform="p">0NCE there was a full-sized Girl named Florine whose Folks kept close Tab on her. Any
                    night-blooming Harold who presumed to keep the Parlor open after Midnight heard low Voices in the
                    Hallway and then a Rap on the Door. If Florine put on her Other Dress and went to a Hop then Mother
                    would sit up and wait for her, and 1 o&apos;clock was the Outside Limit. Consequently Florine
                    would have to duck on the Festivities just when everything was getting Good. Furthermore she would
                    have to warn Mr. Escort to behave himself when they drew near the House.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Nothing doing at the Gate,&quot; she would say, warningly.
                    &quot;It&apos;s Dollars to Dumplings that the Girl Detective is peeking out to get a Line on
                    my Conduct. She has her Ear to the Ground about four-thirds of the Time and if any one makes a Move,
                    then Mother is Next. If Father takes a Drink at the Club and then <pb id="VAA2326-033" n="38"
                        TEIform="pb"/> starts Homeward on a first Trolley, Mother knows all about it when he is still
                    three Blocks from the House. What&apos;s more, she is a knowing Bird and can&apos;t be
                    fooled by Cloves or these little Peppermint Choo-Choos. The only time when Mother kisses Father is
                    when she wants to catch him with the Goods. Look Out! This is our Corner.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As soon as they had landed at the Gate, little Florin would say in loud, clear Tones that
                    would carry as far as the Sitting-Room Window, &quot;Oh, Mr. Gilblitz, I have had a most
                    charming Evening, and I wish to thank you most heartily.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Whereupon the Escort, standing 8 Feet away, with his Concertina Hat in his Hand and the
                    Face in the Moonlight beaming with child-like Innocence, would come back thusly:
                    &quot;It&apos;s awfully good of you to say that. Good Night.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After which, Mother was supposed to believe that they had been 8 feet apart all Evening.
                    But Mother was Canny and up to Snuff, with a Memory that reached back at least 25 <pb

                    not throw her off for any part of a Minute. Before Florine turned in she was Cross-Exansined and
                    required to tell with whom she had danced, and why and how often and what he said. Occasionally the
                    Daughter worked the Mental Reservation. In other Words, she held out on Mother. She said that she
                    had sat out most of the Numbers, but she admitted going through a Square Dance with the Young Man
                    who passed the Plate at the Episcopal Church.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At which Mother would wink the Off Eye and murmur, &quot;Is that no?&quot; with
                    the Loud Pedal on the &quot;That.&quot; Also something about being more than Seven.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One of Floriue&apos;s Ancestors on Mother&apos;s Side happened to be on Earth at
                    the time of the Revolution, and Father often spoke of a Second Cousin who had been in Congress until
                    the District tumbled to him. Because of this Current of Blue Blood racing in her Veins, Florine was
                    supposed to be a trifle Classy and Mother was always afraid that she might get</p>
                <pb id="VAA2326-036" n="41" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">Thumb-Marks on the Family Escutcheon. Therefore Florine was forbidden to work up a
                    Calling Acquaintance with any of the Hoi Polloi, which is Greek for Selling-Platers. According to
                    Mother, there were only about 8 Families in Town that really belonged and some of them
                    didn&apos;t Belong enough to hurt. Florine found herself cut out of many a Good Time because the
                    Chaperon for the Occasion chanced to be related to some one who had been in the Liquor Business.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Florine was up against it ever so Hard. She had to go out in the Grape Arbor when she
                    wanted to chew Gum, and she kept her Reading Matter under the Mattress. Nearly every high-speed
                    Bachelor in Town had been forbidden the Premises because of the Stories that were going around. The
                    kind that Mother approved were of the Lilac Division with White Puff Ties and their Hair glued down.
                    They talked about Choir Practice and sometimes, when they were sufficiently wrought up, they played
                    Charades.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The only Chance that Florine had to mingle <pb id="VAA2326-037" n="42" TEIform="pb"/>
                    with the Popular Boys was to go down Town in the Afternoon and just happen to meet one of them at
                    the Ice-Cream Parlor. Florine learned to be quite a Happener. But on the way home she would have to
                    fix up a few Jules Vernes for the Old Lady in the Watch Tower. Mother knew that it didn&apos;t
                    take 4 Hours to be measured for a Shirt Waist.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Wait until I get Married,&quot; Florine would say. &quot;I&apos;ll
                    make that 20-hour Flyer look like a Steam-Roller. If Mother doesn&apos;t let up on me,
                    I&apos;ll learn to smoke Cigarettes.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At times she was so Desperate that she was ready to join a Troupe or elope with a
                    Drummer. She wanted to get out among the Bright Lights and hear the Band play. And she knew that she
                    couldn&apos;t turn Flip-Flops and break Furniture and play Rag-Time along after Midnight until
                    she had become a Respectable Married Woman So she had her Distress Signal out and used to drop very
                    Broad Hints, when she was chatting with the Lads who happened to be in the Soda-Water Resort when
                    she dropped in. They liked Florine for Keeps, <pb id="VAA2326-038" n="[43]" TEIform="pb"/>

                    Eagle-Eye, the Family Sleuth, he weakened.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Florine would have remained a Dead Card if she had not gone on a Visit to a neighboring
                    City where she bumped into the Town Trifler. He had a Way of proposing to every Girl the first time
                    he met her. It always seemed to him such a cordial Send-Off for a budding Friendship. Usually the
                    Girl asked for Time and then the two of them would Fiddle around and Fuss and Make Up and finally
                    send back all the Letters and that would be the Finish Florine fooled the foxy Philander. The Moment
                    he came at her with the Marriage Talk she took a firm Hold and said, &quot;You&apos;re on!
                    Get your License tomorrow morning. Then cut all the Telegraph Wires and burn the Railroad
                    Bridges.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">They were Married, and, strange as it may appeal, Mother immediately resigned her Job as
                    Policeman and said: &quot;Thank goodness, I&apos;ve got you Married Off! Now you can do as
                    you, please.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2326-040" n="45" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">When Florine found that she could do as she pleased she discovered that there
                    wasn&apos;t very much of anything to do except Settle Down. After about seven Chafing-Dish
                    Parties she expended her whole Stock of pent-up Ginger and now she is just as Quiet as the rest of
                    us.</p>

                <head TEIform="head">The Attenuated Attorney Who Rang In the Associate Counsel</head>
                <p TEIform="p">ONCE there was a sawed-off Attorney who had studied until he was Bleary around the Eyes
                    and as lean as a Razor-Back. He knew the Law from Soup to Nuts, but much learning had put him a
                    little bit to the Willies. And his Size was against him. He lacked Bellows.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He was an inconspicuous little Runt. When he stood up to Plead, he came a trifle higher
                    than the Chair. Of the 90 pounds he carried about 45 were Gray Matter. He had Mental Merchandise to
                    burn but no way of delivering it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When there was a Rally or some other Gabfest on the Bills, the Committee never asked him
                    to make an Address. The Committee wanted a Wind-Jammer who could move the Leaves on a Tree 200 feet
                    distant. The dried up Lawyer could write Great Stuff that would charm a Bird out of a Tree, but he
                    did not have the Tubes to enable him to Spout. When <pb id="VAA2326-042" n="47" TEIform="pb"/> he
                    got up to Talk, it was all he could do to hear himself. The Juries used to go to sleep on him. He
                    needed a Megaphone. And he had about as much Personal Magnetism as an Undertaker&apos;s
                    Assistant.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Runt lost many a Case because he could not Bark at the Jury and pound Holes in a
                    Table. His Briefs had been greatly admired by the Supreme Court. Also it was known that he could
                    draw up a copper-riveted Contract that would hold Water, but as a Pleader he was a Pickerel.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At one time he had an Important Suit on hand, and he was Worried, for he was opposed by a
                    couple of living Gas Engines who could rare up and down in front of a yap Jury for further Orders.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I have the Law on my Side,&quot; said the Runt. &quot;Now if I were
                    only Six-Feet-Two with a sole-leather Thorax, I could swing the Verdict.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">While he was repining, in came a Friend of his Youth, named Jim.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">This Jim was a Book-Agent. He was as <pb id="VAA2326-043" n="48" TEIform="pb"/> big as
                    the Side of a House. He had a Voice that sounded as if it came up an Elevator Shaft. When he folded
                    his Arms and looked Solemn, he was a colossal Picture of Power in Repose. He wore a Plug Hat and a
                    Black Coat. Nature intended him for the U. S. Senate, but used up all the Material early in the Job
                    and failed to stock the Brain Cavity.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Jim had always been at the Foot of the Class in School. At the age of 40 he spelled Sure
                    with an Sh and sank in a Heap when he tried to add 8 and 7. But he was a tall Success as a Book
                    Pedler, because he learned his Piece and the 218 pounds of Dignified Superiority did the Rest.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Wherever he went, he commanded Respect He could go into a strange Hotel and sit down at
                    the Breakfast Table and say: &quot;Please pass the Syrup &quot;in a Tone that had all the
                    majestic Significance of an Official Utterance. I would sit there in silent Meditation. Those who
                    sized up that elephantine Form and noted the Gravity of his Countenance and the fluted Wrinkles on
                    his high Brow, imagined that he <pb id="VAA2326-044" n="49" TEIform="pb"/> was pondering on the
                    Immortality of the Soul. As a matter of fact, Jim was wondering whether he would take Ham or Bacon
                    with his Eggs.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Jim had the Bulk and the awe-inspiring Front. As long as he held to a Napoleonic Silence
                    he could carry out the Bluff. Little Boys tip-toed when they came near him, and Maiden Ladies sighed
                    for an introduction. Nothing but a Post-Mortem Examination would have shown Jim up in his True
                    Light. The midget Lawyer looked up in Envy at his mastodonic Acquaintance and sighed.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;If I could combine my Intellect with your Horse-Power, I would be the largest
                    Dandelion in the Legal Pasture,&quot; he said.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Then a Happy Idea struck him amidships.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Jim, I want you to be my Associate Counsel,&quot; he said. &quot;I
                    understand, of course, that you do not know the difference between a Caveat and a Caviar Sandwich,
                    but as long as you keep your Hair combed the way it is now and wear that Thoughtful Expression,
                    you&apos;re just as good as the whole Choate Family. I will introduce you as an Eminent Attorney
                    from <pb id="VAA2326-045" n="50" TEIform="pb"/> the East. I will guard the Law Points and you will
                    sit there and Dismay the Opposition by looking Wise.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So when the Case came up for Trial, the Runt led the august Jim into the Court Rod and
                    introduced him as Associate Counsel. A Murmur of Admiration ran throughout the Assemblage when Jim
                    showed his Commanding Figure, a Law Book under his Arm and a look of Heavy Responsibility on his
                    Face. Old Atlas, who carries the Globe on his Shoulders did not seem to be in it with this grand an
                    gloomy Stranger.</p>

                    Their mute and frightened Faces seemed to ask, &quot;What are we up against?&quot;</p>

                <p TEIform="p">A DOMESTIC Team had a Boy named Buchanan who refused to Work, so his Parents decided that
                    he needed a College Education. After he got that, he could enter a Learned Profession, in which Work
                    is a mere Side-issue.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Father and Mother of Buchanan sent to the College for a Bunk Catalogue. The Come-On
                    Book had a Green Cover and it was full of Information. It said that the Necessary Expenses counted
                    up about $180 a year. All Students were under helpful and moral Influences from the Moment they
                    arrived. The; were expected to hit the Mattress at 10 P.M., while Smoking was forbidden and no one
                    could go to Town except on a Special Permit.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;This is just the Place for Buchanan,&quot; said his Mother. &quot;It
                    will be such a Comfort to know that Son is in his Room every Evening.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Accordingly Buchanan was supplied with <pb id="VAA2326-050" n="55" TEIform="pb"/> six
                    Shirts, two Suits of everything, a Laundry-Bag, a Pin-Cushion, a Ready-Repair Kit and a Flesh Brush,
                    and away he rode to the Halls of Learning. He wrote back that he was Home-Sick but determined to
                    stick out because he realized the Advantages of a College Education. He said his Eyes hurt him a
                    little from Reading at Night and he had to buy a great many Extra Books, but otherwise he was fine
                    and fancy. Love to all and start a little Currency by the first Mail.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After Buchanan had been toiling up the Hill of Knowledge for nearly two Months, and
                    sending hot Bulletins back to the Old Folks, his Father decided to visit him and give him some
                    Encouragement.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;The Poor Boy must be lonesome down there among all those
                    Strangers,&apos;&quot; said Father. &quot;I&apos;ll drop in on him and brighten him
                    up.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So Father landed in the College Town and inquired for Buchanan, but no one had heard of
                    such a Person.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Perhaps you mean &apos; Old Buck,&apos;&quot; said a Pale Youth,
                    with an ingrowing Hat. &quot;If he&apos;s <pb id="VAA2326-051" n="56" TEIform="pb"/> the
                    Indian you want to see, I&apos;ll show you where he hangs out.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Proud Parent was steered to a faded Boarding House and found himself in a Chamber of
                    Horrors that seemed to be a Cross between a Junk-Shop and a Turkish Corner. Here he found the
                    College Desperado known as &quot;Old Buck,&quot; attired in a Bath-Robe, plunking a stingy
                    little Mandolin and smoking a Cigarette that smelled as if somebody had been standing too close to
                    the Stove.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Hello, Guv,&quot; said the Seeker after Truth. &quot;Wait until I do a
                    Quick Change and we&apos;ll go out and get a, few lines of Breakfast.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Breakfast at 2 P.M.?&quot; inquired Father.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;We had a very busy Night,&quot; explained Buchanan. &quot;The
                    Sophomores have disputed our Right to wear Red Neckties, so last night we captured the President of
                    the Soph Class, tied him to a Tree and beat him to a Whisper with a Ball Bat. Then we started over
                    to set fire to the Main Building and we were attacked by a Gang of Sophs. That is how I happend to

                    getting along fine.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;You are doing Great Work for a Mere Child,&quot; said the Parent.
                    &quot;If you keep on, you may be U. S. Senator some day. But tell me, where did you get all of
                    these Sign-Boards, Placards, Head-stones and other Articles of Vertu?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I swiped those,&quot; replied the Collegian. &quot;In order to be a
                    real Varsity Devil, one must bring home a few Souvenirs every Night he goes out. If the Missionaries
                    did it, it would be called Looting. If the Common People did it, it would be called Petit Larceny.
                    But with us, it is merely a Student Prank.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I understand,&quot; said Father. &quot;Nothing can be more playful than
                    to nail a Tombstone and use it for a Paper-Weight.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Would you like to look around the Institution?&quot; asked Buchanan.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2326-054" n="59" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Indeed, I should,&quot; was the Reply. &quot;Although I have been
                    denied the blessed Privileges of Higher Education, I love to get into an Atmosphere of four-ply
                    Intellectuality and meet those Souls who are above the sordid Considerations of workaday
                    Commercialism.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;You talk like a Bucket of Ashes,&quot; said the Undergraduate.
                    &quot;I&apos;m not going to put you up against any Profs. Follow me and I&apos;ll fix it
                    so that you can shake Hands with the Guy that eats &apos;em alive. I&apos;ll take you over
                    to the Corral and show you the Wild-Cats. They&apos;ve been drinking Blood all Morning and are
                    feeling good and Cagey. About 3 o&apos;clock we turn them out into the Arena and let them plow
                    up the Turf.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Is this a College or a Zoo?&quot; asked the Parent.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I refer to the Squad,&quot; said Buchanan. &quot;We keep about 40 at
                    the Training Table all of the time, so that no matter how many are killed off, we will always have
                    11 left. We have a Centre Rush who weighs 238, and you Couldn&apos;t dent him with a Hatchet. We
                    caught <pb id="VAA2326-055" n="60" TEIform="pb"/> him in the Woods north of Town and brought him
                    down here. He is taking a Special Course in Piano Music two hours a Week and the rest of the Time he
                    is throwing Substitutes down and biting them on the Arm.&quot;</p>

                    for a while. Buchanan explained that it was merely Friendly Practice.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">That Evening the Son said: &quot;Father, you can stay only a Little While and I want
                    to give you a Good Time while you are here. Come with us. We are going down to the Opera House to

                    was demanding. A few Opera Chairs were pulled I up by the Roots and tossed on the Stage, merely to
                    disconcert the Artiste. When the I House Policeman came he was hurled 80 Feet into the Air and soon
                    after that the Show broke up. The Student Body flocked out and upset a Trolley Car, and then they

                <p TEIform="p">Inasmuch as Women never came in to straighten up, he knew where to find everything. He
                    knew it was somewhere in the <pb id="VAA2326-064" n="69" TEIform="pb"/> Room and all he had to do
                    was to excavate until he found it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Then he hooked up with Laura so as to get a real Home and she gave him a new one every
                    Year.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Mr. Jump soon discovered that, although every Man is the Architect of his own Fortune,
                    the Wife usually superintends the Construction.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When Mrs. Jump made her Spring Announcement that they would move to another House, he did
                    a deal of Kicking, but he always went into the Wood Shed to do it. He sassed her inwardly, but not
                    so that she could hear.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She was a Wonder at framing up Reasons for hurling the Lease back at the Landlord.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One Year she quit because the Owner papered the Upstairs with a Jay Pattern that cost
                    only 15 cents a Bolt. Another time the Family next door kept Chickens. Usually the Children across
                    the Alley were not fit Associates for their own little Brood.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One Time she quit on account of a Cockroach. She saw it scoot across the Pantry [69] <pb
                        id="VAA2326-065" n="70" TEIform="pb"/> and that afternoon she headed for a Renting Agency.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Father suggested that instead of vacating in favor of the Cockroach, they offer a reward
                    of $100 for its Capture, dead or alive, and thereby save a little Money, but she refused to listen.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">If the Plumbing wasn&apos;t out of Whack, the Furnace required too much Coal or else
                    the Woman across the Street had been divorced too many times.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">If they squatted in a low-down Neighborhood, Mrs. Jump was ashamed to give her Address to
                    Friends in the Congregation.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">If they got into a Nest of the New Rich, then Laura had the freeze-out worked on her,
                    because Mr. Jump was on a Salary and she had to ride on the Trolleys. So she began looking for a
                    Street in which Intellect would successfully stack up against the good, old Collateral. And, of
                    course, that meant a long Search.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Therefore, every May 1st, something Red and about the size of a Caboose backed up to the
                    Jumps&apos;. Several husky Boys began throwing Things out of the Windows.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2326-066" n="71" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">Father did a Vanishing Act. When it came to lifting one corner of a Piano or hanging
                    Pictures he was a sad Bluff and he knew it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;How about Paradise?&quot; he asked one day. &quot;I understand that
                    inside of the Pearly Gates, each Family has Permanent Quarters. There are no Folding Beds to juggle
                    down Back Stairways, no Picture Cords to Shorten, no Curtain Poles to saw off, no Book Cases to get
                    jammed in Stairways. I am sure there will be no Piano Movers, for I have heard their Language. Do
                    you think you can be happy in the Promised Land?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;It will depend entirely on whether or not the Rugs fit,&quot; she replied.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Let us hope for the Best,&quot; said Mr. Jump.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">ONE Morning an energetic little Man who had about a Ton of Work piled up on his Desk came
                    down Town with a Hop, Skip and Jump determined to clean up the whole Lay-Out before Nightfall</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He had taken eight hours of Slumber and a cold Dip in the Porcelain. After Breakfast he
                    came out into the Spring Sunshine feeling as fit as a Fiddle and as snippy as a young Colt.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Me to the Office to get that Stack of Letters off my Mind,&quot; said the
                    Hopeful Citizen.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he dashed into the Office he earned 220 pounds of Steam and was keen for the Attack.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">A tall Man with tan Whiskers arose from behind the roll-top Desk and greeted him.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;How are you feeling this Morning?&quot; asked the Stranger.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Swell and Sassy,&quot; was the Reply.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2326-068" n="73" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;And yet, tomorrow you may join the Appendicitis Colony and day after tomorrow
                    you may lie in the darkened Front Room with Floral Offerings on all sides,&quot; said the
                    Stranger. &quot;What you want is one of our non-reversible, twenty-year, pneumatic Policies with
                    the Reserve Fund Clause. Kindly glance at this Chart. Suppose you take the reactionable Endowment
                    with the special Proviso permitting the accumulation of both Premium and Interest. On a $10,000

                    $3,867.44 as you can see for yourself.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;This is my&quot; began the Man.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Or, you may prefer the automatic tontine Policy with ball-bearings,&quot;
                    continued the Death Angel. &quot;In this case, the entire Residue goes into the Sinking Fund and
                    draws Compound Interest. This is made possible under our new System of reducing Operating Expenses
                    to a Minimum and putting the Executive Department into the Hands of well-known New York Financiers
                    who do not seek Pecuniary <pb id="VAA2326-069" n="74" TEIform="pb"/> Reward but are actuated by a
                    Philanthropic Desire to do good to all Persons living west of the Alleghenies.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;That will be about all from you,&quot; said the Man. &quot;Mosey! Duck!
                    Up an Alley!&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Then you don&apos;t care what becomes of your Family?&quot; asked the
                    Stranger, in a horrified Tone.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;My Relatives are collecting all of their Money in Advance,&quot; said the
                    Man. &quot;If they are not worrying over the Future, I don&apos;t see why you should lose
                    any Sleep.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So the Solicitor went out and told every one along the Street that the Man lacked
                    Foresight.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At 9.30 o&apos;clock the industrious little Man picked up letter number 1 and said to
                    the Blonde Stenographer, &quot;Dear Sir.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At that moment the Head of the Credit Department hit him on the Back and said he had a
                    Good One. It was all about little Frankie, the Only Child, the Phenom, the 40-pound Prodigy.</p>

                    the Morning with a Story concerning the incipient Depew out at their House. It seems that little
                    Frankie has been told something at Sunday School and he asked his Mother about it and she told him
                    so-and-so, whereupon the Infant Joker arose to the Emergency and said: and then you get it, and any
                    one who doesn&apos;t laugh is lacking in a Finer Appreciation of Child Nature. The Busy Man
                    listened to Frankie&apos;s Latest and asked, &quot;What&apos;s the Rest of it?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So the Parent remarked to several People that day that the Man was sinking into a crabbed
                    Old Age.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At 10 A.M. the Man repeated &quot;Dear Sir&quot; and a Voice came to him,
                    remarking on the Beauty of the Weather. A Person who might have been Professor of Bee-Culture in the
                    Pike County Agricultural Seminary, so far as makeup was concerned, took the Man by the Hand and
                    informed him that he (the Man) was a Prominent Citizen and that being the case he would be given a
                    Reduction on the Half-Morocco Edition. While doing his 150 Words a 76 <pb id="VAA2326-072" n="77"
                        TEIform="pb"/> Minute, he worked a Kellar Trick and produced a large Prospectus from under his
                    Coat. Before the Busy Man could grab a Spindle and defend himself, he was looking at a half-tone
                    Photo of Aristotle and listening to all the different Reasons why the Work should be in every
                    Gentleman&apos;s Library. Then the Agent whispered the Inside Price to him so that the
                    Stenographer would not hear and began to fill out a Blank. The Man summoned all his Strength and
                    made a Buck.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I don&apos;t read Books,&quot; he said. &quot;I am an Intellectual
                    Nit. Clear Out!&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So the Agent gave him a couple of pitying Looks and departed, meeting in the Doorway a
                    pop-eyed Person with his Hat on the Back of his Head and a Roll of Blue Prints under his Arm. The
                    Man looked up and moaned. He recognized his Visitor as a most dangerous Monomaniacthe one who is
                    building a House and wants to show the Plans.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I&apos;ve got everything figured out,&quot; he began, &quot;except
                    that we can&apos;t get from the Dining Room to the Library without going through <pb
                        id="VAA2326-073" n="78" TEIform="pb"/> the Laundry and there&apos;s no Flue connecting with
                    the Kitchen. What do you think I&apos;d better do?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I think you ought to live at a Hotel,&quot; was the reply.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Monomaniac went home and told his Wife that he had been insulted.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At 11.30 came a Committee of Ladies soliciting Funds for the Home for the Friendless.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Those who are Friendless don&apos;t know their own Luck,&quot; said the
                    Busy Man, whereupon the Ladies went outside and agreed that he was a Brute.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At Noon he went out and lunched on Bromo Seltzer.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he rushed back to tackle his Correspondence, he was met by a large Body of Walking
                    Delegates who told him that he had employed a non-union Man to paint his Barn and that he was a
                    Candidate for the Boycott. He put in an Hour squaring himself and then he turned to the
                    Stenographer.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;How far have we got?&quot; he asked.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;&apos; Dear Sir,&apos;&quot;was the Reply.</p>

                    took 40 Minutes. When Rufe walked out, the Busy Man fell with his Face among the unanswered Letters.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Call a Cab,&quot; he said.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;The &apos;Phone is out of order,&quot; was the Reply.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">She pulled the Buzzer and in 20 minutes there slowly entered a boy from the Telegraph
                    Office.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Man let out a low Howl like that of a Prairie Wolf and ran from the Office. When he
                    arrived at Home he threw his Hat at the Rack and then made the Children back into the Corner and
                    keep quiet. His Wife told around that Henry was Working too hard.</p>

                    his Eyes on a Salmon Pink Handkerchief bordered with yellow Morning Glories. Any one could tell by
                    looking at him that he was a delicate Organism and had been raised a Pet.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Presently he put his left Hand to his Brow and began to indite with a pearl-handled Pen

                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh, how you startled me,&quot; said the Author sitting up among the Rugs.
                    &quot;Just as you came in I was writing about the Fays and the Elfins. I was in the deep

                    Fromage. Miss Fromage is the other half this Season, and if you seen her a Block off you&apos;d
                    say, &apos; Is it or ain&apos;t it Lillian Russell?&apos; We&apos;ve just closed
                    with McGoohan&apos;s Boisterous Burlesquers. We was so strong that we killed the rest of the
                    Bill, so we got the Blue Envelope. Now they&apos;re using all our Business, including the Gag

                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I heard that you was a Litry Mug and I&apos;m around here to see you about
                    a Sketch for me and Miss Fromage. The one I&apos;ve got now is all right, but in it
                    I&apos;ve got to eat 8 hard-boiled Eggs, and with 4 shows a Day that&apos;s askin&apos;
                    too much of any Artist. This Sketch was wrote for us by the Man that handles the Transfer Baggage at

                    get new Stuff once in a while. So I want you to fake up something that&apos;ll kill &apos;em

                    I&apos;m supposed to be a Dead Swell that&apos;s come to take her to a Masquerade. With that

                <head TEIform="head">The Two Old Pals and the Call for Help</head>
                <p TEIform="p">ONCE there was a Married Man who had two Friends whom he had not given up, even to oblige
                    the Missus. They were two Men whom he had known since Boy-hood&apos;s Happy Days away back in
                    Sleepy Hol-low. Once in a while the Man would have the Two around to the House for Dinner.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Of these two Friends, one was a Gusher and the other a Grouch.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Gusher was eternally bubbling over with Compliments and Kind Wishes. Whenever he met
                    an Acquaintance he handed him a rhetorical Yard of Daisies and then smeared him with Sweet
                    Endearments. His talk never had any specific Purport. It was unadulterated Con. The Gusher should
                    have been in the Diplomatic Service. One of his hot Specialties was to get up at Dinner Parties and
                    propose Toasts. He would hot-air the Ladies until they flushed Crimson from the Joy of being
                    hot-aired. Even if the Speech was known to be cut-and-dried <pb id="VAA2326-086" n="[91]"

                    <pb id="VAA2326-087" n="92" TEIform="pb"/> Blarney, it never failed to swell the Adorable Creatures,
                    as he called them.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He had a pump-handle Shake for every Man he met, and after the second Day he called him
                    Old Fellow and inquired as to his Health in a Tone of trembling Solicitude and picked little pieces
                    of Lint off his Coat.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I know it&apos;s Guff,&quot; the Man would say after the Gusher had
                    passed on, &quot;but my Stars! He can ladle out that Soothing Syrup and never spill a
                    Drop.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Grouch, on the other Hand, gave a correct Imitation of a Bear with a Sore Toe. His
                    Conversation was largely made up of Grunts. He carried a Facial Expression that frightened little
                    Children in Street Cars and took all the Starch out of sentimental Young Ladies. He seemed
                    perpetually to carry the Hoof-Marks of a horrible Nightmare. Some said that he had been Blighted in
                    Love and had soured on the Universe. Others imagined that his Liver was out of Whack. At any rate,
                    he was shy on Sweetness and Light. His Dial suggested a Map of the Bad Lands and he was just out of
                        <pb id="VAA2326-088" n="93" TEIform="pb"/> Kind Words. He could Knock better than he could
                    Boost.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When the Gusher would arise at the Dinner Table to blow Bubbles and distribute Candy, the
                    Grouch would slide down in his Chair until he was resting on his Shoulder Blades. He seemed to have
                    a Calomel Taste in his Mouth as he listened to the musical drip of the Mush-and-Milk. That kind of
                    Language went with some People, but nix for Sweeney!</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Wife of the Married Man liked the Gusher and tolerated the Grouch.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Every time the Gusher came into the Flat, he held her Hand a little longer than necessary
                    and looked into her Ha/el Eyes and told her she was becoming Younger and more Charming every Day.
                    After a Woman turns the 80 Corner, those Speeches are worth a Dollar a Word, because she finds
                    herself Guessing at times. Husband never was jealous. He knew that the Gusher told every Woman the
                    same thing, playing no Favorites.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When the Grouch came to see them, he said &quot;How are you?&quot; and then began
                    to kick on <pb id="VAA2326-089" n="94" TEIform="pb"/> the Weather and tell about his Rheumatism. One
                    thing was certain. The Grouch never would break up any Happy Homes. And it was predicted that he
                    would never get a Wife unless he took her on a Mortgage.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Every Husband has a few Friends who come in for hard Raps from the Wife. And the Grouch
                    got all that was coming to him. She used to declare up and down that she was going to break his
                    Plate and revoke his License. Husband would remind her that he and the Grouch had roomed together at
                    College and done the Comrades Act ever since they were Boys. He would assure her that the Grouch was
                    a Good Fellow, but you had to know him thirty or forty years before you found it out He would smooth
                    her down and straighten out her Feathers and she would agree to give the Grouch just one more
                    Chance.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">It came about that one Year the Married Man got Gay and swam out to where it was over his

                    waiting to be Scalped. It was not a dignified thing to do, but he had to yell for Assistance and
                    yell plenty.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He hot-footed to the Gusher, friend of his Youth and God-Father to his Children. He
                    explained that his Heels were beating a Tattoo on the Ragged Edge of Insolvency, and unless he could
                    raise the Wind, it meant a Receiver over at the Works, his Credit evaporated and the Pianola to the
                    Hock-Shop.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Gusher listened with Tears in his Eyes. In a Voice all choked with Sobs he tendered
                    his Sympathy and his Sincere Hope that all would yet be Well. He told him it grieved him to see a
                    Friend go under the Rollers. It tore his Heart. It did for sure. In fact it had so upset him that he
                    would have to go out into the Air. So he did an Olga Nethersole Exit with one Hand over his
                    streaming Eyes, and the life-long Friend sat there with Salt Water <pb id="VAA2326-092" n="97"
                        TEIform="pb"/> spattered all over him and nothing in his Hand.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As soon as he had dried his Clothes he went to the Grouch and candidly owned up that he
                    was on the Waiting List for the Poor House unless he could borrow enough to tide him over.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As might have been expected, the Grouch began to Roast him. He told him that he
                    didn&apos;t have as much Business Gumption as a Belgian Hare and a Chump who would walk into
                    Debt with his Eyes open deserved to get it right in the Collar.</p>

                    earned her Harp three times over. The Prune Joke never touched her, and she had herself trained so
                    as not to hear any sarcastic Cracks about the Oleo. She prided herself on the Atmosphere of Culture
                    that permeated the Establishment, and on the Fact that she did not harbor any Improper Characters. A

                    Spring Chicken, but the Boarders allowed that she never saw a Spring Chicken.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In the Cast of Characters were many of the Old Favorites. There was the lippy Boy with

                    to pay the National Debt.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he stayed at home and marked the Card and made Mind Bets he could beat five out of

                <p TEIform="p">And now Saturday Afternoon had come and Percy M. Piker was hanging on the rear end of the
                    Choo-Choo with $7 sewed up in the inside Pocket of his Vest, while in his Hand there fluttered a
                    batch of Clippings, written by the Smoke Brothers, showing which ones were sure to win unless
                    something happened.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Mr. Piker, the amateur Gam, closed his Eyes and saw himself buying a real Panama and a
                    dozen or so George H. Primrose Shirts. He <pb id="VAA2326-106" n="111" TEIform="pb"/> had a Vision
                    of riding in a Machine called the Pink Demon, with Claire at his side and an imported Chiffonier
                    working the Jigger and mowing down the Common People.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Percy had two or three Good Things that were guaranteed to go through. They had been
                    slipped to him by a Cigar Salesman who knew an Owner. They looked to be the real Candy.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he arrived at the Track he gave up for a Badge and a Dope-Sheet and a couple of
                    Perfectos, and this left him with 5 and a little something on the side for Ked Hots. He fought his
                    way to the Black-Board and demanded $2 worth of Bright Eyes at 9 to 1. While he was struggling to
                    get to the Fence he heard some one say that Appendicitis was right and would win by a City Block. A
                    Low Moan escaped him. He climbed over a large mass of Colored People so as to get $3 down on
                    Appendicitis. The Odds were 7 to 5. He got balled up in his Arithmetic, and while he was waiting for
                    the Figures to shift so that he could butt in with his 3, a Bell rang and the</p>

                    and fell in a Faint. Bright Eyes had beaten the Gate and spread-eagled his Field. It was a Case of
                    winning on the Chin Strap. Mr. Piker was first in the Line, shaking like a Corn-Starch Pudding. He
                    wanted to cash before the Book failed.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">A few Moments later he went out behind the Grand Stand and counted up and found that he
                    had $28. He had the Panama and one Shirt. The still, small Voice said, &quot;Duck!&quot; but
                    he thought of Claire and his coming Vacation. There grew within him a high resolve to clean up the
                    Betting Ring and quit the Mercantile Life.</p>

                    would roll in. Accordingly he gnawed his way up to the Workman with the Pencil and laid Twenty at 3

                <p TEIform="p">Josie Jinks carried on her Back something just out of the Cradle that had number 3 marked
                    on it. Mr. Piker had his Chin over the Fence and was wondering if any one would gather up his Body
                    and put it on the Train. His Pulse was up to 180 and he couldn&apos;t hear the Band play.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He saw them come past the first time. Sassafras had a piece of Daylight between himself
                    and the Bunch. The Boy was going along under Double Wraps with a lot up his Sleeve. Away back in the
                    Pocket there was something with a 3 on it. Percy clung to the Fence and he felt the Chill come up
                    his Legs. Sassafras had them smothered. He heard the Roar behind him and knew that an Awful Thing
                    was being pulled off, but he did not have the Heart to look. As they pounded up the Stretch he
                    lifted a dying Gaze and saw a figure 3 move <pb id="VAA2326-110" n="[115]" TEIform="pb"/>

                <p TEIform="p">A bug-eyed Maniac with his Collar to the bad was found wandering hither and thither with
                    $90 in his Left Hand. The Tout had to shake him a couple of times before he came to. The Tout had
                    some Goods of a very superior Quality. In the next Race there was a Collie that had enough Hop in
                    him to convert a Selling Plater into a Reina. It was like making change with a Blind Man. Rinkaboo
                    was the Name. Breathe it softly, as very few were Next.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Tout said to play it across the Board, forward and back, up and down. He said that
                    Rinkaboo would breeze in, that he would win on the Bit, doing Buck and Wing Steps, that all the
                    others would seem to be Hitched.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So, Mr. Piker allowed the Tout to take him by the Hand, for he was too weak to resist,
                    and together they wandered off into Dreamland. Piece by Piece the happy Sesterces went up. Rinkaboo
                    was played in all the Books, straight, place and to peep. Mr. Piker <pb id="VAA2326-112" n="117"
                        TEIform="pb"/> found himself up in the Grand Stand holding his Head with one Hand while in the
                    other Hand was a Pinochle Deck, suitable for framing. If Rinkaboo finished at all, Mr. Piker was a
                    Wealthy Person. If he happened in toward the head of the Procession, Mr. Piker would have to send
                    for a Furniture Van. If he came First, it would be a case of Hoboken for every Book inside of the
                    Fence.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After it was all over and Mr. Percy M. Piker was riding homeward with his Head out of a
                    Trolley Window, he recalled dimly that a large number of long-legged Ponies came out on the Track.
                    One of them was the color of an Old Glove and was doing a Two-Step. There was about twenty minutes
                    of Fussing around at the Bend in the Track and then they all kited away like a flight of Swallows
                    and there was one Horse in front and Mr. Piker had a Convulsion and frothed at the mouth. Presently
                    the Tonic seemed to die away and something Blew and Rinkaboo fell down and stepped on his Lip. He
                    came in about the time they were blowing the Horn for the next Race.</p>

                    Time and pulled for the House, he would Arrive in time.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Faithful Worker wanted to be Department Manager. The Hours were short and the Salary

                <p TEIform="p">At last the House gave the old Manager the Privilege of retiring and living on whatever

                    a Month. Dearie took her to the Train, and all the way she kept saying that it did not seem just
                    Right to romp away on a Pleasure Trip and leave him Shell-Roaded.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He began to fear that she would Weaken, so he told her that while he was slaving and
                    humping in the City, it would give him sufficient Joy to know that Darling was out in the Woods,
                    listening to the Birds. He insisted that she should stay until she was thoroughly Rested. Of course,
                    he did not dare to make it too Strong. He played the Self-Sacrifice Gag and threw in a Dash of
                    Marital Solicitude, and made an awful Try at imitating one who has been soaked by a Great Sorrow. As
                    the Missus looked at him through her Tears and held his Salary-Hook in hers, little did she suspect
                    that he had framed up a Poker Festival <pb id="VAA2326-129" n="134" TEIform="pb"/> for that Night
                    and already the Wet Goods were spread out on the Ice.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He had told her that he was going to sit up in the Library every Evening and read
                    Macaulay&apos;s History of England. By opening the Windows on both sides he could get a nice
                    Breeze from the West. Along about 10 o&apos;clock, if he got Sleepy, he could turn in. Why not?</p>
                <p TEIform="p">It was a lovely Time-Table that he had mapped out. He submitted it to Pet before she went
                    away and she put her O.K. on it, even though her Heart ached for him. Break-fast at the strange
                    Boarding-House. A day of Toil interrupted by a small Bunch of Food at the Dairy Lunch.</p>

                    or so.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He held himself down until the Train had flirted around the Curve, for he knew that she

                    moving along about the same as usual. With Love and Kisses.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After which he went over to the Brewery to see if they would make a Reduction on

                    the dizzy Pleats. His Cuban Blood was all het up and he told himself that he was 19 years old and

                    returned True Bills. They were a little too Gamey for Presbyterian Circles, but they fitted right in
                    at any Function where every man takes off&apos; his Coat.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Husband began to use the Telephone, and in the course of an Hour he had organized a

                <p TEIform="p">For when a decent Married Man does start <pb id="VAA2326-133" n="138" TEIform="pb"/> out

                    Circuit</head>
                <p TEIform="p">ATEAM of Proud Parents had a son named James Henry Guff. On the Day of his Birth the Wind
                    changed and blew in another Direction, Apples fell off the Trees, Chickens went to Roost at Mid-Day.
                    All Nature seemed to have been given a Jolt by the Portentous Event. For James Henry Guff was born
                    to know all the Brands of Human Greatness. Destiny had put a Green Tag on him and nothing could stop
                    him.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he was only 18 years of age, he was elected Captain of a Volunteer Fire Department,
                    which was a valuable Organization, only when there was a Fire no one could find the Key to the House
                    in which they kept the Hand-Pump. But the Papers began to speak of him as Captain Guff. His
                    Intimates called him Cap. After the Hose Company disbanded, his Title clung to him and it was
                    generally believed <pb id="VAA2326-138" n="143" TEIform="pb"/> that he had been with Grant at
                    Appomattox.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Not satisfied with a resounding Title, for which those in the Regular Army have to
                    struggle for Years, Captain Guff began to give Lessons on the Flute at 50 cents an Hour, and the
                    first thing he knew he was a real Professor, just the same as if he had gone up in a Balloon or had
                    some trained Horses. Now over at Harvard, where they grow the English Accent, a Student must grind
                    through a long Course, and a Fellowship and an Instructorship before he blossoms into a simon-pure
                    Professor. Which only goes to show that the Real Boy can gain by one stroke of Genius the Renown for
                    which the ordinary Skates must go forth and Rustle.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">James Henry Guff at the age of 30 was both a Captain and a Professor, but his insatiable
                    Ambition spurred him to go out and gather other Laurels. So he ran for Justice of the Peace, and was
                    elected the third time he ran, because the other Candidate pulled out. As Magistrate he became
                    custodian of a Law-Book, <pb id="VAA2326-139" n="144" TEIform="pb"/> a Checker-Board, and a stack of
                    Blank Affidavits. Once every three Months or so somebody would levy on a Cow or threaten to Assault,
                    and then the Judge would get a chance to operate his Graft. But he didn&apos;t care so much
                    about the Income, so long as he could be addressed as Judge. He allowed his Hair to grow into a
                    long, graceful Cow-Lick that kept falling into his Eyes, and he looked at the Sidewalk meditatively
                    as he went over to the Grocery to get his Fine-Cut. Sometimes, when he was far enough from Home,
                    those who met him and heard him called Judge thought that he was on the Supreme Bench.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In the course of Time he began to crave a Political Job, so he began to stump around in
                    the Interests of the Machine. He drove out to District School-Houses with the American Eagle seated
                    on the Dash-Board of his Buggy, and when he got on the Platform he waved Old Glory until both Arms
                    gave out. All of which went to prove that the Machine should be kept in Power. After he had been

                    there was a Jim-Crow Speaking, then the Hon. James Henry Guff&apos; showed up with his Voice in
                    a Shawl-Strap and also a fine Assortment of Platitudes. When the Congressman wrote to him and asked
                    him to get the Swazey County Delegates into Line, he always addressed his letter to the Hon. James
                    Henry Guff and in the Course of Time Guff began to believe.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But a prouder Distinction awaited him. In view of the fact that he had plugged for the
                    Kegular Organization and delivered the Goods at the State Convention, he was made a Colonel on the
                    Governor&apos;s Staff. It is the Duty of a Colonel on the Governor&apos;s Staff&apos; to
                    ride in a Pullman Car and take a Ball every time he is touched on the Back. Colonel Guff&apos;
                    was a Dream when be got into his $275 Uniform with the Gold Braid rigged all over the Front. He wore
                    a Cbapeau similar to the one worn by Napoleon at Austerlitz, but he had on top of it seven
                    Tail-Feathers of the Loo-Loo Bird, which rather laid over anything that Napoleon <pb
                        id="VAA2326-142" n="147" TEIform="pb"/> ever wore. And when Colonel James Henry Guff&apos;
                    in his magnificent Regalia and smoking, a ten-cent Cigar, leaned back in an Open Carriage drawn by
                    White Horses and allowed the People to gaze at him, the Grandeur of the Spectacle made one forget
                    the real Horrors of War.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Many of the ardent Admirers of Prof. Guff, and Capt. Guff, and Judge Guff, and Col. Guff
                    believed that lie had climbed to the Summit of Greatness when he appeared in his S42 Plume. Not so.
                    One Year the State Militia was to have an Encampment and the Governor gave Col. James Henry Guff the
                    Job of buying all the Beans, Fresh Beef, and other Supplies, because there promised to be a slight
                    rake-off. Officially he was known as the Commissary-General.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Thus it came about that after Years of Endeavor, James Henry Guff&apos;, who left the
                    Post a poor and unknown Boy, went under the Wire a real General.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">AN old Residenter, who owned a Section of Improved Land, and some Town Property besides,
                    was getting too Feeble to go out and roast the Hired Hands, so he turned the Job over to his Son.
                    This Son was named Joel. He was foolish, the same as a Fox. Any one who got ahead of Joel had to
                    leave a 4:30 Call and start on a Lope. When it came to Skin Games he was the original High-Binder.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Joel took the Old Gentleman aside one Day and said to him: &quot;Father, you are not
                    long for this World, and to save Lawyer Fees and avoid a tie-up in the Probate Court, I think you
                    ought to cut up your Estate your own self, and then you will know it is done Right.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;How had I better divide it?&quot; asked the Old Gentleman.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;You can put the whole Shooting-Match in <pb id="VAA2326-145" n="150"
                        TEIform="pb"/> my Name,&quot; suggested Joel. &quot;That will save a lot of Writing.
                    Then if any other Relatives need anything, they can come to me and try to Borrow it.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Joel sent for a cut-rate Shyster, who brought a bundle of Papers tied with Green Braid,
                    and assured the Old Gentleman that the Proceeding was a Mere Formality. When a Legal Wolf wants to
                    work the Do-Do on a Soft Thing, he always springs that Gag about a Mere Formality.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Joel and the Shell-Worker moved the Old Gentleman up to a Table in the Front Room and put
                    a Cushion under him and slipped a Pen into his Hand and showed him where to Sign.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After he got through filling the Blank Spaces with his John Hancock, he didn&apos;t
                    have a Window to hoist or a Fence to lean on. He was simply sponging on Joel.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">This went on for about a Month, and then Joel began to Fret.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I don&apos;t think I am getting a Square Deal,&quot; said Joel.
                    &quot;Here is an Ancient Party <pb id="VAA2326-146" n="[151]" TEIform="pb"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2326-32" TEIform="figure">

                    <pb id="VAA2326-147" n="152" TEIform="pb"/> without any Assets, who lives with me Week in and Week
                    out and doesn&apos;t pay any Board. He is getting too Old and Wabbly to do Odd Jobs around the
                    Place, and it looks to me like an awful Imposition.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So he went to the Old Gentleman and said: &quot;Father, I know the Children must
                    annoy you a good deal; they make so much Noise when they play House. Sometimes we want to use the
                    Piano after it is your Bed-Time, and of course that breaks your Rest, so I have been thinking that
                    you would be a lot better off in some Institution where they make a Specialty of looking after
                    Has-Beens. I have discovered a nice, quiet Place. You will live in a large Brick Building, with a
                    lovely Cupola on top. There is a very pretty Lawn, with Flower-Beds, and also an ornamental Iron
                    Fence, so that the Dogs cannot break in and bite you. You will be given a nice Suit of Clothes, the
                    same as all the others are wearing, and if you oversleep yourself in the Morning, a Man will come
                    around and call you.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2326-148" n="153" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;In other Words, me to the Poor-House,&quot; said the Old Residenter.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;You need not call it that, unless you want to,&quot; said Joel.
                    &quot;If you choose, you may speak of it as the Home for Aged Persons who got Foolish with their
                    Fountain Pens.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So Joel put his Father into the Spring Wagon and hauled him over the Hills to the Charity
                    Pavilion, where all the Old Gentleman had to do was to sit around in the Sun looking at the Pictures
                    in last year&apos;s Illustrated Papers and telling what a Chump he had been.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But sometimes a Man is not all in, simply because he looks to be wrinkled and doddering.
                    Joel&apos;s Father had a Few Thinks coming to him. Although he had been double-crossed and put
                    through the Ropes, he still had a Punch left. He sent for a Lawyer who was even more Crafty than the
                    one employed by Joel and he said to him: &quot;There is a Loop-Hole in every Written Instrument,
                    if one only knows how to find it. I want you to set aside that fool Deed.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA2326-149" n="154" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">Next day the Lawyer came for him in a double-seated Carriage and said, &quot;They
                    forgot to put on a Revenue Stamp and so the Transfer is off.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;And do I get all of my Property back again?&quot; asked the Old Residenter.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;You get half and I get half,&quot; was the Reply of the Lawyer.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Give me mine,&quot; said the Old Residenter. &quot;I&apos;m from
                    Wisconsin and I wont it in the Hand. Whatever I own from this time on, I carry right in my Clothes,
                    and any Relative who separates me from it will have to set his Request to Music.&quot; Then the
                    went to a Physician.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Doc,&quot; he says, &quot;they are counting nine on me, but I figure
                    that before I cash in, I have time to spend all that I have. Look me over and tell me how long I
                    would last on a Waldorf diet. I want to gauge my Expenses so as to leave nothing behind for Joel
                    except a Ha-Ha Message and a few Heirlooms.&quot;</p>

                    And after a Nice Girl has had a long and prosperous Run on the Home Circuit and then begins to curl

                <p TEIform="p">To prove that this is no Idle Jest, it can be demonstrated that the marrying Girl usually
                    goes on the Road a while before she closes a Contract.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Two-Stepper could not forget the Girl from Another Town. She pulled out next Day but
                    he looked up the Address and sent her the Dance Programme that he had found in his Overcoat Pocket.
                    She wrote back that it was Awfully Sweet of him to remember poor little Me and then she asked one or
                    two Questions. That gave him a Hunch, so he bought a new kind of Writing Paper, said to be the
                    Latest Agony, and he wrote a nice Long Letter in which he told her that she was very easy to look
                    at, and that when it came to picking them up and setting them down in the Slow and Dreamy, she made
                    all the other Girls of his Acquaintance look like a Set of Cripples.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She returned the Serve with one of these chummy Epistles, written on all sides of the</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Her Pace was a trifle Swift for Harry J., who had derived his Education from the Sporting
                    Section of the Daily Papers, but he bought a Lover&apos;s Guide and a Dictionary and decided to
                    stay</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The size of it was that little Harry had been Harpooned all the way through. He was the
                    original Sweetheart la Brochette. He carried with him, Night and Day, a Vision of Her in the $200
                    Rig that she had flashed on the Night of the Party. It never occurred to him that she could wear any
                    other Costume. He would close his Eyes and try to hear once again the dulcet and mellifluous Tones
                    of that Voice which, to him, sounded as Good as an $AEolian Harp moved by gentle Zephyrs within a
                    Bower of Orchids costing $7 each.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So they exchanged Photos.</p>

                    Universe.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">A successful Photographer, who has learned the Tricks and made a slight Study of Human
                    Nature, can take a Grass Widow of 48, who is troubled with Wild Hairs and other Excess Ornaments,
                    and by tampering with the Negative, he can make her out to look something like Ethel Barrymore. Then
                    she can send the Picture to her Relations who live a long way off and they will never know the
                    Difference.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Girl sent Harry a High Art Panel of herself, in which she was looking at something in
                    a Tree, and when he gazed at it, he had a Palpitation and said, &quot;This is better than I
                    thought it was.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He told himself that it would be a Pleasure and a Privilege to walk up to something like

                <p TEIform="p">This Specialist could take any Set of Misfit Features and rearrange them into a Work of
                    Art. He put Harry in front of the Bull&apos;s-Eye and scrooged him around so as to blanket the
                    White Wings as much as possible and then he told him to think of Money and look Pleasant.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When the Pictures were delivered, Harry realized for the first time that he was a
                    Beautiful Creature. He sent one to the Girl and wrote that it was a hum Likeness and did not do him
                    Justice, and so on.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In acknowledging Receipt, she cut out the &quot;Dear Mister&quot; and cane right
                    at him with &quot;Dear Friend,&quot; which gave him such a Stroke of Joy that he did very
                    little Work that Day.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Harry did not have Gumption enough to evolve any deep System for landing a Tid-Bit, but
                    he had accidentally hit upon the Cinch Method.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So long as Courtship consists of sending <pb id="VAA2326-160" n="165" TEIform="pb"/>

                    about the Third Party. He lives in the sweet Delusion that he has bought up the whole House.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Harry&apos;s Letters to the Girl and the Girl&apos;s Letters to Harry became more
                    and more on that Order, until at last they began to burn holes in the Mail Bags.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After comparing her Picture with all the Parlor Favorites that he met on his Social
                    Rounds, he realized that she outclassed all other Representatives of her sex.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In her cosy Flat, far away, she had him propped up on the Piano in a Silver-Gilt Frame
                    and featured to beat the Cars. Any <pb id="VAA2326-161" n="166" TEIform="pb"/> one who dropped in to
                    see her was made to understand that he was merely an Understudy, who was being used as a

                <p TEIform="p">She used to write to Harry and tell him about her Callers and what Chumps they were, and
                    then let him draw his own Conclusions as to who was the real white-haired Papa.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Finally Harry took an Overdose of Nerve Food and asked her right out, would she? The

                <p TEIform="p">ONCE there was a moving Target who was strong on the Brotherhood of Man. He ran a little
                    Sunshine Factory all of his own. When it came to scattering Seeds of Kindness, the Farm Drill was a
                    Poor Second.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Every time he started down Town he would have to zigzag so as to cover both sides of the
                    Street and glad-hand all of his Acquaintances.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">From time to time he joined Fraternal Organizations and took blistering Oaths that he
                    would always love his Fellow-Man and stand for any Touch within Reason. Consequently a good many
                    People found it cheaper to send for him than to hire a Professional Nurse. He would travel Miles in
                    order to have the Pleasure of sitting up with a Corpse. And he was one of the handiest Pall-Bearers
                    in the Business.</p>

                    give him the Grip and then weep on his Shoulder. Usually he promised to do what he could to square
                    Matters, even though he had to cut in where he wasn&apos;t wanted. In flying around, trying to
                    re-in-state No-Goods who had lost their Jobs and secure Salaried Positions for Nice Fellows who were
                    willing to do anything except Work, he got many a Jolt, but he was not discouraged.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One of his regular Assignments was to arbitrate a Domestic Scrap, merely out of the
                    Goodness of his Heart.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In this way he managed to re-unite quite a number of Couples who were afterward sorry

                    frequently Stung, but still he could not resist any Appeal that was backed up by a few Weeps.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In the Course of Time he came into quite a Bundle of Money, and then all the Bread that

                    Shoes, now had a Chance to show his Gratitude. He let Jasper in on the Ground Floor of a Company
                    organized to manufacture an Automobile that could be turned out of the Shop for $35 and would run 90
                    Miles on a pint of Gasoline.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Gentlemen who were getting along without Overcoats came in to see him about Mining Stock
                    that was sure to touch Par by January 1st. The only Reason they came to him first, instead of
                    tackling John W. Gates, was that he had always been a True Friend and they wanted to put him next to
                    a Good Thing.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After one or two of these Gift Enterprises had been slipped to him, he began to back

                    he had been landed. She was a Confiding Thing, and did not know that the Bachelor who had started in
                    to Rush her seven nights a Week was a Rounder and a Poker-Player and somewhat of a Lush.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Every one who knew the Sweet Girl said it was too Bad and that some one ought to go to
                    her and warn her. After the Old Ladies and the Elders had talked the Matter over on the side, it was
                    decided that Jasper was It. He was known to be kind and disinterested and <pb id="VAA2326-177"
                        n="182" TEIform="pb"/> was accustomed to dealing out Good Advice. Anything that he said would go
                    a long Way to head off the Deal.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Accordingly he did a Fatherly Talk to the Daughter of his Old Friend, giving her a
                    Straight Line on the Conduct of the High-Roller who was trying to warm up to her.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She thanked him right from the Bottom of her heart. Then she sent a Messenger Boy to hunt
                    up the High-Roller, because she wanted to know if it was all True or merely a Cruel Slander.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When she sprung his Record on him he leaned right over against her and cried and said
                    that no matter what he had been, she was the one to make him a Good Man. Then she stroked his Hair
                    and begged Forgiveness and he asked her who had been Knocking and she gave the whole Snap away and
                    begged him not to do anything Desperate. He said that whatever he did, he would do out of Love for

                    midway between the Oats Belt and the Tall Timber. He was a large and sandy Mortal with a steel-trap
                    Jaw and a cold glittering Eye. He made his first Stack a Dollar at a Time on straight Deals, but
                    after a while he learned a few Things. He organized Stock Companies and then crawled out after
                    hooking up with the Velvet. Every one called him Mister and treated him with Politeness, but, just
                    the same, when he walked into an Office Building they all wondered what he had come after and there
                    was more or less locking of Safes. It is only fair to remark, on the Side, that he wouldn&apos;t
                    take anything which was securely spiked down, and the Grand Jury never bothered him, because he
                    worked under a Contract.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Financier was the high Centre Pole of <pb id="VAA2326-181" n="186" TEIform="pb"/> a

                <p TEIform="p">In his own Domicile he did not even play Second Fiddle. He simply trailed along at the

                    a common Heritage. Domestic Cigars were good enough for him, and he figured that one good reliable
                    Hired Girl who knew how to cook Steak was all the Help that was needed in any House. But Mother had
                    seen Fifth Avenue in a Dream, and the Girls had attended a Boarding School at which nearly every one
                    knew some one who was Prominent Socially. They had done a lot of Hard Work at the Piano and taken a
                    side-hold on the French Language and it seemed to them that they were wasting their Time in
                    loitering on the Outskirts of Civilization when they might be up at Headquarters cutting more or
                    less of a Gash. All the Young Men in this Rub Town wore Derbies with their Evening Clothes and came
                    to Dances with their White Gloves smelling of Gasoline, in addition to which they lacked Repose. If
                    they had stopped to cultivate Repose, most of them would have landed in the Villa set aside for
                    Paupers.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">So the Caravansary moved away toward the Rising Sun. At Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania, the

                    to carry the Letter of Credit. Laura and the Girls suddenly forgot that there was any Land west of
                    Pitts-burg, and they dropped their R&apos;s and got the Kangaroo Walk and began to order their
                    Food in Foreign Languages. After that, all Father had to do was to follow along and look Pleasant

                <p TEIform="p">IN Way back Township, along in the Thirties, there arrived a 12-pounder. When he was
                    three days old he was exhibited to a Bunch in the Front Room by an Old Lady who had made a Study of
                    Colic. She was a Baby Expert who always broke in to do considerable heavy standing around and
                    calling off when there was a lift in the Population.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">While little Ipsy-Wipsy was being inspected, he opened one Eye and spotted a silver
                    Half-Dollar that the Honoary Nurse wore as a Brooch. Immediately he closed in on it. They had to
                    choke him to make him let go. In after Years it was remarked that this was the only time that he
                    went after the Coin and failed to bring it home.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Baby never had any Tantrums at Night because he had overheard them say <pb
                        id="VAA2326-190" n="195" TEIform="pb"/> that it cost $2 every time Doc was called in. He would
                    lie quietly in his Crib for Hours at a time looking up at the Ceiling and computing Compound
                    Interest on the $5 Gold Piece that had been put in the Bank, to be drawn out when he should be 21.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">His Parents gave his a Biblical Name so as to make him a strong Come-On for Investors who
                    belong to the Pious Element. Hezekiah Hooper is what they christened him. They wanted a Name that
                    would carry weight on a Letter-Head and reassure the Soft Mark who was about to sink his Funds in a
                    Mining Venture with a Guarantee of 48 per cent. Dividends.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At the age of 4 Hezekiah sat down and figured that if he devoted his Life to Physical
                    Toil, he might some day be the Owner of a six-room cottage fully protected by a Mortgage, whereas if
                    he wore a White Shirt and kept busy with the Pencil, he might be Rich enough some day to land in the
                    Senate. So he went out looking for Work to hand to other People, thus becoming what <pb
                        id="VAA2326-191" n="196" TEIform="pb"/> the Campaign Orator calls a Captain of Industry.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">If a man wanted the Weeds pulled from his Garden, then Hez would take the Job for 25
                    cents. He would buy 5 cents worth of Stick Candy and place it judiciously, so that at Nightfall the
                    other boys would have Blisters and the Stomach-Ache, while Hez would have 20 cents salted away in
                    the Tin Bank.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he was still a Young Man he made the Immportant Discovery that the honest Laborer
                    who digs Post-Holes for 11 Hours at a Stretch gets $1.25 in the Currency of the Realm, while the
                    Brain-Worker who leads out a Spavined Horse and puts in 20 Minutes at tall Bunko Work, can clean up
                    $14.50 and then sit on the Porch all Afternoon, reading &quot;The Lives of the Saints.&quot;</p>

                    whose Figure had all of the graceful Ins and Outs of a Flag-Pole, but she owned half of the Land in

                <p TEIform="p">When grim-visaged War showed its awful Front, Hezekiah went down to the Court-House and
                    hollered for the Union until he was black in the Face. He showed all the emotional Farm Hands where
                    to sign their Names and promised to keep them supplied with Blue Overcoats, Beans, Navy Plug and
                    Hard Tack until the whole Works had been saved. Every time there was a new Call for Men, he took a
                    firmer fold on the Commissary Department and began to gouge the Government in a new Place.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Heroes who came home full of Malaria raid Lead were met at the Station by Hezekiah,
                    who had grown a Chin Whisker and was sporting a White Vest. He gave each one a Card announcing that
                    all of our country&apos;s Brave Defenders who had failed to become well fixed on. $I3 per, would
                    get what Money they needed at 2 per cent. a Month, with Real Estate as Security.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">He and other old Gentlemen with pink Jowls and cold fishy Eyes would occasionally meet in
                    some Directors&apos; Room, finished in Mahogany. The Meeting would be opened with Prayer, after
                    which they would discuss Ways and Means of putting the Inter-State Commerce Law to the Bad, squaring
                    the Legislature without passing over any of the Stuff themselves and handing the Public the Short
                    End of it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Having arrived at this Proud Eminence, Hezekiah was ripe to spring some Advice to Young

                    Drink and never asked anybody else to do either, was invited to address the Class of Naughty-Three
                    at the Local Business College.</p>

                    ancient Trade-_Marks, the White Shirt and the White Vest, he had a White Bow Tie. As he sat there in
                    conscious Rectitude, wondering if the Congressional Investigation would harm the Beef Trust, it
                    could be seen at a Glance that he would never take anything that was too heavy to carry, unless he
                    had a Dray.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The studious Young Gentlemen who had been preparing themselves to go out into the Great
                    World and draw Car-Fare as Book-Keepers and Stenographers, looked up at Honest Hezekiah and said,
                    &quot;This is where he puts us next to the Recipe for Getting There.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At last the Honored Guest arose and told <pb id="VAA2326-197" n="202" TEIform="pb"/> the
                    Class that the Young Man who wishes to succeed must be Upright, Frugal, Industrious, and Patriotic.
                    He considered it the Duty of every Young Man to accept whatever Compensation was offered him and be
                    Content, for as soon as he began to earn more his Employer would come around and put it in his
                    Pocket. Above all, he must love his Country and let Integrity be his Watchword and remember that a

                <p TEIform="p">ONCE upon a Time there was a long-headed Girl who used to sit in her own Room on Rainy
                    Afternoons and evolve Theories. Her principal Ambition in Life was to stand Are High with all the
                    Nice Men of her Set. She hoped in the course of Time to tease one away from the Drove and gallop him
                    into the Branding Pen.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Now this Girl was so Foxy that at times she got in front of herself and blocked off her
                    own Plays. Her scheme for getting all the Real Boys intoxified with Love for her was to engage them
                    in Conversation and that out what kind of Girls they liked. Then her Play was to be that Kind. She
                    had no Difficulty whatever in inducing her Men Friends to talk about the Opposite Sex. They were all
                    keyed up on the Subject and full of Information. Just as a Feeler one Evening she asked an eligible
                    Charley if he didn&apos;t think that the Woman of Today was too Extravagant.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2326-199" n="204" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;That&apos;s just why so many of us shy at the Matrimonial Jump,&quot;
                    he confided to her. &quot;There was a time when the &gt;Ian who got $75 per Month and had
                    about $500 planted could take a Chance at the Game. But now that measly Allowance wouldn&apos;t
                    keep a High Roller supplied with Violets. The up-to-date Maudine isn&apos;t happy unless she has
                    a Gray-Squirrel Coat, an Auto Car, $11,000 worth of Twinklers and a fourteen-room Apartment.
                    That&apos;s why these Society Shawl-Holders keep on making Love right and left but never come
                    down to Cases.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">This was a valuable Tip, so the crafty Maiden put it down in her little Note-Book that
                    she who would make a Hit must convince the Men that her Tastes were simple and inexpensive. Another
                    one gave her a learned Talk on the frivolity and Two-by-Fourness of the typical Seraphine.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;You cannot expect a Man to hand over his serious Affections to one of these

                    for a Lizzie who talks Piffle and gets an Attack of the Giggles every few Seconds, but when it comes
                    to the grand Hook-Up he wants one who is there with the Gray Matterone who can play up to his
                    loftiest Ambitions and supply his Home with that Atmosphere of Culture which is the true Ozone of
                    Married Life.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">So she put it down that it was her Cue to chop out the Twaddle and be a sort of Lady
                    Emerson. Incidentally she resolved to cut out all kinds of Slang, for she got a very straight Line
                    of Talk from an Amateur Philosopher who was in the Wholesale Grocery Business.</p>

                    Confidential Charts warning the Just-Outs against taking Presents from Strangers and putting them
                    next to Rules of Conduct that would be sure to please and fascinate Proper Young Men. It seemed
                    strange at Times that these Head Coaches who knew just how to jolly up any Man were not out spending
                    some Millionaire&apos;s Money instead of writing Pieces for the Paper.</p>

                    the Seventh or Eighth. But it did look Tough to see Mere Children of about twenty-three Years of Age
                    going after the Dry Manhattans.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">After sounding the Men on the Liquor Question the long-headed Girl made a solemn Resolve
                    that she would never hit up anything stronger than Cherry Sundae.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When she had her Note Book full of useful Directions she found a Chance to try out her
                    System. She was invited to a Swell Dinner Party at which all the Nice Men in Town were to be rounded
                    up. She put on a simple White Gown and wore a Rose in her Hair, and just before starting she locked

                <p TEIform="p">At the Dinner she sat next to a Bachelor who had Nothing But. She talked to him about the
                    Panama Canal, just to show that she was no Piker. When he wanted her to take sonic of the Phizz
                    Water she made an Awful Stand and seemed surprised that he should think that of her.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">This did not prevent him from splashing in. By the time the Birds came along he had
                    accumulated a very neat Brannigan, and was paying a lot of Attention to a wonderful Piece of Work
                    sitting opposite. She wore a Red Costume that must have cost $7,000, and although she was very gabby
                    and called the Men by their First Names and invited all who were not Quitters to stand by for a
                    Bumper, she was making fair Headway. In fact, she seemed to have the Bunch with her.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Wise Girl figured that they were tolerating her out of mere Politeness. Later on, in
                    the Drawing Room, they continued to tolerate her the best they knew how. The Girl <pb

                    to a reasonable Limit. She got along first-rate, even though she was doing a lot of Things that none

                    April 1st. He and his Wife figured that by keeping on the Jump they could do Niagara, Thousand

                <head TEIform="head">The Experimental Couple and the Three Off-Shoots</head>
                <p TEIform="p">AMAN and Wife had three Sons. The first, named Abraham Lincoln Tibbetts, was born in
                    1862. His name was promptly abbreviated to Link.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The second, who arrived in 1872, was christened Ulysses Simpson Grant Tibbetts. This was
                    too long, so people called him Chub.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The third was of the Vintage of 1882 and his name went into the Register as Chester A.
                    Arthur Tibbetts, but, in the interest of Euphony he was dubbed Art, because Art is Long.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Tibbetts Family lived in the City, and Link, the first-born, enjoyed all the
                    Advantages of Life in an Apartment Building. He went to a Graded School and picked up so much
                    Knowledge that at the age of 12 he could set his Parents down in front of him and tell them Things
                    they did not know. At 14 he was so far along that he knew how to lie in Bed and have his Mother
                    bring his</p>

                    &quot;Pinafore&quot; music on the Upright Agony Box. Sometimes he chided Mr. and Mrs.
                    Tibbetts for not having as much Money as many of the People he met at Dancing Parties. He had about
                    as much Application as a used-up Porous Plaster, and he worried more about his Complexion than he
                    did about his Business Prospects.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Mr. Tibbetts gave him a Desk at the Office and called him Assistant Something. His Duties
                    consisted of looking at the Clock and writing Notes to the Gazelles he had met the Night before. If
                    he had been set out on the Pavement and told to Root for himself, it would have broken him of the
                    habit of Eating.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Link was whatever they called a Lobster in 1880. Mr. Tibbetts realized that City Life had
                    an enervating Effect on Boys and made them Superficial and Wise in their own Conceit.</p>

                    out to the Green Fields and keep him there until he had developed a Character. Mr. and Mrs. Tibbetts
                    knew that all the Men of Sterling Worth, mentioned in Political Biographies, had been raised on the
                    Farm. They figured that if Chub could be left in the Country to run with the Live Stock, he would
                    grow up to be a Sturdy and self-reliant Character, with no hankering for Soda Water and the Military
                    Schottische.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Therefore Chub was sent out to live with Uncle Jabez Quackenbush, an Agriculturalist who
                    owned 480 Acres and was still wearing the Army Overcoat that the Government had given him when the
                    War broke out. Chub slept on a Feather Tick up in a Room where they had the Seed Corn hung on the
                    Rafters. Uncle Jabe would yank him out at 4.30 G. M. and keep him in the Field until the early
                    Candle-Lighting, so that usually he had two Meals in the Dark. On Sunday he and the Hired Help would
                    sit in the Hay-Mow and <pb id="VAA2326-214" n="[219]" TEIform="pb"/>

                    School and learned to bound Patagonia, but he did not go to any demoralizing Shows nor learn to pick
                    up flip Slang.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he was 18, he seemed to be past the Danger Period, so Uncle Jabe took him to the
                    Train and told the Conductor where to put him off. On the way back to the City he bought an oval Box
                    of Figs from the Train Boy and lost his Hat out of the Window. When he arrived at Home and entered
                    the House, it sounded like a Crowd coming in. His Mother took one Look and fell backward. There was
                    a Neutral Zone between his Vest and Trousers. Also he had been raising Warts on himself.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">For two Months after he arrived they kept him under Cover for fear the Neighbors would
                    sec him. He gave way at the Knces every time he stepped. If a member of the Opposite Sex spoke to
                    him, he usually backed into something Breakable. At the Table he he did a Sword-Swallowing Act and
                    drank out of the Saucer.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">&quot;We made a mistake in leaving him so long in the Tall Grass,&quot; said Mr.
                    Tibbetts. &quot;But now that we have tried the two Extremes, we know just what to do with Art.
                    We shall send him to a small Town, where he may associate with bright Youth of his own age and yet
                    be away from the distracting and corrupting Influences of the Big City.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Accordingly Art was farmed out to a Cousin residing in a drowsy Corporation of about
                    1,500 Souls, figuratively speaking. He went to the Grammar School and what he didn&apos;t learn
                    at School he learned in Back Alleys and Box Cars. However, his Parents were happy in the Knowledge
                    that he was beyond the influence of the gaudy Play House, the gilded Buffet and the seductive
                    Dancing Academy. He was out where nothing happened unless the Boys started it themselves. So they
                    started it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When he was twenty he was sent to the City, an extra fine Specimen of what the Small Town
                    can produce. He had his Hair combed down into his Eyes. He wore a <pb id="VAA2326-217" n="222"
                        TEIform="pb"/> punky little Derby, about two sizes too small. The turn-down Collar was four
                    inches high, and he wore a navy-blue Cravat with a copper Butterfly for a Scarf-Pin. Furthermore, he
                    had a Suit of Clothes that was intended for a gentle Brakeman. On his Lapel he had a Button
                    Photograph of the Girl who worked in the Millinery Store.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Are you made up for a Masquerade or is this the regular Costume?&quot;
                    asked his Father.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;&apos;Go &apos;Way Back and Set Down,&apos;&quot; replied Art,
                    for he knew his Village Repartee and was on to all of last year&apos;s Gags.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;What do you propose to do for yourself?&quot; asked Mr. Tibbetts.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;I want to travel with a Circus or Minstrel Troupe and I don&apos;t much
                    care which,&quot; replied Art.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As the Boy appeared to be somewhat Lumpy about the Pockets, his Father threw him down and
                    searched him, finding on his Person, a $3 Revolver, a Package of Cigaroots, a 1-lb. Plug of Tobacco,

                    Mr. Tibbetts. &quot;Link is door-keeper in a Dime Museum and Chub is putting in Coal for an old
