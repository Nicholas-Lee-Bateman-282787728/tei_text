            <head>The Adequacy of the Imperialist View of Colonial History</head>

            </byline>
            <p>Historians in attempting to write the history of the colonies established in the Western Hemisphere
                    have ordinarily been inclined to approach their problem from either one of two points of view, an
                    Old-World imperialist or a New-World nationalist. The former school have thought of the colonies as
                    the tip ends of the branches—including the flowers, fruitage, and seed—of an
                    old imperial tree, while the latter have thought of them as the seed-germ and tap-root of the sprout
                    of a new nationalist state. In each case they are admittedly dealing with the same seed and with
                    some of its same antecedents and results. In the one case, the historians are following out the
                    results of activities reflecting the ideals, purposes, objectives, and efforts of the builders of
                    empire, modified of course by the environment and by the resistance as well as the co-operation of
                    the people of the colonies. In the other case the historians begin with certain presuppositions as
                    to what are considered some of the ingredients of the unique genius of the new nationalist state and
                    then proceed to trace the origins and causes of these ingredients. Herbert Osgood, Clarence Alvord
                    and others, cognizant of the purposes of the British government in establishing and developing a
                    mercantilist empire and cognizant of the various British political, economic, and social instruments
                    and agencies used in trying to implement those purposes, undertook to discover and relate how
                    successfully the instruments achieved the purposes. George Bancroft, Frederick Turner and others,
                    duly impressed with what they considered the American type of democracy or way of life, including a
                    large measure of political equality and individual freedom secured by its own peculiar <list type="footnotes">

                    manifestations of examples of these things on the American shores and in observing their
                    development, emphasizing in it all the part played by the colonists themselves and by their
                    environment. The facts and materials handled by the imperialist and by the nationalist historians
                    are obviously very largely the same. Results that are the concern of the imperialists on the one
                    hand may in turn constitute in many cases the causes assembled and arranged by the nationalists.
                    That is, if the imperialist historian explains fully all of the workings-out of the results of
                    imperial objectives in their relation to the co-operation as well as the resistance of the colonists
                    in their new and changing environment and if the nationalist historian explains fully the origins
                    and development of the causes of the new culture, the two will just about tell the same story and
                    come out at the same place even though they may start from different points of view. For a historian
                    to assume that either the imperialist or the nationalist approach is <hi rend="i">per se</hi> the
                    better would be to make the mistake of implying the possibility of attaching quantitative values to
                    certain aspects of heredity and of environment as historical factors. While some biologists today
                    talk as though they believe that the modification of living organisms is 99% heredity
                    through the rearrangement of the genes and while some behaviorist psychologists talk as though the
                    matter were 99% environment and conditioning, the historian, I believe, must assume that
                    in the actions and reactions between the individual and the environment, which after all constitute
                    the raw materials of history, individual heredity and environment are both absolutely indispensable.
                    consequently, in a case wherein the reduction of one of two factors to zero inevitably results in
                    the total disappearance of the other as well, the attempt to fix quantitative values to either or
                    even to hold that one is more important than the other is pointless and childish.</p>
            <p>It is not here claimed that the nationalist historian interprets everything by environment and the
                    imperialist historian by heredity or vice versa. It is not as simple as that. Rather each is
                    inclined to emphasize certain aspects of both factors. The nationalist historian in the matter of
                    heredity is inclined to emphasize the things that the colonist brought over inside of him, such <hi rend="bold">as</hi> initiative, drive, and tenacity, as well <hi rend="bold">as</hi> ideas,
                    beliefs, and experiences with Old-world practices, while the imperialist in the matter of heredity
                    is probably a little more interested in the things that the colonist brought over here which
                    accompanied or followed him but which in a <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-045-2-007"/> way were external to
                    him. These included all the instruments and agencies of sovereignty, of repulation, and of
                    direction, including such material things as charteis, acts of Parliament, commissions and
                    instructions and such personal instruments as royal govcriiol<hi rend="sup">*</hi>s,
                    customs officials, and naval and military personnel. Obviously all of these, whetlier internal or
                    external, from one point of view were parts of the colonist's heritage, biological or
                    social. Obviously too, the externals mentioned above in turn became part of the colonist's
                    larger environment after he got over here. Furthermore, everything that the colonist brought over
                    here inside of him in the way oi capacity, ideas and experience, in one sense, he had inherited from
                    the mother country. That is. the American colonist did not start from scratch. Our history, if we
                    omit the Indians, does not begin with primitives. To the imperalist natural environment and New
                    World conditions are likely more often to enter into the picture as obstacles in the way of the
                    working out of the British objectives, whereas to the nationalist they more often appear as
                    oppoihnities for the useful innovations by the free-thinking colonists. The nationalist, perceiving
                    that sonic of the colonists like John Wintlirop, Thomas Hooker, and Roger Williams were probably iii
                    every respect the equal of Oliver Croniqell, John Lock, and John Miltonk, even though they were
                    obliged to play their parts on a snialler stage, is probably inclined too much to assume that
                    because the first Ameiicaiis clanie on the American stage full grown they, like Athena, had sprung
                    full-growll from the brow of Jo\e. He does not always take the trouble to give due consideration to
                    the extent to which these individuals had been moulded by England. However., once being given these
                    individuals, the nationalist is probably justified in placing the emphasis upon the quality of these
                    individuals and the nature of the physical environment as the determining factors in the course of
                    events rather than upon the effectiveness of the force and authority exercised by the Empire. He is
                    entirely correct in assuming that the application of force, even when applied by a so-called
                    sovereign authority can only produce negative and never positive results. If thoroughly and
                    effectively applied, force can repress, obstruct, and destroy, but never impel or create. At most it
                    can only change the direction of an already existing movement or trend by repressing or destroying
                    certain aspects of the movement, thereby allowing certain other remaining aspects of the movement
                    freedom to develop, provided always that there is in the people the will, the energy, and the
                    capacity to <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-045-2-008"/> carry the remaining aspects forward. Force can even
                    destroy obstacles in the path of these remaining aspects of the movement, leaving a clear road for
                    the advance, but it can never drive the people down that road if they are determined unto death not
                    to go or if they lack the ability to do so. Institutions then came into being and grew in the
                    colonies, in the view of the nationalists, not so much because they were planted here by the
                    government of the mother country of Europe, but because the colonists, familiar with old-country
                    institutions, reproduced on their own accord those with which they were familiar and which they
                    liked, including of course some that the mother country urged. According to this view the colonists
                    also accepted the form of other institutions that the mother country tried to force upon them, but
                    changed the substance rather completely, and finally they tried out some institutions in harmony
                    with new ideas of their own, sometimes with failure and sometimes with marked success and abiding
                    consequences. From this point of view, then, New-World environment and past experience were the
                    really decisive factors. Imperial force and control handicapped by distance was in the long run not
                    very effective except in cases where it re-enforced colonial tendencies. The New World was thus
                    essentially a laboratory wherein new ideas and old experiences were being rather freely adapted to a
                    rather new and peculiar environment.</p>
            <p>The imperialists on the other hand are justified in replying that not only did the Empire through its
                    means of defense and other means destroy in the path of the general development of the colonies
                    obstacles that might have been absolutely fatal and that besides offering and suggesting useful ways
                    of doing things which might in some instances have been adopted by the colonists anyway because they
                    conformed with the ideas and experiences of the pro-imperialist parties in the colonies, it imposed
                    in other instances ways which might never have been thought of by the colonists if they had not been
                    suggested to them by the statesmen of the mother country. Finally the imperialists may point out
                    that some regulations and patterns were imposed that were absolutely contrary to the wishes of even
                    the effective majority of the colonists. In the latter case the colonists if they could not evade
                    the regulations had the choice of submitting or resorting to a life-and-death struggle. This
                    struggle was so long deferred, both in the case of the English and of the Spanish colonies, that
                    there was time for enduring effects upon the history of the colonies concerned.</p>
            <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-045-2-009"/>
            <p>By way of illustrating some of the general statements just made, one may point out a few things that
                    took place in the political, economic, and social adaptations and changes in the colonies. When the
                    colonists came to the New World, the authority of the king theoretically and legally followed them.
                    They could not and perhaps did not wish to slough off their allegiance to their king. Something,
                    however, happened when they crossed the Atlantic. Back in the old country the king was a very
                    present thing—very near and very real. Every day many concrete reminders of his authority
                    and activity confronted them. The evidences of the connection of the kings of the past with the
                    history of their country were many and important, but in the American wilderness not much could be
                    seen that would remind them either of the king, his authority, or his creations. In the old country
                    kings had held forth so long and government was so old that it was easy to assume that both went
                    back to divine ordination. But in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sa">America</country>
                    </placeName>there were no governments anywhere until after they had been set up by men. It was quite
                    obvious that men and not God were organizing the governments. Even the colonial governments that
                    were supposedly brought over from the mother country were in their original conception so hopelessly
                    out of harmony with the needs over here that mere men had out of necessity to do a lot of tinkering
                    and improvising before they would serve their purpose at all. It became very clear to most observers
                    that governments grew out of the needs of the situation and out of agreements of the people. At the
                    founding of some of the English colonies, the king issued charters granting conditional title to
                    land and authorizing a system of government. In the case of both <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Bay the charters were of the type adapted to the use of overseas trading corporations.
                    In the case of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> what would today be called the president, board of directors and controlling
                    stockholders of the corporation all remained in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. A kind of superintendent of production called the governor was sent by the corporation
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to be assisted by a supervisory council. The interesting thing, however, is that in
                    less than a generation the superintendent of production had turned out to be a political chief
                    executive and the supervisory council a kind of cabinet or upper house and a miniature house of
                    commons had been added. In the case of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Bay, the chief officers of the corporation came to the colonies and it was over here
                    that the stockholders' meetings were held. The Puritans who came into <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-045-2-010"/> control of the charter undertook to use it as a frame of government
                    within which they could try to solve the ancient problem of finding the perfect form of government.
                    This was to be done by the simple device of placing the government in control of God's
                    elect, who presumably would be both wise and honest unless one assumes that God did not use very
                    good judgment in choosing His companions for Glory-land. The Puritans fell short of achieving their
                    ideal not because they lacked the ability to stretch and bend the charter sufficiently to suit their
                    needs in that respect as well as in many others, but for the simple reason that God alone knew who
                    were the elect and the Puritans found no agreed-upon way of eliciting this information from Him.
                    Very soon therefore the government of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Bay consisted of chief executive, an upper house, and a lower house of deputies very
                    much as existed down in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. The colonists who went to <placeName>

                    and electing one of their number as a kind of Biblical judge to construe the statutes and make the
                    applications with the assistance of a dozen elders elected by the settlers. It transpired, however,
                    that in a very short time the Biblical judge began to conduct himself very much as did the governors

                    issues on the basis of common sense and past experience, leaving to the judge and to the elders
                    little more than the sometimes difficult task of finding the appropriate text in the Bible that
                    might with some stretch of the imagination serve as the legal basis for decisions already made. Far
                    be it from us to maintain that the charters and directives did not have a moulding and a restraining
                    influence upon the development of colonial political institutions, but when one realizes that some
                    colonies started with charters for trading companies, some with medieval feudal proprietary grants,
                    and some with no authorization at all; when one realizes that some had definite ideas with which
                    they wished to experiment and that some like Penn <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-045-2-011"/> had no
                    definite ideas to try out at all but believed that if free to experiment they could work out
                    something, one is amazed at the fact that in spite of charters 01– absence of charters,
                    transitory ideals and voluntary changes of proprietary governments to royal colonies, in all
                    important essentials the colonies very soon became very much alike. The fact is the majority of
                    colonists were after all Englishmen that had all inherited a common experience, and while the
                    environment differed from colony to colony in important respects the most fundamental features of
                    the environment of the wilderness were everywhere the same. As a result, in the things that they did
                    and made similarities were more important than differences.</p>

                    </placeName> free in most respects to provide for their local needs, was not lost upon the
                    colonists. When the independent states came to form the Constitutional compact in 1787, they
                    provided for a central government that exercised for the most part the identical powers that the
                    British government had tried to exercise before the Revolution, in some cases without protest from
                    the colonies and in some cases over their objections and evasions. But the experience with the
                    British Empire was not the only experience that the colonists: had had in the matters of
                    governmental unions. From the very beginning. the colonists had experimented with governmental
                    compacts between individuals and between local governments. Formation of government by compact in
                    the Old World was at best only a matter for philosophical speculation, but in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sa">America</country>
                    </placeName> it was a practical reality. Settlers made governments almost as casually as they built
                    their houses. They experimented with organizing and operating confederacies of varying types. The
                    Rhode Island confederacy was made up of two Bible commonwealths, one pure democracy, and one
                    political association that approached about as nearly to a system of deliberate and studied anarchy
                    as was ever set up in America. The <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> Confederacy was made up of two unitary representative democracies, one confederacy, and
                    one government that might be called a federal union. Hence it becomes difficult to decide whether
                    the framers of the Constitution of 1787 were more influenced in the matter of distribution of powers
                    between the central government and the states and in the <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-045-2-012"/> matter
                    of division of powers between the three departments of government by their own experiments or
                    experiments that were initiated in Britain.</p>
            <p>In the economic history of the colonies probably nothing played a more important part than the
                    possession of land. Theoretically before the discovery of America the continent belonged to no one,
                    since the Indians were not Christians and did not count. By right of discovery absolute legal title
                    to all the land in a given drainage area passed to that king who first in person or through an agent
                    discovered a part of that drainage system. The colonists never legally owned any land. They held it
                    directly or indirectly of the king on stipulated conditions. Now in the old country where all the
                    land was occupied and had been held for generations and had changed hands many times through
                    purchase, inheritance, feudal grant, and conquest, the beginnings of proprietorship were lost in a
                    hazy past. It was not easy to visualize the origins and rational basis of the theory of ownership.

                        <country reg="sa">America</country>
                    </placeName> on the other hand with millions of acres of wild land occupied and used by no one it
                    was difficult to subscribe to the validity and reality of the king's ownership merely
                    because someone had happened to cross the ocean and had seen a part of a coastline a thousand miles
                    away. Common sense dictated the conclusion that the wild, unoccupied land still belonged to no one
                    if it did not belong to the Indians. To the colonist it was obvious that the unoccupied land was
                    practically without value till man had done something to it. It was obvious too to the humble
                    colonists that this land should really belong to the people who would occupy it and improve it. They
                    frequently proved to their own satisfaction the validity of this view by settling on the frontier
                    without taking the trouble to secure a formal title and by escaping year after year the collector of
                    quitrents. True enough, colonies that held grants from the king naturally urged the validity of
                    those grants in competition with rival colonies, and wealthy land speculators who had bought up land
                    warrants based upon the imperial theory were anxious to support its validity. The common people, on
                    the other hand, for the most part were inclined to feel that the function of governments was
                    practically exhausted in this matter in witnessing and warranting the legal title to the man who had
                    acquired first possession, and was making it productive. This view continued after the colonial
                    period had passed and was urged with increasing vigor and success against the Federal government.</p>

            <p>Naturally in most aspects of the social development of the English colonies, imperial control was
                    perhaps less effective than were the ideas, the memories of experiences and practices that the
                    settlers brought over in their heads and the influences of the new environment upon these ideas and
                    practices unless possibly it might be in the field of religion. In the case of England, religion was
                    a matter of state authority. The king was the head of the state in things spiritual as well as
                    secular. In all of the Southern colonies the Anglican church was either assumed to be the
                    established church from the founding of the colonies or was made so by the passage of specific
                    colonial acts. The settlers that came in the great migration to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Bay and from there went to the other <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> colonies belonged for the most part to that branch of Puritanism that had remained in
                    the Anglican church and wanted to remain there, but wished to change it still farther away from
                    Catholicism. What happened in the case of both the Southern and <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> colonies was still further change from the English pattern. In <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName>, the colonists made the changes in ritual, belief, and church government that they had

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or had come to want in America. They finally realized that the resultant church was
                    really so different from the Anglican that they called it the <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> Way or Congregationalism. In the Southern colonies, there was then theoretically an
                    Episcopal church, but without an <hi rend="i">episcopus</hi>. This was certainly for that kind of
                    church a fundamental omission. The Bishop of <placeName>

                    </placeName> had nominal supervision but with the exception of the rather ineffective efforts of
                    James Blair and Thomas Bray each parish and church in the South was almost completely under the
                    direction of the ten or twelve vestrymen chosen either by themselves, the church members, or the
                    freeholders. Except for the fact that the twelve men elected by the congregation in <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> were called elders, the fundamental facts of church government were not very different
                    in the two sections. In the church in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, in which Washington sometimes
                    worshipped, the minister's pulpit with the open Bible rather than the altar occupied the
                    most prominent position in the center of the front of the church. This was of course significant.
                    Unless the church happened to have a rector ordained in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> there was little more than the use of the prayer book that would continue to tie the

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    </placeName> were really the reflection of the differences of the people of the two regions rather
                    than the result of any imposition from without.</p>
            <p>Among historians who have written from the imperialist point of view there are perhaps a few to whom
                    the approach implied conviction that it was the only sound approach. Some of them, strongly
                    influenced by the idea of the integrity of western civilization. have believed that the only proper
                    way of interpreting the history of the countries of the Western Hemisphere was to treat them as an
                    extension of European history beyond the seas. A modification of this view is held by those
                    believers in the solidarity of Anglo-Saxon civilization who have from time to time envisaged a
                    reunion of the United States with the British Commonwealth of Nations and who look upon the American
                    Revolution and the period of independent history of the United States as a mere interruption and
                    even a kind of unfortunate interruption in that outward unity. The latter. may be correct, but they
                    cannot be sure that liberty and self-government would have developed either in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or in the United States or in the British Dominions in the way that it has without the
                    American Revolution. Those who believe in interpreting the history of the Western Hemisphere as a
                    mere extension of European history may be right, but it is still much too early to say so with any
                    degree of finality. We do not know whether we are at present in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sa">America</country>
                    </placeName> in the opening pages of the chapter of a new civilization or near the close of an old
                    one. The answer depends upon the length and richness and direction of the future development of some
                    of the nations of the Western Eleniisphei. and upon the extent of the decline of western European
                    activity. When one disagrees with Arnold Toynbee as to the content of his extinct and arrested
                    civilizations, Toynbee can in those cases argue back with at least the assurance that the facts so
                    far as accomplishment is concerned are all in. Not so with his content of western civilization.
                    There is still the possibility that American civilization will continue so long and attain such
                    specialized and unique development that the colonies in the Western Hemisphere would not be
                    considered even by Mr. Toynbee as the mere extension of an old civilization but the beginnings of a
                    great new civilization. This new civilization would of course Ire more closely related to western
                    European civilization than to some of the others that he has with some justification segregated but
                    might nevertheless take its own rather unique place within the unity of all human civilization.</p>

            <p>The "imperial school of American colonial historians" may be defined as that group
                    of historians dealing with the British colonies in the American hemisphere prior to 1753 whose
                    fundamental approach to their subject is based upon the assumption that, since those colonies were
                    integral parts of the British Empire, their history should be studied as the history of parts of the
                    Empire. This point of approach contrasts sharply with that of the "nationalist"
                    school of historians of the United States, of which the most notable examples are perhaps George
                    Bancroft and John Fiske, and of which the most notable recent exponent is Edward
                    Channing—a school of historians who investigate the colonial period chiefly, if not
                    exclusively, with the objective of finding there the origins of the United States—of
                    which, of course, the British-Americans of the colonial period never even dreamed! Thus, where the
                    nationalist sees national origins, the imperial Historical sees the development of institutions
                    within the framework and organic interrelationships of that conglomerate aggregation of widely
                    differing economic, social, and political entities known as the "old British
                    empire." The nationalist historian sees the history of thirteen of these many differing
                    entities as something unique, for in it he finds the origins and the foundations of a great nation;
                    to the imperial historian, when he pushes his position to its logical conclusion, the so-called
                    "thirteen" are merely some of the parts of a much larger phenomenon, the British
                    Empire as a whole, which was itself only one of the major incidents in the expansion of European
                    civilization round the world.</p>

                    soil, and the adaptation of them to new wants and altered modes of life … The history of
                    the American colonies is in one sense nothing more than a continuation of English history
                    … The colonies did indeed one and all form for themselves institutions closely resembling
                    those of the mother country. But these institutions were developed, not transplanted or servilely
                        copied."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    John Fiske, to throw off their nationalistic provincialism and bias and write of the colonies in the
                    moods of the Englishmen and the British-Americans of the pre-Revolutionary era. Those American
                    historians who managed it have introduced a new mood and a new perspective into American

            <p>The most notable American exponents of the imperial school of colonial historians are Herbert Levi
                    Osgood, George Louis Beer, Charles McLean Andrews, and Lawrence Henry Gipson.</p>
            <p>Osgood was the first important American historian of the colonial period to react against the narrow
                    nationalistic bias of George Bancroft. A pupil of John W. Burgess, who was one of the major stars in
                    the galaxy of German-trained, so-called "scientific" historians, Osgood was
                    convinced that the colonial phase of American history should be studied as "a natural
                    outgrowth of the history of Europe." Thus the task he set himself when he began his
                    monumental study of the thirteen colonies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was a twofold
                    one. His own description of his effort is given in the preface to <hi rend="i">The American Colonies
                        in the Seventeenth Century</hi> as follows: "The entire work, while serving as an
                    introduction to American institutional history, will at the same time, it is hoped, illustrate the
                    principles of British colonization, so far as those were revealed in the early relations between the
                    home government and its colonies on the North American continent."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus on the one side, the origin and development of American institutions; on the other, the origin
                    and development of British policy and the institutions of colonial administration and control;
                    policy and institutions an understanding of which is so essential to any real understanding of the
                    colonies and their history—or even of the history of the later United States, for that
                    matter. But Osgood concerned himself only with the colonies on the continent of North America. His
                    major interest was centered, after all, upon the origins of the institutions of the later United
                    States. Thus while his perspective was a much broader one than that of his nationalistic
                    predecessors, he assumed that it was unnecessary for him to concern himself with any of the British
                    colonies other than the thirteen that eventually seceded from the Empire. Osgood is thus both an
                    historian of the colonies and an historian of the United States. As Charles M. Andrews wrote of
                    Osgood's history, it was "not British history, nor yet American history in any
                    narrow and <list type="footnotes">

                    American than British and growing more and more American with every decade that passes."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The important thing about Osgood is that he realized, more than any other American historian of his
                    generation, perhaps, the fact that the history of the British colonies in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sa">America</country>
                    </placeName> in the eighteenth century could not be written without great error and distortion, even
                    from the nationalistic point of view, without considering thoroughly and carefully what he called
                    "the British side of the problem."</p>
            <p>The realization of the second of Osgood's objectives, however, the examination of what he
                    called "the British side of the problem," was not actually achieved by Osgood, but
                    by one of his pupils, George Louis Beer. Beer, indeed, disclaimed any direct intention of writing
                    any part of the history of the United States. As he put it, in the preface to his volume <hi rend="i">on British Colonial Policy, 1754–1765</hi>, this "is a study of
                    British policy during the critical period of the old Empire. Thus the essay belongs distinctly to
                    the domain of British history; but to the extent that English and American development were then
                    inseparable. it also, but more indirectly, falls within the field occupied by American history. The
                    focus of interest is, however, the British Empire, and not the rise of the American
                        hisntioll."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Beer, then, his task was logically to investigate one aspect of the history of the British Empire.
                    Any elucidation of the history of the United States that might result was for him purely
                    coincidental. But he adhered conscientiously to the historical logic of his position, and his
                    achievement is significant not merely because he made a major contribution to historical knowledge,
                    but also because he succeeded in completely freeing himself from the bias of nationalism.</p>

                    simply feels that those origins can be seen and understood only in terms of <hi rend="i">all</hi>
                    the British colonies in America, and of their relations with each other and with the mother country.</p>
            <p>Thus, in the preface of his <hi rend="i">magnum opus</hi> he says: "I have had no intention
                    of adding another account to the existing histories of the thirteen original colonies. I have been
                    convinced for many years that to place the colonies in their rightful historical setting and so to
                    discover what our colonial history is all about, it would be necessary to reexamine the evidence
                    from a vantage point other than that usually taken, to view them not from within, as is commonly
                    done, but from without, with the movement constantly forward, following the natural course of
                    historical development, and disregarding all preconceptions based on later events. For this purpose
                    I have approached the subject from the English end, from the land whence the colonists came and of
                    which they were always legally a part, and have broadened the scope of my inquiry to include all
                    England's colonial possessions in the West that were founded in the seventeenth century. I
                    have done this because I believe that final conclusions must always rest upon the experiences
                    England had with all, not a part, of her colonies. That some of these colonies remained British
                    while others became American does not, historically speaking, enter in as a determining
                        factor."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be observed, of course, that Andrews' interest is still in the early period of
                    "our history"—a phrase that he uses repeatedly. He is apparently at
                    heart still a nationalist, just as Osgood was; his originality lay in his method of determining just
                    what the truth in this early period of "our history" was. That is to say, he was
                    convinced that any history of the "thirteen original colonies" that omitted a
                    discussion of the British West Indies, on the one hand, or of the institutional development of the
                    mother country relative to the colonies, on the other, could only result in a distortion of the
                    truth. Thus to understand "our history," one must see <list type="footnotes">

                    American Empire.</p>
            <p>But Andrews succeeded in doing what neither Beer nor Osgood had succeeded in doing. For he was able
                    to describe both the internal institutional developments of the colonies and the British
                    institutions of colonial administration, together with the relationships between them, all together
                    in his one great work.</p>
            <p>But it is Lawrence H. Gipson who has carried the position of the Imperial School to its logical
                    conclusion. For Gipson's work is concerned with the British Empire between 1750 and 1776 as
                    such; and, except for the warm blast against Tom Paine, George Bancroft, and the historical
                    distortions perpetrated by the nationalist school that appears in the beginning of volume six,
                    Gipson writes his history much as a man of 1760 might have written it, as though the United States
                    had never existed. He has succeeded, about as nearly as anyone might be expected to do, in divesting
                    himself of the American habit of seeing the colonial period through the distorting haze of the
                    history of the United States —even, indeed, of the "our history" mood
                    of Andrews.</p>
            <p>The title of Gipson's work indicates his position: <hi rend="i">The British Empire before
                        the American Revolution</hi>. His history, as it is projected, must, of course, include the
                    history of the change in attitude on the part of the Americans of the thirteen colonies that led
                    them, in the thirty-odd years before 1776, to change from contented British subjects into a body of
                    Americans fired with a hatred of England and determined upon independence. But Gipson's
                    work is, nevertheless, primarily a history of the old Empire in that period. And, since it is that,
                    it is not limited to the colonies in the American hemisphere, but includes all the colonies of the
                    Empire, including those of Africa and India; further, as it is a history of the Empire as a whole
                    and not just the colonies, it must needs discuss all the other parts of the Empire as well,
                    including Britain itself. Gipson begins about 1760; for, as he says, "to get a view of the
                    old Empire in a state of tranquillity and equilibrium for the last time in its history one must
                    indeed turn to the brief period between the end of the War of the Austrian Succession and the
                    outbreak of hostilities <pb n="129" id="VAA4025-045-2-021"/> between the English and French in North
                    America that led to the great Seven Years' War."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Gipson is primarily and exclusively an historian of the old British Empire. The problem he sets
                    himself is much broader than that of either Osgood, Beer, or Andrews; his approach to history is
                    much broader, also; for where they are historians of institutions, Gipson is an historian of
                    civilization, covering social phenomena, military and economic history, and other aspects of life as
                    well as political events and institutions. He is concerned little, if at all, with the history of
                    the United States, although he does give a little greater emphasis to the American British colonies
                    than he does to the British colonies elsewhere in the world, and although in any discussion of
                    imperial history in the years between 1750 and 1775 the reasons for the American Revolution and the
                    formation of the United States must inevitably appear.</p>
            <p>These, then, are the chief American exponents of the imperial school of colonial historians. Osgood,
                    Beer, and Andrews appear to belong, in the last analysis, to the so-called German school of
                    "scientific" history. Their works are all primarily institutional histories; and
                    all three of these writers, particularly Beer and Andrews, base their conclusions largely upon
                    original source materials of an "official" documentary sort. As Andrews says,
                    "The historian, if he is to keep both his levels and his proportions true, cannot fail to
                    stress, first of all, the institutional and structural aspects of colonial life, which, despite
                    certain present-day opinions to the contrary, are fundamental to any right understanding of the
                    colonial past."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Gipson, on the other hand, is more of a social
                    historian. As he says, his work "makes no attempt to institutionalize the old British
                    Empire but is concered rather with an analysis of some of those forces—economic, social,
                    and political—motivating various geographical groups within it before the American
                        Revolution."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> His work, too, is based predominantly upon official

                    human history. As Andrews says, however, "if he [the historian] is honest to himself and
                    his evidence he cannot neglect the imponderable forces (always most difficult to identify and
                    trace), as well as the driving influence of emotional and mass psychology. These factors are
                    essential, however much those who can see in society, present and past, only things that are
                    ‘real’ and ‘practical’… and consider
                    irrelevant whatever cannot be pinned down as a social or economic activity. No one should deal with
                    the past whose ambition it is to find a single cause for all that has happened or who is unwilling
                    to admit the existence of many causes acting simultaneously."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> He
                    quotes J. M. Keynes to the effect that "‘The view that the economic ideal is the
                    sole respectable purpose of the community as a whole is the most dreadful heresy which has ever
                    gained the ear of a civilized people.’"<hi rend="sup">10</hi> And Andrews
                    himself continues, "Modern industrialism would seem to be responsible for these latter-day
                    attempts to interpret the past in the light of the present and to apply the Marxian doctrine that
                    social progress is the outcome of class conflict and of nothing else."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>It is of considerable interest to notice that, with the exception of Beer, the historians of this
                    group share some of the basic positions of the so-called "frontier school" of
                    American historians symbolized by Frederick Jackson Turner. For Osgood, Andrews, and Gipson all
                    appear to accept, in one degree or another, the proposition that the culture inherited from the
                    mother country underwent so profound a modification or differentiation in the course of replanting
                    and new growth in the new environment as to make the product of this adaptation an essentially new
                    variant of the broad culture pattern of western civilization. Andrews describes the colonies in the
                    eighteenth century as having "marked individual and sectional differences that made
                    cooperation difficult and union practically impossible, each moving forward in its own sphere toward
                    a popular and local management <list type="footnotes">

                    certain ideas regarding government, law, land tenure, and finance that were not in accord with
                    English precedent and usage. In these conflicts and divergences of the eighteenth century are to be

                    that which was English slowly and imperceptibly merged into that which was American—has
                    never been adequately told; but it is a fascinating phase of history, more interesting and
                    enlightening when studied against the English background than when construed as an American problem
                    only. It is the story of the gradual elimination of those elements, feudal and proprietary, that
                    were foreign to the normal life of a frontier land, and of the gradual adjustment of the colonies to
                    the restraints and restrictions that were imposed upon them by the commercial policy of the mother
                    country. It is the story also of the growth of the colonial assemblies … It is above all
                    … the story of the gradual transformation of these assemblies from the provincial
                    councils that the home government intended them to be into miniature parliaments. At the end of a
                    long struggle … they emerged powerful legislative bodies, as self-conscious in their way
                    as the House of Commons in <placeName>

                    England or of Europe under the influence of the local American geographic and ethnic environment as
                    manifestations of the Turnerian process in the formation of cultures, these historians in effect
                    relate the Turner thesis to the larger process of European expansion. The result seems to be that
                    the American frontier becomes the frontier of western civilization, to be sure, but one in which
                    both the processes of continuity and the processes of new cultural growth are going on together to

                    cases sharply different cultural variants of western civilization. Further, as the history of the
                    "old British empire" is a part of the expansion of Europe in general, these
                    historians, particularly Beer, Osgood, and Gipson, along with Francis Parkman, relate the
                    development of the British colonies, in one way or another, to the parallel developments of their
                    non-British neighbors; although it is Herbert E. Bolton and his students who have made the most
                    conscious and deliberate efforts to relate the Anglo-Saxon colonial expansion in this hemisphere to
                    that of the other colonizing European nations.</p>
            <p>The broadened perspective of the imperial school of colonial historians, and their effort to see the
                    British-American colonial phenomenon in terms of its organic relationship with Britain and the rest
                    of the Empire seems to be a refutation, for this particular group, at least, of Professor C. J. H.

                    past seventy years has been the tendency to turn away from European themes and to concentrate upon
                    strictly American."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> This generalization is probably in a general
                    sense true. And it is also doubtless true, as Professor Hayes says, that the vogue of the restricted
                    interpretation of the American frontier that sees it as "a peculiarly American phenomenon,
                    determining the unique character of our national society and culture," and "the
                    concurrent neglect of broader and otherwise obvious considerations, have been … at once a

                    combat it. To quote Andrews again, "American writers, except in an incidental way, have
                    ignored the English side of the story, because it was English and therefore out of their range if
                    not beyond their ken … The time must come, however, when this duality of interest will be

            </p>
            <p>Gipson is even more deliberate in his effort to correct the errors of provincial American
                    nationalism. As he puts it in the preface to Volume VI of his monumental description of the British
                    Empire before the American Revolution, "In the present work one of the motives that
                    dictated the selection of topics and space allotted to each of these has been a desire to emphasize
                    certain important aspects of the history of this conflict [The Seven Years' War] that have
                    been, it would seem, especially subject to popular misconceptions and even to serious
                    misinterpretations on the part of many historians and of others who are not."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> And among the chief of these misconceptions, fathered by Tom Paine and propagated by
                    George Bancroft, was the idea "that the connection of Americans with monarchical Great
                    Britain, far from being a blessing, had actually been a curse …."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The imperial school of colonial historians, then, may be said to be distinguished by its deliberate
                    effort to relate what was going on in British America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to
                    what was going on in Europe at the same time, thereby placing the history of this continent in a
                    more correct perspective relative to the development of western civilization as a whole. While they
                    do seem to accept, if with some caution, the Turner hypothesis of the formation of new cultures,
                    they relate that hypothesis to the great phenomenon, the expansion of Europe. In doing so it would
                    appear that they, perhaps more than any other group of historians interested primarily in American
                    history, have escaped the limitations of nationalistic bias or myopia. It might even be suggested
                    that an attitude toward American <list type="footnotes">

            <p>For many years the economic interpretation of history was the popular one with American historians.
                    The economic influence, however, is not the only one with which to reckon. Man does not live by
                    bread alone. Certainly his art, literature, and religion are as important as his material
                    development. Charles Beard who has been regarded as the leading economic determinist modified his
                    views to a considerable extent before his death. He is quoted as saying, "I have never been
                    able to discover an all pervading determinism in history." In the last few years there has
                    been a new interest in the cultural approach to history. The economic emphasis has perhaps had its
                    inning and the pendulum seems to be swinging at the present time toward the cultural emphasis. Such
                    notable collections, largely on the cultural aspects of history as may be found at the Newberry

            <p>Now it is generally recognized that in the field of American cultural history Anglo-American cultural
                    relations loom large. America's cultural heritage from England has been far greater than
                    from any other country, greater than many realize or are willing to admit. Whether one's
                    ancestors came from England or from other lands beyond the sea makes no difference. All have shared
                    in this inheritance. Why is it important to stress this point, it might be queried. For one thing it
                    is probably easier to arouse anti-British feeling in this country than it is against any other
                    country. Old prejudices based on impressions gained from misguided and distorted history textbooks
                    of a previous generation still persist. There are forces always ready and willing to cater to this
                    sentiment. Everyone will remember the campaign waged along this line not so many years ago in the
                    two largest cities in the United States. A book was published bearing the intriguing title <hi rend="i">England Expects Every American to do his Duty</hi>. It was an attempt to prove how we
                    had been made the dupe of the English.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>I, for one, believe that the future of our civilization depends upon the close co-operation of the
                    two great English-speaking nations. Such co-operation can flourish only in an atmosphere of good
                    understanding and friendship. This, in turn, in large measure grows out of a knowledge of our common
                    culture.</p>

            <p>The close contact of the colonial planters of the southern colonies with the mother country is well
                    known. They made frequent visits to the old home. They sent their sons to be educated in the great

                    swimming the horses, of making a fire at night in the woods where he slept and dried himself,
                    frequently wet to the skin. Upon his return to England he could write his

                    England and America. He also had a prominent part in co-operation with another Friend, David
                    Barclay, in the founding of the Friends Boarding School at Ackworth, in Yorkshire, which became a

                    suffered the most severely of all the dissenting sects.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> It was only with the
                    Glorious Revolution of 1689 when toleration was extended to all dissenters that this persecution
                    ceased. George Fox is said to have been imprisoned eight different times in this period as a
                    blasphemer, heretic, and seducer and was at least on one occasion threatened with death by hanging.

                    began to study. It started a train of thought in the mind of the farmer. He had been destroying
                    plants and blossoms for years and he knew nothing about them. He took up Latin in order to learn the

                    more unassuming man with less thought of self never lived. He was thoroughly devoted to a cause,
                    that cause being freedom for the slaves. He was a great lover of humanity. William Ellery Channing
                    once referred to the Journal of John Woolman as "beyond comparison the sweetest and purest
                    autobiography in the language." Charles Lamb also exclaimed "Get the writing of
                    Jchn Woolman by heart." Woolman died on a trip to England in the interests of antislavery
                    in 1772 and was buried in the city of York. His fame was greater in <placeName>

                    Sevcral years before the outbreak of the Revolution, he went to that country and remained there to
                    the end of his life. He became the favorite court painter of George III and the successor of Sir
                    Joshua Reynolds as president of the Royal Academy. Until his death in 1820, a stream of young
                    American painters including John S. Copley, Gilbert Stuart, John Trumbull, and Charles Willson Peale

                    or may not be true is that one day in the presence of George III he replied to a question by
                    remarking "I cannot say that the calamities of my native country can ever give me
                    pleasure." The king, placing his hand on West's shoulder, graciously said,
                    "The man who does not love his own country can never make a faithful subject of another nor
                    a true friend." Upon the death of this "father of American Painting,"

            <p>The enchantment proved to be a lasting one and Logan Pearsall Smith joined the ranks of literary

                    </placeName>. Many years later in 1837, Joseph visited the United States. In the course of three
                    years he visited every corner and remote region where Friends were settled giving them aid and
                    encouragement. Rufus Jones says, "He gave distinction to the Society which it had not to
                    the same degree received since the birth period of Quakerism."</p>
            <p>On the occasion of this missionary journey, Joseph Gurney attended the yearly meeting of the Friends
                    in Indiana at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He reached the town from the east traveling over what he calls "the great
                    Western road," which he found crowded with movers. "Immigration," he
                    writes in his memoirs, "seems the order of the day." Already steps had been taken
                    to establish a <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Gurney, who had been an influential teacher at Ack-worth, made a donation to the
                    proposed school, which was later increased by his widow. Other English Friends also came forward
                    with gifts. The school modeled after similar ones in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, opened as a boarding school of high standing in 1847. It received a charter from the
                    state a few years later as Earlham College, named for the home of the Gurneys in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>There were many precedents for the gifts received by Earlham from England. Without such aid many of
                    the colonial colleges could not have been established. English names were given to a number of
                    them—for example, <placeName>

            <p>One cannot help but notice a close resemblance of some of the buildings on the Earlham campus with
                    their red brick and white wood trim, small windows, cornice decoration, and doorways to some of the

                    the agreement, he was starting with the opportunity of sharing equally in the returns from unpaid
                    accounts if they could be collected. This would be a fairly comfortable sum, $844.57, of
                    which he considered $293.78 as "bad."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> He also
                    assumed most of the responsibilities for the successful direction of the business, in a field where

                    Potawatomi annuity for two years. The total demanded was fifty thousand dollars. There is also an

                    was still a clerk for his brother, so it seems certain that L. M. Taylor was dealing directly with
                    the Indians through his own outfits. Two other outfits were sent out, the Griggs and the Monease

            <p>A few more furs were sold to the same company to make a total of $249.22. A note was added

                    a market and provided for price fluctuations in his favor. Communications were so slow that market
                    prices were not known for some time on the frontier. The fur market was seasonal since most of the
                    season's catch was brought in April and May. The prices could be altered quickly, but
                    Taylor was in a position to receive any changes which favored him by the terms of this contract.</p>

            <p>This is not as complete as the inventory for 1830–1831. The chief differences are in a
                    larger stock of goods on hand, larger white accounts due, and a much smaller amount due from notes.
                    There is very little change in the amount owed by Indians. The 1830–1831 inventory showed
                    a larger credit account with Hanna. This inventory gives no information on the amount of goods sold

                    operate on a cash basis in his first year as a partner in the company.</p>
            <p>The question of location of the county seat had been settled by the fall of 1831, but the legality of
                    Taylor's claim <list type="footnotes">

                    affected Hanna and Taylor can be appreciated if one considers the seven letters written to Senator
                    Tipton by Samuel Hanna, Allen Hamilton, David H. Colerick, and James Barnett. It was a crucial year
                    in the community activities of the Company, because a failure to receive title to their tract of
                    land would permit Elisha B. Harris and his associates to receive the benefits of future sales, as
                    well as of the lots already sold. Taylor would lose the money already spent, much of the money he
                    had received for lot sales, and his dominance as a founder and donor to the town.</p>
            <p>The winter of 1832 also brought Taylor's confirmation of ownership of the disputed property
                    in the Gebo affair. The final terms, fifteen hundred dollars and four lots to Harris, John Bequette,
                    and Peter Gebo were harsh. Either Taylor's claims were not legally clear or the value
                    expected from the sale of town lots made a quick decision advisable. Clear titles to lots could now
                    be given to purchasers.</p>
            <p>The Black Hawk War was concluded in 1832, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the scene of a peculiar incident connected with the return of the troops. John D.
                    Defrees, publisher and editor of the St. <hi rend="i">Joseph Beacon</hi> had made an editorial
                    comment on the soldierly conduct of the Fortieth Regiment of the Indiana Militia, which did not see
                    action in the war. The regiment was returned through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and part of it encountered Defrees in the streets. He was threatened, although the
                    accounts conflicted as to whether he was knocked down. He was released by South Bend men who were
                    attracted by the confusion. The militia group then proposed to wreck the newspaper presses. They
                    were met on the stairs to the second floor room by Captain Anthony Defrees and six or seven armed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> citizens. John Defrees' uncle held the single approach for three or four hours
                    against the threat of the group of militia, which was later known as "the bloody
                    three-hundred." L. M. Taylor was one of four men who signed affidavits supporting

                    </placeName> is the best authenticated example of Taylor's business practices. J. H. and J.

                    </placeName>. Taylor sold them the merchandise needed at a moderate twenty per cent markup but with
                    no down payment. This establishment of a competitor on such favorable terms is only partially
                    explained by the statement that he had more goods than he needed.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> It is quite

                                    was writing to some of my friends I might have enclosed an advertisement to save me

            <p>The Potawatomi Indian treaties of October, 1832, are most significant to this study. The treaty of

                    </placeName> treaties were the last general treaties made with the Indians of Indiana. Four treaties
                    were made in 1834, nine in 1836, and one in 1837, but all were with individual bands.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> The movement in Indiana for internal improvements had progressed so far by 1832 that a
                    concerted effort was made for a final disposition of the Indian problem. The claims of the Indian
                    traders were presented for settlement at the negotiations and were made a part of the treaty terms.

                    shillings each, total price two dollars and fifty cents. The report to the War Department
                    "bought five ostrich feathers from L. M. Taylor at eight shillings each; total price five
                    dollars." That equals a difference of one hundred per cent. A further study will show
                    discrepencies of varying degree, but a total of about one-third price increase.</p>
            <p>There is a still greater discrepency when the invoices are checked against each other. We find that
                    the commissioners' invoice did not include many articles that were on Taylor's
                    list. At least $303.70 worth of merchandise was omitted from the commissioners'
                    list. The United States paid to the commissioners nearly one hundred per cent more than Taylor
                    received for the goods actually delivered to the Indians.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    Hamilton, R. N. Forsyth, and A. E. Van Ness. Many subcommittees of traders were appointed to pass on
                    the goods of their competitors. Samuel Hanna was present at the treaty and his name appears
                    twenty-five times on sub-committees for the commissioners. Taylor did not serve on any appraising
                    committees. Hanna was the senior partner of Hanna and Taylor, and it seems quite unlikely that
                    Taylor would have falsified the company's books in Hanna's presence.</p>
            <p>This evidence points to collusion and fraud by the commissioners or traders. The order for payment
                    was made out to Taylor if the formal certification was followed. The commissioners' invoice
                    was a fairly exact copy of Taylor's so they were aware of his prices. One can be sure his
                    original invoice represents a generous markup over its wholesale cost, and that $2,010.93
                    represented a good profit. In July, 1832, Taylor purchased twenty-four roram hats from Spafford and
                    Tellison for forty dollars, which cost the Indians five dollars a piece.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> If
                    Taylor received a payment of $3,000.49, he knew that it represented a sale not supported
                    by his books. If the money was paid directly to the commissioners and then to Taylor, the fraud
                    would involve others. The evidence certainly points to fraud against the federal government, but the
                    evidence is not conclusive enough to identify the offenders. If one-third to one-half of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> settlement money went to the white men concerned, rather than to the Indians, there was
                    a very large sum taken fraudulently from the United States Treasury to enrich the traders of
                    northern Indiana. The following amounts were awarded the Indians and were to pass through the hands
                    of the commissioners.</p>

            <p>The inventory of July 8, 1833, shows two noteworthy features. Colonel Taylor's accounts or
                    credit extension had grown much larger, and his store was receiving a share of the local civic
                    orders. Taylor had either extended much more liberal credit to the Indians than formerly, expecting
                    to collect them at the <placeName>

                    small down payments and notes were taken for the balance.</p>

            <p>He was expanding his merchandise volume rapidly, and table V shows that he was securing a very
                    general line of goods. He was becoming more closely bound to the economic life of the eastern coast
                    and less closely tied to the other middle western cities.</p>
            <p>There were two complicated real estate matters which demanded considerable attention at this time.
                    The cases involved land secured by Taylor from Chief Topenebee and Wymego, who was William Burnett.</p>
            <p>Taylor wrote to Cyrus Taber at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> on September 7, 1833, that "Old Baker" (Martin Baker) had influenced
                    Topenebee to give Baker a claim on a quarter section of land in LaPorte County. Topenebee had sold
                    the same land, the southwest quarter of section thirty-three, township thirty-eight, of range one
                    west, to Taylor in the spring of 1833. Baker's action could delay the President's
                    approval of the deeds. Taylor included affidavits of Topenebee and others that Taylor's
                    claim was the prior one. Taber was requested to see the Indian agent at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and clear the claim.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This letter to Taber was followed by another concerning the same deed, and one for land bought from
                    Wymego. It expresses an interesting view of Indian Bureau methods, and the dependence of Taylor upon
                    the courtesy of Edward A. Hannegan. Taylor suspected the Bureau of dilatory tactics which would
                    respond only to pressure, and the circumstances made him rely on Hannegan's acceptance of
                    the commission.</p>

            <p>The case of ‘Clrymego (William Burnett) involved Taylor with General Tipton. The Burnett

                    children. John, James, Abraham, Rebecca, and Nancy each were given two sections of land by the

            <p>The tone of this letter indicates that Taylor and Tipton were at cross purposes, and the Burnett
                    estate or other Indian affairs were the most likely points of contact between the two men. James
                    Burnett's son was William, or Wymego, whose deed was one of those mentioned by Taylor in

            <p>The treaties and settlements were opportunities to do a year's business in a few weeks.

            <p>The Taber letter does not explain which deeds were involved. It gives a picture of the difficulties
                    encountered when securing land from the Indians. Taylor always appealed to influential friends in
                    such cases. The side trip to Washington, D.C., was an effort which kept him from his business for an
                    additional time and would only be taken for a vital matter-.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> This is the first
                    time he mentioned the illnesses which he contracted on several of his eastern trips.</p>
            <p>A letter to Smith and Macy in August, 1834, illustrates one of the risks taken by the pioneer
                    merchant. His goods had arrived at <placeName>

                    $668.29, but he had carried insurance of five thousand dollars on his goods.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taylor wrote to General Marshall, Indian agent at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on November 23, 1834.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> He had not yet received the deed for
                    Wymego's land. Marshall had been authorized to buy out the Indian reserves in Indiana, and
                    Taylor offered to attend any councils held by the agent. He stated he had "considerable
                    claims" on the <geogName>Yellow River</geogName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> Indians. These claims had been accumulated since the Treaty of October 27, 1832, and
                    show that Taylor had been active in trading in those years. Senate Document 452 shows that fourteen
                    Potawatomi settlements were made from 1834 to 1837, but none list the names of the traders whose
                    claims were allowed.</p>
            <p>There was no newspaper in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> during this period, and most of the letters of the winter of 1834–1835 are
                    of minor importance, but it is possible to reconstruct Taylor's activities of that period
                    from his inventory made in the spring of 1835. The notes and white accounts had made a very large
                    increase. The Indian accounts are mostly from one season's trade since the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> settlement had been made in October, 1834. The item given for furs on hand may or may
                    not be for the full winter take, but since no outfits were listed for that year, Taylor probably
                    concentrated on business with the whites. A letter to Suydam and Sage, June 2, 1835, enclosed a
                    check for $2,290. endorsed by Alexes Coquillard to Hanna and Taylor.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> A study of his stocks on hand at the start of the winter season shows that most of his
                    supplies were used in credit sales to his white customers. The amount of goods stocked in the summer
                    of 1835 for the coming season more than doubled that bought in any previous year. Taylor obviously
                    chose to disregard the warnings he had previously found in <placeName>

                    where the University of Notre Dame is now located. He began the school by building a cabin and
                    chapel in May, 1834, and named it Sainte Marie des Lacs. It probably functioned for a short time but
                    was abandoned by 1835. Badin deeded the property to Bishop Bruté on condition that he

            <p>A letter to Suydam, Sage and Company, February 2, 1836, contains a very good clue to Colonel
                    Taylor's business ethics. He had been asked to collect a note from Henricks and Rush of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> for Suydam and Sage. Taylor regretted meddling in his neighbor's business and
                    would only promise to act if his observations showed the firm was in danger of failure. He gave a
                    conservative view of Henricks, and Rush, who were inclined toward spectacular methods.</p>
            <p>The South Bend <hi rend="i">Free Press</hi> became the third newspaper in the town's short
                    history on July 9, 1836. Its first issue reported a citizen meeting to determine the location of a
                    bridge over the <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName>. Colonel Taylor was secretary of the meeting
                    and made the motion that the street should be selected by vote. This was done and the Washington
                    street location was chosen.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The newspaper carried the notice of the dissolution of the partnership of Hanna and Taylor, effective
                    July 26, 1836.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> These are the only items which can be presented for this
                    period. The lack of records for the final year of partnership was probably due to the accounting
                    made with Hanna. The Letters and Orders Book does not contain any information and suggest that
                    Colonel Taylor did not intend to preserve copies of letters relating to this important transaction.
                    It prevents a comparison of the assets of Hanna and Taylor for the five years of its operation and
                    eliminates one year from the survey. Subsequent letters show the partnership ended in name but that
                    Taylor continued to rely extensively on Hanna. The step was a frequent one. The junior partner set
                    up his own establishment as soon as he was financially able to do so.</p>
            <p>One has a fairly satisfactory picture of the growth of Hanna and Taylor for the period from 1831 to
                    1835 in table VI since the data is not available for 1836. It will be seen that the store's
                    assets were approximately doubled, but an unfortunate feature is very evident. Taylor had relaxed
                    his credit policy to gain much of this increased business. The stock of goods on hand and the credit

            <p>The old river town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, was founded in 1801 by the French-Swiss, who left many substantial homes,
                    some more than one hundred and twenty-five years old. One of the best known of these is the old
                    Ferry House, which was being built in 1811 when the first steamboat, the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>," passed down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. People from miles around camped for days about the foundations of the house as they
                    waited to see this marvel of steam power.</p>
            <p>Among the passengers on this boat were the great-uncle and great-aunt of Theodore Roosevelt. The
                    uncle was a member of the company that built the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>." In 1911, in celebration of the centennial anniversary of that pioneer trip,
                    a replica came down the river and passed the dignified old mansion. Again people assembled to view
                    the vessel and to marvel, but this time their wonder was inspired by the fact that so fragile a boat
                    seemed so marvelous to their forebears.</p>
            <p>The gallant old house that had weathered so many floods of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> finally succumbed about five years ago, and further efforts to make it habitable have
                    been abandoned until flood control is obtained. Now surrounded by a wild growth of shrubbery, it is
                    suggestive of an enchanted castle with a sleeping beauty awaiting her prince charming to break the
                    spell.</p>
            <p>It was long a picturesquely romantic building that posed often for both local and visiting artists.
                    Built of stone with a cement coating, it has an adobe appearance. Climbing vines add to its beauty.
                    The side facing the river has a long veranda, upstairs and down, connected by an outside stair in
                    true foreign fashion. This stair opens by a trapdoor to the upper porch, a guarantee against Indian
                    attacks which never materialized, for the red men were friends of the French-Swiss. The lower
                    veranda has a brick floor. An original "dog run" at the back was filled in. The
                    walls are three feet thick; the doors are heavy and broad. Because of its sturdy build, the old
                    chateau, withstanding the onslaught of river floods which sometimes rose to the top of mantel pieces
                    in the second story, was able to survive so long. There were so many rooms rambling and detached,
                    that one almost needed a guide and compass to go through it. The third story was reached by the
                    conventional narrow, steep, cup-boardlike attic stair. There in a tiny bedroom, long ago, a <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Jean Franqois Dufour, one of the founders of <placeName>

                    travelers. It is a matter of some dispute as to whether or not Monsieur Dufour himself ever occupied
                    the house; however, it is probable that his son Oliver in 1842 brought his bride, Amelia Ruter, to
                    the home where they resided for some years. Mrs. Dufour was a poetess of more than local repute and
                    enjoyed the friendship of George D. Prentice and other distinguished literati of the day, who
                    visited her and her husband in their <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> home. Later she acquired further prestige when they resided in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., where her husband held a government position during the Civil War and later
                    under Grant. Through her the old house was embalmed in <hi rend="i">Footfalls on the Boundary of
                        Another World</hi>, for she told Robert Dale Owen the stories he therein related of queer
                    apparitions—not of the dead but of the living—that occurred here.</p>
            <p>In spite of its age, the Ferry House and the Ferryboat rights have until recently belonged to only
                    two families, the Dufours and the Grahams; but after the death of Captain Jack Graham, they passed
                    to his brother-in-law, Charles Tyson. Captain Timothy Graham, the first of his family to own the
                    place, rescued the seventeen-man crew of a flatboat which had been wrecked in the ice. He fed and
                    housed them until they could get home. To show their gratitude they dug for him the largest cistern
                    in the county with a capacity of three hundred barrels; it was known as the "Rescue
                    Cistern."</p>
            <p>Three generations of Grahams, supporting with dignity the best traditions of rivermen, expert and
                    fearless swimmers —many are the lives they have saved—owned and operated the
                    ferry and occupied the house on the rising knoll above the landing. Captain Jack was widely and
                    popularly known for his courtesy, affability, and readiness to oblige, and several pilots of large
                    craft, learned their skill from him. He has "become a name." His sister June was
                    also a licensed pilot.</p>
            <p>The preservation of the old historic house is due to Captain Jack's sister, Miss Eva, who
                    fell heir to it. Although often compelled to leave the place by the encroachment of flood waters,
                    she patiently and courageously restored the damages and resumed her abode there until it was no
                    longer feasible.</p>

                        the House</hi>.</p>
            <p>Purporting to be the story of the life of Eugene Debs, it is made up of gross misstatements of all
                    characters, from the most startling anachronisms to plain mistakes that could so easily have been
                    avoided with any effort to ascertain the facts.</p>
            <p>The opening paragraph tells of the October sun rising as "a little after five" when
                    even a small boy knows that after the equinox the sun does not rise until after six, yet Gene
                    himself said on another page, that he had an alarm clock in his head that told the time better than
                    his watch.</p>
            <p>The account of Robert Ingersoll coming to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1875 is another error, for his first appearance here was in 1877. And the morning
                    train came in at 11:15, daily except Sunday, and October 17, 1875, was Sunday with no train. It did
                    rain heavily the day that Ingersoll came in 1877, but there was no early morning sun at
                    eleven-thirty. The sun seemed to cause Stone a great deal of trouble, for on page 29 he has it
                    shining through the west door in the morning.</p>
            <p>The Vandalia Railroad did not come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1869, as stated on page six, for its trains first came by way of the tracks of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Railroad from the state line June 8, 1870. On page seven, Gene saw the
                    "mustard-colored" frame station, though it was a red brick throughout its
                    existence. The entire story of Gloria is pure fiction, there never was a
                    "triangle" in Gene's life.</p>
            <p>Page 22 probably has the star account of the book. O. J. Smith did not own the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> in 1875. He had sold it in 1874. No such story appeared in the paper on Monday morning
                    for no papers were issued on Monday morning, and the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> was an evening paper.
                    The clock described on page 123 is in the courthouse that was built after the story occurred. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Gene and Kate were married on Tuesday, June 9, 1885, and not on Sunday morning. They could not catch
                    an early train on Sunday, for there was no train on Sunday until after noon. The church and county
                    records dispute the statement on page 118. And in 1875 there was no principal of Rose Polytechnic to
                    fail to introduce Robert Ingersoll as shown on page 11, for the Institute did not open until 1882.

                    from the city, of a dangerous water system, and of no lighting at night. The facts are that the
                    waterworks was in operation in 1875, and the street lights date from 1858. The most absurd story is
                    on pages 393 and 594. No such incident ever occurred and Governor Warren T. McCray was not in office
                    until 1921.</p>

                    weather that the meeting was held in the open air. Captain Donald Macdonald recorded Owen's
                    remarks: He "commenced by congratulating himself at being surrounded by so many speaking

                    stated the principles of Human Nature that Man's character consists of &amp; is formed

                    Thence he traced the effect of charity, kindness &amp; benevolence, and the absence of the angry
                    passions. —He told them that such alone was pure religion, and that they might be certain
                    it did not exist wherever anger, ill will, and uncharitable conduct was found. He called their
                    attention to the necessity of placing themselves in the best and excluding the worst circumstances,
                    commented upon the advantages of Union, and spoke of those principles alone being able to produce

                    botany and ornithology, and practiced scientific farming. He had a rather speculative turn of mind

                    Owen's ideas with the plan which Hall drew up for his own co-operative enterprise, it is
                    clear that while he was impressed with Owen's economic ideas, he was reserving judgment on,
                    or even rejecting, Owenite educational theories.</p>

                    religion and education, and so, in Hall's words, this was the course of action decided
                    upon: "At a meeting held at my House [July 24, 1825] six of us constituted ourselves into a
                    Society to be styled the Wanborough Joint Stock Society. Myself, A: Emmerson, &amp; C: Ayres
                    were appointed to form a Committee &amp; I was appointed Secretary and Treasurer."
                    Later, on August 20, he records, "It was agreed at a meeting of the Society that myself, A.
                    Emmerson, &amp; Wm. Woodlands should be appointed to value the stock of the members &amp;
                    that at the valuation of either of our own stock A: McWhorter should be called in in place of that
                    one of us whose stock should be under valuation. It was also agreed that the Land under Cultivation
                    shoud [be] valued at $6. &amp; the uninclosed Land at $2 pr.
                    Acre." These are the only direct references to the "Society" in
                    Hall's journal, but the following entries indicate that further steps were taken to
                    implement the joint agreement: August 22, 1825. "The Wanbro mill was given possession of to
                    myself, A: Emmerson, &amp; Chas Ayres by T: Hine. A Valuation of the stock of T: Hine was taken
                    by E: Walker &amp; B: Dorrettry." This statement should be read in connection with an
                    earlier one of August 13: "Went to Village Creek with D: Hearsum &amp; E: Emmerson to
                    assist in taking the Level of a section of the Creek which was said to offer a sufficient fall for a

                    yards." Apparently, since there was not enough water power available for the
                    "Society" to erect its own mill, Hall and the others acquired Hine's
                    Wanborough Mill for the "Society."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                    Owenism, but none of the social, religious, and moral objects which were equally important in the
                    schemes of Robert Owen. The joint agreement, however, did provide for equality among members in the
                    distribution of profits after expenses were met; but included among the expenses was the payment of
                    four per cent interest to those who had contributed the capital. In other words, this was a
                    co-operative capitalistic enterprise, not at all socialistic, and was exactly what it was called, a
                    "Joint Stock Society." If Hall and his associates had wanted to become socialists,
                    they would have gone to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Finally, it may be noted that in the statement of advantages to be derived from the
                    "union of Labour and Capital" the signers aimed to overcome some of the hazard and
                    unpleasantness of life on the frontier. It must have seemed to them that the co-operation of the
                    members of the group would accomplish more for each than could individual effort. In the long run,
                    though, the things that William Hall and his associates wanted were secured not through private
                    economic action, but rather through political means as the population of the West grew, and as
                    national, state, and local governments assumed responsibility for the welfare of the members of

                                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                                    </placeName> State Historical Library, dated April 2, 1948, is quoted: "The
                                    signatures of William Hall, McWhorter, and the names following [the latter] are all
                                    in the same handwriting. A comparison of these signatures and the document indicate
                                    that all were written by the same person. The Hall Journal has been returned to the
                                    owners so no actual comparison can be made, but it is assumed that William Hall
                                    signed the ‘Conditions,’ and therefore wrote the
                                    document." It is my own opinion that this is not necessarily the only copy
                                    of the "Conditions" that was made, but that this copy, at least,
                                    was intended as the official one, and that Hall wrote it as a part of his duty as
                                    secretary-treasurer, and is thus his own record of those who were members.</item>

                                time and at much less expence than it coud at the present state of things.</p>
                            <p>2d That by working together with one common interest their Labour will be much less

                            <p>3d They hope to secure to their Children the benefits of Education &amp; to
                                themselves &amp; their families the advantage of Medical attendance &amp; to be
                                relieved from that long train of anxieties attendant upon a fit of sickness in the busy
                                Season, And in the event of their death their families will not be left unprovided for.</p>
                            <p>4th Their Live Stock may be managed to much greater advantages the Young Cattle kept
                                separate &amp; better wintered, A regular Flock established &amp; properly
                                looked after. And many other Advantages secured to them, which they cannot expect to
                                enjoy in their present State.</p>

                                    transmitted, in accordance with what seems to be Professor Owen's wish, to
                                    the Honourable the Secretary of the Interior. The very conspicious position of the
                                    writer of this letter in the world of science lends great weight and value to his
                                    opinions and this hearty expression of them cannot fail to give much gratification
                                    to the projectors and authors of the surveys to which he alludes as well as to the
                                    Government which authorized them.</p>

                                    of the Scale on which this Survey has been conducted, and of the munificence shown
                                    in the publication and illustration of the results of the arduous and hazardous
                                    labours of the Surveyors. They are most exemplary; and the support which they have
                                    received from the "Hon: the Secretary of the Interior" is

                    </placeName> to interest the Rappites in a loan to the state.</p>
            <p>The letter of April 24, 1826, reveals that the Rappites, after their return to Pennsylvania,
                    maintained active trade relations with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. An effort was made to get some information concerning the Isaac &amp; Willis
                    Stewart Co., but as yet with little success. Meyer writes with reference to this letter: "I
                    bought it for the notation ‘P. St. Bt. Gen. Pike’. The General Pike was a very
                    early boat on the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The absence of a postmark means that it was carried as a favor by the boat's
                    captain or clerk and handed to any Rappite who was at the landing when the boat stopped at
                    Economy."</p>
            <p>The letter dated October 12, 1830, is especially interesting because of the sidelights it throws upon
                    the outside attitude toward the Rappites. It was written in German without regard to any system of
                    orthography and practically devoid of punctuation. It was sent by George Kurtz to Frederick Rapp at
                    Economy. Although Kurtz wrote the letter on October 12, 1830, he did not mail it until December 31,
                    1830. He was a runaway Rappite and had been involved in illicit relations with some woman either in
                    Economy or near there. When the woman was with child, he offered her one hundred dollars if she
                    would in writing release him from further obligations. She agreed on condition that he take her to
                    her sister, but the judge (or justice of the peace) declared the paper worthless, whereupon Kurtz
                    left Economy and took the woman to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, where the child was presumably born. He began to yearn for a return to
                    Economy but waited two and a half months before sending the letter to Frederick Rapp. According to
                    his story he vigorously vindicated Frederick Rapp and the Community against the abusive accusations

                        <p>Dear Parents. Your letter containing Mr. Brown's Certificate arrived some
                                    time since but from the session of the Legislature that is now just closing, I have
                                    been so busy that I have not yet located it. I have been trying to sell it but in
                                    this part of the County most of the good land has been sold so that I shall not be
                                    able till the weather settles in the Spring to get the worth of it. As soon as I can
                                    dispose of it to advantage, I will inform you.</p>
                        <p>Our family have for the last year enjoyed good health, though yesterday some little
                                    change took place by the birth of another daughter, which I believe is to have the
                                    name of Catharine. The luck of the Merrills seems at present not to lie in <hi rend="i">the boy line</hi>, unless Hazen has before this time done something to
                                    keep up the name, I fear it will be in a bad way. Our winter has hitherto been very
                                    warm and wet, no snow has fallen and grass fields are quite green.</p>
                        <p>The present Legislature has passed a Law to change the seat of government from this
                                    place to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> which lies 108 miles north of this place and about 90 miles west from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Three years ago the town was laid out in the woods near fifty miles
                                    distant from any settlements of white people, it has now 80 or 100 houses and
                                    probably will have twice that number in a year. The County around it also has 5 or
                                    600 families. We shall not move however till late in the fall.</p>
                        <p>I was not long since at a place called Harmony a settlement of Germans containing
                                    about 800 people who are entirely under the domination of one man. The town is
                                    situated about 25 miles from the mouth of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName>, and is large enough to accommodate themselves well. They have two
                                    churches one for Winter and the other for summer the latter of which is nearly twice
                                    the size of yours. Every kind of manufacture that can be of use is there carried
                                    ‘on, and the value of their property is becoming immense. Though the head
                                    of them is sufficiently polite yet it is very difficult to know much about their
                                    real situation. Most of them do not understand English and those who do have little
                                    disposition to gratify idle curiosity. It is certain I believe that they do not seek
                                    converts, and that it is very rare that children are born among them. My business
                                    was to obtain a loan for the State which kept me so much engaged that I had no time
                                    to make so many observations as I wished.</p>
                        <p>During this winter we have generally had excellent preaching which is not common in
                                    this country. When the Missionary Society of the East remembers, we try to subscribe
                                    and pay so much as not to be a burthen to them. Exertions have been made here to
                                    procure a regular Presbyterian preacher but as yet without success.</p>
                        <p>I hope some of you will write soon. Where is David and how do the Dr. and Betsy come
                                    on?</p>

                        <salute>Much beloved Father [George Rapp] and Frederick [Rapp],</salute>
                        <p>If my letter finds you in good health I shall be happy. I too am well, but not in
                                    good spirits. I am very sorry that I have left Economy; I find no rest by day or
                                    night; my conscience tells me that I did wrong. Therefore I beg of you that you will
                                    plead for me to have me again received into the Society, for it is terrible how
                                    those [of Economy] are despised.</p>
                        <p>When I returned from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, I arranged with her [the woman with whom he was involved] to give her
                                    $100 if she gave me a statement in writing, and she agreed on the
                                    condition that I take her to her sister. This I agreed to do, but when I appeared
                                    before the Justice [of the Peace?], he said that it was of no avail. Then I decided
                                    to go down the Beaver [he means the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>]; when I arrived at <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, I thought I would not reveal my identity, but there John Kurtz
                                    recognized <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-045-2-079"/> me. With him I went into the city to
                                    Scheide's. When I arrived, he was full [of praise?] for the Society; then I
                                    spoke a few words [probably mentioning his departure from Economy], whereupon a
                                    complete change took place in him [denouncing the Society]. He let me read a letter,
                                    but would not let me read the signature, in which all things which occurred [at
                                    Economy] were described. It is horrible how dark they painted you.</p>
                        <p>I entered a grocery; there they asked me from where I came; when I said from Economy,
                                    they asked whether my eyes had been opened; then they said that you were the
                                    greatest swindlers that ever lived on earth. I said that they would have to prove it
                                    to me or I should not be satisfied. Then they told me that Frederick had visited a
                                    house of ill-fame and got the pocks. Then I said it wasn't true; then they
                                    said they would prove it to me. I said I would bet $100 that it
                                    wasn't true. I was so angry that I threw $100 on the counter and
                                    said, "If you are not liars, put your $100 down."
                                    Thereupon they slunk away and I never saw any of them.</p>
                        <p>From there I went to <placeName>

                                    </placeName> to Höhr, and I left her there until the child is born. With
                                    Höhr I had a total break; I could no longer bear to hear how he called
                                    the good men [of Economy] scoundrels; it was just as if one had thrust a dagger into
                                    my breast. They said I was more ignorant than a dog or R eat; they begin to see in
                                    nine days, but not I.</p>

               <hi rend="i">First First Ladies, 1789–1865. A Study of the Wives of the Early
                        Presidents</hi>. By Mary Ormsbee Whitton. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, Hastings House, 1948, pp. x, 341. Illustrations, appendix, bibliography, and portrait
                    of Martha Washington frontispiece. $5.00.)</head>
            <p>It was a fine idea for this book to parade the women themselves whose presidential gowns in the
                    Smithsonian Institution at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> are such a center of attraction to the visitors at that museum. Sixteen women were
                    selected for the procession. It moves along with Martha Washington at its head and Mary Lincoln at
                    the end. But as every parade has some design, even a Coxey army, so this one has its director. Mary
                    Ormsbee Whitton is both director and interpreter of the ladies who pass in review. Unfortunately in
                    many cases she has only fragmentary knowledge for some of her interpretations and in other cases she
                    heavily loads them with feminist clichés, thus attempting to speak in the place of many
                    ladies herself instead of letting their biographies as she recites them speak for themselves.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this procession, according to the author, is to "represent a neglected area
                    in the history of American women … before the material itself should be scattered
                    irretrievably in the mists of time [p. 313]." Why these women's gowns hang
                    together, with their wearers so evancescent, is a question which comes to the mind of this
                    commentator in the grandstand. Anyway in cultivating a neglected area of any kind in any history,
                    the cultivator in that "field" may be subject to an inquisition. If it is applied
                    to Martha Washington's and Abigail Adams' personalities, to start with, a first
                    question may well be this: "Did you read carefully <hi rend="i">New Letters</hi> of Abigail
                    Adams published while you were working on these two wives of our presidents?" If the answer
                    is "No," then the verdict might be stern: "Having failed to read what
                    Abigail said about Martha during their close association at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the second capital of the nation, and before that in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, the first capital, your interpretation of Martha Washington is too fragmentary, and
                    that's just too bad." As for Abigail, these new letters reveal her as so
                    bloodthirsty during the X Y Z affair that she longed to have the United States go to war instantly
                    against <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-045-2-082"/> the French for the insult to American envoys, despite
                    the vital aid rendered to the American Revolution by the French. She is introduced here as
                    "teller of a <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> love story." She told her story of hate, if not for publication, in
                    unmistakable language.</p>
            <p>Yet as biographer of these ladies this writer has magnetic pages of narrative revealing the courage,
                    the problems which called for it, the initiative, the marital loyalty, and the kinds of dignity
                    which characterized woman after woman in this parade. One of the most appealing to this spectator of
                    their procession is Louisa Adams, wife of John Quincy Adams. Having had an exceedingly dangerous
                    experience in Europe during the last armed act in the Napoleonic war, and expecting revolutionary
                    changes to recur, she established for herself a line of conduct—quiet adaptability though
                    not Buddhistic. This reflective characteristic and firm trait gives distinction to her portrait as
                    this viewer sees it.</p>
            <p>Running through nearly every interpretation by the designer of this parade, however, is her diapason
                    of the feminist credo that these were underprivileged women. Mrs. Monroe for instance is
                    "not permitted to speak for herself," despite her bold action in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> when she had faced the prison officials to call upon Mme. La Fayette awaiting there her
                    summons to the guillotine—a deed which, crowning President Monroe's valiant
                    efforts to liberate the wife of the French devotee of America, saved the great French woman from
                    having her head cut off in the reign of terror. With the feminist interjections of such sorts goes
                    the associated credo of the "gentle" tradition, a literary device for a fresh
                    theme having in reality little substance but highly pleasing to readers themselves enjoying new
                    literary themes.</p>
            <p>When all is said that can be said by an inquisition, the verdict of the disagreeable tyrant who
                    raises questions is this: there is power in many of these biographies and facts which every American
                    should know who cares about American history and women in it who helped to make it importantly.</p>

                    Illustrations, portrait of George Catlin at the age of fifty-three frontispiece. $5.00.)</head>
            <p>It seems strange that no biography of George Catlin should appear until the publication of this
                    volume more than three-quarters of a century after his death. Catlin was not only a great painter of
                    Indian subjects, but he was a tireless collector of the products of Indian craftsmanship, a world
                    traveler, and the author of a number of books. Finally, one who follows his life story so admirably
                    told in the twenty-five chapters of this book will be inclined to agree with the author that he was
                    in many respects a great man.</p>
            <p>He was born at Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, in 1796 but a year later his parents removed across the
                    line into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Here young Catlin grew to manhood, attended school, and studied law. He was far more
                    interested in painting than in a legal career and soon sold his law library for enough money to
                    establish himself in a modest studio in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Here he painted miniatures and at times larger portraits. Within three or four years
                    he had become one of the outstanding painters of the country. In 1829, he was married to Clara
                    Gregory, daughter of a well-to-do citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By this time he made up his mind that destiny had called him to devote his life to
                    portraying on canvas the features, civilization, and lifeways of the American Indians. Accordingly,
                    in 1830 he journeyed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and from that city followed up the <geogName>Missouri River</geogName> to visit many
                    strange tribes of the remote parts of the West. From this time until his death in Jersey City in
                    1872, he pursued with boundless energy the vision which he had seen. His was a dual task. First he
                    would preserve with his pencil and brush the Indians in their native environment before changed and
                    corrupted by white civilization. He would then create a greater interest in these aboriginal
                    inhabitants of America by showing his pictures and Indian collections to the people of the United
                    States and of Europe. In achieving the first of these objectives he traveled into the most remote
                    parts of North and South America from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> to Terra del Fuego. In the second he exhibited his great Indian gallery in most of the
                    important cities of the eastern part of the United States as well as in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>

                    enormous output his paintings varied widely as to quality. In the judgment of a layman, Catlin at
                    his best is very good. At his worst his work is less than mediocre. Apparently, he was equally at
                    home in a smoke-stained Indian lodge or the palace of European royalty. As revealed in the pages of
                    this book, however, Catlin the traveler and painter is a far more attractive figure than Catlin the
                    showman. He was a poor businessman and financial distress eventually caused him to mortgage and
                    re-mortgage his great Indian gallery. It was taken over by one of his creditors in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and stored in packing cases where much of it was destroyed by fire, water, and the
                    ravages of moths and rodents. That part which was preserved was at last given by the heirs of the
                    mortgagee to the Smithsonian Institution, while the cartoon collection formed later was eventually
                    purchased for the <placeName>

            <p>The life story of Catlin's strange and tragic life is beautifully told in this volume. The
                    author is himself an artist, at least in the use of words, and the book shows every evidence of long
                    and careful research. Two or three minor errors due to the author's lack of knowledge of
                    the geography of some regions Catlin visited should be noted. The title of Chapter IX, "A
                    Tour in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>," is misleading since the Dragoon Expedition with which Catlin visited the
                    villages of the Pawnee Picts in 1834 was never in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>. The mistake is natural since Catlin himself heads his letters written during this
                    expedition "Camp Canadian, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>." Also the False Washita is not "now the Red River" (p. 90).
                    The Washita is a northern tributary of Red River flowing across <placeName>

                    most interesting story which the reader will not want to put aside until the last page is finished.
                    It is illustrated with seventeen Catlin pictures which add much to the beauty and value of the book.</p>

                        1783–1865</hi>. By Robert H. Russel. (Cedar Rapids, <placeName>

            <p>The author of this volume makes no claim that it "cultivates a virgin historical
                    field." He admits frankly that numerous articles and monographs have dealt with such
                    aspects of his subject, as Asa Whitney's Pacific railway project, the Pacific railway
                    surveys, the overland mail, the pony express, the Gadsden purchase, Anglo-American isthmian
                    diplomacy and the construction of the Union and Central Pacific railways. And he might have included
                    in his list the works of his mentor, the late Professor Frank H. Hodder, and others on the origins
                    of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. It is Professor Russel's belief, however, that no one has
                    "undertaken before to write upon the establishment of improved means of communication with
                    the Pacific coast as a great national problem and a political issue before the American people
                    related to and involved with other great problems and issues of the times."</p>
            <p>The date "1783" in the title is somewhat misleading. Actually only ten pages are
                    given to the period before 1844, when Asa Whitney brought forth his plan for a railway to the
                    Pacific. Sixteen pages suffice to carry the story to the gold discovery in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, the point at which the detailed discussion of the problem of communication with the
                    Pacific Coast begins.</p>
            <p>Six of the twenty chapters in the volume are devoted to the various schemes for improved
                    transportation across Central America and Mexico with a view to linking <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> more closely to the Union. The Panama Railroad, the proposed Atlantic and Pacific Ship
                    Canal, the Tehuantepec Railroad project, and other possible "Transits" across
                    Mexico are discussed in detail, together with the maze of diplomatic negotiations in which they
                    involved us with both England and our neighbors to the South. Although little of this material is
                    new, it is, of course, presented from a point of view rather different from that found in standard
                    treatises on diplomatic history. Since only one of these plans—the Panama
                    Railroad—actually materialized, the space devoted to them seems a trifle excessive.</p>
            <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-045-2-086"/>
            <p>Professor Russel's chief concern is with the question of the Pacific railway, which for a
                    dozen years was a major subject of controversy in and out of Congress. In this connection the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> railway conventions of 1849, the building of local railways in the
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> (referred to by the author as "First
                    Links" in 8 possible highway to the Pacific), and the ambitions of rival promoters all
                    receive detailed consideration. On the railway background of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Professor
                    Russel adds little to the data found in the writings of Frank H. Hodder, Allen Johnson, Perley O.
                    Ray, George F. Milton, and James C. Malin, although he differs with them on some points of
                    interpretation.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the freshest portion of the book is the thorough discussion of the sectional and local
                    rivalries and jealousies which, between 1854 and 1861, so completely frustrated all efforts to agree
                    upon a route by which this railway to the Pacific was to be built. Professor Russel believes that
                    "if at any time during six or seven years prior to secession Southern congressmen in
                    general had been willing to vote federal aid for Pacific railroads …, two railroads would
                    have been provided for and their construction begun," one of them by the Southern route.
                    And he adds that "it is one of the ironies of history that it was largely this
                    dog-in-the-manger attitude of the South with regard to the Pacific railroad and other measures
                    … that ensured the Republican victory in 1860 which, in turn, was the occasion for
                    secession, war, and the destruction of slavery."</p>
            <p>The volume closes with a discussion of the charters granted to Pacific railways in 1862, the
                    amendments to these in 1864, and the chartering of the Northern Pacific in the latter year.</p>
            <p>Professor Russel's volume is so complete, so thorough and so well buttressed with original
                    materials that it will undoubtedly be the definitive work on the subject. Although he freely
                    acknowledges his indebtedness to authors of secondary accounts, he appears to have neglected some of
                    the more recent of these, such as Wheaton Lane's <hi rend="i">Commodore Vanderbilt</hi>.</p>

                    many persons consider America's most progressive businessman.</p>
            <p>Nine of the twenty chapters in the book deal at length with the financing and construction of the
                    road by the Seney Syndicate, a process begun in 1881 and completed in 1882. Toward the original
                    builders Mr. Hampton is favorably inclined; typical of his evaluation of them is the following
                    (pages 17–18): "The Nickel Plate Road was no unsound, highly speculative scheme
                    conceived by inexperienced promoters in a moment of flighty desire. It was a sound, legitimate
                    enterprise organized by men of position, influence, and means, who had successfully built and
                    operated other railroads." Nor does he find, as some writers have suggested, that the
                    Nickel Plate was built to blackmail William H. Vanderbilt or Jay Gould. Instead, he sides with the
                    Seney Syndicate as against Vanderbilt (who purchased the road from the Syndicate in 1882) and
                    concedes only "that the road was built to sell" (page 150). Thus he dissents in
                    part from the opinion of such previous authorities as John Moody, who states flatly (in <hi rend="i">The Railroad Builders</hi>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Haven</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Yale University Press, 1920, page 35): "This road … had been
                    constructed with the hope of ultimately selling out to its competitor."</p>
            <p>The remaining half of the book is divided into three parts, built around the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Central, VanSweringen, and Young regimes. Toward William H. Vanderbilt the author is
                    inclined to accept the somewhat unfriendly attitude of the former's contemporaries rather
                    than the revisionist attitude of John Moody, Matthew Josephson, and others. Concluding that the
                    Nickel Plate "did not prosper under <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Central control" (page 203), he buttresses his statement with statistical
                    detail. Even more detail goes into his evaluation of the VanSweringen brothers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-045-2-088"/> whose control of the Nickel Plate
                    (1916–1936) he regards highly. This family added two important lines to the system: the

               </placeName> and Western (Clover Leaf) and the Lake Erie and Western, whose
                    involved histories are traced with great care.</p>
            <p>After this very full account of the railroad to 1937, the "Young Era" receives only
                    one chapter of nine pages. It is true, of course, that the Nickel Plate has been only one of the
                    Young roads; probably some of the recent records are still in active use and not available for
                    historical research; no doubt a writer so close to the controversial events in which Mr. Young has
                    been involved is limited to tentative conclusions. Nevertheless, Mr. Hampton's book appears
                    to be an approximation of a semi-official history of the railroad; for example, the introduction is
                    written by its president, Mr. John W. Davin. Then why should the author be so modest about Mr.
                    Young's achievement? Mr. Hampton's clientele will probably wish to learn more of
                    such omitted or abbreviated developments as Mr. Young's efforts to free his railroads from
                    the control of Eastern investment banks; of his concern for the rights of small investors and of his
                    workers; of the many conveniences he installed for passengers and shippers; of his bolt from the
                    Association of American Railroads and his formation of the Federation for Railway Progress; and of
                    his famous campaign for through train service at <placeName>

                    Trains—But You Can't."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hampton lists in his bibliography twenty-five libraries, more than three-score newspapers and
                    periodicals, and private records of the railroad. He has documented and indexed his work well.

                    </placeName> West, he is not a newcomer to the frontier field.</p>
            <p>The nature of the work is indicated by the subjects treated. They include the squatter, station life,
                    the planter, land greed, the slave as a pioneer, agriculture, sports, amusement, the frontier town,
                    schools, religion, travel, justice, politics, manufactures, militia, women, food, dress, speech, and
                    frontier characteristics. There are thirty-two chapters which average approximately ten pages to the
                    chapter.</p>
            <p>The chief significance of the present volume is not the newness of the material presented or the
                    analytical or philosophical conclusions of the author, but rather the availability and the
                    completeness of the material brought together. Most informed readers will be familiar with much of
                    the facts, but there will be few who will not learn some new details. Many will know of other works
                    which describe some of the customs and institutions here treated, but none will likely know of
                    another volume which includes so much. Its value will be greater for the general reader and the
                    beginning student in frontier history and correspondingly less for the advanced student.</p>
            <p>The main objection to the procedure of the author is the lack of any analytical approach. The Dixie
                    Frontier as considered in this volume was not a single frontier but a series of frontiers. It could
                    have been differentiated chronologically and geographically. Conditions differed north of the <placeName>

            <p>The book has an interesting descriptive style. It should make good collateral reading for college and
                    high school students and should be entertaining for many others. There are relatively few errors of
                    fact or slips in proof reading. <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-045-2-090"/> The thirty-four page
                    bibliography contains a very considerable amount of material and should be valuable to scholars.
                    Individual documents rather than collections are listed, but the items are not evaluated for the
                    reader. The format of the book is attractive.</p>

                    </placeName> venture largely because he saw, in Owen's liberalism, a good proving ground
                    for his educational theories. The two men had strong convictions that there was need for educational
                    reform. Robert Owen would use the schools of the community to develop citizens who could live in a
                    selfless, cooperative society. Maclure's chief interest was the further development of
                    industrial and vocational education. Maclure had, when he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> a long record of interest in, and support of, educational experiments both in <placeName>

            <p>The correspondence between William Maclure and Madame Fretageot, preserved in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> library and edited by Dr. Bestor, begins with the letters written in 1820, when Maclure
                    was in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Switzerland</region>
                    </placeName> and Madame Fretageot was teaching in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Within a year, she had moved her school to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where she remained until Owen and Maclure joined forces to come to Indiana. From the
                    first, the letters reveal enthusiasm for Owen's ideas on Madame Fretageot's part
                    and a feeling of caution and reservation on Maclure's part. In fact, one feels that Maclure
                    joined the experiment reluctantly, and that he did not, from the first, share Owen's
                    beliefs that the experiment would <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-045-2-091"/> make over the world. Robert
                    Owen is quoted in one letter as telling Madame Fretageot that "I would [he said] devote 30
                    years of my life where I now am [in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>] without being able to counterbalance the evils which surround my pupils." The
                    freedom of the frontier, in the West, would soften the prejudices of the Old World, and the older
                    sections of America forward new ideas. William Maclure's decision to join up with Owen
                    involved the transfer of his scientific work in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as well as his educational efforts, and the Keelboat
                    "Philanthropist" came down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> late in 1825, with a distinguished list of passengers including eminent teachers,
                    scientists, and artists. In the group were Owen, Maclure, Madame Fretageot, Phiquepal
                    d'Arusmont, a Pestalozzian teacher from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> and protege of Maclure, Thomas Say, a brilliant young scientist, Charles Lesuer, Robert
                    Dale Owen and others. The uneasy partnership between Owen and Maclure was launched.</p>
            <p>Maclure's interests in business and science and a state of ill health, which led him to seek
                    warmer climates, often kept him constantly in and out of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His stays there were never very long. He made Madame Fretageot his secretary and
                    business agent. He depended upon her to advance the schools, according to his theories, and to
                    supervise the expenditures of money, which he had put into the partnership with Robert Owen. Their
                    letters over the years of the active life of the Owen community, 1826–1827, and later,
                    when the community was dissolved, reveal the friction between the ideas of the two men. Their
                    theories of education, never in harmony from the first, grew further apart and Owen set up his own
                    schools and teachers for a time. Maclure set off the Education Society, as a separate unit, and
                    there Madame Fretageot did a superwoman's job of running the boarding school, teaching long
                    hours, cooking, caring for the clothes of the children and the housing and gardens, as well as her
                    financial duties as Maclure's agent. Finally the break between Owen and Maclure became
                    absolute, and a legal division of their property interests in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> was made.</p>
            <p>Madame Fretageot remained in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> to supervise the work of establishing Maclure's School of Industry, and the
                    setting up of his scientific press "coordinating research, engraving, printing and hand
                    coloring." A newspaper <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-045-2-092"/>
                    <hi rend="i">The Disseminator of Useful Knowledge</hi> was published by the School of Industry. By
                    the close of 1827, the Owen experiment had vanished and the work which remained was
                    Maclure's. The aim of social reform now was definitely committed to use educational means.</p>
            <p>In December, 1828, Maclure sought the milder climate of Mexico for his health, and he remained there
                    until his death in 1840. Madame Fretageot left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1831, and, after a year's stay there, returned to the New World to visit
                    Maclure in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mexico</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She died there in 1833.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bestor has, by his publication of this correspondence, thrown additional light on the controversy
                    between Owen and Maclure. The letters reveal the practical wit of Maclure and his belief that the
                    test of validity for any system of education is whether it produced citizens who are self-reliant
                    and self-sustaining.</p>
            <p>The author has quoted extensively from contemporary accounts of the experiment. The work is well
                    edited. There are full comments and excellent transitional materials, which aid the reader in
                    understanding matters referred to in the letters.</p>

            <p>A hundred years ago many Americans were leaving the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> to seek
                    the gold of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. But other pioneers were giving their attention to the thinly settled areas of the
                    Middle West. The year 1849, famed for the Gold Rush, was also marked by the organization of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> Territory. This book deals with the early days of that new territory, and with a man
                    who helped build <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>

            <p>Goodhue was not a great success, as Americans generally use that word. Born and raised in <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName>, he was an <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-045-2-093"/> indifferent student at Amherst. After
                    graduation (class of 1833), he drifted west. "To supply his want of means," he
                    farmed in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Then he practiced law in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> lead region. There he married a young school teacher. Shifting to journalism, he became
                    an influential (but not prosperous) editor. When the Gold Rush came, many of Good-hue's
                    lead mining neighbors went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. Preferring to remain in the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>, Goodhue went

                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> Territory. There, in the territorial capital of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he launched the <hi rend="i">

                    forty-two.</p>
            <p>Many Western pioneers lived lives more exciting than Goodhue's. Many accomplished more than
                    did this journalist. But the bulk of the early settlers of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> allowed their experiences to go unrecorded. Good-hue, on the other hand, was highly
                    articulate; and, unlike many frontier editors, he filled his columns with local items. His paper,
                    therefore, became a mirror of his region, and his story has value for all interested in the
                    settlement of the Great Lakes area.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Berthel, the competent and careful author of this volume, is well aware that Goodhue is more
                    important as a witness than as a participant in events. Hence, after sketching the editor's
                    career, she devotes most of the volume to reprinting pieces from the <hi rend="i">Pioneer</hi>. The
                    selections are well chosen, and their value is increased by excellent illustrations.</p>
            <p>This is local history. Some will say that James Madison Goodhue had no national importance, and that
                    none but confirmed Minnesotans will be interested in quotations from a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspaper of 1849–1852. But those of us who believe in state history look at
                    it in another way. We feel that the lives of the great national figures tell only part of the story.
                    We feel that those who write our national history in the future will find much of value in books
                    like this, books which deal with local subjects of national significance.</p>

                    hard work in an incorruptible Norwegian accent left an imprint. His biography has a significance,
                    however, that is broader than his home state, for it illuminates the rural side of the Progressive
                    Era and because Norbeck's sixteen years as United States senator supplies the author with
                    an opportunity to write an excellent summary of recent agricultural history. This is a professional
                    job by a practicing historian—meaning that it is an unadorned, honest account written
                    according to the standards of scientific history. A clear style is marred only by too obvious and
                    frequent attempts to achieve variety by use of short exclamatory sentences.</p>
            <p>From a boyhood that might have been lifted from Ole Rölvaag's novels of
                    Scandinavian pioneer life, young Peter Norbeck turned to artesian well drilling with phenomenal
                    success. In 1906 he entered politics as a Progressive Republican, his Scandinavian origin,
                    acquaintance among the farmers, and business success making him a valuable recruit. Consequently, he
                    rose rapidly from state senator to governor, serving two terms in the latter office from 1917 to
                    1921.</p>
            <p>Though a bitter foe of the Nonpartisan League, he adopted part of its program by putting the state
                    into business to the extent of rural credits, hail insurance, a coal mine, and cement factory. Rural
                    credits failed completely and will cost the taxpayers $57,000,000 by the time the last
                    bonds are retired in 1960. Judgment of the hail insurance and coal mine depends chiefly upon whether
                    they are viewed from a financial or regulatory basis. By setting the price of the plant's
                    products at the regular market price, the cement factory has been an unqualified and continuing
                    success.</p>
            <p>Elected to the United States Senate in 1920 as a Theodore Roosevelt Republican, he became a
                    consistent supporter of farm legislation aimed at surplus control. In turn, Norbeck worked for the
                    Farmer's Export Corporation, McNary- <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-045-2-095"/> Haugen Bill,
                    domestic allotment plans, and the A.A.A., but opposed the Agricultural Marketing Act.</p>
            <p>A summary judgment of Norbeck must place on the debit side his articulate belief in the special worth
                    of the Teutonic people, his inconsistencies in foreign affairs, and an apparent willingness to
                    provide relief for the farmers at the expense of other economic groups. As to his experimental
                    economic measures, one can agree with author Fite that evaluation will be measured "by the
                    same yardstick that future historians will apply to the New Deal in general." Clearly on
                    the credit side was the undoubted sincerity of his efforts. Likewise, he had been the agent of
                    industrialism that reduced the cost of the average artesian well from about four thousand dollars to
                    four hundred dollars. As a conservationist he founded Custer State Park while governor and in the
                    senate championed all measures to preserve public lands, create national parks, and protect
                    migratory wild fowl. He secured federal appropriations for the completion of Mount Rushmore Memorial
                    and was personally responsible for the inclusion of his Bull Moose leader among the sculptered
                    heads. Happy but tiring days were spent clambering through the Black Hills with the engineers to
                    insure that highways leading to the Needles and over Iron Mountain follow scenic rather than
                    scientific routes. Norbeck would probably be surprised, but not necessarily regretful, that the
                    South Dakotans are yearly placing greater stress upon his work for the Hills and less upon his
                    political activity.</p>

                    </placeName> was attached to the Indiana Territory, October 1, 1804-July 4, 1805; and Part Three,
                    over four hundred pages, deals with the period from July 4, 1805, when the Act of Congress of March
                    3, 1805, which created the separate Territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, to the time when Governor James Wilkinson was ordered to the southwestern frontier
                    because of the developments in the Burr Conspiracy and the threatened invasion by Spanish military
                    forces from <placeName>

                    </placeName> by William C. C. Claiborne; during the second period Governor William Henry Harrison of

                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>; and during the third period the Territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> was under a separate territorial administration.</p>
            <p>Military affairs are represented by instructions and orders to various officers for occupying the
                    posts in Upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>; plans for forwarding necessary supplies for the troops in the new posts; quarrels with
                    the civil authorities over the exercise of military jurisdiction; and dissatisfaction of the regular
                    army officers stationed in the territory over their pay, which was not sufficient to meet the high
                    cost of living in their new locations. Indian affairs are covered by numerous documents on
                    appointment of Indian agents; the problem of establishing suitable trading posts and factories for
                    supplying American goods to the Indians, and the exclusion of British Canadian traders from the
                    region; and the making of treaties with various tribes in the region.</p>
            <p>There are materials on the expedition of Lewis and Clark up the <geogName>Missouri River</geogName>,
                    and of Lieutenant Z. M. Pike to the headwaters of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, with reports on their progress. Introduction and expansion of the postal system in the
                    Territory is reflected in numerous documents. There are requests from Congress for information on
                    the lead mines, and from individuals seeking information on various conditions, many of them
                    prospective settlers.</p>
            <p>Political items are numerous. There are recommendations by politicians of applicants seeking federal
                    appointments in the Territory, most of whom made an office a condition <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-045-2-097"/> precedent to their removal to the region; documents reflecting the
                    dissatisfaction of the inhabitants with the form of government provided by Congress for them, and on
                    the jealousy between the American and French residents over the control of territorial affairs—<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> vs. the districts farther to the south. The controversy between Governor Wilkinson and
                    the grand jury over the appointment of an attorney-general is revealed at length, as is the movement
                    to set up a representative elective assembly to direct the affairs of the District. There are
                    voluminous petitions favoring and opposing Governor Wilkinson's confirmation by the United
                    States Senate, and in favor of his retention as governor when the rumor spread that he was about to
                    be removed; and there is a lengthy petition in favor of the appointment of Secretary Joseph Browne
                    as Wilkinson's successor after the Governor had been ordered to the southwestern frontier.</p>
            <p>Much space is occupied by documents relating to the public lands. There are the appointments of
                    surveyors and commissioners for the investigation and adjustment of land titles and claims; the
                    problems confronting the commissioners because of the inaccuracy of the old Spanish surveys and the
                    different interpretation placed upon the provisions of the Act of Congress for handling the land
                    question in the territory; the problem of squatters on the public lands; the government's
                    policy with respect to the lead mines; and popular discontent over many of the decisions of the
                    commissioners in confirming or rejecting various land claims.</p>
            <p>There is much material on appointments to offices, ranging from governor down to justices of the
                    peace, and including both civil and military positions. The long list of appointments made by
                    Governor Wilkinson, dated July 4, 1806, gives a clue to most of the leading citizens in the various
                    districts of the territory. This list, when used in conjunction with the numerous signatures to
                    petitions and memorials, is a veritable mine of information for the local historian and the
                    genealogist.</p>
            <p>While not so meaty as some of the previous volumes in the series, the volume under review makes
                    readily available a vast amount of formerly inaccessible source material. The editor has done a very
                    good job in deciphering the troublesome signatures appended to the petitions and memorials. The
                    adequate index of sixty-six pages lists all important <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-045-2-098"/> matters
                    in the volume. All in all, the volume reflects the excellent work of the editor.</p>

                    </placeName> State University has followed the practice of inviting outstanding Southern historians
                    to present a series of lectures in honor of the late Walter Lynwood Fleming. The lecturer for 1947
                    was Thomas D. Clark of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and his subject was "The Rural Press and the New South." The lectures
                    have subsequently appeared in book form as published by Louisiana State University Press.</p>
            <p>Professor Clark, whose full-length study of <hi rend="i">The Southern Country Editor</hi> appeared
                    recently (The Bobbs-Merrill Company, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1948), demonstrated clearly in his lectures the importance of the rural editor in the
                    study of the cultural history of the South. Country editors necessarily were
                    "toms-of-many-Tinkers." Frequently unlettered, these men were forced to pour forth
                    reams of sage advice on education, politics, farm finance, and a myriad of other subjects. At the
                    same time they must scrupulously recognize the importance of public relations by personalizing the
                    news and setting it to the standards of rural communities. Setting his own type, soliciting
                    advertisements, and collecting from delinquent subscribers were all in a day's work for the
                    average editor.</p>
            <p>Professor Clark's lectures were at their best in describing the highly personalized
                    character of the average country weekly. Frequent use of names, the sometimes irresponsible
                    reporting of idle gossip, the relation of folklore, and the reporting of freaks of nature, all
                    indicated that the rural paper was often ordinary conversation set to print.</p>
            <p>The present writer, however, wishes that the lectures might have given more space to the breaks in
                    unanimity among the press, particularily in the political sphere. Southern editors did not all agree
                    on politics even during the period of Reconstruction, and the Populist period saw the establishment
                    of a National Reform Press Association <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-045-2-099"/> that soon counted in its
                    membership numerous Southern editors who did not even have to change the crossings of their
                    t's to fit comfortably into the press program of the Populist party (e.g., Frank Burkitt of
                    the Okolona, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, <hi rend="i">Chickasaw Messenger</hi>). These editors might have been in the minority,
                    but they too played a part in influencing the society of the South.</p>
            <p>The author presents interesting information on the extent to which advertising (especially of patent
                    medicines) and political printing kept editorial pens still on controversial subjects. The
                    restraining hand of personal violence as a limitation on a free press might have received
                    elaboration. It was not at all rare for outspoken editors to face death at the hands of an outraged
                    opponent. Within a year's time (1886–1887) two Jackson, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, "reform" editors were killed after writing stormy editorials
                    affecting state politics.</p>
            <p>Only one lapse in editorial work (p. 53) caught the eye of the reviewer. The book is attractively
                    printed and bound. Professor Clark has added another valuable work to his lengthy list of studies in
                    the social history of the South.</p>

                    </placeName> Press Association launched the present society.</p>
            <p>The decision to locate the headquarters of the society on the campus of the state university at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> has played <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-045-2-100"/> an important part in the
                    society's development. First housed in temporary quarters, its offices and collections were
                    moved into the new university library in 1915. By close co-operation the university and society have
                    been able to avoid duplication in building up their collections, thus permitting the latter to
                    concentrate on Missouriana and historical sources for the Middle and Far West. The society has
                    likewise drawn on the university for leadership and personnel, but men and women of other
                    professions and the amateur historians and collectors have also played an important part in the
                    development of the organization throughout its existence.</p>
            <p>Another important step was taken by the society in 1899 whereby it became the trustee of the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, holding all its property in trust for the state. Two years later the society received
                    its first appropriation from state funds and has continued to receive state support. This action
                    also led to the removal of the state archives to the society's library in 1911 following
                    the disastrous fire at the state capitol.</p>
            <p>The society has published such documentary material as the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> and <hi rend="i">Debates</hi> of the Constitutional Convention of 1873 and the <hi rend="i">Messages and
                        Proclamations of the Governors</hi>, and issues a quarterly magazine, the <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Historical Review</hi>. The latter includes articles of popular interest as well as
                    those of a scholarly nature. With over four thousand paid memberships, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> society takes the lead over all other historical organizations in this country. This
                    may be due in part to the low membership fee of $1.00 per year made possible by partial
                    state support. Comparing the situation in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>

                    addition takes the place in part of the archives and Indiana divisions of the State Library and of
                    the Indiana Historical Bureau.</p>
            <p>In outlining the achievement of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> society, the author has not neglected to tell the story of the men who have guided its
                    destinies and brought it to its present preeminent position in its state and in the historical
                    world. Though written primarily for Missourians to inform them of the society's work, the
                    volume is a welcome addition to the literature of the historical society movement in this country.</p>
