                        THE RUSSIAN STUDENT’S TALE.
                        
                            THE midnight sun with phantom glare
                            Shone on the soundless thoroughfare
                            Whose shuttered houses, closed and still,
                            Seemed bodies without heart or will;
                            Yea, all the stony city lay
                            Impassive in that phantom day,
                            As amid livid wastes of sand
                            The sphinxes of the desert stand.
                        
                        
                            * * * * * 
                            And we, we two, turned night to day,
                            As, whistling many a student’s lay,
                            We sped along each ghostly street,
                            With girls whose lightly tripping feet
                            
                            Well matched our longer, stronger stride,
                            In hurrying to the water?side.
                            We took a boat; each seized an oar,
                            Until on either hand the shore
                            Slipped backwards, as our voices woke
                            Far echoes, mingling like a dream
                            With swirl and tumult of the stream.
                            On—on—away, beneath the ray
                            Of midnight in the mask of day;
                            By great wharves where the masts at peace
                            Look like the ocean’s barren trees;
                            Past palaces and glimmering towers,
                            And gardens fairy?like with flowers,
                            And parks of twilight green and closes,
                            The very Paradise of roses.
                            The waters flow; on, on we row,
                            Now laughing loud, now whispering low;
                            And through the splendour of the white
                            Electrically glowing night,
                            
                            Wind?wafted from some perfumed dell,
                            Tumultuously there loudly rose
                            Above the Neva’s surge and swell,
                            With amorous ecstasies and throes,
                            And lyric spasms of wildest wail,
                            The love?song of a nightingale.
                        
                        
                            * * * * *
                            I see her still beside me. Yea,
                            As if it were but yesterday,
                            I see her—see her as she smiled;
                            Her face that of a little child
                            For innocent sweetness undefiled;
                            And that pathetic flower?like blue
                            Of eyes which, as they look at you,
                            Seemed yet to stab your bosom through.
                            I rowed, she steered; oars dipped and flashed,
                            The broadening river roared and splashed,
                            So that we hardly seemed to hear
                            Our comrades’ voices, though so near;
                            Their faces seeming far away,
                            
                            As still beneath that phantom day
                            I looked at her, she smiled at me!
                            And then we landed—I and she.
                        
                        
                            * * * * *
                            There’s an old Café in the wood;
                            A students’ haunt on summer eves,
                            Round which responsive poplar leaves
                            Quiver to each æolian mood
                            Like some wild harp a poet smites
                            On visionary summer nights.
                            I ordered supper, took a room
                            Green?curtained by the tremulous gloom
                            Of those fraternal poplar trees
                            Shaking together in the breeze;
                            My pulse, too, like a poplar tree,
                            Shook wildly as she smiled at me.
                            Eye in eye, and hand in hand,
                            Awake amid the slumberous land,
                            I told her all my love that night—
                            How I had loved her at first sight;
                            
                            How I was hers, and seemed to be
                            Her own to all eternity.
                            And through the splendour of the white
                            Electrically glowing night,
                            Wind?wafted from some perfumed dell,
                            Tumultuously there loudly rose
                            Above the Neva’s surge and swell
                            With amorous ecstasies and throes,
                            And lyric spasms of wildest wail,
                            The love?song of the nightingale.
                        
                        
                            * * * * *
                            I see her still beside me. Yea,
                            As if it were but yesterday,
                            I hear her tell with cheek aflame
                            Her ineradicable shame—
                            So sweet flower in such vile hands!
                            Oh, loved and lost beyond recall!
                            Like one who hardly understands,
                            I heard the story of her fall.
                            The odious barter of her youth,
                            
                            Of beauty, innocence and truth,
                            Of all that honest women hold
                            Most sacred—for the sake of gold.
                            A weary 
                                    seamstress
                                    seampstress
                                , half a child,
                            Left unprotected in the street,
                            Where, when so hungry, you would meet
                            All sorts of tempters that beguiled.
                            Oh, infamous and senseless clods,
                            Basely to taint so pure a heart,
                            And make a maid fit for the gods
                            A creature of the common mart!
                            She spoke quite simply of things vile—
                            Of devils with an angel’s face;
                            It seemed the sunshine of her smile
                            Must purify the foulest place.
                            She told me all—she would be true—
                            Told me things too sad, too bad;
                            And, looking in her eyes’ clear blue
                            My passion nearly drove me mad!
                            I tried to speak, but tried in vain;
                            
                            A sob rose to my throat as dry
                            As ashes—for between us twain
                            A murdered virgin seemed to lie.
                            And through the splendour of the white
                            Electrically glowing night.
                            Wind?wafted from some perfumed dell,
                            Tumultuously there loudly rose
                            Above the Neva’s surge and swell,
                            With amorous ecstasies and throes,
                            And lyric spasms of wildest wail,
                            The love?song of a nightingale.
                        
                        
                            * * * * *
                            Poor craven creature! What was I,
                            To sit in judgment on her life,
                            Who dared not make this child my wife,
                            And life her up to love’s own sky?
                            This poor lost child we all—yes, all—
                            Had helped to hurry to her fall,
                            Making a social leper of
                            God’s creature consecrate to love.
                            
                            I looked at her—she smiled no more;
                            She understood it all before
                            A syllable had passed my lips;
                            And like a horrible eclipse,
                            Which blots the sunlight from the skies,
                            A blankness overspread her eyes—
                            The blankness as of one who dies.
                            I knew how much she loved me—knew
                            How pure and passionately true
                            Her love for me, which made her tell
                            What scorched her like the flames of hell.
                            And I, I loved her too, so much, 
                            So dearly, that I dared not touch
                            Her lips that had been kissed in sin;
                            But with a reverential thrill
                            I took her work?worn hand and thin,
                            And kissed her fingers, showing still
                            Where needle?pricks had marred the skin.
                            And, ere I knew, a hot tear fell,
                            Scalding the place which I had kissed,
                            
                            As between clenching teeth I hissed
                            Our irretrievable farewell.
                            And through the smouldering glow of night,
                            Mixed with the shining morning light
                            Wind?wafted from some perfumed dell,
                            Above the Neva’s surge and swell,
                            With lyric spasms, as from a throat
                            Which dying breathes a faltering note,
                            There faded o’er the silent vale
                            The last sob of a nightingale.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE MYSTIC’S VISION.
                        
                            I.
                            AH! I shall kill myself with dreams!
                            These dreams that softly lap me round
                            Through trance?like hours, in which, meseems,
                            That I am swallowed up and drowned;
                            Drowned in your love which flows o’er me
                            As o’er the seaweed flows the sea.
                        
                        
                            II.
                            In watches of the middle night,
                            ’Twixt vesper and ’twixt matin bell,
                            With rigid arms and straining sight,
                            I wait within my narrow cell;
                            With muttered prayers, suspended will,
                            I wait your advent—statue?still.
                        
                        
                        
                            III.
                            Across the Convent garden walls
                            The wind blows from the silver seas;
                            Black shadow of the cypress falls
                            Between the moon?meshed olive trees;
                            Sleep?walking from their golden bowers,
                            Flit disembodied orange flowers.
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            And in God’s consecrated house,
                            All motionless from head to feet,
                            My heart awaits her heavenly Spouse,
                            As white I lie on my white sheet;
                            With body lulled and soul awake,
                            I watch in anguish for your sake.
                        
                        
                            V.
                            And suddenly, across the gloom,
                            The naked moonlight sharply swings;
                            
                            A Presence stirs within the room,
                            A breath of flowers and hovering wings:
                            Your Presence without form and void,
                            Beyond all earthly joys enjoyed.
                        
                        
                            VI.
                            My heart is hushed, my tongue is mute,
                            My life is centred in your will;
                            You play upon me like a lute
                            Which answers to its master’s skill,
                            Till passionately vibrating,
                            Each nerve becomes a throbbing string.
                        
                        
                            VII.
                            Oh, incommunicably sweet!
                            No longer aching and apart,
                            As rain upon the tender wheat,
                            You pour upon my thirsty heart;
                            As scent is bound up in the rose,
                            Your love within my bosom glows.
                        
                        
                        
                            VIII.
                            Unseen, untouched, unheard, unknown,
                            You take possession of your bride;
                            I lose myself to live alone
                            In you, who once were crucified
                            For me, that now would die in you,
                            As in the sun a drop of dew.
                        
                        
                            IX.
                            Fish may not perish in the deep,
                            Nor sparrow fall though yielding air,
                            Pure gold in hottest flame will keep;
                            How should I fail and falter where
                            You are, O Lord, in whose control
                            For ever lies my living soul?
                        
                        
                            X.
                            Ay, break through every wall of sense,
                            And pierce my flesh as nails did pierce
                            
                            Your bleeding limbs in anguish tense,
                            And torture me with bliss so fierce,
                            That self dies out, as die it must,
                            Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
                        
                        
                            XI.
                            Thus let me die, so loved and lost,
                            Annihilated in my dreams!
                            Nor force me, an unwilling ghost,
                            To face the loud day’s brutal beams;
                            The noisy world’s inanities,
                            All vanities of vanities.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE MESSAGE.
                        
                            FROM side to side the sufferer tossed
                            With quick impatient sighs;
                            Her face was bitten as by frost,
                            The look as of one hunted crossed
                            The fever of her eyes.
                        
                        
                            All seared she seemed with life and woe,
                            Yet scarcely could have told
                            More than a score of springs or so;
                            Her hair had girlhood’s morning glow,
                            And yet her mouth looked old.
                        
                        
                            Not long for her the sun would rise,
                            Nor that young slip of moon,
                            
                            Wading through London’s smoky skies,
                            Would dwindling meet those dwindling eyes,
                            Ere May was merged in June.
                        
                        
                            May was it somewhere? Who, alas!
                            Could fancy it was May?
                            For here, instead of meadow grass,
                            You saw, through naked panes of glass,
                            Bare walls of whitish gray.
                        
                        
                            Instead of songs, where in the quick 
                            Leaves hide the blackbirds’ nests,
                            You heard the moaning of the sick,
                            And tortured breathings harsh and thick
                            Drawn from their labouring chests.
                        
                        
                            She muttered, “What’s the odds to me?” 
                            With an old cynic’s sneer;
                            And looking up, cried mockingly,
                            “I hate you, nurse! Why, can’t you see
                            You’ll make no convert here?” 
                            
                            And then she shook her fist at Heaven,
                            And broke into a laugh!
                            Yes, though her sins were seven times seven,
                            Let others pray to be forgiven—
                            She scorned such canting chaff.
                        
                        
                            Oh, it was dreadful, sir! Far worse
                            In one so young and fair;
                            Sometimes she’d scoff and swear and curse;
                            Call me bad names, and vow each nurse
                            A fool for being there.
                        
                        
                            And then she’d fall back on her bed,
                            And many a weary hour
                            Would lie as rigid as one dead;
                            Her white throat with the golden head
                            Like some torn lily flower.
                        
                        
                            We could do nothing, one and all
                            How much we might beseech;
                            
                            Her girlish blood had turned to gall:
                            Far lower than her body’s fall
                            Her soul had sunk from reach.
                        
                        
                            Her soul had sunk into a slough
                            Of evil past repair.
                            The world had been against her; now
                            Nothing in heaven or earth should bow
                            Her stubborn knees in prayer.
                        
                        
                            Yet I felt sorry all the same,
                            And sometimes, when she slept,
                            With head and hands as hot as flame,
                            I watched beside her, half in shame,
                            Smoothed her bright hair and wept.
                        
                        
                            To die like this—’twas awful, sir!
                            To know I prayed in vain;
                            And hear her mock me, and aver
                            That if her life came back to her
                            She’d live her life again.
                        
                        
                        
                            Was she a wicked girl? What then?
                            She didn’t care a pin!
                            She was not worse than all those men
                            Who looked so shocked in public, when
                            They made and shared her sin.
                        
                        
                            “Shut up, nurse, do! Your sermons pall;
                            Why can’t you let me be?
                            Instead of worrying o’er my fall,
                            I wish, just wish, you sisters all
                            Turned to the likes of me.”
                        
                        
                            I shuddered! I could bear no more,
                            And left her to her fate;
                            She was too cankered at the core;
                            Her heart was like a bolted door,
                            Where Love had knocked too late.
                        
                        
                            I left her in her savage spleen,
                            And hoarsely heard her shout,
                            
                            “What does the cursed sunlight mean
                            By shining in upon this scene?
                            Oh, shut the sunlight out!”
                        
                        
                            Sighing, I went my round once more, 
                            Full heavy for her sin;
                            Just as Big Ben was striking four,
                            The sun streamed through the open door,
                            As a young girl came in.
                        
                        
                            She held a basket full of flowers—
                            Cowslip and columbine;
                            A lilac bunch from rustic bowers,
                            Strong?scented after morning showers,
                            Smelt like some cordial wine.
                        
                        
                            There, too, peeped Robin?in?the?hedge,
                            There daisies pearled with dew,
                            Wild parsley from the meadow’s edge,
                            Sweet?william and the purple vetch,
                            And hyacinth’s heavenly blue.
                        
                        
                        
                            But best of all the spring’s array,
                            Green boughs of milk?white thorn;
                            Their petals on each perfumed spray
                            Looked like the wedding gift of May
                            On nature’s marriage morn.
                        
                        
                            And she who bore those gifts of grace
                            To our poor patients there,
                            Passed like a sunbeam through the place:
                            Dull eyes grew brighter for her face,
                            Angelically fair.
                        
                        
                            She went the round with elf?like tread,
                            And with kind words of cheer,
                            Soothing as balm of Gilead,
                            Laid wild flowers on each patient’s bed,
                            And made the flowers more dear.
                        
                        
                            At last she came where Nellie Dean 
                            Still moaned and tossed about—
                            
                            “What does the cursed sunlight mean
                            By shining in upon this scene?
                            Will no one shut it out?”
                        
                        
                            And then she swore with rage and pain,
                            And moaning tried to rise;
                            It seemed her ugly words must stain
                            The child who stood with heart astrain,
                            And large blue listening eyes.
                        
                        
                            Her fair face did not blush or bleach,
                            She did not shrink away;
                            Alas! she was beyond the reach
                            Of sweet or bitter human speech—
                            Deaf as the flowers of May.
                        
                        
                            Only her listening eyes could hear
                            That hardening in despair,
                            Which made that other girl, so near
                            In age to her, a thing to fear
                            Like fever?tainted air.
                        
                        
                        
                            She took green boughs of milk?white thorn
                            And laid them on the sheet,
                            Whispering appealingly, “Don’t scorn
                            My flowers! I think, when one’s forlorn,
                            They’re like a message, Sweet.”
                        
                        
                            How heavenly fresh those blossoms smelt,
                            Like showers on thirsty ground!
                            The sick girl frowned as if repelled, 
                            And with hot hands began to pelt
                            And fling them all around.
                        
                        
                            But then some influence seemed to stay
                            Her hands with calm control;
                            Her stormy passion cleared away,
                            The perfume of the breath of May
                            Had passed into her soul.
                        
                        
                            A nerve of memory had been thrilled,
                            And, pushing back her hair,
                            
                            She stretched out hungry arms half filled
                            With flower and leaf, and panting shrilled,
                            “Where are you, mother, where?”
                        
                        
                            And then her eyes shone darkly bright
                            Through childhood in a mist,
                            As if she suddenly caught sight
                            Of some one hidden in the light
                            And waited to be kissed.
                        
                        
                            “Oh, mother dear!” we heard her moan,
                            “Have you not gone away?
                            I dreamed, dear mother, you had gone,
                            And left me in the world alone,
                            In the wild world astray.
                        
                        
                            “It was a dream; I’m home again!
                            I hear the ivy?leaves
                            Tap?tapping on the leaded pane!
                            Oh, listen! how the laughing rain
                            Runs from our cottage eaves!
                        
                        
                        
                            “How very sweet the things do smell!
                            How bright our pewter shines!
                            I am at home; I feel so well:
                            I think I hear the evening bell
                            Above our nodding pines.
                        
                        
                            “The firelight glows upon the brick,
                            And pales the rising moon;
                            And when your needles flash and click,
                            My heart, my heart, that felt so sick,
                            Throbs like a hive in June.
                        
                        
                            “If only father would not stay
                            And gossip o’er his brew;
                            Then, reeling homewards, lose his way,
                            Come staggering in at break of day
                            And beat you black and blue!
                        
                        
                            “Yet he can be as good as gold, 
                            When mindful of the farm,
                            
                            He tills the field and tends the fold:
                            But never fear; when I’m grown old
                            I’ll keep him out of harm.
                        
                        
                            “And then we’ll be as happy here
                            As kings upon their throne!
                            I dreamed you’d left me, mother dear;
                            That you lay dead this many a year
                            Beneath the churchyard stone.
                        
                        
                            “Mother, I sought you far and wide,
                            And ever in my dream,
                            Just out of reach you seemed to hide;
                            I ran along the streets and cried,
                            ’Where are you, mother, where?’
                        
                        
                            “Through never?ending streets in fear
                            I ran and ran forlorn;
                            And through the twilight yellow?drear
                            I saw blurred masks of loafers leer,
                            And point at me in scorn.
                        
                        
                        
                            “How tired, how deadly tired, I got;
                            I ached through all my bones!
                            The lamplight grew one quivering blot,
                            And like one rooted to the spot,
                            I dropped upon the stones.
                        
                        
                            “A hard bed make the stones and cold,
                            The mist a wet, wet sheet;
                            And in the mud, like molten gold,
                            The snaky lamplight blinking rolled
                            Like guineas at my feet.
                        
                        
                            “Surely there were no mothers when
                            A voice hissed in my ear,
                            ‘A sovereign! Quick! Come on!’—and then
                            A knowing leer! There were but men, 
                            And not a creature near.
                        
                        
                            “I went—I could not help it. Oh,
                            I didn’t want to die!
                            
                            With now a kiss and now a blow,
                            Strange men would come, strange men would go;
                            I didn’t care—not I.
                        
                        
                            “Sometimes my life was like a tale
                            Read in a story?book;
                            Our blazing nights turned daylight pale,
                            Champagne would fizz like ginger?ale,
                            Red wine flow like a brook.
                        
                        
                            “Then like a vane my dream would veer:
                            I walked the street again;
                            And through the twilight yellow?drear
                            Blurred clouds of faces seemed to peer,
                            And drift across the rain.”
                        
                        
                            She started with a piercing scream 
                            And wildly rolling eye:
                            “Ah me! it was no evil dream
                            To pass with the first market?team—
                            That thing of shame am I.
                        
                        
                        
                            “Where were you that you could not come?
                            Were you so far above—
                            Far as the moon above a slum?
                            Yet, mother, you were all the sum
                            I had of human love.
                        
                        
                            “Ah yes! you’ve sent this branch of May.
                            A fair light from the past.
                            The town is dark—I went astray.
                            Forgive me, mother! Lead the way;
                            I’m going home at last.”
                        
                        
                            In eager haste she tried to rise,
                            And struggled up in bed,
                            With luminous, transfigured eyes,
                            As if they glassed the opening skies,
                            Fell back, sir, and was dead.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A MOTHER’S DREAM.
                        
                            I.
                            THE snow was falling thick and fast
                            On Christmas Eve;
                            Across the heath the distant blast
                            Wailed wildly like a soul in grief,
                            As waste soul or a windy leaf
                            Whirled round and round without reprieve,
                            And lost at last.
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Lisa woke shivering from her sleep
                            At break of day,
                            And felt her flesh begin to creep.
                            
                            “My child, my child!” she cried; “now may
                            Our blessed Lord, whose hand doth stay
                            The wild?fowl on their trackless way,
                            Thee guard and keep.”
                        
                        
                            III.
                            “Dreams! dreams!” she to herself did say,
                            And shook with fright.
                            “I saw her plainly where I lay
                            Fly past me like a flash of light;
                            Fly out into the wintry night,
                            Out in the snow as snowy white,
                            Far, far away.
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            “Her cage hung empty just above
                            Your chair, ma mie;
                            Empty as is my heart of love
                            
                            Since you, my child, dwell far from me—
                            Dwell in the convent over sea;
                            All of you left to love Marie,
                            Your darling dove.”
                        
                        
                            V.
                            Hark to that fond, familiar coo!
                            Oh, joy untold!
                            It falls upon her heart like dew.
                            There safely perching as of old,
                            The dove is calling through the cold
                            And ghastly dawn o’er wood and wold,
                            “Coo?whoo! Coo?whoo!”
                        
                        
                            VI.
                            The snow fell softly, flake by flake,
                            This Christmas Day,
                            And whitened every bush and brake;
                            
                            And o’er the hills so ashen gray
                            The wind was wailing far away,
                            Was wailing like a child astray
                            Whose heart must break.
                        
                        
                            VII.
                            “I miss my child,” she wailed; “I miss
                            Her everywhere!
                            That’s why I have such dreams as this.
                            I miss her step upon the stair,
                            I miss her laughter in the air,
                            I miss her bonnie face and hair,
                            And oh—her kiss!
                        
                        
                            VIII.
                            “Christmas! Last Christmas, oh how fleet,
                            With lark?like trill,
                            She danced about on fairy feet!
                            
                            Her eyes clear as a mountain rill,
                            Where the blue sky is lingering still;
                            Her rosebud lips the dove would bill
                            For something sweet.
                        
                        
                            IX.
                            “My dove! my dear! my undefiled!
                            Oh, heavy doom!
                            My life has left me with the child.
                            She was a sunbeam in my room,
                            She was a rainbow on the gloom,
                            She was the wild rose on a tomb
                            Where weeds run wild.
                        
                        
                            X.
                            “And yet—’tis better thus! ’Tis best,
                            They tell me so.
                            Yes, though my heart is like a nest,
                            
                            Whence all the little birds did go—
                            And empty nest that’s full of snow—
                            Let me take all the wail and woe,
                            So she be blest.
                        
                        
                            XI.
                            “Let me take all the sin and shame,
                            And weep for two,
                            That she may bear no breath of blame.
                            ’Sin—sin!’ they say; what sin had you,
                            Pure as the dawn upon the dew?
                            Child—robbed of a child’s rightful due,
                            Her father’s name.
                        
                        
                            XII.
                            “I gave her life to live forlorn!
                            Oh, let that day
                            Be darkness wherein I was born!
                            
                            Let not God light it, let no ray
                            Shine on it; let it turn away
                            Its face, because my sin must weigh
                            Her down with shame.
                        
                        
                            XIII.
                            “I? I? Was I the sinner? I,
                            Not he, they say,
                            Who told me, looking eye in eye,
                            We’d wed far North where grand and gray
                            His fair ancestral castle lay,
                            Amid the woods of Darnaway—
                            And told a lie.
                        
                        
                            XIV.
                            “But I was young; and in my youth
                            I simply thought
                            That English gentlemen spoke truth,
                            
                            Even to a Norman maid, who wrought
                            The blush?rose shells the tide had brought
                            To fairy toys which children bought
                            Before my booth.
                        
                        
                            XV.
                            “‘Those fairy fingers,’ he would say,
                            ‘With shell?pink nails,
                            Shall shame the pearls of Darnaway!’
                            And in his yacht with swelling sails
                            We flew before the favouring gales,
                            Where leagues on leagues his woods and vales
                            Stretched dim and gray.
                        
                        
                            XVI.
                            “Grim rose his castle o’er the wood;
                            Its hoary halls
                            Frowned o’er the Findhorn’s roaring flood;
                            
                            Where, winged with spray and water?galls,
                            The headlong torrent leaps and falls
                            In thunder through its tunnelled walls,
                            Streaked as with blood.”
                        
                        
                            XVII.
                            It all came back in one wild flash
                            Of cruel light,
                            And memory smote her like a lash:—
                            The foolish trust, the fond delight,
                            The helpless rage, the fevered flight,
                            The feet that dragged on through the night,
                            The torrent’s splash.
                        
                        
                            XVIII.
                            The long, long sickness bred of lies
                            And lost belief;
                            The short, sharp pangs and shuddering sighs;
                            
                            The new?born babe, that in her grief
                            Bore her wrecked spirit such relief
                            As the dove?carried olive?leaf
                            To Noah’s eyes.
                        
                        
                            XIX.
                            It all came back, and lit her soul
                            With lurid flame;
                            How she—she—she—from whom he stole
                            Her virgin love and honest name—
                            Must, for the ailing child’s sake, tame
                            Her pride, and take—oh, shame of shame!—
                            His lordship’s dole.
                        
                        
                            XX.
                            Like one whom grief hath driven wild,
                            She cried again,
                            “My snowdrop shall not be defiled,
                            
                            Nor catch the faintest soil or stain,
                            Reared in the shadow of my pain!
                            How should a guilty mother train
                            A guiltless child?
                        
                        
                            XXI.
                            “You shall be spotless, you!” said she,
                            “Whate’er my woe;
                            Even as the snow on yonder lea.
                            You shall be spotless!” Faint and low,
                            The wind in dying seemed to blow,
                            To breathe across the hills of snow,
                            “Marie! Marie!”
                        
                        
                            XXII.
                            A voice was calling far away,
                            O’er fields and fords,
                            Across the Channel veiled and gray;
                            
                            A voice was calling without words,
                            Touching her nature’s deepest chords;
                            Drawing her, drawing her as with cords—
                            She might not stay.
                        
                        
                            XXIII.
                            Uprose the sun and still and round,
                            Shorn of his heat,
                            Glared bloodshot o’er the frosty ground,
                            As down the shuttered village street
                            Fast, fast walked Lisa, and her feet
                            Left black tracks in earth’s winding?sheet
                            And made no sound.
                        
                        
                            XXIV.
                            Then on, on, by the iron way—
                            With whistling scream—
                            Piercing hard rocks like potter’s clay,
                            
                            She flashed as in a shifting dream
                            Through flying town, o’er flowing stream,
                            Borne on by mighty wings of steam,
                            Away, away.
                        
                        
                            XXV.
                            A sound of wind, and in the air
                            The sea?gull’s screech,
                            And waves lap?lapping everywhere;
                            A rush of ropes and volleyed speech,
                            And white cliffs sinking out of reach,
                            Then rising on the rival beach,
                            Boulogne?sur?Mer.
                        
                        
                            XXVI.
                            Above the ramparts on the hill,
                            Whence like a chart
                            It saw the low land spreading chill,
                            
                            Within its cloistered walls apart
                            The Convent of the Sacred Heart
                            Rose o’er the noise of street and mart,
                            Serenely still.
                        
                        
                            XXVII.
                            Above the unquiet sea it rose,
                            A quiet nest,
                            Severed from earthly wants and woes.
                            There might the weary find his rest;
                            There might the pilgrim cease his quest;
                            There might the soul with guilt oppressed
                            Implore repose.
                        
                        
                            XXVIII.
                            The day was done, the sun dropped low
                            Behind the mill
                            That swung within its blood?red glow;
                            
                            And up the street and up the hill
                            Lisa walked fast and faster still,
                            Her sable shadow lengthening chill
                            Across the snow.
                        
                        
                            XXIX.
                            Hark! heavenly clear, with holy swell,
                            She hears elate
                            The greeting of the vesper bell,
                            And, knocking at the convent gate,
                            Sighs, “Here she prays God early and late;
                            Walled in from love, walled in from hate;
                            All’s well! All’s well!”
                        
                        
                            XXX.
                            A sweat broke from her every pore,
                            And yet she smiled,
                            As, stumbling through the clanging door,
                            
                            She faced a nun of aspect mild.
                            Like some starved wolf’s her eyes gleamed wild:
                            “My child!” she gasped; “I want my child.”
                            And nothing more.
                        
                        
                            XXXI.
                            The nun looked at her, shocked to see
                            The violent sway 
                            Of love’s unbridled agony;
                            And calmly queried on the way,
                            “Your child, Madame? What child, I pray?”
                            Still, still the mother could but say,
                            “Marie! Marie!”
                        
                        
                            XXXII.
                            The nun in silence bowed her head,
                            And then aloud,
                            “Christ Jesus knows our needs,” she said.
                            
                            “Madame, far from the sinful crowd,
                            The maiden to the Lord you vowed;
                            There is no safeguard like a shroud—
                            Your child is dead.
                        
                        
                            XXXIII.
                            “Upon the night Christ saw the light
                            She passed away,
                            As snow will when the sun shines bright.
                            We heard her moaning where she lay,
                            ‘Come, mother, come, while yet you may;’
                            Then like a dove, at break of day,
                            Her soul took flight.”
                        
                        
                            XXXIV.
                            As from a blow the mother fell,
                            No moan made she;
                            They bore her to the little cell:
                            
                            There in her coffin lay Marie,
                            Spotless as snow upon the lea,
                            Beautiful exceedingly:
                            All’s well! All’s well!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A CARNIVAL EPISODE.
                        NICE, ’87.
                        
                            I.
                            WE two there together alone in the night,
                            Where its shadow unconsciously bound us;
                            My beautiful lady all shrouded in white,
                            She and I looking down from the balcony’s height
                            On the maskers below in the flickering light,
                            As they revelled and rioted round us.
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Such a rush, such a rage, and a rapture of life
                            Such shouts of delight and of laughter,
                            
                            On the quays that I watched with the General’s wife;
                            Such a merry?go?reeling of figures was rife,
                            Turning round to the tune of gay fiddle and fife,
                            As if never a morning came after.
                        
                        
                            III.
                            The houses had emptied themselves in the streets,
                            Where the maskers bombarded each other
                            With a shower of confetti and hailstorm of sweets.
                            Till the pavements were turning the colour of sheets;
                            Where a prince will crack jokes with a pauper he meets,
                            For the time like a man and a brother.
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            The Carnival frolic wa now at its height;
                            The whole population in motion
                            
                            Stood watching the swift constellations of light
                            That crackling flashed up on their arrowy flight,
                            Then spreading their fairy?like fires on the night,
                            Fell in luminous rain on the ocean.
                        
                        
                            V.
                            And now and again the quick dazzle would flare,
                            Glowing red on black masks and white dresses.
                            We two there together drew back from the glare;
                            Drew in to the room, and her hood unaware
                            Fell back from the plaits of her opulent hair,
                            That uncoiled the brown snakes of its tresses.
                        
                        
                            VI.
                            How fatally fair was my lady, my queen,
                            As that wild light fell round her in flashes;
                            How fatally fair with that mutinous mien,
                            And those velvety hands all alive with the sheen
                            Of her rings, and her eyes that were narrowed between
                            Heavy lids darkly laced with long lashes!
                        
                        
                        
                            VII.
                            Almost I hated her beauty! The air
                            I was breathing seemed steeped in her presence.
                            How maddening that waltz was! Ah, how came I there
                            Alone with that woman so fatally fair,
                            With the scent of her garments, the smell of her hair,
                            Passing in to my blood like an essence?
                        
                        
                            VIII.
                            Her eyes seemed to pluck at the roots of my heart,
                            And to put all my blood in a fever;
                            My soul was on fire, my veins seemed to start,
                            To hold her, to fold her but once to my heart,
                            I’d have willingly bared broad chest to the dart,
                            And been killed, ay, and damned too for ever.
                        
                        
                        
                            IX.
                            I forgot, I forgot!—oh, disloyal, abhorred,
                            With the spell of her eyes on my eyes—
                            That her husband, the man of all men I adored,
                            Might be fighting for us at the point of the sword;
                            Might be killing or killed by an African horde,
                            Afar beneath African skies.
                        
                        
                            X.
                            I forgot—nay, I cared not! What cared I to?night
                            For aught but my lady, my love,
                            As she toyed with her mask in the flickering light,
                            Then suddenly dropped it, perchance, at the sight
                            Of my passion now reaching its uttermost height,
                            As a tide with the full moon above!
                        
                        
                            XI.
                            Yet I knew, though I loved her so madly, I knew
                            She was only just playing her game.
                            She would toy with my heart all the Carnival through;
                            She would turn to a traitor a man who was true;
                            She would drain him of love and then break him in two,
                            And wash her white hands of his shame.
                        
                        
                            XII.
                            Yet beware, O my beautiful lady, beware!
                            You must cure me of love or else kill.
                            That fire burns longest that’s slowest to flare:
                            My love is a force that will force you to care;
                            Nay, I’ll strangle us both in the ropes of your hair
                            Should you dream you can drop me at will.
                        
                        
                            XIII.
                            And then—how I know not—delirious delight!
                            Her lips were pressed close upon mine;
                            
                            My arms clung about her as when in affright
                            Wrecked men cling to spars in a tempest at night;
                            So madly I clung to her, crushed her with might
                            To my heart which her heart made divine.
                        
                        
                            XIV.
                            Oh, merciful Heavens! What drove us apart
                            With a shudder of sundering lives?
                            Oh, was it the throb of my passionate heart
                            That made the doors tremble, the windows to start;
                            Or was it my lady just playing her part,
                            Most indignant, most outraged of wives?
                        
                        
                            XV.
                            She was white as the chalk in the streets—was she fain
                            To turn on me now with a sneer?
                            
                            All the blood in my body surged up to my brain,
                            And my heart seemed half bursting with passion and pain,
                            As I seized her slim hands—but I dropped them again!
                            Ah! treason is mother to fear.
                        
                        
                            XVI.
                            Had it come upon us at that magical hour,
                            The judgment of God the Most High?
                            The floor ’gan to heave and the ceiling to lower,
                            The dead walls to start with malevolent power,
                            Till your hair seemed to rise and your spirit to cower,
                            As the very stones shook with a sigh.
                        
                        
                            XVII.
                            “With you in my arms let the world crack asunder;
                            Let us die, love, together!” I cried.
                            
                            Then, with a clatter and boom as of thunder,
                            A beam crashed between us and drove us asunder,
                            And all things rocked round us, above us and under,
                            Like a boat that is rocked on a tide.
                        
                        
                            XVIII.
                            She sprang like a greyhound—no greyhound more fleet—
                            And ran down the staircase in motion;
                            And blindly I followed her into the street,
                            All choked up with people in panic retreat
                            From the houses that scattered their plaster like sleet
                            On the crowd in bewildered commotion.
                        
                        
                            XIX.
                            Black masks and white dominoes, hale men and dying,
                            Scared women that shook as with fever
                            
                            Poor babes in their bedgowns all piteously crying,
                            Tiles hurled from the housetops—all flying, all flying,
                            As I, wild with passion, implored her with sighing
                            To fly with me now and for ever.
                        
                        
                            XX.
                            “Go, go!” and she waved me away as she spoke,
                            Carried on by the crowd like a feather;
                            “You forget that it was but a Carnival joke.
                            Now blest be the terrible earthquake that broke
                            In between you and me, and has saved at a stroke
                            Us two in the night there together.”
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE BATTLE OF FLOWERS.
                        
                            I.
                            THE battle raged, no blood was spilled, 
                            Though missiles flew in showers;
                            Hard though they hit, they never killed
                            Or maimed the merry throwers:
                            Or if they killed, those wingèd darts,
                            They killed but unprotected hearts;
                            For flowers from flower?like hands can slay
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Like humming?birds upon the breeze
                            So swiftly shot the posies;
                            Glory of red anemones,
                            Pink buds of curled?up roses,
                            
                            Lilacs and lilies of the vale;
                            Yea, every flower that scents the gale
                            Yielded up incense to its day,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            III.
                            How gallantly along the course,
                            Stepping with conscious glances,
                            Each flower?decked, gaily harnessed horse,
                            In rank and file advances!
                            Even as green boughs and daisy?chains
                            Enwreathe their bits and bridle?reins,
                            Bright pleasure hides black grief away
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            The people humming like a hive,
                            Swarm closely pressed together,
                            To watch high fashion’s crowded drive
                            With flirt of fan and feather;
                            
                            And nosegays thrown up high in air,
                            Now hitting gray, now golden hair,
                            Now deftly caught upon their way,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            V.
                            And past the eager jostling crowd,
                            Watching their guests from far lands,
                            Gigs flash by in a violet cloud,
                            And drags with rose?red garlands;
                            There meet crowned heads from many zones,
                            And princes who have lost their thrones,
                            With gifts from Ind and far Cathay,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            VI.
                            Ah, who shall bear away the prize
                            In this bewitching battle,
                            Where shafts are hurled from brightest eyes,
                            And Cupid’s arrows rattle;
                            
                            In that fair fight where flowers alone
                            By fairer flowers are overthrown?
                            Who shall be victor in this fray?
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            VII.
                            And people bet with buzz of tongue
                            As the gay pageant passes;
                            Now runs a murmur through the throng
                            And stirs the thrilling masses.
                            All heads are turned, all necks astrain, 
                            As through the thickening floral rain,
                            “Look! look! She comes!” you hear them say—
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            VIII.
                            No turn?out in that festive throng
                            Is half so bright and airy;
                            Your cream?white ponies prance along
                            As if they drew a fairy;
                            
                            They step along with heads held high,
                            And favours blue to match the sky:
                            They know theirs is the winning way,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            IX.
                            A queen in exile might you be,
                            Or leader of the fashion?
                            Some Jenny Lind from over sea
                            Melting all hearts with passion?
                            Some tragic Muse whose mighty spell
                            Unlocks the gates of heaven and hell?
                            What sceptre is it that you sway?
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            X.
                            All by yourself in spotless white,
                            You sit there in your glory;
                            Your black eyes scintillate with light—
                            Eyes that may hide a story.
                            
                            In spotless white with ribbons blue,
                            You look fresh from a bath of dew
                            That sparkles in the rising day,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XI.
                            Triumphant—without shame or fear—
                            You air a thousand graces;
                            Though women turn when you appear
                            With cold, averted faces;
                            Though men at sight of you will stop,
                            As if they looked into a shop;
                            Shall both for this not doubly pay?
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XII.
                            And with a smile upon your lips,
                            Perhaps a shade too rosy,
                            You shake two dainty finger?tips
                            And lightly fling a posy:
                            
                            So might a high?born dame perchance,
                            In days of tourneys and romance,
                            Have flung her glove into the fray,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XIII.
                            As with that little careless sign
                            You fling your bouquet lightly,
                            Three graybeards, flushing as with wine,
                            Lift hats and bow politely;
                            And one, the grandest of the three,
                            Stoops low with stiff, rheumatic knee;
                            Out of the dust he picks your spray,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XIV.
                            His coat is all ablaze with stars
                            For deeds of martial daring;
                            His name, a watchword in the wars,
                            Kept soldiers from despairing.
                            
                            Now see beside his orders rare
                            Your mignonette and maidenhair;
                            With just a nod you turn away,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XV.
                            You turn to meet the wintry face
                            Of an old beggar?woman,
                            Just there beyond the railed?in space,
                            Brown, bony, hardly human;
                            Who in her tatters seems at least
                            The skeleton of Egypt’s feast;
                            A ghastly emblem of decay,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XVI.
                            With palsied head and shaking hand,
                            As if it were December,
                            Grim by the barrier see her stand,
                            Just mumbling a “Remember!
                            
                            Remember in thy days of lust,
                            That fairest flesh must come to dust;
                            Then have some pity while you may,”
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XVII.
                            Why do you shiver at her glance,
                            As if the wind blew chilly?
                            Why does your rosy countenance
                            Turn pale as any lily?
                            The sun is warm, the sky is bright,
                            The sea dissolving into light
                            Breaks into blossom?bells of spray;
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XVIII.
                            Ah, could some instinct in your breast
                            Reveal that beggar’s story,
                            Would not your gay life lost its zest,
                            Your empire lost its glory?
                            
                            Or would you only care to waste
                            Life’s bounty in yet hotter haste?
                            For is the world not beauty’s prey?
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XIX.
                            Alighting at the beggar’s feet,
                            A bright Napoleon flashes!
                            Then gaily through the dust and heat
                            Your light Victoria dashes.
                            Again your face is rosy clear,
                            As with a loud and ringing cheer
                            They hail you winner of the day,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XX.
                            And gloriously at set of sun,
                            In triumph now departing,
                            The golden prize your flowers have won
                            Leaves rival bosoms smarting.
                            
                            How many deem you half divine,
                            Where amid bouquets you recline—
                            Proud beauty in the devil’s pay,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                        
                            XXI.
                            Down, down beneath the rolling wheels,
                            The flowers, so fresh this morning,
                            Lie trampled under careless heels,
                            Vile stuff for all men’s scorning.
                            The roses crushed, the lilies soiled,
                            The violets of their sweets despoiled,
                            In dusty heaps defile your way,
                            Jeanne Ray! Jeanne Ray!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        THE SONG OF THE WILLI.
                        According to a widespread Hungarian superstition—showing the
                            ingrained national passion for dancing—the Willi or Willis were the
                            spirits of young affianced girls who, dying before marriage, could not
                            rest in their graves. It was popularly believed that these phantoms
                            would nightly haunt lonely heaths in the neighbourhood of their native
                            villages till the disconsolate lovers came as if drawn by a magnetic
                            charm. On their appearance the Willi would dance with them without
                            intermission till they dropped dead from exhaustion.
                        
                            I.
                            THE wild wind is whistling o’er moorland and heather,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            I rise from my bed, and my bed has no feather,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            My bed is deep down in the brown sullen mould,
                            My head is laid low on the clod;
                            So wormy the sheets, and the pillow so cold,
                            Of clammy and moist clinging sod.
                        
                        
                        
                            II.
                            The long livid moon rides alone high in heaven, 
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            The stars’ cutting glitter their dull shrouds hath riven, 
                            Heigh?ho!
                            I rise and I glide out far into the night,
                            A shadow so swift and so still;
                            Bleak, bleak is the moonshine all ghastly and white,
                            The dank morass drinketh its fill.
                        
                        
                            III.
                            And down in yon valley in wan vapour shrinking,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            The bare moated town cowers fitfully blinking,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            There, warm under shelter, the fire burning bright,
                            My lover sleeps sound in his bed;
                            
                            But I flit alone in the pitiless night,
                            Unpitied, unloved, and unwed.
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            And hast thou forgotten the deep troth we plighted?
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            Too warm was thy love by cold death to be blighted,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            My sweetheart! and mind’st thou that this is the night,
                            The night that we should have been wed?
                            And while I flit restless, a low wailing sprite,
                            Ah, say, canst thou sleep in thy bed?
                        
                        
                            V.
                            A week, but a week, and a wreath of gay flowers,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            
                            I wore as I vied with the fleet?footed hours,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            As I vied with the hours in dancing them down
                            Till the stars reeled low in the sky,
                            And sweet came thy whispers as rose?leaves when blown
                            About in the breeze of July.
                        
                        
                            VI.
                            “Thou’rt light, O my chosen; a bird is not lighter,
                            O love, my love!
                            I’d dance into death with thee; death would be brighter,
                            My love!”
                            And they struck up a wild and a wonderful measure;
                            Quick, quick beat our hearts to the tune;
                            Quick, quick the feet flew in a frenzy of pleasure,
                            To the sound of the fife and bassoon.
                        
                        
                        
                            VII.
                            Oh, on whirled the pairs on the swift music driven,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            Like gossamer vapours afloat in high heaven,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            Like gossamer vapours, in silence they fled,
                            With a shifting of face into face;
                            But fleeter than all the fleet dancers we sped
                            In the rush of the rapturous race.
                        
                        
                            VIII.
                            How often turned Wanda, the slim, lily?throated,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            And gazed at wistful as onward we floated,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            And Bilba, the swarthy, whose eyes had the trick
                            Of a stag’s, with a glitter of steel;
                            She lifted her lashes, so long and so thick,
                            To stare at my true love and leal.
                        
                        
                        
                            IX.
                            But he, he saw none o’ them, brown?faced or rosy,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            Tho’ maidens bloomed bright like a fresh?gathered posy,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            For his eyes that shone black as the sloes of the hedges,
                            They shone like two stars over me;
                            And his breath, thrilling o’er me as wind over sedges,
                            Stirred my hair till I tingled with glee.
                        
                        
                            X.
                            Now slow as two down?bosomed swans, we were sliding,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            O’er the low heaving swell of the silver sounds gliding,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            
                            Now hollowly booming drums rumbled apace,
                            Flashed sharp clatt’ring cymbals around,
                            And swung like loose leaves in a stormy embrace
                            We whirled in a tumult of sound.
                        
                        
                            XI.
                            But pallid our cheeks grew, late flushing with pleasure,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            As slowly away swooned the languishing measure, 
                            Heigh?ho!
                            For shrill crew the cock as the sun ’gan to rise,
                            And it rang from afar like a knell;
                            Our kisses grew bitter and sweet grew our sighs,
                            As sadly we murmured, “Farewell!”
                        
                        
                            XII.
                            High up in the chambers the maidens together,
                            O love, my love!
                            
                            Were piling bleached linen as white as swan’s feather
                            My love!
                            Were weaving and spinning and singing aloud,
                            While broidering my bride?veil of lace;
                            But the three fatal sisters they wove me my shroud,
                            And death kissed me cold on the face.
                        
                        
                            XIII.
                            The wild wind is whistling o’er moorland and heather,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            I rise from my bed, and my bed has no feather,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            The snow driveth grisly and ghostly, and gleams
                            In the glare of the moon’s chilly glance;
                            What pale flitting phantoms aroused by her beams,
                            Are circling in shadowy dance!
                        
                        
                        
                            XIV.
                            Mayhap ye were maidens death plucked in your flower,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            As clustering you glowed in love’s murmuring bower,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            Who, delirious for life from the gloom of your graves,
                            Are driven to wander with me,
                            And you rise from your tombs like the white?crested waves
                            From the depths of the dolorous sea.
                        
                        
                            XV.
                            Ah, maidens, pale maidens, o’er moorland and heather,
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            The bridegroom is coming athwart the wild weather,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            
                            Full shines the fair moon on his beautiful face,
                            He walketh like one in a trance;
                            Nay, is running like one who is running a race
                            Against death, with his dead bride to dance.
                        
                        
                            XVI.
                            At the sound of thy footfall my numb heart is shaken,
                            O love, my love!
                            Once again all its pulses to new life awaken,
                            My love!
                            It leaps like a stag that is borne as on wings
                            To the brooks thawing thick through the noon,
                            Like a lark from the glebe, like a lily that springs
                            From its bier to the bosom of June.
                        
                        
                            XVII.
                            “I hold thee, I hold thee, I drink thy caresses,
                            O love, my love!”
                            
                            Round thy face, round thy throat, I roll my dank tresses,
                            My love!
                            “I hold thee, I hold thee! Eight nights, wan and weeping,”
                            I wandered loud sobbing thy name!
                            “Thy lips are as cold as the snowdrift a?sweeping;”
                            But thy breath soon shall fan them to flame!
                        
                        
                            XVIII.
                            Blow up for the dance now o’er moorland and heather!
                            Heigh?ho, heigh?ho!
                            Blow, blow you wild winds, while we two dance together,
                            Heigh?ho!
                            Till the clouds dance above with tempestuous embraces
                            Of maidenly moonbeams in flight;
                            In the silvery rear of whose fugitive traces
                            Reel the stars through the revelling night!
                        
                        
                        
                            XIX.
                            “Cocks crow, and the breath on thy sweep lip is failing,
                            O love, my love!”
                            Stars swoon, and the flame in thy dark eye is quailing,
                            My love!
                            “Oh, brighter the night than the fires of the day”
                            When thine eyes shine as stars over me!
                            “Oh, sweeter thy grave than the soft breath of May!”
                            Then down, Love to death, but with thee.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SCHERZO.
                        
                            OH, beloved, come and bring
                            All the flowery wealth of spring!
                            Though the leaf be in the sere,
                            Icy winter creeping near;
                            Though the trees like mourners all
                            Standing at a funeral,
                            Black against the pallid air
                            Toss their wild arms in despair,
                            With their bald heads sadly bowed
                            O’er dead summer in her shroud.
                            Yea, though golden days be o’er,
                            If you enter at my door,
                            Spring, dear spring, will come once more.
                            There will break upon the night
                            
                            That glad flash of dewy light 
                            Which, like young love in a pet,
                            Once with sunny tears would wet 
                            Many a wild?wood violet;
                            And the hyacinth will arise
                            In the April of your eyes.
                            Blossoms of the apple tree?
                            Rarer blossoms bloom for me 
                            In the cunning white and red,
                            Most felicitously wed,
                            On your cheek. And then your brow—
                            Can a snow?white cherry?bough
                            Match its bland, unsullied hue,
                            Where, like threads of silky blue,
                            Little veins show here and there
                            Through broad temples where your hair,
                            Clustering, hangs a tender brown
                            Softer than the fluffy down
                            Which before the leaf in March 
                            Beards the lime tree and the larch?
                            
                            Shall I grieve because the rose,
                            The red rose, no longer blows,
                            Since all roses you eclipse
                            With the roses of your lips?
                            And what matter, O my sweet,
                            Though the genial light and heat
                            Have departed for a while!
                            Only let me see you smile,
                            Let me see that dulcet curve
                            Like a dimpling wavelet swerve
                            Round the coral of your mouth,
                            And the North will change to South:
                            To the happy South, whose clear
                            Light o’er?brimming atmosphere,
                            Flowing in at every pore,
                            Sets life glowing to the core.
                            You are light and life in sooth,
                            Fair as was that Grecian youth
                            Who in her cold sphere above
                            Drove poor Dian mad with love—
                            
                            When she saw him where he lay,
                            White and golden like a spray
                            Of tall jonquils whose intense 
                            Sweetness faints upon the sense;
                            When she saw him swathed in light,
                            Couched on the aërial height
                            Of hoar Latmos, hushed and warm;
                            While, to shield him from all harm,
                            Like a woman’s rounded arm,
                            A fresh creeper wildly fair
                            Twined around his throat and hair.
                            And the goddess clean forgot
                            Her fair fame without a blot,
                            And untarnished reputation,
                            Free from faintest imputation
                            Of such frailties as the fair
                            Dwellers in Elysian air
                            Find recorded to their shame,
                            Chronicled with date and name,
                            In the annals of the skies.
                            
                            She forgot in her surprise,
                            When her empyrean eyes
                            Saw Endymion where he lay
                            Slumbering, and she cast away
                            Her immortal honour, clear
                            As her own unclouded sphere,
                            For the palpitating bliss
                            Of a surreptitious kiss.
                        
                        
                            Oh, beloved, come and bring 
                            All the flowery wealth of spring—
                            All its blossoms, buds, and bells,
                            And wind?coaxing violet smells—
                            All its miracle of grace
                            In the blossom of your face.

                        LOVE’S SOMNABULIST.
                        
                            LIKE some wild sleeper who alone at night 
                            Walks with unseeing eyes along a height,
                            With death below and only stars above;
                            I, in broad daylight, walk as if in sleep,
                            Along the edges of life’s perilous steep,
                            The lost somnambulist of love.
                        
                        
                            I, in broad day, go walking in a dream,
                            Led on in safety by the starry gleam
                            Of thy blue eyes that hold my heart in thrall;
                            Let no one wake me rudely, lest one day,
                            Startled to find how far I’ve gone astray,
                            I dash my life out in my fall.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A MEETING.
                        
                            A TWILIGHT glow diffused on high
                            Flushed all the autumn land beneath;
                            Like love that lights your azure eye,
                            The pond’s blue goblet on the heath
                            Was brimful of the sky.
                        
                        
                            We met by chance, and heaven’s rich hue
                            Leaped to your face in rosy flame;
                            Ah, is it possible you knew
                            The wild delight that filled my frame
                            As I caught sight of you?
                            
                            Ah, is it possible, my love,
                            That your delight can equal mine?
                            Nay, then, the burning sky above
                            Grows pale beside this bliss divine,
                            And the deep glow thereof.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        YOUR FACE.
                        I TOOK your face into my dreams,
                        It floated round me like a light;
                        Your beauty’s consecrating beams
                        Lay mirrored in my heart all night.
                        As in a lonely mountain mere,
                        Unvisited of any streams,
                        Supremely bright and still and clear,
                        The solitary moonlight gleams,
                        Your face was shining in my dreams.
                    
                    
                    
                        ONLY A SMILE.
                        
                            NO butterfly whose frugal fare
                            Is breath of heliotrope and clove,
                            And other trifles light as air,
                            Could live on less than doth my love.
                        
                        
                            That childlike smile that comes and goes
                            About your gracious lips and eyes,
                            Hath all the sweetness of the rose,
                            Which feeds the freckled butterflies.
                        
                        
                            I feed my love on smiles, and yet
                            Sometimes I ask, with tears of woe,
                            How had it been if we had met,
                            If you had met me long ago,
                            
                            Before the fast, defacing years
                            Had made all ill that once was well?
                            Ah, then your smiling breeds such tears
                            As Tantalus may weep in hell.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SOMETIMES I WONDER.
                        
                            SOMETIMES I wonder if you guess
                            The deep impassioned tenderness
                            Which overflows my heart;
                            The love I never dare confess;
                            Yet hard, yea, harder to repress
                            Than tears too fain to start.
                        
                        
                            Sometimes I ponder, O my sweet,
                            The things I’ll tell you when we meet;
                            But straightway at your sight
                            My heart’s blood oozes to my feet
                            Like thawing waters in the heat,
                            Confused with too much light.
                            
                            I hardly know, when you are near,
                            If it is love, or joy, or fear
                            Which fills my languid frame;
                            Enveloped in your atmosphere,
                            My dark self seems to disappear,
                            A moth entombed in flame.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        MANY WILL LOVE YOU.
                        
                            MANY will love you; you were made for love;
                            For the soft plumage of the unruffled dove
                            Is not so soft as your caressing eyes.
                            You will love many; for the winds that veer
                            Are not more prone to shift their compass, dear,
                            Than your quick fancy flies.
                        
                        
                            Many will love you; but I may not, no;
                            Even though your smile sets all my life aglow,
                            And at your fairness all my senses ache.
                            You will love many; but not me, my dear,
                            Who have no gift to give you but a tear
                            Sweet for your sweetness’ sake.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A DREAM.
                        
                            ONLY a dream, a beautiful baseless dream; 
                            Only a bright
                            Flash from your eyes, a brief electrical gleam,
                            Charged with delight.
                        
                        
                            Only a waking, alone, in the moon’s last gleam
                            Fading from sight;
                            Only a flooding of tears that shudder and stream 
                            Fast through the night.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        ROSE D’AMOUR.
                        
                            I PLANTED a rose tree in my garden,
                            In early days when the year was young;
                            I thought it would bear me roses, roses,
                            While nights were dewy and days were long.
                        
                        
                            It bore but once, and a white rose only—
                            A lovely rose with petals of light;
                            Like the moon in heaven, supreme and lonely;
                            And the lightning struck it one summer night.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SONNET.
                        
                            EVEN as on some black background full of night,
                            And hollow storm in cloudy disarray,
                            The forceful brush of some great master may
                            More brilliantly evoke a higher light;
                            So beautiful, so delicately white,
                            So like a very metaphor of May,
                            Your loveliness on my life’s sombre gray
                            In its perfection stands out doubly bright.
                        
                        
                            And yet your beauty breeds a strange despair,
                            And pang of yearning in the helpless heart,
                            To shield you from time’s fraying wear and tear
                            That from yourself yourself would wrench apart;
                            How save you, fairest, but to set you where
                            Mortality kills death in deathless art?
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A PARTING.
                        
                            THE year is on the wing, my love,
                            With tearful days and nights;
                            The clouds are on the wing above
                            With gathering swallow?flights.
                        
                        
                            The year is on the wing, my sweet,
                            And in the ghostly race,
                            With patter of unnumbered feet, 
                            The dead leaves fly apace.
                        
                        
                            The year is on the wing, and shakes
                            The last rose from its tree;
                            And I, whose heart in parting breaks,
                            Must bid adieu to thee.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        MY LADY.
                        
                            LIKE putting forth upon a sea
                            On which the moonbeams shimmer,
                            Where reefs and unknown perils be 
                            To wreck, yea, wreck one utterly,
                            It were to love you, lady fair,
                            In whose black braids of billowy hair
                            The misty moonstones glimmer.
                        
                        
                            Oh, misty moonstone?coloured eyes,
                            Latticed behind long lashes,
                            Within whose clouded orbs there lies,
                            Like lightning in the sleeping skies,
                            
                            A spark to kindle and ignite,
                            And set a fire to love alight
                            To burn one’s heart to ashes.
                        
                        
                            I will not put forth on this deep
                            Of perilous emotion;
                            No, though your hands be soft as sleep,
                            They shall not have my heart to keep,
                            Nor draw it to your fatal sphere.
                            Lady, you are as much to fear
                            As is the fickle ocean.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        ON A VIOLA D’AMORE.
                        CARVED WITH A CUPID’S HEAD, AND PLAYED ON FOR THE FIRST
                            TIME AFTER MORE THAN A CENTURY.
                        
                            WHAT fairy music clear and light,
                            Responsive to your fingers,
                            Swells rippling on the summer night,
                            And amorously lingers
                            Upon the sense, as long ago
                            In days of rouge and rococo!
                        
                        
                            A century of silence lay
                            On strings that had not spoken
                            Since powdered lords to ladies gay
                            Gave, for a lover’s token,
                            
                            Fans glowing fresh from Watteau’s art,
                            Well worth a marchioness’s heart.
                        
                        
                            Your dormant music tranced and bound
                            Was like the Sleeping Beauty
                            Prince Charming in the forest found,
                            And kissed in loyal duty:
                            And when she woke her eyes’ blue fire
                            Turned the dumb forest to a lyre.
                        
                        
                            Thus Amor with the bandaged eyes,
                            Fit symbol of hushed numbers,
                            Most musically wakes and sighs
                            After an age of slumbers:
                            Beneath your magic bow’s control.
                            The Viol has regained her soul.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A CHILD’S FANCY.
                        
                            “HUSH, hush! Speak softly, Mother dear,
                            So that the daisies may not hear;
                            For when the stars begin to peep,
                            The pretty daisies go to sleep.
                        
                        
                            “See, Mother, round us on the lawn;
                            With soft white lashes closely drawn,
                            They’ve shut their eyes so golden?gay,
                            That looked up through the long, long day.
                        
                        
                            “But now they’re tired of all the fun—
                            Of bees and birds, of wind and sun
                            Playing their game at hide?and?seek;—
                            Then very softly let us speak.”
                            
                            A myriad stars above the child
                            Looked down from heaven and sweetly smiled;
                            But not a star in all the skies
                            Beamed on him with his Mother’s eyes.
                        
                        
                            She stroked his curly chestnut head,
                            And whispering very softly, said,
                            “I’d quite forgotten they might hear;
                            Thank you for that reminder, dear.”

                            I LAID me down beside the sea,
                            Endless in blue monotony;
                            The clouds were anchored in the sky,
                            Sometimes a sail went idling by.
                        
                        
                            Upon the shingles on the beach
                            Gray linen was spread out to bleach,
                            And gently with a gentle swell
                            The languid ripples rose and fell.
                        
                        
                            A fisher?boy, in level line,
                            Cast stone by stone into the brine:
                            Methought I too might do as he,
                            And cast my sorrows on the sea.
                            
                            The old, old sorrows in a heap
                            Dropped heavily into the deep;
                            But with its sorrow on that day
                            My heart itself was cast away.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        SEEKING.
                        
                            IN many a shape and fleeting apparition,
                            Sublime in age or with clear morning eyes,
                            Ever I seek thee, tantalizing Vision,
                            Which beckoning flies.
                        
                        
                            Ever I seek Thee, O evasive Presence,
                            Which on the far horizon’s utmost verge,
                            Like some wild star in luminous evanescence,
                            Shoots o’er the surge.
                        
                        
                            Ever I seek Thy features ever flying,
                            Which ne’er beheld I never can forget:
                            Lightning which flames through love, and mimics dying
                            In souls that set.
                            
                            Ever I seek Thee through all clouds of error;
                            As when the moon behind earth’s shadow slips,
                            She wears a momentary mask of terror
                            In brief eclipse.
                        
                        
                            Ever I seek Thee, passionately yearning;
                            Like altar?fire on some forgotten fane,
                            My life flames up irrevocably burning,
                            And burnt in vain.

                        “There is perhaps no phase of our history more capable of poetic
                            treatment than the sainted lives of the Irish monks who first spread the
                            Christian faith over the western shores of Scotland, and yet it would be
                            difficult to point to a single representative poem having Saint Columba
                            and the devoted band of his disciples for its heroes. An attempt at
                            filling up this gap has recently been made by Miss Blind in a narrative
                            poem devoted to the fate of St. Oran, the friend and disciple of St.
                            Columba.... Apart from the sonorous beauty of her lines, there is in her
                            diction a straightforwardness and simplicity, and an entire absence of
                            affectation and false sentiment, which, combined with considerable power
                            of characterization, make her volume a remarkable contribution to
                            English literature.”
                        —Times, September 26, 1881.
                    
                    
                        “To disturb the motif of a legend is
                            always a bold, and mostly a rash proceeding.... And yet so skilfully is
                            the story handled that the main incidents of the legend do not lose, but
                            gain by this disturbance of the motif,
                            and the character of Oran, which with the old motif could only have presented the single side of the
                            religious enthusiast, becomes a character exhibiting that complexity
                            which modern taste demands.... Directness of style and lucidity of
                            narrative are the characteristic excellences of the poem. There are few
                            contemporary poets who could have done so much dramatic business in so
                            few lines.... In each of the sonnets there is a thought that is well
                            expressed, and worth expressing.”

                        “It is in the domain of character that the poem is distinguished by its
                            highest excellence. There is an ideal statuesqueness embodied in the
                            person of St. Columba such as is felt to possess a powerful appeal to
                            the imagination. The poem embraces many passions, of which the most
                            tender and beautiful finds expression in the exquisite creation of the
                            radiant golden?haired girl for whose love St. Oran breaks his vow of
                            chastity. But the really powerful contribution to our knowledge of
                            character which this book contains is fittingly centred in St. Oran
                            himself. A dramatic instinct of high order finds utterance in his
                            struggles between opposing passions. Nor are the metrical excellences of
                            the poem less conspicuous.... If one were in need of some single phrase
                            by which to denote the ultimate effect produced by this book, one might
                            say that it seems the most mature of all recent first
                            efforts, even of established rank.”

                        “In the choice of a subject for her chief poem she has been singularly
                            fortunate.... That a story such as this is full of poetical
                            suggestiveness is obvious, and Miss Blind has proved herself equal to
                            the occasion. She has avoided writing anything approaching to a
                            ‘tendency poem.’ She metes out justice with an equal hand to all her
                            characters. The genuine enthusiasm and religious zeal of the monks are
                            set forth in language as inspired as is the final protest of St. Oran
                            against their narrow fanaticism; and one of the best passages in the
                            book is indeed the Sermon in which St. Columba announces the Gospel of
                            love and redemption to the islanders.”

                            character; and in the management of singularly difficult positions,
                            there is visible a firm and practised hand, a bold and unmistakable
                            power. ‘The Street Children’s Dance’ not unworthily ranks with some of
                            the touching pieces of Hood, Mrs. Barrett Browning, and others.”

                            is the touching plea for public toleration which is embodied in Miss
                            Mathilde Blind’s poem, wherein the spectacle of poor children dancing
                            round an organ is as pathetically moralized and as tender and full of
                            loving pity as Mrs. Browning’s ‘Cry of the Children.’”

                            glows in sympathy with the deeper feelings which stir humanity. There
                            has been published no poem of such creative suggestiveness as this for
                            many a day, and we hope and believe that it is the precursor of other
                            work by the same unfaltering hand. This poem is a true work of art,
                            complete and beautiful. There is in the volume other work which shows a
                            master’s touch.... ”

                    The Heather on Fire: A Tale of the Highland Clearances.
                    
                        “Miss Blind has produced one of the most noticeable and moving poems
                            which recent years have added to our shelves.... As a singer with a
                            message her attempt is praiseworthy, and her performance is fairly
                            self?consistent. It is eminently homogeneous; the passion once felt, the
                            inspiration once obeyed, the well?head pours forth its stream in a
                            strong and uniform current, which knows no pause until its impulse
                            ceases.... The story is pathetic at once in its simplicity and in its
                            terror.... We congratulate the author upon her boldness in choosing a
                            subject of our own time, fertile in what is pathetic, and free from any
                            taint of the vulgar and conventional. Poetry of late years has tended
                            too much towards motives of a merely fanciful and abstruse, sometimes a
                            plainly artificial, character; and we have had much of lyrical energy or
                            attraction, with little of the real marrow of human life, the flesh and
                            blood of man and woman. Positive subject?matter, the emotion which
                            inheres in actual life, the very smile and the very tear and heart?pang,
                            are, after all, precious to poetry, and we have them here. ‘The Heather
                            on Fire’ may possibly prove to be something of a new departure, and one
                            that was certainly not superfluous.”

                            clearances which stain the history of Scotch landlordism. Though her
                            tale is a fiction it is too well founded on fact.... It may be said

                            Miss Blind succeeds best; and on the whole we are inclined to think that
                            its greatest and most surprising success is the picture of the poor old
                            soldier Rory driven mad by the burning of his wife. In his frenzy he
                            mixes up his old battles with the French and the descent of the
                            landlord’s ejectors upon the village.”

                        “A subject which has painfully preoccupied public opinion is, in the poem
                            entitled ‘The Heather on Fire,’ treated with characteristic power by
                            Miss Mathilde Blind. Irish evictions have offered so convenient a theme
                            to party strife, that the sufferings of the unhappy Highland crofters
                            have not always met with the compassion they were so well calculated to
                            inspire. In eloquent and forcible verse, Miss Blind tells the tale of
                            their wrongs, their resistance to the hard fate imposed upon them, and
                            describes the bitter grief with which,

                             those among them driven into exile look on the shores to which
                            many bid an eternal farewell. Both as a narrative and descriptive poem
                            ‘The Heather on Fire is equally remarkable.’

                        “We are happy in being able to extend to the present poem a welcome
                            equally sincere and equally hearty; for it is a poem that is rich not
                            only in power and beauty but in that ‘enthusiasm of humanity’ which
                            stirs and moves us, and of which so much contemporary verse is almost
                            painfully deficient. Miss Blind does not possess her theme; she is
                            possessed by it, as was Mrs. Browning when she wrote‘Aurora Leigh.’...
                            We can best describe the kind of her success by noting the fact that
                            while engaged in the perusal of her book we do not say, ‘What a fine
                            poem!’ but ‘What a terrible story!’ or, more probably still, say nothing
                            at all, but read on and on under the spell of a great horror and an
                            over?powering pity. Poetry of which this can be said needs no other
                            recommendation, and, therefore, we need not unduly lengthen our review

                            unaffected and truthful expression of her own feelings.... Whatever the

                            the Highlands of Scotland. It is a strange fact that the general reader
                            knows more about the siege of Troy, the Norman Conquest, and the Wars of
                            the Roses than about such matters in the very history of our own days as
                            the depopulation of the Highlands of Scotland by the landlords. The old
                            story comes to the front just now by reason of the crofter agitation. In
                            the preface to her fine and touching epic, and in the notes at the end,
                            Miss Blind passes in review some of the facts of the eviction of the
                            Glen Sannox people by the Duke of Hamilton in 1832, where, as she says,
                                ‘the progress of civilization, which has redeemed many a
                                wilderness and gladdened the solitary places of the world, has come
                                with a curse to these Highland glens, and turned green pastures and
                                golden harvest fields once more into a desert.’ The ‘Heather on
                            Fire’ is a poem in four cantos—or ‘Duans’—comprising about two hundred
                            stanzas.”

                                récit (as we have called it) of
                            the musician, Emanuel Sturm, nearly all the interest of the book is
                            concentrated. The violinist, poor and unknown, finds himself at Capri.
                            Accident brings him, one evening, to a frightened group of women, one of
                            whom has just been bitten by the tarantula, and, according to the
                            popular superstition, he is implored to play, in order to drive the
                            poison out of her. He refuses at first, but afterwards consents, and
                            finding himself almost supernaturally inspired, plays an improvised
                            ‘Tarantella’ throughout a whole stormy night, finally curing the girl.
                            The tune thus strangely hit on spreads, and ultimately makes him famous,

                            the very opposite kind of charm of which ‘Tarantella’ is full. Entirely
                            poetical in conception (save that it is not written in metre),
                            ‘Tarantella’ is more essentially a poem than many a narrative written in
                            smooth and elegant verse.... ‘Tarantella’ is indeed full of strange
                            originality and scenic effects of uncommon powers. The dance among the
                            ruins is not likely to be soon forgotten by the most unimaginative of
                            readers, and it is rarely, we think, that in an English novel the
                            psychology of the poetic temperament has been touched by a hand so
                            delicate and at the same time so strong.”

                            colours; she is a complete mistress of the art of dramatic cause and
                            effect. When once fairly under weigh, she never allows the interest to
                            flag for a single moment. Thus it is only when we have laid down the

                            the author’s extraordinary knowledge of the human heart—extraordinary
                            alike for its depth and its range. As for the wit and humour with which
                            the book is freely sprinkled, the poetic and artistic spirit which
                            pervades it throughout, they can only be appreciated on a second or a

                            novels of the present day.”

                        “There is an inherent charm about ‘Tarantella’ which will be apparent to
                            the reader from a perusal of the first chapter. This agreeable quality
                            does not end there, however. The whole of the tale, which is divided
                            into forty?six chapters, is permeated with features of an exceptionally
                            attractive description. Not the least noteworthy character of the story
                            is its novelty. Most of the incidents, which are carefully elaborated
                            and follow in logical sequence, are conspicuous for an airy freshness in
                            nature and treatment. Every chapter has its specific purpose, there
                            being a uniform overflow of idea and sentiment; and each development of
                            the pleasing romance opens to the mental vision of the thoughtful reader
                            incidents of a more or less engrossing description. Continental scenes
                            and customs are described with freeness and perspicuity, and the varied
                            and eventful adventures of the principal characters, pleasingly typical,
                            it may be mentioned, of the romanticism invariably associated with
                            ‘love’s young dream,’ when, as in the present instance, there is a
                            combination of youth and beauty—are recorded with a poetical fervour and
                            gracefulness of diction which are certain to be generally admired.”

                    The Ascent of Man: Poems
                    
                        “Miss Blind traces the ‘Ascent of Man’ through successive stages, until
                            first love, and then sorrow—which is love under another guise—lead us to
                            the highest conception of human life we can hope to reach. It is a
                            brave, sad, glorious story, told with inimitable skill, and as only a
                            poet who knows man’s heart, with its hopes, doubts, fears, aspirations,
                            could possibly tell it.... The other poems in the volume are as
                            excellent in their kind as those which give a title to it. The only
                            difference between them is that one series is rich with human
                            experience, and with the results of knowledge and of high thinking,
                            while the other is all aglow with the fresh delights of the outdoor
                            world. These delights find an almost perfect expression.... A reviewer
                            who is so fortunate as to light on a book like this, lays it down with
                            regret, and fears that he has not said of it all that it deserves should
                            be said. That is my feeling; and, lest I should have omitted any note of
                            praise that ought to be sounded, I should like to add, by way of
                            suggestion to all lovers of poetry—and I hope they are still many—that
                            here is truly a book that is worth the loving.”

                        “The effort which Miss Blind has made is one deserving of high praise.
                            From Chaos to Kosmos she hurries her reader along, breathless and
                            perspiring perhaps, but never anxious to stop. We have known her book to
                            be read on the Underground Railway, and the reader to be so absorbed in
                            its contents as to be carried unawares several stations past his
                            destination.... Miss Blind’s gift of song is genuine, and her
                            imagination powerful.... When all is said and done, ‘The Ascent of Man’
                            remains a remarkable poem, and cannot fail to increase its author’s
                            reputation as a brilliant and original writer.”

                        “There is a fine elevation of tone, and there is a splendid mastery of
                            diction, well sustained from the beginning to the end.... The poems are
                            unquestionably very beautiful.”

                            volume will make it sure. There is nothing weak or unreal about her
                            verse, and there is much force of thought, sympathy for all, and burning
                            scorn of luxurious vice.”

                        “One of the advanced minds of the day is Mathilde Blind. I have at my
                            side her latest book, ‘The Ascent of Man.’ The poems are all earnest and
                            high pitched in tone—they are human.... Every line comes from a heart
                            full of life’s unutterable woes, of hope’s faint, half?believing
                            monitions.”

                        “To Miss Blind belongs the honour of having been the first to seriously
                            render Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer into verse on anything like a
                            bold and comprehensive scale. ‘The Ascent of Man’ is a really remarkable
                            poem. Its main conception is even noble, its manner of execution is
                            brilliant and vigorous, and it abounds in passages which prove Miss
                            Blind to possess the true poetic faculty.”

                            place her high indeed among women writers of the day.”

                            philosophical poem, challenging comparison by its subject with the great
                            work of Lucretius, and inevitably suggesting some of the finest passages
                            of Tennyson.”

                            brilliant, forcible, and easy colouring, in ‘The Ascent of Man.”

                            than it is, she might well be proud.... This volume will considerably

                            Blind’s previous poetic work, and should give much pleasure to all
                            thoughtful and cultivated readers.”
