				<head rend="sc center">PREFACE.</head>

				<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> following poem is an attempt to portray American Boyhood, with its
					surroundings, as it was in the early part of the nineteenth century. It is mainly a
					picture of country boyhood, because the boyhood of our great cities is more or less
					exceptional. The muscle, brain, health, and vigor of the nation have been, and must ever
					be, principally supplied from the great country. Besides, it is the country, and not the
					city, which forms the character of every free people. It is an effort to represent <hi
						rend="i">National</hi> Boyhood--the boyhood of all sections and of every class-- blended
					into the unity--A<hi rend="sc">MERICAN</hi>.</p>
				<p>If some of the scenes described appear homely to the present generation, they will be
					better able to appreciate the advantages they enjoy compared with those possessed by their
					ancestors, who laid the foundation of their prosperity. But it is difficult, indeed quite
					impossible, for the present inhabitants, with the privileges they enjoy, to realize the
					privations endured by the early settlers.</p>
				<p>The descriptions in the poem are all taken from real and many of them are actual
					pictures, which, if <pb id="VAB8224-007" n="8"/> not sketched soon by some one, must
					evidently be lost forever.</p>
				<p>Incidentally the author sings of our heroes, statesmen, sages, philosophers, poets; of
					our fathers and mothers,-- their trials and struggles, their truth and devotion; of the
					loves of their sons and daughters,--our brothers and sisters, our friends and neighbors;
					of freedom and the rights of the human race.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">"Cradled in a sugar trough"</hi> was a common expression among early
						settlers, and by no means an uncommon fact.</p>
					<p>To rock the cradle, spin on the little wheel, and sing to the baby--all at the same

					<p>There was a general prejudice among the pioneers against giving written obligations for
						the performance of their agreements. To ask them to give a receipt for money paid, or a
						promissory note for money loaned, would often be taken as an impeachment of their
						integrity. The same feeling exists yet among many of the old settlers. Deeds or patents
						for lands, however, always stood an exception to this rule.</p>

					<p><hi rend="i">Patroon.</hi> This is a Dutch word, meaning patron, protector, master,

					<p>The early Dutch governments of the States of New York and New Jersey granted certain
						lands--two miles on each side of a navigable river, or four miles on one side, and as "
						far into the country as the situation of the occupiers would permit, etc."--to certain
						persons on condition that they would settle on the same with a colony of fifty persons,
						over fifteen years of age, within four years next after they had given notice to the
						"Company," or a "Commander of the Council." Such grantees were called <hi rend="i"

					<p><hi rend="i">Squatter:</hi> One who settles on lands belonging to the government with

						America, but it is not confined to this country. In Scotland those who " squat under
						tenants," as the phrase is, and occupy their huts and kail-yards, are called <hi
							rend="i">squatters</hi>, and, like American squatters, have certain rights sanctioned
						by the custom of the country</p>

							<p rend="center">"A PIONEER BABY.</p> "In September, 1860, the first babe saw the blue
							Idaho firmament and breathed the crisp mountain atmosphere under circumstances little
							less primitive than those which attended its Saviour's birth. David Cartwright and
							wife were the parents who were rendered happy by the little fellow's appearance, and
							the boy was born under the spreading branches of a pine-tree, which is yet standing
							near the centre of the village. This specimen nugget soon became the pet--and, it is
							said, the somewhat demoralized pet--of the rough miners, and, catching their roving
							disposition, he rambled around the confines of the camp at the rather youthful age of
							two years with the apparent ease of an Arab. He was called 'Rock,' on account of his
							wonderful hardness, and often showed his appreciation of the honor conferred upon him.
							The crowning act of Rock's life, so far as is known, was accomplished just before he
							discarded his swaddling garments, at the age of two and a half. While on his way to
							superintend the working of some extensive gulch-diggings one day, he tumbled
							head-foremost into <pb id="VAB8224-206" n="207"/> a well, where the bottom could only
							be found at a depth of thirty feet. Upon striking, he only found six inches of water,
							and didn't propose to be worried much by such a fall, so immediately commenced calling
							for help. It was his sad fate, however, to remain in there six long hours before being
							discovered, but when men finally came to the rescue, his pentup wrath knew no bounds.
							There was no crying about it, but such a volley of invectives upon the heads of
							neglectful parents never before fell from childish lips. Here is a sample: 'You fink I
							kin tay in a well all day wifout nuffin' t'eat like a f'og? 'Fy wasn't no better

					<p>Catching wild turkeys by this method would seem quite incredible to any one who never
						had witnessed the fact. A pen some ten feet square is built of common fence-rails or
						poles, about three feet high, and covered in the same way, sufficiently tight to confine
						the turkey. A trench some foot and a half wide and about the same depth, gradually
						descending at each end, is dug from the outside under and into the pen some four <pb
							id="VAB8224-215" n="216"/> or five feet, which, next to the wall of the pen on the
						inside, is covered over with small sticks or boards, on which earth is thrown to
						disguise the bridge thus formed across the trench. The trench and its surroundings,
						inside and outside of the pen, are then baited with grain--corn or wheat--thrown about
						on the ground. Fodder or straw scattered around is an additional attraction. The turkeys
						will follow the trail of the bait 'along the trench, pushing one another forward in
						their greed under the bridge and into the pen. When they find themselves caught, they
						will run around the sides of the pen, passing over the bridge across the trench,
						sticking their heads out of the cracks, and never think of creeping under it and going
						out the way by which they came in. I have seen as many as eight taken at one time,
						frequently from two to six, but very seldom only one. </p>

					<p>The size to which the sycamore-trees sometimes grew was enormous, and when very large

						for many years as a smoke-house. It had an opening on one side, in which a door was

						into the tree, turn round and come out without dismounting. This feat was actually done

						there was a much larger sycamore. It had shot up three immense trunks to a great height,
						which, for some twenty feet at the bottom. were united in one round base. The tree had
						been deadened for many years, and ultimately the separate trunks broke off and fell,
						leaving the base, as a great stump, standing. One day, as we were at work near the
						place, my father boosted me up on the outside and helped me down onr the inside, for the
						purpose of measuring the diameter of the tree. As high as I could reach up from the
						ground, we found the space to be twenty-two feet. This, allowing one foot for the

						days, much to his surprise and dismay, he found the hoops broken and the barrel empty.
						He ran to his neighbors with the astonishing news; but his more worldly-wise friends
						only smiled, and told him that he should have bored a gimlet-hole in the top of the
						barrel near the bung, to allow the gases to escape while the cider was fermenting. This
						was all new information to the parson; but he resolved to thenceforth profit by his

						rescue him from danger. They found him in his library composedly reading his Bible,
						while the flood, which had already invaded his stable to the depth of several feet, was
						rapidly approaching his house. On his friends expressing some surprise, he, with one

					<l rend="center">"A few would play at 'possuming."</l>

					<p>"In the common parlance of the country, any one who counterfeits sickness, or
						dissembles strongly for a particular purpose, is said to be <hi rend="i"
							>'possuming."</hi>--</p>
					<bibl rend="i">Flint.</bibl>
					<p>This word comes from the "'possum's" instinctive habit of feigning death to avoid being
						killed by his enemies. But with great deference to what naturalists say, and
						notwithstanding all the popular stories to the contrary, I am convinced that it is a
						habit practiced only against the dog.</p>
					<p>A 'possum will fight a cat even unto death. I have seen it tried several times, by
						putting both in a large gum where they could not escape. At first the cat will have the
						best of it, but the 'possum will fight on without wincing till his head is a gore of
						blood, and at length gets his enemy by the throat or breast and holds on like a
						bull-dog, then nothing but timely interference will save the cat's life.</p>
					<p>I have clubbed them, stoned them, whipped them with withes, kicked and stamped them,
						and even killed them in this way, just for the experiment, without any 'possuming
						whatever; while, sometimes, if a dog comes up and simply smells of them, and always
						after a snap or two, they will keel over and feign death. But it is a poor deception
						after all, and would <pb id="VAB8224-225" n="226"/> not mislead anything but a dog, for
						instead of the stretched-out and relaxed condition of death, they are coiled up into a
						compact bunch. I have carried them in this condition by the tail many a time, and
						whenever I would gently relax my hold I would feel the prehensile action of the tail,
						and if I gradually let go entirely, they always took care by bending their tail around
						my finger not to let themselves fall. Besides, if you pull at the long hairs on the back
						part of their thighs, you will see them cringe at every pluck, but in other respects
						they will bear a great deal of punishment without flinching.</p>

					<p>Diggings. This word, almost always used in the plural, originally meant the place where

						It also means the lead mines, or any mine opened by digging, and is sometimes used to
						designate a particular section of the country, as, "about these <hi rend="i"

						But he still remained. At length my father's house became his home, yet not a word was

						member of the family for about eight years ; indeed, until my father died and the family
						became scattered. He worked with us whenever he chose to, which was nearly always when
						we were at work, but never was required to do so, and we shared everything with him as

					<p><hi rend="i">Sharp-shin</hi>. After the war of 1812 money became very scarce,

					<p>The middle-sized sycamore-tree, say three feet in diameter, during the prevalence of

							Ohioensis</hi>) grows very large, especially along the Scioto River. The are found
						quite frequently three feet in diameter, and eighty or ninety feet in height. In the
