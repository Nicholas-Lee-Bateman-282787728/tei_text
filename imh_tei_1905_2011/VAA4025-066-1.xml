            <p>The autobiography of Edward A. Rumely, an American industrialist, educator, and editor of the first
                    half of the twentieth century, is a remarkable document and an exemplar of its genre. A number of
                    circumstances prompted Rumely to undertake an accounting of his life. He was, first of all, an
                    accomplished newspaper editor and publisher and doubtless felt he could tap this reservoir of
                    experience. Secondly, he received enthusiastic encouragement from his immediate family, particularly
                    his devoted wife of over forty years, Mrs. Fanny Scott Rumely,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and several
                    close friends. The example of Mrs. Rumely's father, Emmet Hoyt Scott, who at the time of
                    his death in 1924 had completed 276 pages of his autobiography, perhaps provided another impetus.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Finally, the existence and availability of Rumely's own papers made
                    possible and practical the writing of a memoir.</p>
            <p>According to Mrs. Rumely her husband began his autobiography by dictating into a wire recorder (this
                    was before the days of tape recorders) one evening a week with his wife and daughter sitting by.
                    They would ask leading questions to bring out details and elucidate various points as needed. The
                    wire recordings were then typed and given to Samuel Thurston Williamson, a family friend of many
                    years and a staff writer for the New York <hi rend="i">Times</hi> and former editor of <hi rend="i">Newsweek.</hi> Williamson worked over the transcripts and put them into <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Mrs. Rumely's special insight stemmed from a lifelong
                            interest in the study of history. After graduating from Smith College in 1900, she actively
                            participated in numerous historical societies and maintained a particular interest in
                            genealogy. Mrs. Rumely's forebears were lineal descendants of Richard Warren and

                            Nathaniel Niles. As a trustee of Dartmouth College, Niles supported Daniel Webster in the
                            famous Dartmouth College Case in 1819. Mrs. Rumely has collected and given to the Lilly
                            Library, Indiana University, Bloomington, the papers of her great grandfather, Judge William
                            Polke, who fought in the Battle of Tippecanoe (1811) and was a member of Indiana's
                            first constitutional convention at Corydon (1816): her grandfather, John Barron Niles, who
                            helped write much of Indiana's 1851 constitution; her father, Emmet Hoyt Scott,
                            manufacturer, agriculturist, and mayor of La Porte; and her husband, Dr. Edward A. Rumely.

            <p>Edward A. Rumely was born at La Porte, Indiana, on February 28, 1882, the second son of Joseph and
                    Margaret Rumely and the second grandchild of Meinrad and Theresa Rumely. The first child, named
                    Joseph, died before Edward was born; therefore, the latter was considered by his family as the first
                    son. This primogenital position proved auspicious. Edward's Rumely grandparents bestowed
                    special favors on him, and he became a frequent visitor at their home. Grandmother Rumely welcomed
                    the inquisitive boy into her kitchen and acquainted him with the mysteries of cooking. Undoubtedly
                    his grandmother's warmth and her encouragement of his youthful curiosity affected him.
                    Rumely, in fact, credits this early experience as a factor in his lifelong interest in vitamins and
                    nutrition. The favoritism was extended by Grandfather Rumely in other ways. He allowed Edward to
                    tinker in his machine shop; and when the boy informed him that he had read all the books in the
                    public library, his grandfather replied, "Whatever books you promise to read I will pay
                    for." He kept his word in spite of the enormous number of books Edward ordered, some of
                    which were on such controversial subjects as the single tax and evolution. On the maternal side
                    Grandmother Ludwina Schweitzer Zimmerman and her youngest son, Frank, were exceptionally kind to
                    young Eddie, as he was affectionately called.</p>
            <p>Rumely implies that his family provided a wholesome and positive atmosphere, conducive to learning.
                    He, in turn, developed a progressive spirit, respect for the broader aspects of religion, a belief
                    in a way of life that emphasizes service to others, a genuine desire for knowledge, self-reliance
                    based on intellectual accomplishment, an appreciation of the pursuit of formal education,
                    satisfaction derived from industrious labor, a creative urge to combine esthetic and utilitarian
                    concepts, a sensitivity to the south German heritage of his forebears, the courage to follow his
                    ideas even when they were unpopular with the crowd, and an appreciation of the value of American
                    democracy and the free enterprise system.</p>
            <p>The Rumelys and the Zimmermans were devout Roman Catholics, and the family faith determined the
                    course of Edward's education. He attended a parochial school in La Porte and St.
                    Joseph's Academy in Rensselaer, Indiana; spent eight months under the tutelage of Father
                    Schweitzer, his mother's cousin, at Sinsinnawa Mound, Wisconsin; <list type="footnotes">

                            seventieth birthday there was a. gala dinner in his honor at which Williamson read aloud the
                            first chapters of the autobiography.</item>

                    <pb n="3" id="VAA4025-066-1-007"/> and, finally, attended Notre Dame, where his father had studied
                    before him.</p>
            <p>Rumely's stay at Notre Dame was brief and turbulent. He was receptive to the free flowing
                    ideas of the close of the nineteenth century, and his intellectual curiosity drew him into a
                    whirlpool of controversy. The writings of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, Henry
                    George's <hi rend="i">Progress and Poverty</hi>, and Louis F. Post's <hi rend="i">The Public</hi>, a single tax newspaper, ignited the flame of activism in him. The majority of
                    Notre Dame's faculty, however, had not accepted the revolutionary ideas of environmental
                    determinism and evolution. Consequently, Rumely was labeled a student radical for his participation
                    in the formulation of the Henry George Debating Society and incurred the wrath of conservative
                    faculty members and administrators. While at Notre Dame Rumely's questioning of
                    ecclesiastical dicta put to rest any lingering thoughts he may have had of a life devoted to his
                    church. His English professor, Austin O'Malley, apparently thought he should reject his
                    grandmother's wish that he become a priest because his "obstinate nature and
                    independent viewpoint would get him into difficulty" with ecclesiastical discipline. His
                    professor's evaluation proved correct. Faculty rivalry, administrative inflexibility, and
                    Rumely's reputation as a student radical, coupled with his refusal to abide by what he
                    considered an unfair faculty decision, caused him to leave Notre Dame abruptly but voluntarily.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> He accepted the advice of Louis F. Post to continue his education in England
                    and eventually entered Ruskin Hall in the city of Oxford, where he could earn his board and room by
                    participating in household chores and attend classes at the same time.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    Rumely's decision to leave the United States was reinformed by his school friend, Alexander
                    Lattimore, who agreed to accompany him to England.</p>
            <p>Rumely took the opportunity while he was in Europe to travel and to attend three universities. He
                    spent one year at Ruskin Hall in Oxford; a second year at Heidelberg University, Heidelberg,
                    Germany; and the remaining four and one half years at Freiburg University, Freiburg, Baden, Germany,
                    where he received the M.D. degree <hi rend="i">magna cum laude</hi> and completed the requirements
                    for a degree in economics in 1906.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi> According to the Office of the Registrar, University of Notre Dame,
                        Edward Rumely entered the university in 1898 and left it in 1900. Joseph Rumely,
                        Edward's father, attended Notre Dame as a "minum" from 1867-1872. The
                        minum program which was high school level college preparatory work, operated at the university
                        until the 1920s. Joseph Rumely received a commercial degree in 1872.</item>

                        wanted young men of the British labor and cooperative movement to have the opportunity of study
                        and contact at Oxford. The institution was not connected in any way with Oxford University and
                        was run on a cooperative basis with everyone-faculty and students-sharing in the work. It is
                        today called Ruskin College.</item>

            <p>After his return to La Porte in 1906 Rumely became involved in building the Interlaken School for
                    Boys and in working in the family agricultural implement business, the M. Rumely Company. Both of
                    these endeavors proved rewarding. Rumely was founder and owner of Interlaken, a college preparatory
                    boarding school for boys who were also taught shop and farm work. His endeavors with the M. Rumely
                    Company provided ample capital to expand Interlaken. He was responsible for the development of the
                    Rumely Oil Pull Farm Tractor and helped raise company sales from $1,000,000 a year to
                    $38,000,000 by 1913. He resigned at age thirty-two as an officer of the firm and moved
                    his family to New York City where he resided until his retirement and return to La Porte in 1959.</p>
            <p>In 1915 Rumely became editor-in-chief and publisher of one of New York's leading daily
                    newspapers, the New York <hi rend="i">Evening Mail</hi>, which he and a number of colleagues had
                    purchased. On friendly terms with Theodore Roosevelt, Rumely permitted the ex-President to continue
                    to use the <hi rend="i">Evening Mail</hi>, as his mouthpiece.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> For a short time
                    two distinguished critics of the American scene wrote articles for the Rumely newspaper: Samuel S.
                    McClure, from 1915 to 1918, and H. L. Mencken, from 1917 to 1918.</p>
            <p>In the 1920s Rumely pursued his interests and civic minded activities. He became a pioneer in the
                    introduction of vitamins and vitamin containing foods to the retail market. From 1923 to 1928 he was
                    executive director of the Vitamin Foods, Inc., of Westfield, Massachusetts. He organized the Super
                    Diesel Company in 1925, and from 1926 to 1930 he helped loan farmers $30,000,000 through
                    the Agricultural Bond and Credit Company which he organized.</p>
            <p>Remaining in New York from 1932 until his retirement in 1959, Rumely focused his attention upon
                    national political questions. To his mind Aristotle's golden .mean of "nothing in
                    excess" had under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal taken on the
                    appearance of "everything in excess." The pot pourri of government agencies (AAA,
                    NRA, SEC, NLRB, NIRA, RFC, PWA, CWA, CCC, etc.)<hi rend="sup">7</hi> became for him an unpalatable
                    alphabet soup. To alert the American people to what he considered excessive governmental power he
                    served during the New Deal as executive secretary to both the Committee for the Nation and the
                    National Committee to Uphold Constitutional <list type="footnotes">

            <p>One of Rumely's last projects after returning to La Porte in 1959, after fifty years of
                    public service in New York state, was the distribution of Alton Ochsner's <hi rend="i">Smoking and Health</hi> to the fifty state medical societies. It was a gesture characteristic
                    of his whole career, at once civic minded, forward looking, and bold. Rumely continued to lend
                    support to those organizations whose purpose and philosophy agreed with his interpretation of
                    American democracy and the free enterprise system. He was active, cheerful, and outgoing until he
                    died in November, 1964, at the age of eighty-two.</p>
            <p>Rumely achieved success in many, varied fields. In agriculture, education, business, editing,
                    politics, nutrition, his contributions to Indiana in particular and to the nation as a whole were
                    myriad. Rumely's perceptive comments about his life and environment make his autobiography
                    both interesting and informative. The manuscript recreates the personality, accomplishments,
                    philosophy, and principles of an unusual and outstanding citizen. Further, it provides a much needed
                    glimpse of the history of northern Indiana and contributes to a better understanding of the cultural
                    and social world of the first half of the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>The first four completed chapters of the Rumely autobiography are reproduced below. "The
                    Formative Years, 1882-1900" includes the author's account of the events and
                    activities of his early life and his recollection of pioneer days in La Porte, Indiana. Rumely also
                    notes his forebears' origins and reflects upon, among other things, the hazardous political
                    climate in Germany after the abortive democratic revolution of 1848; the oppression of southern
                    Germans by the Prussians; the immigration of his grandparents, the Rumelys, Zimmermans, Schweitzers,
                    and Fierstosses, from their homes in the Black Forest and Alsace-Lorraine; the selection of La Porte
                    as the ideal location for their new home; and the successful establishment of an agricultural

            <p>When French explorers reached the end of Lake Michigan and its sand dunes in the late
                    1660's, they found a few miles inland a chain of small lakes and ponds which teemed with
                    plump fish and clouds of water birds. Immediately to the South stretched rolling prairie lands. It
                    was a pleasing place, this oak-lined gateway to the prairies, so the French named it
                    "LaPorte," then pushed on to the gently flowing Kankakee and down it to the
                    Mississippi.</p>
            <p>Settlers did not come until a century later and after the Revolution. First were New Englanders who
                    moved out to this Indiana section of the Northwest Territory either direct from their Yankee
                    salt-box houses, or after stopping over a generation or two in New York State. Down the Ohio and up
                    from the South came a few soft-spoken Virginians. The newcomers fancied the fertile ground between
                    the lakes. After trying to conjure up a suitable name, they eventually decided they could not do
                    better than the French, and so the place became and still is, La Porte.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                            A. Rumely. The "Williamson" manuscript was typed, triple spaced, in pica
                            type. The present editor worked with a carbon copy of this version of the Rumely
                            autobiography on which were a number of additions and/or deletions—some
                            handwritten, some typed in elite type. Since it was impossible to ascertain exactly
                            when—or by whom—the changes in the "Williamson"
                            manuscript were made, the following practices have been used in preparing the autobiography
                            for publication: words which were marked out in the original typescript have been printed
                            with a line through them, typewritten words which were added appear in boldface type,
                            handwritten words are reproduced in italics, words suggested by Mrs. Fanny Scott Rumely
                            during the present editing process have been added in parentheses. Throughout the manuscript
                            there were occasional handwritten words which were illegible, seemingly irrelevant, or
                            written in shorthand. These have been omitted. Obvious typographical errors-such as bou for
                            boy, water for waiter, closed for closet, and caree for career have been corrected.
                            Otherwise, spelling, punctuation, and grammar have been retained exactly as in the original.

                    when the last German bid for freedom was stamped out. They were industrious, but hard work had not
                    dulled their minds or their spirit. They were thrifty, but never at the expense of good things of
                    life, including hearty good things of the table. They were devout Roman Catholics but forgave me
                    when I finally chose not to enter the priesthood. They were closely-knit and with another

            <p>The family name was Rümele. People in this country spelled it with an
                    "ely" as it was pronounced, so my grandfather began writing it that way too, and
                    the name became "Rumely." Meinrad Rumely, my grandfather, founded our family

                    later, it had changed little since Grandfather's time. The houses were straw-thatched,
                    floors were of hardened earth, and there were no chimneys. When I asked a farmer where the smoke
                    from the stove went, he replied "Whithersoever it listeth." Just under the roof
                    hung hams and bacon for curing in this wandering smoke. When visitors came, the host and his frau
                    cut down a slab of ham which they sliced into big pieces to eat on homemade rye bread, the rye being
                    ground by the village millstone.</p>
            <p>Through the years, many men and women have influenced my life and thought, but no one molded me more
                    in the fundamentals than Grandfather Rumely, who took me in hand when I was very young and talked
                    with me like an equal. He was a millwright in the old country, going from one place to another to
                    build mills. One of his jobs took him across the Rhine to an Alsatian village not far from
                    Strasbourg. There he built a mill for a landowner named Fierstoss, whose twelve-year-old daughter
                    Theresa had dark eyes and coal-black hair. A few years later, Fierstoss sold out and moved his
                    family to America.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, Grandfather left for America in a bigger hurry than the Fierstoss family. "I

                    farmers—a few had guns, some had flails and others had scythes. ‘Where are you
                    going?’ they were asked. ‘We are marching to Freiberg’ they said
                    ‘we are going to establish a Republic.’ "</p>
            <p>These poorly-armed young peasants did not get very far. Thirty years before, [Prince von Clemens]
                    Metternich set up a structure for Europe which continued princes and reactionary forces in power. It
                    was this rule by princelings and little autocrats that the people of 1848 were rising against. The
                    King of Prussia [William I] sent his troops to three or four of the smaller states, including Baden,
                    and the incipient rebellions led by Carl Schurz and his associates were crushed. Germany's
                    history since 1848 has been dominated by the fact that, unlike France and England, mid-century
                    liberalism there was checked and thwarted. The statesmanship of [Otto von] Bismark, the early
                    efficient leadership furnished social legislation, army, and application of science to business,
                    consolidated the strength of autocracy in Germany so thoroughly that only the disasters of defeat
                    and pressure from the outside have been able to break it.</p>
            <p>"Ja! I remember Meinrad Rümele" an old fellow digging potatoes in an
                    Adelsberg field told me. "The last I saw of him was when he came back after the fighting,
                    gathered up his things and slipped away before the Prussians caught him." Ever afterward my
                    grandfather disliked Prussians and North Germans. When a man in his shop did something stupidly
                    wrong, the worst thing he could think of was to call him a "North German sable."</p>
            <p>A few jumps ahead of his Prussian pursuers in 1848, Grandfather went over the hills to Switzerland,
                    then to the French coast and landed in New York with one dollar in his pocket. He got a job on an
                    Erie Canalboat which got him to Buffalo and then he went on foot to Canton, Ohio, and to the
                    Fierstoss farm.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> He found the whole family in the fields, cutting wheat with
                    scythes and tying it into bundles with ropes of straw. Working alongside the dark-eyed, black-haired
                    and now grown-up Theresa, Grandfather told her he would come back when he had money enough to marry
                    her and start a family.</p>
            <p>It was some years before he had enough money to do this, but Theresa was waiting. Eventually he
                    reached Chicago, again on foot, after passing through and noting a blacksmith's shop for
                    sale in the little village of LaPorte. At Chicago he was commissioned to build a steam fire engine
                    which had more than enough to do twenty years <list type="footnotes">

                            tired of Canton and worked as a machinist in Massillon and Piqua. Ohio, and Pittsburg,
                            Pennsylvania, as he travelled in search of a more ideal location to make his permanent home.
                            He decided to go further west and in the early 1850s visited Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul,

                    for Grandfather was one of those men who take to tools and machinery as naturally as—and
                    as unaccountably—ducks to water. He had no technical or scientific training; there was
                    none <hi rend="i">little</hi> then. He knew nothing of the higher mathematics now so essential to
                    the engineering profession. Mechanical devices were simpler in those days, and Grandfather had the
                    ability—I don't know how he acquired it—of reasoning from basic
                    simplicity, a quality which I found in men like Henry Ford and which is a prime one for the
                    successful inventor. Meinrad Rumely could plan and execute a machine without working from a drawing.
                    He knew how much iron, cast iron or steel should go into each part, and he knew instinctively how
                    thick each piece should be to resist strain and perform the work expected of it.</p>
            <p>Almost any tool or machine needed in those early days in LaPorte, Grandfather seemed able to build.
                    Sugar at that time came from sorghum raised in the neighborhood. One of Grandfather's first
                    jobs in his blacksmith shop was to make rollers for pressing out the juice from the sorghum cane. He
                    built sugar mills and flour mills, also ice harvesting machinery and wheels for railroad cars.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the early 1850's he made a threshing machine which won him a gold medal at a Chicago
                    fair. Its motive was horsepower—four horses driven in a circle around a drum-like
                    contrivance which set the thresher in motion. The red-painted machine, about as long as a circus
                    wagon, was really the foundation of the Rumely Company, for others wanted to buy one like it. From a
                    hundred miles around and neighboring counties farmers came with their ox teams and lived at
                    Grandmother's, sometimes a week or two, waiting for the threshers they had ordered. In the
                    pioneer life of the West, the household arts of the peasant life in Europe were those of my
                    grandparents. My grandmothers made candles, spun, preserved fruit, made butter, cheese, had their
                    own gardens, grew herbs for medicine, and very little had to be bought at the store. And so, Rumely
                    customers didn't mind waiting for their machines.</p>

                    you foolish boy," he said. We drove up to the barn where sheaves of wheat were stacked
                    outside. "Run up into the top of the barn and bring me a flegel."
                    "What's that?" I asked. I knew it was German for flail. He said
                    "That's a long stick with another one like one of your baseball bats tied to
                    it." When I found the flail and brought it down, he told me to whip the straw with it. I
                    hit my knuckles and skinned them but Grandfather forced me to keep on, beating time by whistling. I
                    got tired. The flail was heavy to swing, but "keep on, keep on," said Grandfather.
                    Finally, when I was completely tuckered out, he said, "Now, if you had to do that all
                    winter as farmers used to do, you'd think of making a machine to do it for you,
                    wouldn't you?" Then he took me outside the barnyard and said, pointing to the
                    great opening prairies, "If you saw all of this land and knew that it could be planted in
                    wheat and yet at harvest time there were not men enough to gather and flail the grain,
                    wouldn't you think of making a machine to do it for you?"</p>
            <p>After the Civil War, when most of the Middle West had been tamed into farm land,
                    Grandfather's business grew rapidly. He built a small two-story factory with a casting
                    foundry in its rear, and in a ten-by-ten office partitioned off from the workshop, fat old Herman
                    Houser, a great lover of his pipe and his beer, kept books and accounts in characteristically
                    Teutonic handwriting.</p>
            <p>The growing Rumely plant had sales agents in Indianapolis, St. Louis and Minneapolis, and the growing
                    number of Rumely sons (there were <hi rend="b">four Joseph H, William N., Meinrad C., A. J.</hi>)
                    were sent away for the formal schooling which their father never had. Joseph Rumely, my father, took
                    a commercial course at Notre Dame. Uncle William Rumely studied steam engineering at Stevens
                    Institute; <hi rend="b">A. J. went to Purdue</hi> [.] The sons became possibly more learned than
                    their father, but <del rend="strikethrough">without the greater benefit of</del>

            <p>The next step in development of Grandfather's thresher was to replace horse power with
                    steam. In the 1870's the Rumely shops turned out a portable steam engine which could be
                    horse-drawn from one farmyard to another and linked to the thresher by means of a driving belt. Its
                    fuel was wood, coal, or hot-burning straw from the threshing operation. Thus, for the first time,
                    power from engines rather than from draft animals and humans was applied on the American farm.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                        $625 to $2,300, and was ten feet in length and five feet wide. See Reynold

            <p>The logical sequel ten years later was a traction engine employing its own steam power to propel
                    itself and draw threshing machine and water wagon to the next appointment at a straw stack. This
                    road locomotive required a larger steam boiler and a friction clutch<hi rend="sup">9</hi> which
                    would engage the gears gradually in the flywheel so that the contraption got under way without
                    jerking and tossing the driver out of his <del rend="strikethrough">post of responsibility</del>

                    employing the friction clutch, a man who claimed to be its inventor haled all and sundry into court
                    in a patent suit. The complainant was on the point of winning his suit when a customer of the Rumely
                    Company read in a farm paper about the litigation and wrote, "I bought one of your engines
                    a long time ago, and I rigged up to it a friction clutch and pulled my threshing rig all over my
                    county years before this man who claims to be the inventor took out his patent."</p>
            <p>The customer's affidavit broke the patent suit and freed all threshing machine makers from
                    the threat of making heavy royalty payments. This litigation was akin to the Selden patent suit in
                    the automobile industry, when Henry Ford, alone of all motor car manufacturers defied and broke a
                    patent monopoly.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Rarely have I ever seen such an ironic situation the day
                    after the Selden patent decision. I was traveling to Detroit and visiting Mr. Ford in his
                    compartment when one after another auto manufacturer who had been on the opposite side of the case
                    came in to congratulate him and thank him for having freed their industry from paying tribute to the

                    <hi rend="b">Soon after the Catholic Church was founded, the Luthern Church was built by North
                        German settlers. And as North Germany was more populous, the North Germans equaled and
                        out-numbered the South Germans in my Grandfather's employ.</hi> All of this inspired
                    such a protective clannishness that Meinrad Rumely's first employees became also family
                    friends and remained so until his death. Some worked thirty and forty years in the Rumely shops.
                    Sons <hi rend="b">and grandsons</hi> followed their parents, and this continuity of work and
                    possession of skill furnished top-grade foreman material when Rumely threshing machine and engine

            <p>During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, a hereditary antipathy to Prussia inclined many Rumely South
                    German employees to sympathy with France. One noontime after Grandfather had just hired a recent
                    immigrant, he heard a big hubbub in front of the factory. Every window was filled with shouting men
                    watching a South German in the street below beating up the new man. After Grandfather stopped the
                    fight and inquired its cause, his older worker exclaimed, "Meinrad, don't you know
                    what you put to work with us? This fellow is a Prussian!"</p>
            <p>Grandfather had few labor problems. Even when several hundred names were on his payroll, he had
                    personally chose and trained for special jobs the more competent men, a grant of opportunity to men
                    of ability that kept morale and incentive at high level.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Sam Hoover, who
                    worked in a small shop by himself was promised a lifetime job. When my father passed control of the
                    Rumely Company to me, he said, "Your grandfather said as long as Sam Hoover lives and works
                    here, he must earn more money than anyone else in the factory." Hoover operated a big
                    boring mill and special machine, and he was so habituated to its various sounds that he could fall
                    asleep and never fail to wake up to put on another fly-wheel when a cut was ended. Awake or asleep,
                    jolly old Sam Hoover's skill was worth all the extra wages paid him.</p>
            <p>To men who showed promise of ability after their hiring, Grandfather said "Now, you save
                    $400. When you have it, come to me, and I'll take you to a bank and you can
                    build a home."</p>

            <p>Grandfather always insisted upon every man keeping a cow and having enough backyard for a garden. At
                    that time, La Porte had high board sidewalks, and cows grazed placidly in the streets and walked
                    majestically down to the lake for water. By the 1890's, the town had outgrown being an open
                    pasture for cows, but Grandfather wouldn't admit it. One year while he was away at Atlantic
                    City, Mayor E. H. [Emmet Hoyt] Scott,<hi rend="sup">14</hi> my father, and my uncle William Rumely
                    secured passage of an ordinance which ruled cows off the streets. When he returned, Grandfather was
                    indignant and he was more indignant, drawing upon the most emphatic expressions in both German and
                    English, when he heard that two of his sons had a part in this innovation. He scolded bi-lingually
                    for weeks, until it occurred to him to buy ten and twenty-acre pasturage at various edges of the
                    town and tell the workmen to put their cows out to the grasslands he had bought. In that way he
                    solved the problem and temporarily was content.</p>

                    home-ownership policy of Endicott-Johnson shoe factory. He found that when the great depression of
                    '29-'33 came, those workers owning their own home could survive economically even
                    when cut down to two and three days of work. Others who rented their homes couldn't do with
                    less than four days a week, even in the depression. The home owners had gardens. Their taxes were
                    less than rent; and home ownership was a major factor in building the stability of the
                    Endicott-Johnson working force. I found George Johnson's ideas exactly those that

                    which shape the character and even the life-course of a human being. It was not foreordained that
                    most of my career should be connected with feeding the body and the mind. At first thought, there
                    seems to be little connection between my development of power plowing which made possible intensive
                    wheat cultivation and my pioneering in vitamins. Yet, both served a common purpose: nutrition. Nor
                    is there much obvious similarity between getting sleepy schoolboys out of bed on cold mornings and
                    in mailing to a million and a half intelligent American citizens an urgent warning against perils of
                    inflation or against a bureaucratic grab for power. Yet both activities had the same aim: implanting

                    experimented with it as "extra-sensory perception." Grandmother was born Ludwina
                    Sweitzer in a Rhine Valley village from which one could see the Black Forest mountains and the
                    beautiful lace-like stone spire of Freiberg Cathedral. In the late 1840's she left home for
                    America with one of her brothers. When the day came for parting she clung to her mother and refused
                    to climb into the loaded wagon. Finally the mayor of the village <hi rend="i">Waltershoven</hi>
                    thrust himself between her and her mother and said, "You decided you wanted to go; <hi rend="i">now go!</hi>" Weeping, she was separated from her mother and, as she feared,
                    she never saw her again.</p>
            <p>In La Porte years later, after her marriage, Grandmother Zimmerman awoke in the middle of the night
                    terrified. "My mother just walked into the room," she told her husband.
                    "Mother is dead!"</p>
            <p>Husband and wife stopped the clock and saw the priest the next morning. Weeks later, a letter came
                    from the old country: Mother Sweitzer had died on that date but at an hour different from the one at
                    which the clock stopped. But when the difference in time between LaPorte and the Rhineland was
                    calculated, the old lady had died at the exact time when the Zimmermans stopped the clock.</p>
            <p>Grandfather Franz Zimmerman died before I was born. He was County Sheriff and during the Civil War
                    was a commissioned officer in charge of drafting soldiers in the LaPorte area. His sword and uniform
                    are now in the Historical Society museum in LaPorte's courthouse.</p>
            <p>Left a widow with four youngsters, Grandmother Zimmerman took in washing for awhile and had a
                    desperately hard time until the children were old enough to help. Although she lived to be 90?, I
                    never saw her sit with folded hands <del rend="strikethrough">outside of</del>
                    <hi rend="i">except in</hi> church. George, the eldest of her children eventually became
                    superintendent of Emmett Hoyt Scott's wheel factory.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Next was
                    Margaret, my mother. Then came Ludwina, who became Sister Vincent a nun <hi rend="i">Leo House.</hi>
                    Her departure from LaPorte had some of the overtones of the scene when her mother left her Rhineland
                    village. This time, I was the hysterical performer. All of <del rend="strikethrough">seven</del>
                    <hi rend="i">five</hi> years old, I advanced upon her with a clothesline and cried, "You
                    come out in the yard! I'm going to tie you up so you can't get away."</p>
            <p>Blessed with common sense and great executive ability, Sister Vincent rose in her Order <hi rend="i">the Sisters of St. Agnes</hi> to become head of Leo House in New York City. At first down on
                    the Battery and later on West 23rd Street, Leo House was a place where Catholic emigrants, <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi> Emmet Hoyt Scott and William Niles, his brother-in-law, established
                            the Niles and Scott Wheel Factory in La Porte, and the business was successful in the
                            manufacture of wheels and hubs from 1876 until its sale to the stockholders in 1889.</item>

                    bearings before proceeding to their new homes in the West. When flood tide of immigration later
                    subsided, Leo House became a home for single girls away from their families and a stop-over for
                    Catholics returning to the old country for a visit.</p>
            <p>Uncle Frank Zimmerman, Grandmother's youngest son, was very kind to me. He introduced me to
                    the outdoor life which my father never fancied and Grandfather Rumely was too busy to enjoy. I
                    helped him build a boat in the Zimmerman cellar and he gave me the key to his boathouse on Clear
                    Lake. For hunting trips, he loaded his own shells and every season brought home a dozen wild ducks,
                    maybe a goose or two and plenty of squirrel and rabbit.</p>
            <p>Because of Uncle Frank and his mother, I liked to visit the Zimmerman house. "Stay for
                    dinner," she would urge and in winter she'd say, "You stay and sleep
                    here." I liked that because Grandmother had feather beds, and half an hour before bedtime
                    she heated a soap-stone, wrapped it in a blanket and put it in the bed. And then in the morning, in
                    a kitchen aromatic with flowering geraniums and amaryllis, she cooked double-yolk eggs which she
                    saved for me. To this day, I remember her buckwheat pancakes cooked with elderberry blossoms and
                    spread with syrup from sorghum or from LaPorte maple trees.</p>
            <p>My arrivel in this world, February 28, 1882, was an event of understandable importance to my parents.
                    Although it was naturally of enormous consequence for me, at the time I was not aware of it, but the
                    consequence was <del rend="strikethrough">eheightened</del>
                    <hi rend="i">heightened</hi> by the fact that I had the good fortune to be Meinrad Rumely's
                    first living grandchild—and a boy at that.</p>
            <p>What initiative and stubborn drive I have was initially inspired by my parents. One encouraged it,
                    and the fact that the other discouraged it seemed to be an equal stimulus. My father, Joseph J.
                    Rumely, was dark-eyed and resembled his Alsatian mother. He was kindly and religious. Never in my
                    life did I hear him speak harshly and his direct influence was one of kindness and love. Yet with
                    all his kindness there was a sense of restraint about him. He was fearful of the sports that I, as a
                    young boy, wished to engage in. He did not want me to swim in deep water and that I found out was
                    the place where swimming was best and most fun. When I was about 11 or 12 he did not want me to take
                    long trips alone with dog and gun in the Kankakee marsh to hunt; that made hunting all the more
                    attractive. In fact, my father wanted me to remain near home and in the safety of our own yard,
                    whereas my impulses and instincts led me to go out and take chances and do things I was interested
                    in.</p>
            <pb n="18" id="VAA4025-066-1-022"/>
            <p>My mother, on the other hand, gave us children great freedom with a word of guidance or restraint at
                    just the right moment. Having been a tomboy with her brothers at a time when LaPorte was a
                    pioneering city she knew what life was like around the places where we went Saturdays to play. She
                    had remarkable intuition; I always felt she could read our thoughts. The greatest thrill in skating
                    in my boyhood days was on the "bender" ice of Clear Lake—ice so thin
                    that it bent under our weights. Of course, sometimes the "bender" broke. Then we
                    scampered down to the factory where we stood in front of a hot blower until thoroughly dried out.
                    But that never deceived my mother when we came home. Invariably she said "So, another
                    ducking." She could size up people so well that Grandfather frequently spent a half hour
                    with her talking over his plans and asking her judgment about people. The priests likewise came over
                    to discuss with her some problem of the congregation.</p>
            <p>My father's chief hobby was music. He was an accomplished violinist, and before his marriage
                    he played at festivals and concerts and sometimes at dances. He always took an interest in us
                    children—bathing us, reading to us, and organizing musical evenings. The signal for such
                    an occasion was when Father reached for his violin case, removed the violin, which he rubbed down
                    with a silk handkerchief, rubbed his bow with rosin, and then called for an "A" on
                    the piano. He played the violin and the whole family sang.</p>
            <p>Father also sang in the choir. At one time or another all my brothers and I were church acolytes.
                    Father was proud of his large family and looked down happily from the choirloft when eight or nine
                    Rumelys filed into church, "in a body" as he used to say, and filled two pews.
                    "Joe," his friends said, "you look too young for such a flock."</p>
            <p>Although Father was the eldest child and grew up while German was the language of my
                    grandfather's home, English became the principal tongue for him and his brothers, and after
                    they had gone through school and college they lost even their facility for speaking German. But
                    since I, the eldest grandchild spent so much time with my grandparents, I was the only native-born
                    member of the family who spoke German fluently and readily.</p>
            <p>My father grew up in LaPorte and after going through parochial school was one of the earliest
                    students at Notre Dame where he took the commercial course. After an apprenticeship in
                    Grandfather's shop, he entered the office, became bookkeeper, and then treasurer and took
                    over financial management of the business. The latter was no mere counting room activity, for the
                    implement business of those days had a banking side with the general practice of extending credit to
                    farmers unable to pay for their machinery in cash.</p>

            <p>My mother maintained the discipline of the family. Occasionally, if some serious offense had been
                    committed, she earmarked the culprit for a spanking, which consisted of Father taking off a slipper
                    and paddling an up-ended offspring without much enthusiasm. When I left home to study in Europe,
                    what I thought I knew at the mature age of 18 about the education and upbringing of children has
                    never since been equalled. I made my parents promise that they would never apply slipper or shingle
                    to my younger brothers and sisters.</p>
            <p>It was a promise which they kept—but regretfully. My younger sister Cecelia recalls lying
                    in bed and hearing rueful voices floating up from the living room below: "If only we
                    hadn't promised Edward not to give that child a spanking. She surely needs one
                    now!" But my brother Joe had not made such a promise and he was not only able but willing
                    to do the needful.</p>
            <p>The pattern of home life of my Grandmothers Rumely and Zimmerman carried over into our home where it
                    was expected that everyone helped everybody else to do the work about the place. Since the death of
                    her husband Grandmother Zimmerman had to manage the family and she was a good manager. One by one
                    the children took the responsibility and worked with her.</p>
            <p>So, too, did Mother handle her large family <hi rend="i">of 12</hi> by making the older children look
                    after and help with the younger ones. As the eldest child I had the longest term of service and my
                    job included preparing milk bottles for the babies and working up the formula as their ages changed.
                    One of my jobs was to take my four brothers down for a hair cut at the switch tower at the
                    intersection of the Pere Marquette and New York Central. The tower was operated by a railroad man
                    named Miller, who had been run over by a train and lost one leg. And as a sideline to his switching
                    and signaling he took on hair cutting. The barber chair was a tree trunk that had been cut to a yard
                    length while the barber sat on a higher stool with his one leg dangling and did the job of hair
                    cutting. When a train whistled he hippety hopped over with one leg and a crutch to pull the levers
                    and switch the signals and then came back to his tonsorial art.</p>
            <p>This stretch of railroad <del rend="strikethrough">has become</del>
                    <hi rend="i">is</hi> the main line of the New York Central and passenger trains now whizz through at
                    70 miles an hour. Even then it was one of the busiest in the United States, and freight and express
                    trains east and west bound rolled through at five <hi rend="i">fifteen</hi> minute intervals. It
                    therefore took longer to have hair cuts than in the ordinary barbershop. But the place was more
                    interesting to wide-eyed youngsters, and instead of charging 15¢ a haircut, as did the
                    more fashionable barbers uptown, Mr. Miller gave us a per capita wholesale price of ten cents.</p>
            <pb n="21" id="VAA4025-066-1-025"/>
            <p>By helping mother in the kitchen, I learned to cook, pack and can fruit and preserve vegetables for
                    the winter. We generally had one girl in the kitchen as a helper. Because Mother was known
                    throughout LaPorte to be a good cook and housekeeper other mothers urged her to take their daughters
                    in and train them. And when the hired girl was out on Thursday or Sunday evenings it was my job to
                    get supper which usually consisted of fried potatoes and eggs, or in wintertime homemade sausage.</p>
            <p>Mother baked from 12 to 20 large loaves of bread for Saturday and sometimes on that day I also baked
                    a cake. She set aside part of the bread dough for cinnamon cake and long coffee cake spread with
                    sugar and cinnamon. Four or five times a week we had pies—three large pies at one meal,
                    and enough left for any tramp who should knock at the door. Being a railroad junction, LaPorte was
                    favorite stopover for hoboes, who scrawled chalk marks on trees and the sidewalk in front of our
                    house informing other knights of the road that there was good vittles inside in return for very
                    little work at the woodpile.</p>
            <p>We sat in the dining room at a long rectangular table, Father at the head with a mound of soup and
                    dinner plates in front of him. The youngest child sat between Father and Mother, the second youngest
                    child next to Father and I was next in line. Joe sat next to me, Leo beyond him, then Cornelius and
                    so according to age around the table until the third youngest child at the other side of Mother.</p>
            <p>Breakfast was about 7:45, usually oatmeal, bacon and eggs, sausage and eggs; in wintertime we had
                    large quantities of salt mackeral—three or four of which made a breakfast with boiled
                    potatoes. The children were all permitted tea and coffee but they also drank a large quantity of
                    milk—a pitcher of which was on the table at every meal.</p>
            <p>At midday there was soup, in which Mother was a great believer, and which Father ladled from a big
                    tureen. She would buy eight to ten pounds of bones which she would boil for a long time and then
                    have soup of various flavors, frequently noodle soup for her mother was an expert noodle-maker.
                    Grandmother Zimmerman rolled the batter extremely thin and then cut her noodles into fine hairlike
                    strips for soup. As for meats, we had round steak, roast beef, roast ham, occasionally leg of lamb,
                    frequently chicken and, not so often, pork chops.</p>
            <p>Each winter Father bought two large hogs, and the entire hog—ham and
                    tenderloin—was worked into sausage, <hi rend="i">smoked</hi> by old Mr. Zech, whose pet
                    names for his good-natured wife were "Dumbe Frau" <pb n="22" id="VAA4025-066-1-026"/> and "Alte Kuh."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Father would
                    buy 24 hams at a time and hang them in the attic. He was an excellent provider and enjoyed nothing
                    better than going to the grocery store and buying a large quantity of food and sending it home. He
                    would buy a whole bunch of bananas or a crate of oranges. The bananas were put in a closet and we
                    children were allowed to run in whenever we wanted to and take one or two off. During the winter two
                    or three barrels of oysters came from Chesapeake Bay, and it was my job to open them.</p>
            <p>Supper was generally fried potatoes with fried apple slices and ham and eggs in one form or another,
                    also <hi rend="i">home-canned</hi> fruit. For supper we had an abundance of home-canned foods. Our
                    cellar was stocked in the fall with apples, potatoes, and endive, celery and cabbage. Enough
                    sauerkraut was put up in ten gallon jars to last through the entire winter. Apple butter was made by
                    Grandmother Rumely in a copper kettle outdoors and sent to us, and Mother put up a delicious tomato
                    preserve in 40 or 50 two-quart jars.</p>
            <p>For a change from this routine I used to go over to Grandmother Rumely's which was the same,
                    only more so. Often I stayed as long as a week at a time. <hi rend="b">My childhood companion was
                        Uncle Aloysius, my father's brother, who was only six years older than I.</hi> I would
                    come out of the house and wave to my mother across the street then go back to my temporary home.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed rummaging through her attic which was filled with every kind of heirlooms and toys. One
                    mysterious object was covered with a cloth and Grandmother warned "You must keep away from
                    that." I later found out that it was a still which the Fierstoss family had fashioned on
                    their Canton, Ohio farm and had kept on making their own liquors and brandy just as they had in
                    Alsace, but the revenue officers heard of it and made a raid. The result was a stiff fine, more than
                    the farm could pay, but Grandfather Rumely paid the assessment and took the still with him to
                    LaPorte so that there would be no temptation to use it further.</p>
            <p>Grandmother Rumely's family, being Alsatian—a betwixt and between of
                    German-French stock—almost made a cult of good food. I have already recorded how in the
                    1850's and 60's farmers used to stay at her house willingly for a couple of weeks
                    at a time while waiting <hi rend="b">with gold in their tobacco sacks for <del rend="s">delivery</del> completion of their threshing</hi> machines, for there is nothing like the
                    drawing power of good food. St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit Order, said: "The
                    table must be so good that if members leave they will eat less well and wish to come back."</p>

            <p>One of those who made a point of returning to Grandmother Rumely's table as often as he
                    could was the greatest trencherman in America. His business card read "James A.
                    Brady," but wherever newspapers were read he was known as "Diamond Jim"
                    Brady. He was then a salesman for Manning Maxwell and Moore, a New York City firm dealing in
                    railroad supplies and other equipment some of which was used by the M. Rumely Company. Either on his
                    way to Chicago or back Diamond Jim made <del rend="strikethrough">one or two</del>
                    <hi rend="i">occasional</hi> calls at LaPorte. He was a connoisseur and mass consumer of good food.
                    But as an antidote to lobsters and champagne he was particularly fond of Grandmother
                    Rumely's noodles and prunes. When Grandmother heard that Diamond Jim was coming she <del rend="s">and my aunts</del> started days ahead preparing the luncheon. I recall one visit when I
                    walked up from the shop between Diamond Jim and Grandfather, on the way to luncheon, and hearing
                    Grandfather say "Now, Jim, don't you make eyes at my daughters when you are <del rend="s">out</del>
                    <hi rend="i">over</hi> there." I did not know what Grandfather meant then for it was years
                    later when I went to New York and owner of <hi rend="i">The</hi> [New York <hi rend="i">Evening</hi>] <hi rend="i">Mail</hi> and heard the fabulous stories of Diamond Jim, Lillian Russell
                    and the favored young ladies of the Ziegfield chorus.</p>
            <p>My lifelong interest in vitamins and nutrition began in Grandmother Rumely's kitchen. So
                    much is known today about these subjects that it is a wonder to many that the human race got along
                    so well without this supposedly up-to-date scientific knowledge. As a matter of fact, science merely
                    fills in some of the gaps in things about which nature has known all along. It merely supplied the
                    why between cause and effect.</p>
            <p>If, for instance, a pint of milk a day is the minimum diet required for healthy Americans, why is it
                    that the Chinese got along for centuries without cows. The secret of the Chinese getting along
                    without milk is the fact that they cook their green foods very lightly without destroying by heavy
                    cooking the beneficial effect of minerals and other compounds and they even sprout their beans to
                    give them more of what is now known as "Vitamin C." But, it will be asked, if
                    green foods contain essential elements for human nutrition why do Eskimoes get along without
                    vegetables of any kind? These northern people get their vitamins from the seal and fish livers. By
                    instinct, meat-eating animals in the jungle <del rend="strikethrough">and fish in the sea</del>
                    first devour the vitamin entrails before eating the flesh of their prey.</p>
            <p>Years before scientists and nutritionists found the explanation, Grandmother Rumely and generations
                    of her people before her knew the beneficial effects of vitamin <del rend="strikethrough">packed <hi rend="i">rich</hi>
               </del> (containing) foods. She insisted as a child that I eat carrots.
                    When I went into her yard to play she would say "Now get a couple of carrots and wash
                    them." <pb n="24" id="VAA4025-066-1-028"/> The pump was outside the kitchen door and
                    she'd stand there until I washed the carrots; then she'd inspect them to see
                    whether they were clean and then say "Now you eat them before you can play in the
                    yard." If it was wintertime I had to go down cellar where carrots were stowed in sand.
                    Grandmother kept 4 or 5 milch cows, one cow was reserved to furnish milk for her infant
                    grandchildren and this cow had carrots in her food and the milk was kept separate.</p>
            <p>Grandmother knew before the nutritionists discovered it that when cows are on dry food the vitamin
                    content of their milk is a fraction of normal. In Berlin more children were sick in hospitals in
                    late winter months while cows were on dry feed but when the cattle went out to the grass meadows the
                    infant morbidity fell rapidly. The University of Minnesota experimenters studying vitamin deficiency
                    in rats endeavored to find out how little milk could be fed them. Suddenly the rats gained weight,
                    yet their milk ration was the same level as before and their other food was unchanged. The only
                    thing that had happened was that three days before the cows supplying the milk had gone on green
                    grass and away from the dry hay of winter.</p>
            <p>For after leaving Grandmother Rumely's kitchen green vegetables became part of my daily
                    diet. Years later this was an essential diet at my Interlaken School and so important did I regard
                    this that when I was in New York publishing The Evening Mail, I used to have the Interlaken menus
                    sent me. Once I thought the boys were not eating enough salads and green foods so I wrote a notice
                    to be pinned on the school bulletin board recommending that all eat salads and instructing the cook
                    and the kitchen what I wished done in their preparation. Several years later when government
                    investigators were going through my files during World War I they found on fine carbon paper an
                    extremely suspicious document. Its pretended subject was about eating salads but no newspaper
                    publisher would be writing instructions about salads so the G-men were certain that this
                    communication was the key to an enemy code which they had not yet thus far been able to decipher.
                        <hi rend="i">Reporter told me[.]</hi> Actually this was a code, though not the kind that the
                    Department of Justice sleuths suspected. It was a code for good eating and healthy living.</p>

            <p>My education began almost as soon as I crawled out of my cradle. I learned to read when I was three
                    at my father's knee, first picking out the letters and then the words while he was reading
                    his newspaper. When I was four Uncle Frank Zimmerman taught me the multiplication table, one table
                    at a time up to 12. Uncle Frank paid <pb n="25" id="VAA4025-066-1-029"/> me 5¢ for each
                    table I learned. My elementary mathematical education therefore cost my Uncle and rewarded me a
                    total of 60¢. I would not go so far as to advocate an educational system in which the
                    teachers pay the pupils, but as an incentive for quick and early learning it has its advantages.</p>
            <p>Mother insisted upon our learning to work as soon as we knew how to use our hands. I learned to use
                    tools so early that I cannot remember when I first handled hammer, saw, and file. Each child was
                    expected to do as much as it could perform and Mother implanted early in us the habit of methodical
                    effort which more or less followed us the rest of our lives. She expected as a matter of course that
                    repairs and such simple carpentry work as building a chicken house and elementary plumbing jobs like
                    thawing out frozen pipes would be performed by the children.</p>
            <p>One time I was repairing a screen door for my mother at the lumber yard where Uncle Frank Zimmerman
                    was foreman. The door was ready to be brought home but the delivery wagon was not within reach, so I
                    put the door on my shoulders. A couple of boys followed me jeering me for making such a spectacle of
                    myself. Without my knowledge Grandfather had observed and when he saw me next time he said
                    "That was a good thing. Don't be afraid of what other people say."
                    Grandfather never was and I never have. <hi rend="i">been.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I earned money by spading the garden, delivering milk for Grandmother Rumely, shoveling snow, mowing
                    the lawn. Baby sitting was unpaid, but I worked at it. We had a cradle that rocked; and to rock it
                        <hi rend="i">in absentia</hi> while playing chess with a Catholic priest who lived opposite, I
                    ran a length of binder twine across the street to our veranda and the cradle of my baby sister,
                    Florence. During the first few chessboard moves I pondered against Father Messman's
                    openers, I pulled the string steadily, then stopped. If the baby didn't cry, she was
                    asleep. If she did cry, she needed more rocking, whereupon I pulled hard <hi rend="i">on</hi> the
                    binder cord until the wailing ceased. Traffic at that time of evening wasn't heavy on
                    "C" Street. When an occasional buggy passed, I unloosed the cord, and took up the
                    slack after the vehicle had gone by.</p>
            <p>Living across the street from the church, we saw much of the Catholic priests in charge of the
                    parish. Several were close friends of mine, particularly Father Messman, my chess-playing
                    antagonist. I used to take him fishing in the best spots Uncle Frank Zimmerman had shown me. Often I
                    played hookey to do so, but since the school was not a parochial one but a public <del rend="s">grammar</del> and high school the good father did not look upon my truancy as much of an
                    offense.</p>
            <p>Besides being an altar boy in the church, I helped the priests in more secular ways. In Chesterton
                    they taught me Pedro, a less intellectual <pb n="26" id="VAA4025-066-1-030"/> game than chess but an
                    innocent one. On Saturday afternoons when four reverend fathers sat down to play Pedro I was <del rend="s">usually</del>
                    <hi rend="i">frequently</hi> there to hold the fifth hand. Hours on end they played—
                    sometimes from noon until 10 or 11 at night with a couple of hours' intermission <del rend="s">for church services</del>
                    <hi rend="i">to hear confessions.</hi> Also they poured down their throats stein after stein of
                    beer. What went in had to come out, and when a priest left the table on the latter mission, I,
                    "the fifth hand," picked up his cards and played them.</p>
            <p>All Rumelys and Zimmermans were devout Roman Catholics. Grandfather Meinrad was devout in his way;
                    that is, he observed his obligations to the church but tolerated no suggestion of domination by the
                    priests. Walking to church on Sundays he would pull out his watch when the bell rang (and knowing
                    that <hi rend="i">which</hi> the altar boy was ringing it he might say,) "That louse boy is
                    ringing the bell a minute and a half too soon." Having timed himself to arrive at church
                    exactly on the minute, he did not want the bell to be rung too early. When that happened Father
                    Nussbaum heard about it, and, through various channels, so did the altar boy who as often as not was
                    a Rumely.</p>
            <p>As the parish grew and overcrowded the church <hi rend="i">an enlarged sacristy was needed.</hi>
                    Grandfather had built a wood addition which had been given a preliminary coat of white. At luncheon
                    one day when I was at Grandfather's house he said that he was going to paint the whole
                    addition for Father Nussbaum. "What color?" asked his daughters. "Why red
                    is a good color" said Grandfather. "It doesn't cost much and it lasts a
                    long time. We'll paint it red." When they mildly suggested other colors
                    Grandfather said "No, we will paint it red." Red paint was a commodity in long
                    supply at the Rumely shops for this was the color which identified over the countryside a Rumely
                    threshing machine. Grandfather's devout daughters did not fancy the idea of the same color
                    as a farm thresher being slapped upon the walls of their church.</p>
            <p>So, when Meinrad took his after luncheon nap, <hi rend="i">one of</hi> my aunts beckoned to me and
                    said "Try to persuade Grandfather to paint the church white or cream instead of red. If you
                    do, we'll give you a quarter." When he woke up I said to him
                    "Grandfather, wouldn't white or cream be a good color for the church?" He
                    put his head on one side and looked at me and said "So! You want the church white or cream?
                    I'll paint it white or cream for you."</p>
            <p>As I look back, I believe that there was some sort of unconscious struggle between Grandfather Rumely
                    and Grandmother Zimmerman for directing the future career of their first grandchild. Grandmother
                    Zimmerman was devoted to the church. She attended Mass every morning then crossed the street for an
                    hour or two at our house. The <pb n="27" id="VAA4025-066-1-031"/> finest career she could imagine
                    was the life of service of a religious. Her <hi rend="i">one</hi> daughter had become a nun, and
                    almost before I was out of my cradle she began expressing her hope that one of her grandchildren,
                    possibly Edward, would become a priest. Grandmother Rumely thought it was a nice idea but she never
                    actually encouraged it. But Grandfather clearly had a notion that I'd be more useful in the
                    factory than in the church.</p>
            <p>Almost as soon as I could walk, Grandfather used to take me on his rounds of the factory, my whole
                    hand grasping one of his fingers. With him always on these inspection trips was his black Spitz dog.
                    The dog knew the rounds almost as well as Grandfather, for he preceded his master by some fifty feet
                    or so, a sort of advance warning to the men that Grandfather was coming.</p>
            <p>The factory was interesting because so many different kinds of work were going on at the same time.
                    The threshing machines were made of wood, but they had many castings and there was much tinsmith
                    work. And so, there was a wood shop, a tin shop, a paint shop and a foundry. Grandfather explained
                    them all and encouraged my going in the plant to use the tools and material. Once when we were
                    crossing State Street, he told me ‘Now, some day when you are in charge of the plant,
                    here is where the water main runs, and here the sewer runs. So, you should mark the spot in the
                    mind; and when you have control of the plant and ever have to dig up the water main, here is the
                    place to do it.’</p>
            <p>On our walks together, Grandfather showed me how the steam engine works. Should we hear an engine
                    operating two blocks away, he made me listen to the exhaust and tell me whether the cut-off had been
                    set high enough, or whether the operator was careless or economical in getting the most power with
                    the least amount of steam. (<del rend="strikethrough">I was too young to understand the principles
                        he explained but I could identify its effects.</del>)</p>
            <p>Also Grandfather watched his boilers. Once he stopped suddenly in the street and said crossly,
                    "That fellow is wasting coal." He walked maybe three blocks to the boiler room,
                    and said to the fireman: "You've been wasting coal. You're too lazy to
                    shovel a little coal in at a time, so you filled the whole firebox and dampened the fire. Now I told
                    you to put two or three shovels full of coal on the fire at once, and you've put on
                    ten." When we got outside I asked "How did you know it?" And he said
                    "Well, I looked at the smokestack."</p>
            <p>And so <del rend="strikethrough">at the tender</del>
                    <hi rend="i">before I had reached the</hi> age of 12 or so, I learned about steam engine operation
                    and fuel economy. When a Rumely steam traction engine was being tested, Grandfather allowed me to
                    come down after school and drive the engine around the block <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-066-1-032"/> and
                    up and down the plant yard. The regular model engine had a limited steering gear which could not
                    turn more than 40 or 50 degrees. One day I found a <hi rend="i">specially built</hi> larger sized
                    engine in the yard. Not knowing that its front wheels would move in a right angle, I took this big
                    engine out, delighted that I could handle it. At a certain point, I turned the wheels too far and
                    when the engine pounced out of its course, it cut down a telegraph pole. Then I saw Grandfather in
                    the distance—a distance I had no motive for decreasing. Not knowing how angry he would
                    be, and not wishing the paddling which I knew I deserved, I shut off the engine and ducked. I kept
                    away from Grandfather until he came out of church the next Sunday, because I figured that in his
                    Sunday mood and Sunday clothes with all the church people about, the worst that could happen to me
                    was a scolding. To my surprise all he said was: "You foolish boy! If you'd stayed
                    there I would have shown you how to drive those big engines. Instead, you ran away before I could
                    explain it to you."</p>
            <p>Summertime was always a busy season at the shop so that farmers might get their machinery in time for
                    threshing. One midsummer, Grandfather was so busy that he operated the shop on the holy day of the
                    Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, and the boiler exploded. The priest mentioned the incident at
                    length in his sermon the next Sunday. As we walked out of church, I said "Grandfather, did
                    you hear what Father Nussbaum said? He said your boiler blew up because you ran it on a holy
                    day." And Grandfather said, "Eddie, that boiler blew up because there was too much
                    steam in it!"</p>
            <p>But I noticed that ever after that, Grandfather never allowed steam pressure to get too high in his
                    boiler. Also that he never again operated the shop on a holy day; he played safe, with fingers
                    crossed on both hands.</p>
            <p>Grandfather greatly admired Mayor Scott and thought he had the best head in town not only for civic
                    matters but for mechanical and mathematical problems. Emmet Hoyt Scott was a railroad builder and
                    later an industrialist and banker? in LaPorte who became a close friend of Meinrad.</p>
            <p>Grandfather used to say to me: "We'll go down to see Scott. He knows a
                    lot." Grandfather's business was personally owned partnership with a brother, John
                    Rumely, who didn't share Grandfather's ambition. John, however, was an expert
                    pattern maker. In the late 80's Grandfather bought him out for $70,000 and
                    incorporated. The firm had been M. and J. Rumely; it now became M. Rumely Company. The advice to
                    incorporate and some guidance in putting through the corporation was given to Grandfather by E. H.
                    Scott, his friend. Mr. Scott became my friend, too, for he could have opposed my marrying his
                    daughter. But he didn't.</p>

            <p>When I was six I was sent to LaPorte's German Catholic Parochial School. This school had all
                    grades, some sixty boys and girls from 5 to 13, in one room. Today's heating engineers
                    would have been pained by the big oak-burner which toasted the nearest pupils and permitted the more
                    remote to shiver in their woolens; and the water pail and dipper <hi rend="b">which today would be
                        thought</hi> were appallingly unsanitary. Recitations were rotated for each grade. In these days
                    of pigeon-holed education there is a lot to be said for the one-room school house. The younger
                    pupils listened to recitations of the grade ahead and the brightest ones were carried ahead faster
                    than they would have been within a single grade. I recall following the two upper grades when I was
                    below them two or three years. When I was eleven I had mastered all the subjects of the school, but
                    I was kept there until my thirteenth year when I was allowed to graduate.</p>
            <p>Up to then I had traveled but little. I had seen the World's Fair in Chicago <del rend="s">forty</del>
                    <hi rend="i">sixty</hi> miles away and been to South Bend, Michigan City and a few neighboring
                    towns. I had, however, roamed all over parts of LaPorte County hunting, fishing, nut gathering and
                    making experimental trips with new machinery with my grandfather. I knew all the lakes and pools of
                    the surrounding country. And thanks largely to Father Nussbaum, a cultured, educated man from the
                    Rhine region, I became absorbed in science. Father Nussbaum planned to study medicine before he
                    decided to join the priesthood and three or four times a week he would come into the school and
                    lecture to upper classes upon astronomy, botany and zoology on a basis <hi rend="i">level</hi> not
                    included in school textbooks. He was the living personification of the fact that it's the
                    personality of the teacher and not the subject which first appeals to the student.</p>
            <p>On my own I began the study of physics particularly electricity. All over the house were battery jars
                    of briny water with signs "do not touch." In a long closet off the living room was
                    a row of drawers to which I had attached wooden knobs. By turning them certain ways, like the
                    combination of a bank vault, they would open and only I knew that secret. <hi rend="b">When</hi>
                    [Guglielmo] <hi rend="b">Marconi's wireless invention was announced I made a sender and
                        coherer receiver and was able to operate it.</hi>

            <p>At Grandfather's shop I began making various devices of my own and my school friends dubbed
                    me the <del rend="strikethrough">pattern</del>
                    <hi rend="i">patent</hi> maker because I was always engaged in working out some new mechanical
                    problem. Grandfather did not object, in fact, upheld me when I got into trouble.</p>

            <p>Once when I was about 12,I had the idea of building a rotary engine. Needing a large piece of wood
                    about 3" thick and 2 by 2 feet for the cylinder pattern, I found in the pattern shop a
                    cherry wood plank which William Rumely had stored there for some big pattern job. I sawed off one
                    end of it for my cylinder. Uncle William was indignant and told the pattern maker not to allow me
                    back in the pattern shop. When Grandfather heard this, he countermanded the order and said that he
                    wanted me to finish the pattern; that even if I wasted a little wood it was all
                    right—I'd learn. This experience clouded my relations with William Rumely, I
                    believe, for a long time afterward.</p>
            <p>Grandfather was willing to have an idea tested and encouraged me to work out whatever project I had
                    in mind. In those days there was no science of mixing irons. A foundry man had to go by an acquired
                    skill. Mr. Oliver at South Bend, Mr. Studebaker, and my Grandfather often swapped experience for
                    some of their castings. They sent to Scotland for iron to mix in. Sometimes the mixture would go
                    wrong, and then a conference would be called <del rend="strikethrough">until</del>
                    <hi rend="i">and</hi> the judgment of the visitors used to readjust the mix. Foundry sand was
                    brought in from various nearby sources for the making of cores and the molds in the foundry.</p>
            <p>One time I got the notion that it was a great waste of time to make a mold, destroy it after each
                    casting, then make a new one. I had heard that asbestos would stand very high temperatures, and
                    worked out a mold which I expected could be used over and over again, and by mixing sand and fibrous
                    asbestos, a mold that would hold its form. When I poured the mold, I did not take the precaution of
                    having it thoroughly dry, and the moisture formed steam and blew the molten iron out like a
                    flowerpot. One spot of molten iron made a small hole in my cheek. Foreman Jake Graf thought I
                    deserved a spanking. Grandfather, who happened by said "no; the boy has learned a lesson
                    and the next time he'd bake the mold hard enough to drive the water out before pouring hot
                    metal on it." Then Grandfather told me to try it again. I did, and succeeded in making four
                    paperweights with this one mold.</p>
            <p>Grandfather would go from one department to the other in the factory. He was so expert a mechanic
                    that wherever a man worked he could instantly ascertain whether the methods were proper; and if not,
                    he would go up and show him how to hold a paint brush, how to set the tool in a lathe. He would look
                    at the mixture of the paint and comment on it to the foreman—if too thick, he would tell
                    him he was wasting paint; if too thin, that he was not getting a coat enough on to stand up. <del rend="s">The Rumely separators all were of one color—red, which <pb n="31" id="VAA4025-066-1-035"/> was inexpensive and durable and made the separator visible for
                        miles across the country.</del>
            </p>
            <p>The next fall after leaving parochial school I entered the 7th Grade of public school. In about two
                    months the teacher decided I should be moved forward to the 8th Grade. After two months there I was
                    promoted to the pre-high school grade and at the age of 14 entered high school.</p>
            <p>Gradually my interest changed from scientific experimentation to one of scientific speculation. I
                    became interested in [Charles] Darwin and [Herbert] Spencer and the theory of evolution. The public
                    library <del rend="strikethrough">had none of</del>
                    <hi rend="i">lacked</hi> the books upon this subject that I heard about and wished to read. So I
                    went to Grandfather and told him I needed books that I could not get. "Whatever books you
                    promise to read I will pay for. You choose them and put the order in and have them come here and
                    charge us collect. Have them send a bill."</p>
            <p>One day a huge box arrived at <del rend="strikethrough">M. Rumely Company</del>
                    <hi rend="i">the freight station.</hi> The bill <del rend="strikethrough">of lading was accompanied
                        by a statement</del>
                    <hi rend="b">came addressed to Grandfather at the office</hi> with a charge of $480.00.
                    My horrified father brought the bill home and demanded "What does this mean?"</p>
            <p>"Grandfather told me I could order some books," I said.</p>
            <p>"But not $480 worth" exclaimed Father "$40
                    maybe."</p>
            <p>"No," I said "he told me to buy the books and whatever books I would read
                    he would pay for." So father hurried down to Grandfather and said "You could not
                    have meant to pay all this."</p>
            <p>"Yes," said Grandfather "I did. So you just pay for the books and charge
                    them to me."</p>
            <p>The company teamster brought the box home on a Saturday morning. I had not yet unpacked all of them
                    when noon came and Father arrived home. The first book he picked up was "The Evolution of
                    the Idea of God." This title horrified him even more than the $480 bill. But the
                    books were paid for and there was not much he could do about it. Just to sooth his feelings,
                    however, I went through my now small library and those books I thought Father would object to most I
                    turned wrong end to or laid sideways so they were not noticeable.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile a priest representing St. Joseph's Academy, a newly established boarding school at
                    Rensselaer, Indiana, visited LaPorte and together with one of our priests impressed my father that
                    this was an excellent institution. Perhaps the book episode had heightened my father's
                    impression that a little more church discipline would be an excellent antidote for the free thinking
                    books. After I had been at Rensselaer a couple of months my brother Joe joined me. The school
                    offered excellent instruction in studies that are deemed important in <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-066-1-036"/> Catholic orders and preparations for the priesthood. I studied Latin,
                    Greek and French simultaneously and everything went well at first. We had a great deal of outdoor
                    life and there was an Indian school across the street. The Indians taught us how to hunt down
                    rabbits in the snow by foot. Unable to burrow and disappear the rabbits hid under bushes then ran in
                    circles and if two boys relayed each other one after the other in cutting across the circle, one
                    taking over while the other rested, it was possible to run down a rabbit and kill it. Sometimes
                    three or four of us hunting in a group took ten or fifteen rabbits in a single afternoon.</p>
            <p>The school was better curricular-wise than culinary-wise. Despite our rabbit hunting, the food at St.
                    Joseph's was monotonous and not well-balanced. In January an epidemic swept through the
                    school. It was undiagnosed but I know now from the symptoms that it was an outbreak of beri-beri. I
                    returned home in pretty bad shape where I recovered quickly and comfortably on family food.</p>
            <p>Father Schweitzer, a cousin of my mother's, who visited us frequently, heard of my illness
                    and insisted that I visit him in lower Wisconsin, at Sinsinnawa Mound where he had one large parish
                    and two mission churches; one of which was at Galena, Ill., the old lead city where Ulysses Grant
                    once lived. The time between February to September that I spent with Father Schweitzer was one of
                    the most enjoyable of my life. My priestly cousin loved poetry and had written some delightful
                    little German nature verses. He loved outdoors and nature, poetry and birds as intensely as any
                    person that I have ever known. He knew every bird in the region, its nesting habits, its song, and
                    would capture one young bird of a kind or a brood, take it home into a cage and rear it. He was most
                    skillful in preparing food for every age of these fledglings and seldom lost a single bird. In one
                    big room the walls were banked with bird cages. In the center of the room he had a piano and he knew
                    how to stimulate the birds into singing, either by playing the piano or whistling.</p>
            <p>On the same beautiful hill at Sinsinnawa Mound was a nunnery and a school for girls. The school
                    chaplain became a good friend of ours and we played chess with him often. Also Father Schweitzer and
                    I used to go rabbit hunting and fishing in the side waters of the Mississippi. I made a trap which
                    caught rabbits alive and Sister Dolores, a highly intelligent <hi rend="i">young</hi> nun full of
                    zest who had been teaching me a little extra Latin said she would like to go rabbit hunting with me.
                    At five o'clock one morning we ran the traps each one of which had a rabbit in it (and) we
                    were both happy until we got back to the Mound when the Mother Superior discovered her absence and
                    was scandalized that Sister Dolores had gone out for several hours with a young student whom Father
                    Schweitzer hoped some day might <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-066-1-037"/> change his mind and study for
                    the priesthood. She imposed on Sister a penance of a rosary for a half hour each day for two weeks
                    and she recommended that Father Schweitzer think up some proper penance for me. The good Father made
                    the penance something that I had intended to do. My task was to memorize his German nature poetry
                    and recite it to him. Sister Dolores and I were restored to good graces before I left for LaPorte
                    and I was confirmed at Sinsinnawa Mound—one young man at the end of a line of about 35
                    girls.</p>

            <p>While I was still with Father Schweitzer at Sinsinnawa Mound, I decided to enter Notre Dame. My
                    father had studied there, but he objected to my going for reasons he never explained. All I could
                    get out of him was "That's not the place for you." If he feared that I
                    was too independent and likely to get into trouble, his foreboding was correct.</p>
            <p>But my mind was set on going to Notre Dame and I packed my things. On the morning of my departure,
                    Father was at home with a cold and I went in to his room to bid him good-bye. "I want you
                    to understand," he said "that you are not going with my consent." But I
                    went and Father later accepted the situation, even going to the trouble a year and a half later to
                    try to intervene in my behalf after I quit the place a few hours before the authorities were to
                    expel me.</p>
            <p>At Notre Dame I continued the classical course and got on easily in my studies. By doubling two or
                    three classes into each term I completed <del rend="strikethrough">seven</del>
                    <hi rend="i">five</hi> Latin courses in three terms. I was an honor student in my second year, and
                    when I got into difficulties with the administration I was to have received the gold medal for
                    highest ranking student. But in addition to the classical course I dabbled in the sciences. My chief
                    recreation was chess at which I became champion.</p>
            <p>The <del rend="strikethrough">$420</del>
                    <hi rend="i">480</hi> library I had with me became the center of a group of students interested in
                    the Darwinian theory. Notre Dame had not then accepted the doctrine of evolution and <hi rend="i">the church</hi> disciplined Dr. Zahn for writing <del rend="strikethrough">his book
                        "Evolution and Dogma</del>" <hi rend="i">a book favoring the theory of
                        evolution.</hi> The preceeding summer I had spent eight weeks reading Herbert Spencer's
                    "First Principles" digesting each paragraph into a sentence or two. Until then no
                    book had influenced my thinking so profoundly. Another book, however, set me off on a temporary
                    tangent. Henry George's "Progress and Poverty" gripped me and filled me
                    with a great enthusiasm for the single tax. I subscribed to "The Public" the
                    Chicago single tax paper edited by Louis <pb n="34" id="VAA4025-066-1-038"/> F. Post, who later
                    became Woodrow Wilson's assistant secretary of labor. I met single taxers in the
                    neighborhood of South Bend and I evangelized single tax doctrine to my fellow-students until we
                    formed a Henry George group.</p>
            <p>This was not good Catholic doctrine. Father Glynn, New York State priest had been reprimanded for too
                    active an interest in the single tax and the University frowned on the discussion of such a subject.
                    Nevertheless we argued the question in our philosophy classes. With the head of the debating society
                    we organized a single tax debate which we won hands down and glowing reports of these activities
                    appeared in The Scholastic, the college paper, whose editor was a member of our group.</p>
            <p>All this did not rest well with <del rend="strikethrough">James</del>
                    <hi rend="i">Joseph D</hi>[.] Oliver, the forthright South Bend plow-maker. Though not a Catholic he
                    was a friend of Notre Dame and to President (Rev. Andrew) Morrissey<hi rend="sup">19</hi> he doubted
                    the advisability of encouraging college students to become protagonists for Henry George. We heard
                    about this through one of our group who was secretary to the president and told us long before the
                    official notification that we were no longer to be allowed to ride our hobby either in The
                    Scholastic or in the debating society.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, my doubts about becoming a priest increased. At the same time reverend fathers of the
                    Order of Holy Cross who taught at Notre Dame were assuring me that if I joined their Order I would
                    surely become one of the superiors or that if I joined the <hi rend="i">lay</hi> priesthood I would
                    be headed towards a bishopric. Somehow, my English teacher, Austin O'Malley, who later
                    became a physician in Philadelphia, heard of this proselytizing, and gave me subtle warning. He was
                    a cultured man of great intelligence and an able critic of student writing. He knew me and my
                    characteristics well, for while the priests were working on me he wrote on the back of one of my

            <p>I decided to move from Professor Pite's <hi rend="i">Father</hi> [Stanislaus] <hi rend="i">Fitte</hi> Latin class to Professor [John] Ewing's economics class. Old Father <del rend="s">Pite</del>
                    <hi rend="i">Fitte</hi> was one of the small group of French priests which held a sort of balance of
                    power between the Germans and the Irish in the Order. The open battleground between the two dominant
                    factions was over prohibition—Germans opposing, Irish ostensibly favoring. When
                    Grandfather visited Notre Dame, Professor [Robert] Hoynes <hi rend="i">Dean</hi> of the Law

                    LaPorte guest. Father Cavanaugh, also an ardent prohibitionist, likewise brought out his <del rend="s">demijohn</del>

                    received a temporary set-back after instigating prosecutions against restaurant-owner Nichols who
                    had sold drinks to Notre Dame boys in South Bend. Then one Saturday two Notre Dame professors and a
                    couple of priests came in and ordered drinks served in coffee cups. The waiter, already primed for
                    this occasion, called out to the kitchen in a loud voice "Four double whiskies served in
                    coffee cups." And thus was Nichols revenged.</p>
            <p>After the director of studies gave me permission to transfer to Ewing's economics class,
                    Father <del rend="strikethrough">Pite</del>
                    <hi rend="i">Fitte</hi> was indignant. He became more indignant when other students requested
                    transfers from his class and he brought the case up before President Morrissey. Notre
                    Dame's President, a very well-nourished looking cleric sent for me. Using his big round
                    belly <hi rend="i">tummy</hi> like a bull-dozer, he pushed me against a hot radiator, and laid down
                    the law. "You are a very stubborn young man" he said. Still I refused to go back,
                    I insisted that the transfer had been made regularly, that I had learned everything that Father <del rend="s">Pite</del> (Fitte) could teach me in Latin, that Ewing's class was interesting
                    and that I intended to go ahead.</p>
            <p>Father Morrissey released me from the radiator. "The Germans put you up to this
                    obstinacy!" he exclaimed. "The Germans put you up to this!" But he did
                    not tell me what was to happen. A few days later my English teacher friend, Dr. O'Malley,
                    called me to one side "There has been a faculty meeting over your case," he said
                    "and the lay teachers have been out-voted by members of the Order who decided if you do not
                    yield by Thursday you will be expelled." He added that I mustn't think that I knew
                    more than the rest of the world and that I would accomplish nothing by obstinacy.</p>
            <p>I waited until Wednesday evening, when I ordered a hack from South Bend. A couple of students carried
                    down my trunk and my "dangerous" books, and I left Notre Dame at ten
                    o'clock. The next morning when a university official came to carry out the ultimatum and
                    conduct me before the <del rend="strikethrough">faculty</del>
                    <hi rend="i">dean of studies</hi> to give me a final choice, he found my room empty.</p>
            <p>Back in LaPorte my eleventh hour avoidance of expulsion did not stir my family half as much as my
                    announced intention of continuing my studies in Europe. In great agitation my father went to South
                    Bend the next Sunday to try to patch up matters with the University authorities, but there was a
                    church celebraion going on and he was unable to see <hi rend="i">the</hi> President <del rend="s">Morrissey</del>. This proved my chance for after two weeks I won over Grandfather, who said
                    "You'd better wait <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-066-1-040"/> until June, then if your
                    father doesn't consent I'll pay your expenses in Europe."</p>
            <p>"Why must you go to Europe" Grandmother Rumely asked, arguing strenuously against
                    my trip, "why must you go across the ocean?" "Grandmother,"
                    Grandfather said "why did you cross the ocean?"</p>
            <p>I proposed to go abroad with a Notre Dame student of whom I had become very fond, Alexander
                    Lattimore. His family escaped the headman's axe in the French Revolution by fleeing to
                    America where they settled in the South and became slave owners, with 800 <hi rend="i">hundred</hi>
                    (100) slaves freed by Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
            <p>Lattimore, whose nephew, Owen, achieved considerable notoriety in recent years, was a cultured,
                    poetic esthete. He knew architecture and art and books that I had never heard of. To him I was a
                    ruddy-cheeked prairie boy full of enthusiasm and energy. I had charted my time and planned my
                    studies and reading weeks and months in advance. Lattimore's theory was that everything
                    traveled in a circle, that everything returned to the place from which it started. Why trouble? Live
                    and have a good time on the way. Don't be a boor and gulp the common wine but learn to sip
                    the rarer drink. He led me into his world—we read [Geoffrey] Chaucer, Mathew Arnold and
                    [Richard Henry] Wilde.</p>
            <p>Lattimore was a High Church Episcopalian who had been admitted to Notre Dame in the hope that he
                    would become a priest. After I left the University I still had thoughts of continuing my studies for
                    the priesthood. <hi rend="i">but</hi> I had serious thoughts about many of the doctrines and dogmas
                    of the church and I had become thoroughly dissatisfied with <del rend="strikethrough">conditions</del>
                    <hi rend="i">limitations</hi> that surrounded me at Notre Dame, though as I look back today I was
                    too severe in my criticism and may have been wrong in my judgment of them. Nevertheless, I had made
                    up my mind as the result of reading Herbert Spencer's book on
                        "Education"<hi rend="sup">20</hi> and Jean J. Rousseau's
                    "Emile" that I should some day <del rend="strikethrough">as Catholic</del> found a
                    school of my own more along my own lines of thought. But as a <del rend="strikethrough">second
                        alternative to the priesthood</del>
                    <hi rend="i">preparation for this</hi> and coming more and more to the foreground was the thought of
                    the study of medicine.</p>
            <p>After long repeated arguments in which my father's judgment wavered from day to day I
                    finally left LaPorte and joined Lattimore on the way east to Washington. There I met Father Godfrey
                    Schilling head of the Franciscan Monastery who invited me to spend my time in Washington with him,
                    where I slept in a cell and observed the life of a Franciscan monk.</p>

            <p>I have never forgotten those three days. Godfrey Schilling was a remarkable man of great insight. He
                    was interested in my plans, in my views about schools that I had attended and my hope of some day to
                    start a school of my own.</p>
            <p>"I gather from what you say," he said "that you do not believe many of the
                    tenets of the Church. But when you start to build something like a school you must realize that you
                    are building a human institution in which every human being is a unit. Remember, men are like grains
                    of sand, and the winds of time blow them this way and that. The Church is the only organization
                    which has been able to hold men firm through the centuries. She found the secret of cementing
                    individual sands into blocks of sandstone that are a solid foundation on which to build.</p>
            <p>"The wisdom of the Church is based on its knowledge of human nature. It is this knowledge
                    which has enabled her to be the only organization in all history that through the centuries has
                    dealt with the human nature of every race, of every climate and under every condition.</p>
            <p>"Look," he continued "colonization in America was mostly by Protestants
                    who had left the Church of Rome. Foremost among these colonies was Massachusetts. Today, Catholics
                    in Massachusetts are 40% and with the birthrate they have it won't be long
                    before Massachusetts is a Catholic state; and what was once a Protestant colony comes into the fold
                    of the Mother Church."<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"In the Roman world the Church was; in the feudal world, it was; in the modern Democratic
                    world, the Church is. Don't turn lightly from the Church because she treasures 18 centuries
                    of experience with human nature. You could waste your whole life in a futile struggle against such
                    an organization; but work with it, bend it to your purposes, and you will be invincible."</p>
            <p>Leaving Washington, Lattimore and I stopped over for a few hours in Philadelphia. We saw on a
                    billboard that [Walker?] White-side was playing in "The Merchant of Venice," so we
                    bought tickets. After the performance we found that there was no train for New York until three in
                    the morning. Having time on our hands and knowing that Ben Franklin was buried in a churchyard, we
                    decided to look up his grave. We located <hi rend="i">what we thought was</hi> the church but in the
                    moonlight could not find the grave. Then I saw another grave surrounded by a high railing. We
                    vaulted the fence and looked at the tombstone. That was not Franklin's grave either. As we
                    walked away a couple of men rushed us and I thought we were being held up. <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">∗</hi> This was said in 1900. What Father Schilling predicted

                    <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-066-1-042"/> I wrestled with one man, got him out into the street and held
                    him so firmly he could not get away. Lattimore, on the other hand, being of frail physique was
                    easily overpowered whereupon his antagonist blew a whistle. Shortly a police wagon came up and two
                    or three bluecoats jumped out.</p>
            <p>I thought they were going to nab our attackers instead of that they held us and hauled us off to a
                    police station. We were thrown into a cell filled with drunks. When we protested strenuously they
                    moved us to an unoccupied women's cell. The gas flickered, the shadows of the bars jumped
                    back and forth, a procession of cockroaches marched up and down the walls and there were two hard
                    board bunks.</p>
            <p>The desk sergeant had taken away our pocketbooks which included cash for the trip to Europe, letters
                    of introduction and other papers, but they left Lattimore a pocket edition of Shakespeare's
                    Sonnets—a deluxe printing by [Thomas B.?] Mosher. A women's cell occupied by two
                    frightened young men is not the most exotic setting for enjoyment of these immortal lyrics. But we
                    whiled away the time sure that as soon as morning came the error of our arrest would be understood
                    and corrected.</p>
            <p>About eight o'clock I became impatient and rattled the lock on the door. This brought the
                    keeper who struck at my fingers with his club a blow so hard that if I had not withdrawn my hand
                    quickly he would have broken the bones. "That'll teach you to make a noise like
                    that" he said. Later we were taken into the court. One of the men who had rushed us in the
                    graveyard said that he was a watchman at Wanamaker's, had seen us in the churchyard
                    attempting to break a lock on the door. Then frightened by being observed we jumped over the fence
                    and ran until we were overpowered. We tried to explain that we had been looking for the grave of
                    Benjamin Franklin. "Trying to break into church to look for Ben Franklin's
                    grave" exclaimed the Judge "in my many years upon the bench I have heard a good
                    many fish stories but this is the tallest. I am going to hold you for the Grand Jury."</p>
            <p>Back in the cell I asked for a lawyer and I was told "you'll have plenty of time
                    before the Grand Jury gets around to your case." About a half hour later we were summoned
                    back to court where the judge told us "I've been thinking things over. You look
                    young and innocent and probably this is your first offense. So I have decided to give you another
                    chance and to release you."</p>
            <p>The police gave us back our money and papers and we went to a barbershop to get shaved and washed up
                    after our night in jail. There we saw one of the police sergeants who had been in court.
                    "DO you know what got you out" he asked. "No, I don't"
                    I said.</p>
            <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-066-1-043"/>
            <p>"After the judge bound you over for the Grand Jury the court officers looked through your
                    papers and found a letter from Father Godfrey Schilling to some prominent Catholics in London.
                    Whereupon a friend of the judge went to him and said ‘Judge, these young fellows
                    certainly know some top level Catholics. You are up for reelection shortly and since the Catholics
                    are against you, you had better be careful in this case.’"</p>
            <p>This judge had bound us over for no good reason and had released us for a worse reason—an
                    experience I was to undergo a quarter of a century later in The Mail case.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought this matter over and after we got to England reached the conclusion that something had to
                    be done. So I wrote a letter describing the case to a single tax magazine which had considerable
                    circulation in Philadelphia and I learned afterwards without the slightest regret that this letter
                    had been very embarrassing to the judge.</p>
            <p>Delayed a day in our bout with the Philadelphia law we reached New York and put up at Leo House where
                    Sister Vincent was Mother Superior. We booked passage on a slow boat to London. Passengers were
                    several hundred live cattle and 60 humans. Meanwhile my father had <del rend="strikethrough">been

                    York. When he arrived at Leo House shortly before noon the porter who had taken our baggage out that
                    morning pointed out to him an Atlantic Transport Liner moving slowly down the North River. Lattimore
                    and I were on board.</p>

            <p>In the folklore of American patriotism the word Copperhead has held a special place of scorn. Once
                    used by Republicans during the Civil War to slander Democrats opposed to Lincoln's war and
                    emancipation policies, the term has become synonymous in the vernacular with traitor or coward.
                    Apparently Clement L. Vallandigham, a leading Copperhead, inspired Edward Everett Hale's
                    paean to the American nation, <hi rend="i">The Man Without a Country.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">1</hi> More
                    recent writers have used the Copperheads as exemplars of evil. As Nathaniel Weyl wrote of them in
                    1951, "the parallel with the contemporary pro-Soviet conspiracy is evident."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But folklore is not history, and historical literature dealing with Civil War dissent offers a wide
                    variety of interpretations and moral judgments of the subject. Most scholars have agreed that there
                    was widespread discontent with the war, especially after 1862 and primarily in the Midwest. A few
                    Democratic politicians heatedly denounced the war aims as Republican tyranny and abolitionism. Draft
                    resistance posed some threat to the Union cause, and secret societies were created to fight the
                    Republican party extralegally. At the same time, Republicans capitalized on the
                    "treason" of a small number of Democrats to slander the entire opposition. As the
                    war progressed, Republican campaign hyperbole turned into suppression as dissenters were illegally
                    arrested and Democratic presses were destroyed.</p>
            <p>Most historians accept these bare facts regarding the phenomenon of Copperheadism, but the most
                    profound questions surrounding the subject of dissent have yet to be explored sensitively. One
                    central problem—the lack of a working definition for Copperheadism—has its
                    roots in the partisan and perjorative use of the word by Republicans in the Civil War era to
                    describe those suspected of having even the least reservation about the war effort. Historians have
                    described Copperheads variously as advocates of "peace at any price," those who
                    actively encouraged or participated in draft resistance, or loyal Democrats victimized by Republican
                    partisan politics for their grave misgivings about the changes being wrought by the war. To avoid
                    confusion, this essay will use the term only to point out the conceptual limitations it has
                    fostered.</p>

                    certainly true in the case of Civil War dissent, where historical study has been strongly influenced
                    by considerations of patriotism and tradition. Inquiry in this field has been dominated by two major
                    types of questions. First, some historians have concentrated on studying dissent mainly in its
                    relation to the Union cause. They have asked whether there was real danger of widespread, active
                    disaffection. They have studied the Republican response to opposition activities and have asked if
                    the extraconstitutional measures taken were justifiable in a war situation. Historians who have
                    posed such questions in the past have usually been highly sympathetic to the war effort. Thus the
                    answers given have generally led to an indictment of the dissenters and at least qualified
                    endorsement of their suppression. Following a somewhat different line of questioning and often
                    appearing more sympathetic to the antiwar group, other historians have studied the economic, social,
                    and political roots of dissent. This approach has dominated the latest research in the field, but
                    its use stretches back to the early part of the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Of the two roads to an understanding of Civil War dissent, the first to appear was that which
                    attempted to assess the relationship of antiwar feeling to the Union cause. Implicit in this
                    approach was an understanding of the most profound institutional conflicts in a democracy. An
                    obvious problem was that of the seemingly subversive use of constitutional liberties during a
                    government's fight for survival. Less obvious and largely ignored was the question of how
                    dissenters reacted to the Lincoln administration's concept of the powers and role of
                    Federal government: both the decision in favor of a war to force Union and also by the powers
                    developed to prosecute that war. Early historians usually just assumed answers to these difficult
                    questions rather than investigating what actually happened.</p>
            <p>James Ford Rhodes is a case in point. This great nationalist historian found war resistance to be a
                    tricky challenge to his twin deities of national destiny and the Constitution. On the one hand, a
                    serious antiwar movement would have shaken his thesis of consensus for the Union cause in the North.
                    On the other hand, had there existed no threat to the northern cause from within, it would have been
                    hard to explain Lincoln's use of extraconstitutional power to suppress dissent.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Rhodes' solution was to stress the seeming threat of disaffection
                    while denying the seriousness of its presence, and to show that Lincoln stretched the Constitution
                    only when he thought that it was in the interest of saving the Union. Though he admitted that

                    not a vestige of legal standing" and that "the commutation of the President was
                    likewise vitiated in law," Rhodes nonetheless stressed mitigating circumstances for these
                    actions. He impressed upon the reader that it would be "well to remember" that
                    Lincoln "came to the consideration of the Vallandigham case oppressed with the anxiety at
                    the terrible defeat of the Army of the Potomac at Chancellorsville."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One need not condemn Rhodes for such pragmatic historical judgment. A government is expected to
                    defend itself in times of crisis. But Rhodes was so caught up in his vision of what America was to
                    become after the war that he gave no notice to the dissenters' vision of the
                    "Union as it was," a conservative conception of what American life should have
                    been. He failed to explore fully the impact of the Civil War for a significant segment of the
                    northern populus.</p>
            <p>When Rhodes eventually gave pragmatic approval to the suppression of dissent, it was only after
                    gravely questioning its legal implications. With the coming of the First World War, a number of
                    historians developed a view of Civil War dissent so hostile as to ignore the issue of civil
                    liberties. Scholars such as William A. Dunning and Elbert J. Benton fell victim to the same wartime
                    fears which transformed sauerkraut into victory cabbage. Dunning compared Wood-row Wilson's
                    and Lincoln's methods for dealing with "subversives," using efficiency
                    and adequate legislation as his main standards. Lincoln and the war governors, without the Espionage
                    and Sedition Acts of 1917 and 1918 as aids, had to suppress dangerous elements through makeshift
                    executive power and without clear sanction or precedent. Wilson, on the other hand, had adequate
                    power through legislation and therefore could suppress dissent within "an abiding reign of
                        law."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> This argument stressed legal positivism at the expense of

            <p>The spirit of the First World War did not pervade all Copperhead scholarship. One of the pioneer
                    monographs in the field, Mayo Fesler's "Secret Political Societies in the North
                    during the Civil War," argued more in the tone of Rhodes when it concluded that dissenters
                    failed to "distinguish between partisan politics in time of peace and in time of
                    war." Fesler discounted, as did Rhodes, any real danger of widespread subversion.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> At the same time, he was more realistic about Republican actions than Rhodes.
                    On the subject of Republican charges of treason Fesler asserted that "such statements had
                    more of vote-winning power than truth in them." As for the motivations of Peace Democrats,
                    he stressed partisanship and his judgment that the dissenters were from "the more ignorant
                    portion of the Democratic Party … "<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In later years general histories of the Civil War period have continued to deal with the two major
                    questions of the extent of danger from dissent and the propriety of Republican responses. James G.
                    Randall made a detailed study of civil liberties problems raised by the use of executive powers
                    during the war and concluded that Lincoln limited constitutional liberties only in order to insure
                    the preservation of the Union.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Yet Randall, like Rhodes and Fesler, thought
                    the dangers of internal dissent were magnified out of proportion to reality in the heat of politics
                    and war. In his <hi rend="i">Civil War and Reconstruction</hi>, he stated that "careful
                    historians do not accept the view that … [the Copperheads] were a dangerous organization
                    of a thoroughly treasonable nature."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Allan Nevins, in <hi rend="i">War for the Union</hi>, presented similar views in relation to dissent.
                    Nevins questioned the constitutionality of Vallandigham's arrest but also appreciated the
                    circumstances under which Lincoln had to act. He emphasized that the President's duty was
                    "to think first and foremost of the nation's safety … "<hi rend="sup">12</hi> At the same time Nevins discounted any real danger from war dissenters:

                            could find no real leaders. Under these circumstances, sedition was like the ghost in

                    such as Dunning and Benton, they sensibly assessed the dissenters as being of little immediate
                    danger to the Union cause. They took a common-sense approach to constitutional liberties in time of
                    war by arguing that infringements seemed justifiable in the context of a war for the
                    Union's existence. Yet none of these historians looked very hard at the thoughts and
                    motivations of the dissenters themselves. Most dissent was seen as a product of Democratic
                    partisanship, cowardice, or prosouthern attitudes.</p>
            <p>When one raises questions as to the motives of the antiwar elements and the significance of their
                    social, political, and economic outlook in a broader view of American history, regional and state
                    studies of the Civil War era have proved most helpful. The authors of these works usually asked not
                    only how but also why the antiwar movement attempted to counter war policies. Copperheadism was
                    explained not only in terms of selfish partisanship and cowardice, but in addition as a product of
                    economic interest, racial fears, and western sectional identity. Thus dissent could be viewed in
                    terms of American life before and after the war.</p>
            <p>Not all state and regional studies followed this approach. Works by Arthur C. Cole and William Dudley
                    Foulke, for instance, reviewed the same questions as Rhodes, Fesler, and Nevins. <hi rend="i">Era of
                        the Civil War</hi>, Cole's history of Illinois, written during the First World War,
                    often spoke harshly of the dissenters. The author attributed antiwar activities almost solely to
                    prosouthern sentiment which was "often translated into action, varying from cheers for
                    Jefferson Davis to active aid for the rebel cause."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Though Cole
                    himself had some question about the wisdom of suppression, he found sincere fear to be behind
                    arbitrary arrests and the destruction of presses: "The justification for drastic action by
                    individuals or by government authorities was found in the so-called ‘crimes of the
                    copperheads,’ which terrorized not only individuals but whole communities. They were so
                    numerous and varied that there was a fearful uncertainty as to when and how the copperheads might
                    next strike."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>William Dudley Foulke, in his influential writings on Indiana war governor Oliver P. Morton,
                    approached antiwar activities with a mixture of acceptance of their dangerous nature and outright
                    ridicule. In dealing with the largely mythical "Northwest Conspiracy" Foulke
                    accepted every damaging bit of evidence to show the dangerous intentions of the Sons of Liberty, an

                        Older Middle West</hi> he argued that midwestern Democrats were zealously prowestern and were
                    attempting to guard their way of life from both eastern and southern incursions.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Hubbart attributed a distinct ideology to the western Democracy and those who would become
                    dissenters: they "championed a western version of the rights of man, of Jeffersonian
                    liberty, and agrarianism and of the right of revolution."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                    Accordingly, Copperheadism "appeared to be the manner in which thwarted Westerners showed
                    their sectional discontent."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Though Republicans attempted to use
                    western sectionalism as an issue before and during the war, they were seriously hindered by the
                    strong identity that Republicanism had with eastern economic interests and New England
                        abolitionism.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>In the field of economic history, regional scholars also showed that those who urged peace did not do
                    so because they were especially dependent on the South for economic well being; rather it was
                    because the West played an important role in the economic life of both South and East, and the war
                    temporarily made that position impossible. Albert L. Kohlmeier's <hi rend="i">The Old
                        Northwest as the Keystone of the Arch of American Federal Union</hi> carefully documented what
                    the title stated—that midwesterners had a vital interest in keeping the Union together.
                    Unfortunately Kohlmeier's study did not include an explanation as to why Democrats and
                    Republicans envisioned such different paths toward Union. He did, however, establish that a western

            <p>Another midwestern scholar, Charles R. Wilson, considered particularly the charges of prosouthern
                    economic motives in antiwar sentiment.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Wilson argued that expanding industry
                    and increased trade with the East suggested that assumptions as to Cincinnati's prosouthern
                    sympathies were "largely legendary."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> According to Wilson it
                    was true that much western trade did go south, but the fact that the West traded with both regions
                    and manufactured as well allowed it to be independent: "Actually, then, no colorless
                    subserviency to the South characterized pre-war Cincinnati. It spoke for itself, and it spoke in
                    terms of a driving, booming, independent westernism which wore no man's

            <p>Departing from economic history, a recent work by V. Jacque Voegeli, <hi rend="i">Free but Not
                    Equal</hi>, discussed the prevalent racism of the Midwest during the Civil War and related it both
                    to Republican and Democratic politics. Voegeli stressed the Negrophobic elements of Democratic
                    campaigns and opposition to the war after the Emancipation Proclamation, but he also showed that
                    racism was not limited to the Democrats. <hi rend="i">Free but Not Equal</hi> thus reinforced the
                    importance of western sectionalism in a rather odd way: Voegeli showed that while both parties had
                    strains of Negrophobia, only the Democrats could take full advantage of midwestern racism because
                    the local Republicans were tied to their eastern brethren who included a radical fringe. If
                    Republicans wished to exploit midwesterner's racial attitudes, they had to do more than
                    make defensive statements which explained away the abolitionist wing of the party. In a sense then,
                    Negrophobia's relation to dissent had to be read both as an independent force and as a
                    political tool to pin the abolitionist label on the Republican party.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                    period in Indiana, however, point to some of the achievements as well as the shortcomings of the
                    state studies which have appeared so far. James A. Woodburn's "Party Politics in
                    Indiana During the Civil War," one of the first serious looks at Civil War politics on a
                    local level since that war ended, contained a startling number of insights which would be exploited
                    in future years. Woodburn asserted at the outset that both parties professed and practiced loyalty
                    to the Union. In the case of the Democrats, this devotion sometimes took "a peculiar, even
                    a questionable turn." But Woodburn emphasized that the Democratic opposition to the war
                    opposed not the Union cause, but the kind of Union which they saw the Republicans building.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> According to Woodburn, antiabolitionist feelings, conservative
                    constitutionalism, and partisanship all played major roles in creating opposition to the Republican
                    administration's war policies. He saw all of these reasons as basically negative and
                    concluded that the Democrats had really no constructive critique of the crisis at hand.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Even so, his article gave more of an airing of Democratic views than most
                    other unfriendly studies.</p>
            <p>Written a number of years later, the second of Logan Esarey's two volume <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi> offered a similar but somewhat inconsistent view of antiwar activities
                    in that state. He began by generalizing that although resistance to the war effort existed in all
                    parts of the state, "the old Jacksonian Democracy stood firm for the Union." At
                    the same time he noted that "among the people of Indiana there was at all times
                    considerable opposition to the war." Esarey attributed most of this opposition to partisan
                    politics, thus indicting the Democrats whom he also called loyal.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> He then went
                    into a lengthy description of the marginal Knights of the Golden Circle and its secret plots as if
                    it were representative of dissent in general.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> With reference to the Knights
                    Esarey concluded that it was "doubtful if Governor Morton was ever seriously alarmed at
                    their plots and certainly history has paid the poltroons entirely too much attention."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

                    existence of illegal war resistance; he reaffirmed Woodburn's contention, however, that the
                    Democratic party was basically loyal.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> According to Stampp, what the Democrats
                    fought were the Republican war policies which attempted to change the basic social and economic
                    relationships existing before the war.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Emma Lou Thornbrough's <hi rend="i">Indiana in the Civil War Era</hi>, the most recent and
                    most comprehensive study to appear on the subject thus far, summed up the problems inherent in
                    dealing with Civil War dissenters. Miss Thornbrough pointed out the delicate .problem of deciding
                    whether the dissenters were indeed "disloyal" but came to no real conclusion on
                    the matter.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> The book excellently reviewed the accomplishments of past scholars
                    by describing all the reasons why different individuals and groups opposed either Governor Morton or
                    the war effort in general. Included were economic grievances, infringement on civil liberties,
                    Negrophobia, and the fear of New England dominance. Miss Thornbrough even put some stress on dissent
                    outside the normal political sphere.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But state studies, from Woodburn to Thornbrough, concentrated largely on dissent channeled through
                    the Democratic party. Some stressed the unreasoned partisanship of the Democratic side during
                    wartime, others the exaggerated charges of treason hurled by the Republicans. Much has thereby been
                    clarified as to the loyalty and actions of those Democratic politicians who voiced reservations
                    about Republican war policy. It has been made clear that a good deal of the dissenters'
                    political importance came through the use made of them by Republican politicians—both
                    during and after the war. But what of the antiwar sentiment expressed through the varied forms of
                    resistance to the draft? What of the strong disillusion with the Republican war policies which had
                    only partial expression through the election of 1862? And what of the worth of that "Union
                    as it was" which the dissenters mourned ? Little in the way of analysis of such points has
                    come from the largely politically oriented state studies.</p>
            <p>Answers to these questions would seem most likely to come from studies devoted primarily to the
                    dissenters themselves, but so far the results have been mixed. The first major work on the
                    dissenters, Wood Gray's <hi rend="i">Hidden Civil War</hi>, made some headway but was

                    toward his subject. Published just after Pearl Harbor, Hidden Civil War began with a lesson:
                    "In any future crisis this nation may almost certainly expect to be once more face to face
                    with some aspect of defeatism … A wise people learns from such experience."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Gray described the Copperhead defeatists as "narrow, clinging to
                    prejudice as though it were principle, capable of plausible but twisted logic
                        …"<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet to judge Gray's scholarship by such conclusions would be to distort and underrate his
                    contribution. In the pages between his virulent though informative introduction and his generally
                    hostile conclusion, he soberly discussed the roots of discontent with the war, the extent and
                    importance of Republican harrassment and suppression, and the significance of changes in northern
                    progress on the battlefield. He particularly pointed out the bitter reaction to emancipation
                    policies, noting that midwesterners feared that "the bars would be lowered for a horde of
                    Negroes to sweep into the section."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gray's harsh judgment of Copperhead defeatists thus tended to be modified by the evidence he
                    presented showing the stresses and suppression under which antiwar advocates lived. He reported

                    the case of Vallandigham, even exile from the North.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> It was this suppression,
                    Gray argued, that led to the formation of secret societies such as the Knights of the Golden Circle
                    and the Sons of Liberty. They were created "at first largely as a means of self-protection
                    and to some extent for revenge."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> To balance the picture he also
                    reported Democratic retaliation with mob action.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> But even after this
                    insightful and comprehensive look at antiwar sentiment Gray still felt the need to conclude that
                    "the great majority of the people, often misled and given to alternate excesses of optimism
                    and despair, were in the end willing to carry the war through to its close."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>As a revisionist Civil War historian, Milton found both Radical Republicans and Peace Democrats base
                    and cowardly. On the Republican side of the "Fifth Column" Charles Sumner and
                    Thaddeus Stevens were "as deeply committed to a secret revolution as they were to Federal
                    successes on the battlefield."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> On the Democratic side those who did
                    not fully stand by the Union insidiously plotted against the cause of the boys in blue. Thus Milton
                    treated Vallandigham's political career under the chapter heading "Anatomy of
                        Treason."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Fernando Wood, Peace Democrat and mayor of New York
                    "made a few statements of his veneration for the dear old flag," Milton snidely
                    noted, "and then began to fill his paper with innuendo and subversive
                        propaganda."<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The latest full scale study of the dissenters, Frank Klement's <hi rend="i">The Copperheads
                        in the Middle West</hi>, countered the kind of treatment Milton gave to the antiwar faction.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Klement did, in fact, produce a detailed study of dissent, taking the same
                    basic approach as the regional and state studies of the Civil War era. He saw men opposing the war
                    for economic reasons, for racist reasons, and for fear of eastern dominance.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
                    He made explicit one theme which had remained in the background, and its use was perhaps the chief
                    contribution of his work. This was the idea of the dissenter as arch-conservative: "In a
                    sense, those Democrats were conservatives; they thought that the wheel of revolution turned too far.
                    Their wartime slogan, ‘The Constitution as it is, the Union as it was,’ proved
                    that they looked toward the past and feared the changes which the war foisted upon the
                        country."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Yet Klement treated Copperhead and Peace Democrat as
                    synonyms, which of course was the way many of the Republicans had used the terms during the war
                    period. Klement showed the Copperheads not to be treasonous at all because the Peace Democrats were
                    not treasonous. The group of extrapolitical war resisters who interfered with war plans by fighting
                    the draft, for instance, found no place in Klement's consideration of the Copperheads.

            </p>
            <p>Instead of dealing with the real war resistance, Klement fell back to correcting the age old slander
                    of Democrats. He saw the process of revision in two steps. First of all, he stated, the historical
                    literature "still viewed … [them] as men whose hearts were black, whose blood
                    was yellow, and whose minds were blank."<hi rend="sup">52</hi> His task was to reveal that
                    the Copperheads were really "human beings—motivated by the same wants and
                    emotions that have been possessed by people throughout the ages …"<hi rend="sup">53</hi> It must be noted at this point that one of Klement's predecessors, Gray, made
                    almost exactly the same remark in <hi rend="i">The Hidden Civil War:</hi> "All opponents of
                    the war had at least one thing in common: they were human beings acting from human
                        motives."<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After establishing that the Copperheads were human beings, Klement completed his revision by linking
                    Copperheadism with both protoagrarian and backward looking Jacksonian ideals.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
                    Thus Klement's contribution turned out to be an extended monograph continually exploiting
                    links between anti-Republican sentiment and agrarian Jacksonianism, and filling in interesting
                    details on various dissenters, while claiming to do much more. Klement himself never tried to put
                    his own research into any historiographical context. He pointed with pride to the fact that
                    "readers who check the footnotes will notice that this study is based, practically in
                    entirety, upon primary sources";<hi rend="sup">56</hi> left unanswered was the extent to
                    which Klement has brought new understanding to the Civil War peace movement.</p>
            <p>An affirmation of the Klement approach can be found in Richard Curry's "The Union
                    As It Was: A Critique of Recent Interpretations of the
                    ‘Copperheads.’" Curry dismissed charges of resistance and disloyalty
                    in the same way as Klement. But whereas Klement only alluded to the previous historical treatment of
                    the antiwar movement, Curry specifically analyzed the literature. His synthetic categories and
                    distortions pointed out the essential evasion of his position.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Curry began, as did Klement, by stating that Copperheadism had been a blind spot of hysteria for the
                    modern historian and that some <list type="footnotes">

                    "devil theory of politics and history …"<hi rend="sup">58</hi> On this
                    basis Curry set up two schools of Copperhead historians, the traditionalists and the revisionists.
                    The traditionalists supposedly restated the case of the "Radical Republicans against their
                    conservative antagonists."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> The revisionists, however,
                    "reject[ed] the idea of conspiracy, treason, or treasonable intent on the part of
                    significant numbers of northern Democrats."<hi rend="sup">60</hi> The revisionists
                    obviously carried the day in Curry's view, and the essay then went on to treat issues
                    debated among the revisionists themselves. Differences of opinion on the Granger-Copperhead
                    connection, economic and demographic factors, and other topics were well treated in the remainder of
                    the article.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Curry's treatment of the disloyalty problem, however, was both brief and misleading. In the
                    traditionalist group were bunched Gray and Milton,<hi rend="sup">62</hi> who supposedly both took a
                    dim view of their Copperhead subjects. But the appraisals Gray and Milton gave the Copperhead
                    phenomenon varied so widely that it would hardly be justifiable to put them in the same analytical
                    group. Gray saw Copperheadism as a mass socio-psychological <hi rend="i">malaise</hi>, whereas
                    Milton couched his argument in epithets such as coward or traitor and only dealt with a small number
                    of people. In any case, it would certainly be unfair to make the revisionist Milton a spiritual heir
                    of the Radical Republicans he so abhorred.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, Curry went on to use Gray's <hi rend="i">Hidden Civil War</hi> as the exemplar
                    of traditionalist prejudices and exaggerations about the Copperhead threat. But it was Curry who
                    exaggerated to make his point. For example, he paraphrased and quoted Gray to the effect that after
                    Vallandigham lost the 1863 election for governor of Ohio, "<hi rend="i">many Peace
                        Democrats</hi> at last became convinced that ‘they must resort to revolution if they
                    were to succeed in realizing their aims.’ "<hi rend="sup">63</hi> If Gray had
                    actually made such a statement, it would have indeed been an exaggeration of the small popular
                    interest in actual revolution. In fact, Gray's words were: "<hi rend="i">Certain
                        of the peace Democrats</hi>
                    <list type="footnotes">

                            cited works of Gray and Milton, numerous works on eastern dissent, and some minor articles

                            other interesting articles such as Robert Rutland, "The Copperheads of Iowa: A
                            Re-Examination," <hi rend="i">Iowa Journal of History</hi>, LII (January, 1954),

                            and Milton with Radical Republicans. A typical Radical Republican work for comparison with

                    joined the secret societies ignorant of any revolutionary plans and "merely as a party

            </p>
            <p>In addition to exaggerating Gray's view of the Copperheads to fit into the traditionalist
                    category, Curry rejected too easily Gray's proof of conspiracy and war resistance. Curry
                    dismissed the accounts of the Northwest Conspiracy written by ex-Confederate agents assigned to help
                    in the plot as revealing "little." Other proof of lesser activities were consigned
                    to the realm of "bitter partisanship and war hysteria in the North."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Thus Curry set the stage for the revisionist rescue of historical sanity through the
                    works of Stampp, Klement, and Curry himself.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the heart of the Klement-Curry position was a narrow definition of the term Copperhead. The
                    revisionists, as Cyrry called the group to which he adhered, correctly noted that the word was a
                    Republican epithet for Democrats unwilling to endorse the war effort without reservation. They then
                    proceeded to show that though these Democrats opposed the Republicans politically on a number of
                    issues, including the best way to prosecute the war and gain peace, most Democrats protested within
                    the normal political process and could not be called traitors or disloyalists. The focus for further
                    study became the Democratic party. Thus Curry recommended more work in the nature of
                    "political party structure" and in comparative study of the ideological concerns
                    of "Conservative Unionism" in the several states and regions.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such study might be very rewarding in its own right, but it begs the real question of dissent by
                    focusing research on a political party which was essentially loyal and which acted through normal
                    political channels. The platform and campaign rhetoric of the Democratic party, the lives of its
                    leading spokesmen, and the record of Democratic legislators can only act as guides to the study of
                    Civil War dissent. It was the Democratic party which exploited the vote getting power of the
                    dissenter's fears and grievances, but it was not the party which extended the battle beyond
                    legal limits. By limiting study to the Democracy, therefore, one could falsely conclude that such

                            term Copperhead and giving it one meaning—conservative social thought rather than

                    conscription acts only found expression in electoral politics.</p>
            <p>Yet men resisted the draft, assaulted recruiting officers, collaborated with the enemy, formed secret
                    societies to combat the government, and otherwise opposed the war actively but outside the law. The
                    scale of such actions indicated a breakdown in the political system unequalled in its time except by
                    southern secession itself. The focus of study, therefore, should be shifted from that of political
                    parties to the reasons for and process by which the Democratic party became incapable of satisfying
                    the needs of its natural constituents. It is not surprising that Democratic spokesmen voiced some of
                    the discontents which led to an antiwar position. What the historian must find is why some men
                    crossed the line from politics to resistance.</p>
            <p>One can begin to find an answer in the issues raised by such extreme Peace Democrats as Jesse D.
                    Bright and Clement L. Vallandigham. Most of these issues had a common denominator—fear.
                    Fear of the Negro, fear of the New England abolitionist and industrialist, and fear of tyranny led
                    the arguments against Republicanism. Of course fear need not bring on extralegal political behavior.
                    Such arguments did not have that result in the West before the war began. Yet by framing political
                    issues in hyperbolic tones of a struggle for existence, the Democratic party paved the way for a
                    rather apocalyptic understanding of what transpired during the war.</p>
            <p>The relation of this understanding and dissent can only be hypothesized, but perhaps the hypothesis
                    can be tested in the interests of further study of dissent. Democratic politicians had warned the
                    citizenry of catastrophe in the case of Republican rule through the issues of race, tyranny, war,
                    and sectional hegemony. Experience is usually understood in learned categories, and the antiwar
                    minded individual could certainly understand some very important events through those categories
                    exploited by the Democratic party. The Emancipation Proclamation made Republican denials of
                    abolitionism beside the point. Republican tyranny seemed to manifest itself in the draft, in the
                    gerrymandering of Vallandigham's district and his eventual arrest and exile, in the
                    highhanded tactics of Indiana's Governor Oliver P. Morton, and in countless mob actions
                    designed to stifle dissent.</p>
            <p>The contemplation of this situation led some from voting to direct action as a means of protest. What
                    had begun as a war for the Union had become a war for the Negro and for the attainment of Republican
                    dictatorship. Very traditional people, witnessing their prejudices and liberties falling prey to the
                    Republican beast, moved to the extreme of resistance as a last measure in what seemed to be a lost
                    cause.</p>
            <p>Such an interpretation may seem extreme, and it may be just <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-066-1-059"/> that.
                    Research is needed to test the validity of this and other approaches to those who broke the law in
                    their pursuit of political success or revenge. Considering the return to order which followed the
                    Civil War, it might be hard to imagine a time when some envisioned an end to democratic government
                    and lily white supremacy in the United States. Though we may not be sympathetic to all the norms
                    upon which that vision was based, it would be unfair to write our history without understanding the
                    point of view of those who have had few friends in the historical profession.</p>

            <p>Following congressional rejection of the Texas annexation treaty in the spring of 1844, the question
                    of the accession of Texas became one of many campaign issues, and arguments pro and con were
                    absorbed into the rhetoric of the quadrennial presidential race. Annexation proposals prior to the
                    presentation of the Tyler treaty in April, 1844, and the responses to them, however, form a unity
                    which merit examination apart from the events surrounding and subsequent to the treaty itself.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This study of these prior proposals is limited geographically to four states
                    of the Old Northwest: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan. Chronologically, it covers the period
                    1836 to April, 1844, from President Andrew Jackson's first attempt to acquire Texas to
                    President John Tyler's presentation to the United States Senate of a formal treaty.
                    Topically, it focuses upon Whig reactions in these states and the rhetoric and actions as expressed
                    by their journalists, members of state legislatures, and congressmen. The first section of this
                    study treats of annexation attempts prior to January, 1838, when South Carolina Democratic Senator
                    William Preston presented an annexation resolution to the Senate. Then reactions to the Preston
                    resolution in the Old Northwest, culminating in the Senate vote on Preston's measure, which
                    was taken in June, 1838, are discussed. Lastly, renewed agitation in the early 18409, following a
                    hiatus of such activity from 1838 to 1842, is studied with a view to seeing what form antiannexation
                    activity took from 1842 until the spring of 1844, and how Whigs of the Old Northwest tended to align
                    themselves on the question.</p>
            <p>Except in Ohio and to a lesser extent in Michigan, journalists and politicians of the Old Northwest
                    did not join the debate over Texas annexation until the early 1840s. The <hi rend="i">Ohio State
                        Journal</hi>, a Whig organ at Columbus, admitted as early as 1829 that the acquisition of the
                    territory would be very popular in Ohio. Though the editor rabidly dissented with this viewpoint, he
                    attributed such sentiment to fear that Texas might "soon pass into other hands either by
                    treaty or <list type="footnotes">

                    early 1837 many Ohioans wanted Texas to be an independent republic and even petitioned the national
                    government to extend it diplomatic recognition.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> But by 1837 many from both
                    parties began to question the advisability of extending such recognition unless Texas should first
                    outlaw slavery.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Ohio Whig journalists based their objections on partisan and antislavery principles. One Whig
                    editor predicted the "dissolution of the Union" if Texas were admitted because the
                    free states would never consent "to be delivered over to the absolute control of the slave
                        states."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Another, also mindful of the political ramifications,
                    denounced annexation on the ground that the admission of Texas into the Union would throw the
                    balance of power into the hands of the South and "forever destroy the political importance
                    of the free states." He added, almost as an afterthought, that the territory of the United
                    States was already sufficiently extensive and that every addition increased the diversity of
                    interests and the probability of disunion.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sentiment among Ohioans during the late 1830s was expressed most strongly in the state legislature,
                    which was flooded with petitions against the acquisition of Texas. In late 1837 Whig Otway Curry
                    presented a resolution to the lower house of the legislature which stated that annexation would
                    "certainly and naturally tend to weaken and destroy those bonds of union by which our
                    already Colossal Confederacy" was preserved. Thus, Ohio's senators and
                    representatives in Congress ought to be requested "at all times, and under all
                    circumstances" to oppose it. This was twice tabled without coming to a vote.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On January 5, 1838, Benjamin F. Wade, a caustic antislavery Whig who would soon gain national
                    prominence, presented an anti-annexation petition to the Ohio Senate. A week later he again voiced
                    his strong opposition and condemned Texas because of its "foul blot of
                        slavery."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> At the same time several members of the lower house
                    introduced similar petitions.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> State Senator Thomas C. Vincent, a Democrat,
                    shortly afterward called for a "legislative protest" against annexation.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> A month later the legislature adopted a measure similar in content to
                    Vincent's. According to its preamble, this "protest" was a result of
                    popular feeling as expressed in numerous petitions to <list type="footnotes">

                    enthusiastically by a vote of 36 to 0, and the House, also Whig, concurred unanimously.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The strongly worded report which accompanied this resolution was approved by the Senate, but it did
                    not have the same success in the House. The report asserted that admitting Texas was neither
                    consistent with a just treatment of Mexico nor conducive to the safety and happiness of the United
                    States: "SO long as war is maintained by Mexico for the reconquest of Texas, it would not
                    comport with the honor of the United States to make any union with her revolted colonies."
                    The report repeated what was becoming a commonplace Whig argument, that the United States was
                    already large enough and that any increase in area would only augment the likelihood of foreign war.
                    Moreover, annexation would weaken the nation in case of a sea war and would drain off troops to
                    outlying areas, thus making it impossible to cope with warlike Indians. Conceding that Congress had
                    the constitutional authority to incorporate new states into the Union, the Senate document denied
                    Congress the right to admit foreign, independent nations.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although this report was rejected in the House,<hi rend="sup">13</hi> its arguments became part of
                    the creed of the opponents of annexation during the following decade. During the 1830s the
                    intellectual arsenal of these dissidents was being stocked, and this rejected document stands out as
                    one of the earliest, clearest expressions of ideas later held as the irreducible minimum of Whig
                    dogma in much of the nation.</p>
            <p>Agitation in Congress over Texas annexation stimulated scores of petitions in opposition, from Ohio
                    Whigs and Democrats alike.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The national legislature had long been bombarded
                    with antislavery petitions, but as the extension of slavery and annexation became identified, the
                    antislavery advocates began concentrating on Texas. In 1837 Whig Senator Thomas Ewing presented to
                    the upper house of Congress a memorial from his constituents inveighing against even recognizing
                    Texas as an independent republic until it abolished slavery.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> In the House of

            <p>There was far less concern expressed prior to 1838 over the admission of Texas in the rest of the Old
                    Northwest than in Ohio. In the closing days of 1836 Whig Assemblyman George H. Proffitt introduced
                    in the Indiana House a joint resolution against annexation. It was defeated when the Democrats voted
                    78 per cent against it, while the Whigs divided evenly. If the Whig majority had voted as a unit, it
                    would have passed; but partisan alignment on the issue was not solid at that time.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In the following year Whig Richard J. Hub-bard introduced a similar resolution in the lower
                    house of the Indiana General Assembly. Democrat Ebenezer M. Chamberlain attempted to soften the
                    measure by amending it to read "until Texas has established her peace." Whig
                    Thomas J. Evans argued in favor of the measure without the amendment, but Samuel Judah and Joseph G.
                    Marshall, fellow Whigs, fought against it. Reflecting the deep Whig division in Indiana, they
                    insisted that the whole affair was outside the jurisdiction of state legislatures. The resolution
                    was defeated 55 to 42.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>In their expression of antiannexation feeling through their national representatives, Hoosiers ran

                    upper house, presented one petition from his Hoosier constituents to the Senate against receiving
                    Texas into the Union.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Through Whig Representative James Rariden, a yearly

            <p>The acquisition of Texas did not come up in the Illinois Whig press or state legislature during the
                    period 1836-1838. And since there were no Whigs from Illinois in Congress until 1839, there was no
                    activity in this quarter.</p>
            <p>In Michigan the official Whig and Democratic organs were loyal to what were fast becoming the
                    national party lines on the subject. Early in the debate over annexation the Whig Detroit <hi rend="i">Advertiser</hi>, a strong opponent of annexation, was taken to task by the Detroit <hi rend="i">Free Press</hi>, a Democratic organ, for trying to persuade the legislature to adopt an
                    unfavorable position.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Like Illinois, Michigan had no Whigs in Congress until
                    1839. Some Michigan residents employed the services of Vermont Whig Heman Allen to place before the
                    House of Representatives their petitions against annexation.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The balance of
                    this state's anemic campaign was pressed by Democrat Isaac Crary.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On January 4, 1838, Senator Preston introduced his resolution calling for the
                    "reannexation" of Texas, as soon as it could be done "consistently with
                    the faith and treaty stipulations of the United States."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                    Preston's proposal caused a brief flurry of petitions in opposition from Ohioans. Less than
                    two weeks after the proposal was introduced, eight Whigs and five Democrats from Ohio presented an
                    antiannexation petition to the House of Representatives. Two months later a similar document was
                    offered by largely the same group of men.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> But the excitement did not last
                    long. Except for one other House petition, all the rest of the anti-Texas memorials from Ohio during
                    this time came from Democratic Senators William Allen and Thomas Morris.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hoosier agitation in Congress was limited to a few dissenting memorials placed before the House of
                    Representatives. All six Whigs in the Indiana delegation to Congress joined in submitting one of
                    these; unlike Ohio, no Democrats were involved. In early April, 1838, the last Hoosier protests
                    closed that state's activity.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Oliver H. Smith, still the only Whig
                    Senator from the Old Northwest, completely ignored the issue.</p>

            <p>The Whig press in Michigan did not respond to the Preston resolution, but the state's lower
                    house declared annexation dangerous to the Union. The measure adopted by the House instructed the
                    Michigan senators and representatives in Congress to vote against it if the matter ever came to a
                        vote.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> In March, 1838, the state Senate also passed a series of anti-Texas
                    resolutions, which were in turn adopted by the House.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Shortly afterward
                    Democratic Senator John Norvell presented these resolutions to the upper house of the national
                        Congress.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Later, the Whig editor of the Detroit <hi rend="i">Advertiser</hi> was pleased to report that in the congressional elections of 1838 both parties in
                    Michigan screened their candidates to insure that they were opposed to the annexation of Texas.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The mixed reaction to the Preston resolution in the nation as a whole was nowhere better illustrated
                    than in the United States Senate. On June 14 the Senate voted 24 to 14 to table the measure. This
                    vote reflected only slight partisan division, but a clear sectional pattern emerged. Six of the
                    seven states unanimously against annexation were free states; the seventh, Delaware, was a border
                    slave state. All five unanimous supporters were slave states, with only Missouri on the border.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Twenty-five per cent of the nation's senators abstained; by
                    percentage, twice as many were Whigs as were Democrats. Seventy-five per cent of the Whigs and sixty
                    per cent of the Democrats cast their ballots against the Preston resolution. At this time the Senate
                    delegation from the Old Northwest contained seven Democrats and one Whig. Five of the Democrats were
                    against the resolution, while the single Whig, Smith of Indiana, joined the other two Democrats in
                        abstaining.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the defeat of the Preston resolution, the argument over Texas annexation subsided throughout
                    the nation. Agitation further decreased following Secretary of State John Forsyth's second
                    rejection of the proposal and coincident with the accession to the Texas presidency of Mirabeau B.
                    Lamar, a confirmed opponent of annexation.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>There was little mention of the annexation of Texas in the nation's newspapers, state
                    legislatures, or congressional delegations for the four years following the defeat of the Preston
                    resolution; but the issue did not die completely, least of all in Ohio. The Whig editor of the
                    Cincinnati <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> lamented in June, 1838, that the "decisive vote of the
                    Senate" had not "closed the discussion in the House."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The defeat of the measure did not lure the Ohio opponents into abandoning their vigilance.
                    In January, 1839, citizens of Ashtabula County requested that their state legislature take a
                    definite stand against annexation.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> The following month, Whig Representative

            <p>Democratic Senator Thomas Morris addressed the Senate on February 9, 1839, on the contents of several
                    memorials expressing opposition to the admission of any territory which permitted slavery and signed
                    by constituents of both parties from Ohio as well as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, New York, and
                        Pennsylvania.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Texas was not mentioned directly in this speech, but it
                    showed that in the minds of many Ohians the question of Texas annexation was inseparably linked to
                    the extension of slavery.</p>
            <p>The Whig journalists and politicians of Indiana were almost silent on the controversial annexation
                    question immediately following the defeat of the Preston resolution, but the issue surfaced briefly
                    in Illinois. Democratic Assemblyman John Calhoun of Sangamon County presented a series of
                    resolutions—which came in response to proposals that the state legislature take a stand
                    against annexation—to the lower house of the General Assembly. Calhoun insisted that the
                    legislature not go on record with such a protest. His proposals were tabled twice without coming to
                    a vote, but the General Assembly did not make the anti-Texas, antislavery protest that he
                        opposed.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                    Houston to the presidency of Texas, the accession to office of two pro-Texas secretaries of state,
                    Abel P. Upshur and John C. Calhoun, and the presidency of John Tyler, who reportedly spoke often and
                    favorably of annexation.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Not until Texas suffered severe reverses in her war
                    with Mexico, in 1842, and not until rumors reached the Old Northwest that Tyler was planning to
                    annex Texas, did Whig editors in that section leap into action again.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The editor of the Columbus <hi rend="i">Ohio State Journal</hi> again led the Whig attack. He
                    sympathized with the Texas claim to independence, but wrote: "We do not want Texas, nor do
                    we want to extend the Union in any direction."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Recognizing the
                    partisan as well as the sectional aspects of the controversy, he explained that as a party the Whigs
                    were opposed to the acquisition of Texas. Since the territory of the United States was already too
                    extensive, he feared that "the days of the Republic" would be numbered by
                    increasing it even more. The editor further accused Tyler of trying to annex Texas in order to gain
                    southern support in the fast approaching presidential election and referred to his
                    "scheme" as a measure "fraught with evil aspects of the continuance and
                    tranquility of the Union."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> He said that annexation was nothing more
                    than a Tyler conspiracy to secure to the slaveholding South additional strength in the national
                    government. It was an "unhallowed plot" to destroy the political balance of the
                    Union and to subject the free states to the domination of slaveholders. "<hi rend="i">The
                        Union cannot and will not survive the annexation of Texas six months</hi>," he
                        predicted.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>Another Ohio Whig journalist condemned the New York <hi rend="i">Union</hi>, the Tyler organ, for its
                    illogical argument that self-preservation demanded annexation and compared Tyler's
                    negotiations with Texas to Burr's notorious conspiracy.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Thomas
                    Corwin, a powerful antislavery Whig of Ohio, agreed with the party organ that the area of the nation

                    any more territory.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> He viewed the project as a "darling

            <p>By early 1843 nearly all the Whigs in the Old Northwest had become confirmed opponents of Texas
                    annexation, and Joshua Reed Giddings of the Western Reserve had emerged as one of their leading
                    spokesmen. His views on the question were adopted in resolutions passed at a bipartisan, anti-Texas
                    meeting in Jefferson, Ohio, in the summer of 1843. Following this, the Whig editor Henry Fassett of
                    the Ashtabula <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> warned that the people of the free states did not
                    "sufficiently apprehend" the danger that was growing out of efforts of the slave
                    states to admit Texas.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> In a letter to the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>, written
                    the following spring, Giddings said that many members of Congress viewed the annexation of Texas as
                    tantamount to the dissolution of the Union.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In late 1843 the Whig journals of Ohio stepped up their attack against the admission of Texas. In a
                    lengthy editorial the editor of the Columbus <hi rend="i">Ohio State Journal</hi> reminded his
                    readers that the Constitution made no provision for the United States to hold foreign territory.
                    Still less did it provide for "incorporating foreign nations into our Union." He
                    repeated a favorite Whig theme, that the project would without a doubt "eventuate in
                    dissolution of the Union."<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Whig editor of the Cincinnati <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> became at this time one of the most rabid
                    antiannexation spokesmen of the Old Northwest. Recognizing the growing partisan alignment on the
                    question, he wrote, with some hyperbole: "The Whigs
                    unitedly—earnestly—in and out of Congress, have opposed this
                        annexation."<hi rend="sup">54</hi> He asserted confidently that nothing would come of
                    the activity to annex Texas.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> On March 22, exactly one month before Tyler
                    presented to the Senate a treaty to annex Texas to the United States as a territory that would
                    subsequently become a state, this editor condemned the acquisition of Texas on the grounds that it
                    would probably lead to war with Mexico, that it was contrary to the national interest, that it was
                    unconstitutional, and that it would establish the dangerous precedent of acquiring territory by
                        conquest.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> The Cincinnati <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> thereafter carried
                    almost daily editorials against annexation. It criticized President Tyler because he had
                    "by the wrong exercise of a doubtful constitutional power <hi rend="i">clandestinely</hi>
                    sought to accomplish an object against the spirit and honor of the Nation, against the peace and

            </p>
            <p>Between the years 1839 and 1843 there was some but not much concern in the state legislatures of the
                    Old Northwest over the controversy.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> This was especially true until December,
                    1843, when Whig Senator Abraham Van Vorhes of the Ohio legislature moved that his state formally
                    instruct its senators and representatives in Congress to oppose annexation. His resolution was
                    rejected, with all the Whigs supporting and all the Democrats opposing him.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
                    Offered as an amendment to a bill in no way related to the Texas issue, his resolution illustrated
                    the obstructionist tactics resorted to by the opposition.</p>
            <p>When ex-Governor Thomas W. Gilmer of Virginia published a letter in early 1843 favoring annexation,
                    Giddings and other anti-slavery congressmen decided to issue a public warning of the danger facing
                    the nation. Giddings' friend, Seth M. Gates, wrote a tract, which was then signed by
                    twenty-one members of Congress, denouncing the proposed acquisition of Texas as a scheme of
                    slaveholders executed in order that "<hi rend="i">the undue ascendancy of the sluve-holding
                        power in the government</hi>" should be "<hi rend="i">secured and rivetted
                        beyond all redemption.</hi>" Those who signed the tract accused slaveholders of
                    migrating to Texas in order to foment revolution and maintained that annexation was merely the last
                    stage of their conspiracy, which had two objects: "<hi rend="i">The perpetuation of slavery
                        and the continued ascendancy of the slave power.</hi>" The acquisition of Texas would
                    be of no advantage to the United States; it was unconstitutional and would lead to the dissolution
                    of the Union. The signers advised the citizens of the free states to reject it; otherwise, they
                    would be accessories to a criminal act—the "<hi rend="i">irremediable
                        perpetuation</hi> OF AN INSTITUTION … regarded as an evil and a curse."<hi rend="sup">60</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Congress convened in December, 1843, the antislavery forces intensified their agitation, which
                    reached the boiling point in the early months of 1844.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> On January 22, 1844,
                    Giddings presented a protest petition from his home state and one from New York asserting that if
                    Texas were allowed to join the United States, the Empire State should unite with Canada.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> Giddings introduced a hitherto unmentioned element in the Texas battle.

                    a stand on the controversy and virtually ignored the issue until the early 1840s, after which its
                    editor quoted a number of editorials from other papers without commenting on them. In the fall of
                    1843, for example, he quoted the South Bend <hi rend="i">Free Press</hi>, which stated, with only

                    concluded with the words: "The only desire which I feel in connection with the future is
                    and will continue to be to leave the country prosperous and its institutions unimpaired."67
                    The Indiana editor suggested that if Tyler had followed the words "leave the
                    country" with "and I'll go to Texas," millions of his fellow
                    citizens would have rejoiced, and tens of thousands would not have cared at all.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

            <p>Though Indiana Whigs opposed annexation, few felt the urgency that consumed their Ohio brethren. In
                    March, 1844, one Hoosier Whig, Calvin Fletcher, an early Indiana settler and a leading citizen of
                    Indianapolis, admitted in his diary: "Texas annexation gives me some gloomy
                    apprehension." A week later he wrote: "The subject … makes some stir
                    among the people in various states but great apathy prevails here.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> (This

                    himself to make on the matter was that it was clear that the United States would not accept the

            <p>In December, 1843, Whig James A. Foley introduced into the Indiana lower house a joint resolution
                    against the annexation of Texas. When Democrat Willis A. Gorman moved for rejection, the Democratic
                    House gave him its overwhelming support by a sharply partisan vote. The Whigs voted 87 per cent
                    against, while the more numerous Democrats prevailed with their 85.5 per cent support. Five Whigs
                    and six Democrats crossed party lines, while only one Whig and two Democrats failed to vote.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout the late 1830s and early 1840s Illinois Whig journalists and politicians showed very
                    little concern over the Texas question. The Illinois Whig press was late in assuming a consistent
                    anti-annexation policy. When the strongly partisan Alton <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> printed six
                    principles of political faith drawn up by Illinois Whigs as they looked ahead to the election of
                    1844, neither the politicos nor this Whig journalist mentioned Texas.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> By
                    December, 1843, this editor was willing to take a strong stand against annexation, but in the same
                    month a local Whig convention called to define party policies failed to mention the subject.<hi rend="sup">73</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much of the independent press in Illinois was more hostile before the introduction of
                    Tyler's treaty than was the regular Whig press. The Jacksonville <hi rend="i">Illinois
                        Statesman</hi>, for example, agreed with much of the Whig press elsewhere that the nation was
                    already large enough.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> Another independent editor, parroting the Whig party
                    line, predicted that annexation would result in war with Mexico or even disunion.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> Others contented themselves with the old objection that the area of slavery would be
                        extended.<hi rend="sup">76</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Illinois Whigs ignored the issue even when there were excellent opportunities to speak out. In late
                    1843, for example, several local Whig conventions in Illinois gave the Whigs of that state an
                    occasion for rapping Tyler's policies in general and annexation in particular. The
                    delegates to the state convention in Chicago which endorsed Henry Clay and John Davis of
                    Massachusetts as presidential and vice presidential candidates passed eleven resolutions expressing

            </p>
            <p>There was very little activity in the Illinois legislature prior to the presentation of the Tyler
                    treaty. Early in 1843 Robert W. Glass, Whig assemblyman of Macoupin County, introduced into the
                    lower house a favorable resolution which was consigned to the limbo of the committee on counties.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> This was the extent of the controversy in the Illinois legislature, but the
                    paucity of activity at this level did not reflect a lack of anti-Texas feeling in the state as a
                    whole. Most northern Illinois Whigs were opposed, but others broke with their party and supported
                    the measure out of fear that if the United States did not annex Texas, England would.<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principal Whig paper in Michigan remained in firm opposition to annexation. The editor of the
                    Detroit <hi rend="i">Advertiser</hi> objected to the inevitable extension of slavery that would
                    follow, condemned annexation as unconstitutional, and expressed fear that southern dominance in
                    Congress would make the North a "hewer of wood and a drawer of water for the
                        South."<hi rend="sup">80</hi> It was a political matter, he warned, and unscrupulous
                    Democrats would spare nothing to retain political power; they would use threats, promises, and money
                    to overawe the voters.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, objection to the acquisition of Texas in the Old Northwest prior to 1842 was largely
                    bipartisan and was based primarily upon antislavery principles, though the argument that the United
                    States should not become too large was gaining currency. Ohio led the region in opposing annexation
                    as well as in antislavery sentiment. Indiana and Illinois showed less concern with the issue, while
                    Michigan tended to follow Ohio in both opinions.</p>
            <p>Definite signs of political division, however, were seen in the Old Northwest very early, especially
                    in Ohio. This emergence of partisan alignment, though never clear cut during the years 1836-1842,
                    was reflected in the vote on the Preston annexation resolution of 1838. In the Old Northwest the
                    Whigs were generally against annexation, but so were many Democrats, out of fear that this measure
                    would extend the area of slavery or give the South the preponderance of political power in Congress.
                    In objecting on the ground that the nation was already large enough, the Whigs were most
                    inconsistent, since they fought alongside Democrats for the acquisition of Oregon while at <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Whigs of the North and Old Northwest were not alone in opposing Texas annexation; as the price of
                    party division on so vital an issue became apparent to southern Whigs, many of them also moved to
                    the opposition. Their action was almost entirely partisan.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> Some gladly
                    rejected "immediate annexation" in the spring of 1844 just to defeat it as a
                    Tyler-Calhoun measure.<hi rend="sup">84</hi> Others no doubt realized as did Henry Clay that if the
                    issue were to drive antislavery Whigs into the Liberty party, the Whig party would be destroyed.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> Loyal Whigs everywhere must have known, too, that if Texas joined the Union
                    it would be as a Democratic state.</p>
            <p>The Texas issue forced partisans from different sections to re-evaluate their political stands. It
                    was a time for taking political and sectional stock, a prelude to realignment. And the Old
                    Northwest, with its varied pioneer backgrounds, evenly balanced political divisions, proslavery and
                    antislavery elements, and pro-Texas and anti-Texas partisans, did not reflect a section united on
                    the major issues of the day.</p>

            <p>All nominations must be made on the "Awards Nomination Form" and <hi rend="i">postmarked by not later than May 15, 1970.</hi> Each nominator must include a supporting letter
                    which is explicit in indicating why the award or certificate seems merited. Each nominator is also
                    responsible for making certain that at least two or three other persons send similar statements <hi rend="i">directly to the state chairman.</hi> Finally, each nominator should send relevant
                    supporting material such as pamphlets, newspaper clippings, programs, scripts, and books. The views
                    and evaluations of various persons will be considered regarding each nomination.</p>

               <hi rend="sup">1</hi>. <hi rend="i">Certificate of Commendation.</hi> The Certificate of Commendation
                    is given for outstanding achievement by an individual or an or ganization in the field of state,
                    provincial, and local history, but with that achievement judged in the light of local limiting
                    circumstances rather than on a basis of overall excellence in the United States and Canada as a
                    whole. This is an award of encouragement and commendation to a person or group which by great effort
                    has accomplished something that is really outstanding within its own area. The certificate is a pat
                    on the back and says to the individual or or ganization that receives it: "We think you are
                    doing a wonderful job in your area, and we want to recognize you for it."</p>
            <p>2. <hi rend="i">The Award of Merit.</hi> This was the original award of the American Association for
                    State and Local History and is still the back bone of its competition. It is given for excellence of
                    accomplishment or program in the field of state, provincial, and local history and is in no way
                    judged relative to local limiting circumstances. The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as
                    saying to everyone: "This is public acknowledgement by the American Association for State
                    and Local History that this accomplishment or this program, in comparison with all similar
                    accomplishments and programs in North America, deserves the adjective excellent."</p>

               <hi rend="i">Benjamin Harrison, Hoosier President: The White House and After.</hi> Volume III. By
                    Harry J. Sievers. (Indianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc., 1968. Pp. xviii, 319. Notes,
                    illustrations, bibliography, index. $10.00.)</head>
            <p>This volume is the last in a three part series tracing the life of Benjamin Harrison, the
                    twenty-third President of the United States. After rereading the first two, covering the period from
                    1833 to 1888, this reviewer feels that this final volume is much superior. It is quite readable
                    although there seems to be an excessive amount of insignificant detail, such as the statement on
                    page 85 that Harrison's discovery of a "four leaved clover" brought him
                    no luck, and the one on page 51 giving the names of Harrison's four horses! A biographer
                    should know what to leave out, as well as what to include.</p>
            <p>Harrison, the only Hoosier to occupy the White House (although he was not born in Indiana), was known
                    as the Centennial President because his administration coincided with the one hundredth anniversary
                    of the establishment of the federal government. James G. Blaine was perhaps the leader of the
                    Republican party at this time, but Harrison was his own boss and refused to give the party managers
                    any say in his appointments to the Cabinet. He alienated Matt Quay and would not be governed by
                    machine politics, although some may differ with Father Sievers' conclusion that
                    "It was as if Harrison was a forerunner of Silent Cal" (p. 43). Harrison was
                    opposed to the spoils system, but Sievers seems to contradict Harold U. Faulkner, who declared that
                    Harrison found congenial the task "of finding jobs for loyal Republicans" (p. 73).
                    The relations between Harrison and Theodore Roosevelt were not always congenial, according to
                    Sievers, even though each man thought of himself as the popular leader. Sievers gives a good
                    analysis of the 1892 election.</p>
            <p>Harrison's post-White House years, including his second marriage in 1896 and the subsequent
                    birth of a daughter, one of the few children born to an ex-President, are interesting sidelights.
                    But even the most loyal Hoosier may have some difficulty accepting Sievers' conclusion:
                    "The Centennial President of the United States, when judged in comparison with Andrew
                    Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, not to mention more recent leaders in the
                    White House, seems to emerge greater as a man than as a president" (p. 277).</p>
            <p>Sievers has done a good job in documentation. The twenty-one chapters with their interesting headings
                    contain about one thousand footnotes placed at the bottoms of the pages. There is an extensive
                    bibliography of thirteen pages, containing an impressive listing of <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-066-1-077"/> manuscript sources, newspapers, and published material. Five
                    unpublished doctoral dissertations are cited. The index, filling twenty-four pages, is adequate. The
                    author has devoted eight pages to acknowledgement of his indebtedness. There are forty-six
                    illustrations which are placed in the middle of the book. They depict various scenes in the life of
                    Harrison, his family, and contemporaries. The end papers are advertisements from the Indianapolis
                        <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> (Supplement Issued as a Souvenir of the Inauguration of President
                    Harrison, March 4, 1889).</p>
            <p>There is little new material found in the book. Obviously it was written to appeal more to the layman
                    than to the serious student of history. No doubt some Hoosiers would regret that Caroline Scott
                    Harrison is cited only twice as many times as the second Mrs. Harrison. After all, Caroline Scott
                    was Harrison's partner during most of his adult life. Perhaps she, much more than Mary Lord
                    Dimmick, had a powerful influence on the Hoosier President.</p>

                    L. Miller. <hi rend="i">Urban Life in America</hi> Series. Edited by Richard C. Wade. (New York:
                    Oxford University Press, 1968. Pp. xii, 301. Tables, maps, note on sources, notes, index.
                    $7.50.)</head>
            <p>This book by Professor Miller of the University of Cincinnati is more than a study in local politics.
                    It is a study of the problems cities faced in the late nineteenth century when the revolution in
                    urban transportation brought an end to the "walking city." The explosion of the
                    physical proportions of the city made it a sprawling metropolis, ever increasing in population. Land
                    use became more specialized, sorting out people and businesses according to taste and resources.</p>
            <p>In Cincinnati a residential pattern developed similar to that found in most American cities. The
                    inner city or Circle held the poor, usually newcomers; the outer edges or Hilltops, the upper middle
                    class, mainly white Anglo Saxon Protestants and German Jews; and between the two areas, the Zone of
                    Emergence, second or third generation urban dwellers who were on the rise economically. Miller
                    suggests that residence rather than race, religion, or ethnic background reflected the
                    city's social and political experience. And politics mirrored the conflicts created by
                    urban expansion.</p>
            <p>Conflict and disorder, as well as change in residential patterns, followed the coming of the modern
                    city. Urban expansion made virtually every municipal institution and service obsolete. The police
                    force was ineffective in protecting lives and property of the residents. <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-066-1-078"/> Hilltop and Zone residents demanded city services. The school system
                    nearly collapsed. This chaos climaxed in 1884 with the courthouse riot, which left fifty-four dead
                    and nearly two hundred injured.</p>
            <p>The two solutions offered to Cincinnati after the riot were boss-ism and reform. George B. Cox, the
                    Republican boss of the city from about 1885 to 1913, offered the city a series of programs ranging
                    from the "new order" in 1891, which had strong support in the Zone and Hilltops,
                    to the "syndicate" in 1907, which had support in all areas with its greatest
                    strength in the Circle. But in 1911 the Zone and Hilltop Republicans rejected Cox. By 1913 bossism
                    in Cincinnati was dead.</p>
            <p>During these years the reform movement, based on a shifting coalition of
                    "philopolists," as Miller calls the city boosters, and concerned with social
                    justice, won a few political victories. But all were short lived. As a result the boss and the
                    reformer alternately controlled the city. Both were interlocking parts of a new system of urban
                    politics. The "new order" of Cox ended the chaos of the eighties. It brought about
                    a professional police force and fire department, expanded the water works, and revived the school
                    system. With the chaos ended the philopolists were free to develop more sophisticated programs of
                    urban reform. Both the machine and the philopolists made Cincinnati more unified and better able to
                    handle the problems of a twentieth century city: Boss Cox, viewing himself as the "honest
                    broker," and the philopolists, stressing their new urban discipline and quest for
                    community.</p>
            <p>Although Miller is primarily interested in showing how politics reflected urban development, he also
                    makes a contribution in relating the new urban gospel to the process of assimilation. Cincinnati is
                    shown to be a triple melting pot—Protestant, Catholic, Jew. Miller is at his best in
                    examining the impact of urbanization on the Jew. The German Jews in these years made their way to
                    the Hilltops without abandoning the Russian Jews in the Circle. However, Miller is weakest in
                    dealing with the Americanization of Catholics, especially German Catholics. At times the author
                    overemphasizes residential patterns as being primary in reflecting the social and political
                    experiences of the city. He himself shows that in the election of 1913 the defection of the German
                    Catholics from the reform coalition was due to culture and religion rather than area of residence.</p>
            <p>This study of Cincinnati is well written and well researched. Miller adds an important link to an
                    increasing knowledge of urban America. The stereotype of the political boss may have to be revised
                    in the light of this study of Boss Cox. Residence as a factor in de- <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-066-1-079"/> termining attitudes will take its place along with race, religion, and
                    ethnic background in helping us to understand the urban process.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics.</hi> By Melvin G. Holli. <hi rend="i">Urban Life in America</hi> Series. Edited by Richard C. Wade. (New York: Oxford
                    University Press, 1969. Pp. xvi, 269. Notes, note on sources, index. $7.50.)</head>
            <p>"DO you understand now, why it is that a reformer goes down and out in the first or second
                    round, while a politician answers to the gong every time ? It is because the one has gone into the
                    fight without trainin', while the other trains all the time and knows every fine point of
                    the game." (William L. Riordan, <hi rend="i">Plunkitt of Tammany Hall</hi> …,
                    New York, 1963, p. 20.) The words of George Washington Plunkitt, Tammany Hall's turn of the
                    century practical politician, applied to the "mornin' glory" reformer who
                    naively thought that reform of city government would automatically drive corruption from high urban
                    places. The election of Detroit Mayor Hazen S. Pingree, a shoe manufacturer turned reluctant
                    officeholder, was an attempt by the best people and the business elite to reform and to operate
                    urban government by business standards.</p>
            <p>Wild city council meetings, illegal business influence, and a severe depression convinced Pingree of
                    the sterility of structural reform. He realized that such reform could not begin to solve the
                    problems of Detroit without social reform which directly affected the citizenry. Pingree then
                    attacked the very interests that originally backed him for mayor—traction, gas, railroad,
                    telephone, street construction—virtual monopolies with the strength to defeat any lawful
                    encroachment of their somewhat unwarranted status. He quickly changed from a
                    "mornin' glory" to a tough minded reform politician.</p>
            <p>In four terms as mayor of Detroit and in two terms as governor of Michigan, Pingree, while sometimes
                    down, was never out in his boisterous battles against political and business entrenchment. He became
                    the leading progressive in Michigan at least ten years before the Progressive Era is supposed to
                    have begun. His successful fight for the three cent trolley ride was a national event that was
                    duplicated in other cities. He demanded and won equal taxation on business. Pingree fought for the
                    people-the have-nots and the new immigrants-and they never abandoned him at the polls. When he left
                    the statehouse in 1901, Pingree had blazed the trail to be followed by the more famous progressives,
                    such as Robert La Follette.</p>
            <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-066-1-080"/>
            <p>Regardless of temporary frustrations and defeats, Pingree left a lasting legacy to Michigan and the
                    nation, although his historical importance faded in the years following his death in 1901. Melvin
                    Holli has blown the dust from Pingree's record and has provided a sharp, exciting picture
                    of the urban reformer who saw corrupt business and corrupt politics as the cause of antidemocratic
                    urban stagnation. Analyzing social and structural reforms, Holli concludes that the business
                    interests that wanted a streamlined government "also proved to be the greatest obstacle to
                    social reform in Pingree's Detroit" (p. 181).</p>
            <p>Some historians argue that the Progressive Era began with the emergence of President Theodore
                    Roosevelt, others agree that the era vaguely dawns with the publication of Henry Demerest
                    Lloyd's <hi rend="i">Wealth Against Commonwealth</hi> in 1894. Holli's admirable
                    work, covering a still earlier period, perhaps inadvertently indicates that a progressive era knows
                    no span of time. Instead a period of reform depends upon men and circumstances that call forth the
                    best in leaders who support a legitimate public interest, not a perverted private right.</p>

                        Statesman, 1909-1915.</hi> By Paolo E. Coletta. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1969.
                    Pp. viii, 380. Notes, illustrations, essay on sources, index. $8.95.)</head>
            <p>Paolo Coletta's second volume focuses on Bryan's efforts to make the Democratic
                    party an instrument of progressive reform in 1912 and on his tenure as Woodrow Wilson's
                    secretary of state. It is a thorough, prodigiously researched account, largely sympathetic to
                    Bryan—"the persistent plodder of progressive Democracy" (p. 92). For
                    information about Bryan, drawn mainly from primary materials, it is a useful source.</p>
            <p>Bryan was "Wilson's Warwick" in 1912 in the sense that "even if
                    by indirection" he cleared the way for Wilson's nomination "by hectoring
                    the conservatives and insisting that all moves be made in the open" (p. 78). Later his
                    influence on his friends in Congress helped to secure Wilson's New Freedom legislation.
                    When he approached foreign affairs, it was as "a nationalist idealist—one who
                    saw the national interest upheld and protected by the spread of democracy abroad" (p. 181).
                    Coletta indicates that such idealism was susceptible to a paternalistic, moralistic diplomacy. In
                    Latin America <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-066-1-081"/> it sometimes produced results contrary to the very
                    concepts of self-determination and international peace in which Bryan believed. Still, since Bryan
                    had the best of intentions, Coletta believes that he ultimately evoked a trust among Latin Americans
                    which encouraged a genuine Pan Americanism to progress after only a temporary delay.</p>
            <p>Coletta generally gives Bryan good marks as secretary of state. He grants that Bryan sometimes
                    naively spurned instruments of coercion—except in the Caribbean—and viewed
                    complex issues with an old-fashioned faith in simple morality and in the efficacy of reason. Yet he
                    emphasizes that on a number of issues Bryan was ahead of his times. He describes, for example,
                    Bryan's attempts to establish governmental rather than private credit in aiding undeveloped
                    nations as "the forerunner of our modern diplomacy" (p. 210). Or regarding
                    Bryan's early suggestions for mediation between World War 1's belligerents:
                    "As so often happened, Bryan's ideas were laughed at for the moment, then used at
                    a later time" (p. 259). Or: "As so often happened in his career … his
                    ideas were fully adopted by a later generation, in the neutrality laws of 1935 and 1936"
                    (p. 360). With apparent approval Coletta quotes Josephus Daniels who, when recalling
                    Bryan's struggle to keep American ships out of the war zone, asserted that Bryan had been
                    correct and that "events showed that he saw farther than most of us" (p. 360).
                    Coletta thus appears to suggest that in significant ways Bryan was less an anachronism who had
                    outlived his time—as Walter Lippmann wrote—than a man whose time had not yet
                    come.</p>
            <p>The general thrust of Coletta's book is, however, all too often buried beneath a surfeit of
                    detail. The reader learns, for example, that at Wilson's first inauguration "Bryan
                    was second only to Taft to shake Wilson's hand in congratulations" (p. 92); or
                    that Bryan "wisely ate dinner at home before attending public banquets" and
                    sometimes broke his diet "when away from Mrs. Bryan's keen eye, as by munching
                    radishes while riding in the morning" (p. 99); or that Bryan made his farewell visit to the
                    White House at 12:35 P.M., and that the Associated Press released news of his resignation at 5:26
                    P.M. Such detail too often pushes more important themes into the background. When Coletta cites
                    Bryan's belief in 1912 that four fifths of America was "radically
                    progressive," he provides an insight into Bryan's perspective on reform. But,
                    rather than develop this theme, he turns instead to blow by blow accounts of the maneuverings and
                    rhetoric of the Democratic convention. In a way, Coletta's narrative falls victim to the
                    mass of information he has assembled.</p>

                    McDermott. (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1969. Pp. xvi, 304. Notes, illustrations, index.
                    $10.95.)</head>
            <p>Professor McDermott is specially qualified to edit this volume on the French in the Mississippi
                    Valley. As a cultural historian he has made himself thoroughly familiar with the history of this
                    region, especially his native city of St. Louis.</p>
            <p>This compilation of papers comes from the 1967 Conference on the French in the Mississippi Valley.
                    The papers present an overview of what life was like in this region during the sixteenth,
                    seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Existence was difficult and luxuries were few. Uncertainty
                    was a constant companion. Even the sovereignty of the Valley was unsettled. Throughout this period
                    of political change French culture remained dominant.</p>
            <p>The conditions in France that influenced French colonial policy and the men who made that policy are
                    subjects for discussion in two of the essays. John Rule's paper concerning the
                    administration of Jerome de Pontchartrain as French minister of marine from 1696-1715 is especially
                    enlightening. Seven of the essays discuss the development of the French settlements in the
                    Mississippi Valley through the medium of biographies of individual French or French Creole colonists
                    such as Auguste Choteau, prominent citizen of St. Louis; Joseph Nicollet, astronomer who explored
                    and accurately mapped much of the Mississippi River basin; Bishop DuBourg, religious administrator
                    responsible for bringing many religious educators to the Mississippi Valley; James Pitot,
                    businessman and second American mayor of New Orleans; Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, explorer
                    who discovered and entered the mouth of the Mississippi River from the Gulf; Francois Saucier,
                    engineer-surveyor of the Illinois country who constructed Fort de Chartres; and Ignace Broutin,
                    engineer-architect who designed many buildings in early New Orleans. Reconstruction of French
                    colonial sites is the subject of two essays. John Fortier writes of the history of Fort Massac and
                    its reconstruction as an Illinois state park. On a grander scale, Neil Porterfield tells of a
                    proposed plan for reconstruction and/or restoration of St. Genevieve, Missouri, as an eighteenth and
                    nineteenth century French village. James Hardy discusses the legal functions of the Superior Council
                    in colonial Louisiana and how its decisions affected the everyday lives of the colonists. Finally,
                    Jack Holmes examines the military interaction of the French and Spanish from their respective bases
                    at Dauphin Island and Pensa-cola as they sought to control the Gulf Coast.</p>
            <p>The thirteen essays are carefully researched, as is evident from a perusal of the multitudinous
                    footnotes. There are few errors and <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-066-1-083"/> most of these are of a minor
                    typographical nature. A footnote is omitted on page 208, and there is some confusion of dates on
                    pages 2 (footnote 3) and 139. Anyone interested in the Mississippi Valley or in the French
                    colonization of it should find much of interest here.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Town Planning in Frontier America.</hi> By John W. Reps. (Princeton: Princeton
                    University Press, 1969. Pp. 473. Illustrations, notes, selected bibliography, index.
                    $13.50.)</head>
            <p>Reps' purpose in writing this book is twofold. First, he is filling a gap in the general
                    body of information about early town planning in America; and, secondly, he is publishing heretofore
                    unpublished maps, charts, and schemes, some of which are extremely rare, from his own private
                    collection. Most early settlements in America had in common the need for instant fortifications,
                    instant shelter, instant storage of supplies against the departure of the mother ship, and a small
                    house of worship-meetinghouse-infirmary-armory building. Some sort of stockade or enclosure was
                    provided very early for the nightly protection of domestic animals from marauding wild animals and
                    theft by Indians.</p>
            <p>Reps divides frontier American town plans very sensibly into ten different classifications according
                    to European origin and American geographical location. Beginning with the earliest Spanish planning
                    in America, he discusses the origin of the pueblo and presidio types of towns. The Spanish thought
                    Columbus had discovered part of the Indies and were totally unprepared to colonize a whole new
                    continent. In fact, the first planning legislation, promulgated by Philip II of Spain in 1573, is
                    titled "The Laws of the Indies." When the Spanish finally became aware of their
                    task, they set about utilizing these "Laws of the Indies" anyway and did a very
                    good job.</p>
            <p>The author follows this beginning with a detailed study of each of the nine remaining
                    classifications. "The Cities of New France" includes the origins of many Canadian
                    cities, as well as Detroit, Mobile, St. Louis, New Orleans, and others. "The Tidewater
                    Colonies" deals with triangular Jamestown and includes much of Virginia and Maryland. The
                    detailed discussion of Annapolis and Williamsburg are especially interesting. "The New
                    Towns of New England" explains some of the oddities of Boston, Hartford, and New Haven. The
                    chapter covering New Amsterdam, Philadelphia, and the towns of the middle colonies helps the reader
                    to understand the miles and miles of dreariness in some of our large industrial cities and traces
                    Manhattan from the very beginning. "The Colonial Town Planning in Carolina <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-066-1-084"/> and Georgia" includes the author's own favorite,
                    Charlestown, and such little known towns as the recently restored New Bern, North Carolina. Savannah
                    and Ebeneezer, Georgia, also come in for close scrutiny. "The Pioneer Cities of the Ohio
                    Valley" discusses Pittsburgh, Boonesborough, and other settlements along the Ohio. A few
                    oddities such as Indianapolis, Indiana, and Circleville, Ohio (which was later squared!), are
                    included in this chapter. It is only fitting that the author devotes a whole section to Washington,
                    D. C. His fascinating account of the trials and tribulations of the early days in the capital city
                    reflects his thorough research on this subject. The only other geographical location discussed is
                    the "Great Lakes," with such cities as Buffalo and Cleveland coming in for their
                    share of inspection. Reps concludes with a chapter on "The Citie of Zion or the Quest for
                    Utopia." Here he is delightfully humorous in his treatment of the crackpot schemes and land
                    swindles that abounded in early town development. In all, the author admirably succeeds in his first
                    purpose, to fill the gap in information about early American town planning.</p>
            <p>But the way in which the publisher handles the second purpose, to make previously unpublished
                    material available to the public, is a real tragedy. Awkwardly shaped, the book is eight and one
                    half inches wide by only six inches high and has 475 heavy pages. In order to read the book
                    comfortably, one must lay it on a table. The plates are so squeezed down to fit into this odd size
                    that they are unreadable, even with a magnifying glass. Proper reproduction of these plates would
                    have helped to illustrate the author's text, which certainly must have been written around
                    them. What a shame to lose so much! This reviewer recommends that Reps either hang the publisher by
                    his thumbs or insist that the book be republished in a readable form, preferably eight by eleven
                    inches.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Frontier in American Development: Essays in Honor of Paul Wallace Gates.</hi>
                    Edited by David M. Ellis. (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1969. Pp. xxx, 425. Frontispiece,
                    notes, tables, index. $11.50.)</head>
            <p>Paul Wallace Gates has sired a generation of young historians some of whom have already made
                    provocative contributions to the literature of the frontier. Essays of fifteen of the Gates school
                    make up this <hi rend="i">Festschrift</hi> volume. In the foreword, Frederick Merk, of whom Gates
                    was a student, places Gates in the historiography of public land studies.</p>
            <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-066-1-085"/>
            <p>The essays are grouped under three headings: The first, "The Disposition of Public
                    Lands," is opened by Lee Benson with a frontal assault on Frederick Jackson Turner as a
                    mythmaker. Others include Allan G. Bogue's arguments that sectionalism was only one of
                    several important determinants which explain how Civil War senators voted on western legislation,
                    and Mary E. Young's contention that the frontier was a safety valve of American liberalism
                    only so long as land was there for the taking.</p>
            <p>The specific case studies in the second group are titled "Private Interests and Land
                    Development." In one, Robert W. Silsby finds that the usual
                    farm-making-and-marketing-difficulties explanation of the debts and debtors problems on the frontier
                    is exaggerated; more to the point were the casual manner in which debts were contracted and the
                    rather leisurely approach of creditors who tried to collect them. Among the other studies, Henry
                    Cohen concludes that mid nineteenth century absentee ownership bred irresponsibility and fostered
                    the plundering of the land by tenants and neighbors, while Margaret Beattie Bogue finds that in the
                    early twentieth century, under the prodding of enlightened managers, efficient application of modern
                    agricultural science and business methods mutually benefited landlords and tenants.</p>
            <p>The third division of essays is concerned with "Economic Development of the West."
                    In one Robert F. Berkhofer, Jr., asserts that the overriding concern of Canadian officials in the
                    administration of post-Revolution Indian policy in the Old Northwest was to retrieve this area which
                    had been surrendered by their diplomats to the Americans. In another Harry N. Scheiber reassesses
                    the flatboat trade on the Ohio-Mississippi system during the 1815-1860 transportation revolution and
                    concludes that its economic role was as important as the folklore for which it is usually
                    remembered. Among the other studies is that of James L. Clayton who finds that the payment of fur
                    traders' claims for individual Indian debts out of tribal land cession funds saved the fur
                    trade during the years of the panic of 1837 and later helped the trader in his transition from the
                    beaver to other furs. Also interesting is Leslie E. Decker's debunking of the persistent
                    legend that pioneering was homeseeking; on the "mid-continent frontier," the
                    migratory settlers were "professional firstcomers" who composed from 50 to 80 per
                    cent of the population and moved on within a few years.</p>
            <p>The essayists have produced a mixed volume: some further document or flesh out efforts of their
                    mentor; some provide new insights in fresh studies; others merely reiterate what they have said
                    elsewhere. Conclusions range from dogmatic statements to those couched in such conditional terms as
                    "perhaps" and "probably." Verbal bouquets <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-066-1-086"/> for the scholarship of each other are understandable in a volume of
                    this kind, but there is a tendency for the contributors to practice what some of them decry in the
                    Turner school—that its disciples wear Turner-blinders.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Lewis and Clark: Pioneering Naturalists.</hi> By Paul Russell Cutright. (Urbana:
                    University of Illinois Press, 1969. Pp. xiii, 506. Illustrations, notes, appendices, bibliography,
                    index. $12.50.)</head>
            <p>Most Americans first heard of Lewis and Clark as school children, and the facts most likely to be
                    remembered were that they were the first white men to cross the Rocky Mountains and that they had an
                    Indian girl as a guide. Students generally thought of such explorers as intrepid adventurers who
                    travelled to unknown lands chiefly for excitement. That they might have collected scientific
                    specimens and recorded valuable data never occurred to most people. Only scientists such as
                    Alexander von Humboldt and Charles Darwin did that.</p>
            <p>It therefore came as a pleasant surprise to this reviewer in later years to learn that Lewis and
                    Clark had been charged by President Thomas Jefferson to make note of the natural features of the
                    country, including the plants and animals, and to find that they had collected specimens, some of
                    which were still in existence. In connection with a brief paper on the botanical contributions of
                    the Lewis and Clark expedition, it was exciting to examine the plant specimens, but it was a tedious
                    task to search the various published accounts of the journey to extract from the mass of
                    miscellaneous information the obsemations relating to natural history.</p>
            <p>Now, in this book, Cutright has provided a pleasantly readable chronological history of that two year
                    trek up the Missouri River and across the mountains to the west coast of Washington and Oregon as
                    seen through the eyes of the naturalists that Lewis and Clark proved themselves to be. By winnowing
                    out the information on natural history from the various documents and illuminating it with his
                    personal observations and enthusiasm, the author has produced a book to be enjoyed by armchair
                    travellers and professional naturalists alike.</p>
            <p>The format of the book is pleasing, the index appears to be complete, and there is an ample
                    bibliography. The author obviously has been painstaking in his research. For the convenience of
                    scientists who might want to examine the collections made by Lewis and Clark, particularly to search
                    for those that might be "types," there are interesting chapters on "The
                    Fate of the Lewis and Clark Booty"; a <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-066-1-087"/> short chapter,
                    "Summing Up"; and three appendices—Appendix A, "Plants
                    Discovered by Lewis and Clark"; Appendix B, "Animals Discovered by Lewis and
                    Clark"; and Appendix c, "Locations of Lewis and Clark Journals, Maps, and Related
                    Materials."</p>
            <p>Criticisms are relatively minor. It would have been useful to have had a plant taxonomist scrutinize
                    Appendix A before publication. There are a few points of nomenclature that could have been
                    corrected; for example, the scientific name of the Osage Orange now is <hi rend="i">Maclura
                    pomifera</hi> (Raf.) Sehneid. rather than <hi rend="i">Maclura aurantiaca</hi> Nutt. In a book of
                    this sort one always wishes there were more illustrations. A general map of the region traversed
                    should have been included for the benefit of readers not familiar with that part of the world.</p>

                    Jr. Foreword by Martin E. Marty. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1969. Pp. ix, 440.
                    Notes, illustrations, note on sources, index. $10.00.)</head>
            <p>Dwight L. Moody, heir of Charles G. Finney and spiritual forefather of Billy Graham, was a force to
                    be reckoned with in late nineteenth century Protestantism and, indeed, in American society as a
                    whole. Findlay's book, the outgrowth of a Northwestern University doctoral dissertation,
                    gives us a sober, amply documented, and very clearly written account of the evangelist's
                    personality and public career. As such it illuminates not only the life of one religious leader, but
                    the ethos of American society during the Gilded Age.</p>
            <p>Findlay argues that any adequate essay about Moody must accomplish three objectives. To begin with,
                    Moody must be seen in the "inner" context of nineteenth century evangelical
                    Protestantism. The frame of reference which guided his decisions must be exposed and analyzed.
                    Second, Moody's responses to the "outer" society of Gilded Age
                    America—a society marked by a population shift to the cities and by the domination of
                    vast business interests—must be considered. Finally, some feeling for the
                    evangelist's personality should strike the reader. While the distinction between
                    "inner" and "outer" history— brought to the fore by
                    H. Richard Niebuhr in such works as <hi rend="i">The Meaning of Revelation</hi> and <hi rend="i">The
                        Kingdom of God in America</hi>—is, in the judgment of this reviewer, not especially
                    helpful, nevertheless on all points Findlay has clearly accomplished what he set out to do.</p>
            <p>Poorly educated, Moody spent the first years of his life in the shoe business before entering full
                    time work for the Chicago YMCA <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-066-1-088"/> in 1860. Around 1870 his career
                    suffered two setbacks. The buildings housing a school and church he had founded were destroyed in
                    the Chicago fire; and, concurrently, he went through a period of severe depression. He had felt a
                    kind of conversion during the two years he spent in Boston, but in the winter of 1871 he experienced
                    a "second conversion." Thus, driven by circumstances and pulled by experience,
                    Moody embarked on his career as a professional evangelist. Throughout the 1870s he conducted a
                    series of incredibly successful revivals both in Great Britain and the United States.</p>
            <p>At these revivals Moody preached a rather undogmatic but vaguely traditional theology which could be
                    very reassuring to people challenged by the horrors and opportunities of urban existence. Backed to
                    the hilt by prominent businessmen—his pay always came in the form of
                    honoraria—Moody's revivals were dignified affairs, free from turmoil. Although
                    designed to appeal to unchurched masses, they, in fact, were largely attended by the middle
                    class—which viewed Moody as one of its own. The businesslike style of the revivals,
                    combined with the established appearance and familiar theology of the evangelist, enabled the
                    meetings to serve as an aid to the small town American in his "acculturation to urban
                    life" (p. 289).</p>
            <p>The fever of enthusiasm could not be continued indefinitely, and late in his career Moody had to
                    adopt new evangelistic techniques (smaller, more intimate meetings) and establish new institutions
                    (the Northfield schools, what is now called the Moody Bible Institute) in order to try to maintain
                    momentum.</p>
            <p>Moody was unappreciative of the developing social gospel response to urban problems and
                    obscurantistic towards developments in Biblical studies. He found it easier to give up an enterprise
                    and start over than to work for institutional change. In all this he serves as an epitome of
                    American Protestantism. Perhaps his energy, lack of dogmatism, modesty, and pervasive good
                    intentions are only slightly less typical. In any event, scholars are in Findlay's debt for
                    calling him, again, to our attention.</p>

               <hi rend="i">From Hayes to McKinley: National Party Politics, 1877-1896.</hi> By H. Wayne Morgan.
                    (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 1969. Pp. x, 618. Illustrations, bibliographical note, notes
                    to chapters, index. $12.95.)</head>
            <p>Those interested in political history and political personalities in the two decades from the
                    Compromise of 1877 to the election of 1896 are greatly indebted to H. Wayne Morgan, professor of
                    history at the <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-066-1-089"/> University of Texas, for this admirable survey of
                    that important period. The author has accomplished what the title implies he intended—to
                    produce a book about national party politics. One ought not, therefore, to criticize him for
                    neglecting diplomatic, economic, or constitutional history, as he does, or for failing to elaborate
                    upon local or sectional issues.</p>
            <p>This is a long book, but it is well written and holds the reader's attention. Even though
                    the story in general is familiar, there are just enough new viewpoints and fresh materials to keep
                    one alert and fascinated. Organized chronologically, the twelve chapters are grouped into three
                    parts with sections of pertinent photographs at the end of each part. The first five chapters deal
                    with the Hayes administration, the election of 1880, the James A. Garfield-Chester A. Arthur era,
                    and the notorious presidential campaign of 1884. Part two devotes four chapters to Grover
                    Cleveland's first term and to the administration of Benjamin Harrison, and the third part
                    reviews the trials and tribulations of the second Cleveland administration and the election of 1896.</p>
            <p>Morgan presents the view that the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties were
                    sharp and significant in the era discussed. He holds that the Republicans spoke for an emerging
                    businessman-skilled labor-prosperous farmer coalition and believed in stronger national government
                    whereas the Democrats clung to Jef-fersonian ideals of local rule and a limited federal government
                    and never understood the changes that were coming in the United States after the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Among the best sections of the book are the numerous, skillfully written, biographical sketches of
                    leading political figures and the analyses of the Cabinets formed by each of the Presidents. If
                    there is a "hero," it is James G. Blaine, "easily the GOP's most
                    commanding public figure" (p. 22), "a convivial, popular, and usually moderate
                    man" (p. 66), "the most compelling figure of the day" (p. 67), who
                    "typified the ‘American’ aspect of every issue of his time"
                    (p. 68).</p>
            <p>Another personality to emerge in a most favorable light is William McKinley (about whom Morgan has
                    previously written a biography). "A small-town man with considerable sophistication, and a
                    political success who never let power or fame turn his head," McKinley "typified
                    the popular self-made man wishing to keep the system open for others" (p. 483); and
                    "in his own time, he was a liberal Republican, as many followers who later became reformers
                    readily attested" (p. 485).</p>
            <p>Although the author rather obviously regards the Democratic party of the late nineteenth century, and
                    such men as Samuel J. Tilden and Cleveland in particular, with something less than enthusiasm, his
                        <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-066-1-090"/> treatment of controversial issues and personalities is
                    moderate and judicious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">From Hayes to McKinley</hi> is a first rate work and deserves a wide readership.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Pacifism in the United States: From the Colonial Era to the First World War.</hi> By
                    Peter Brock. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1968. Pp. xii, 1005, Notes, bibliography,
                    index. $18.50.)</head>
            <p>Of the growing number of books published in recent years on antiwar sentiment in America, Peter
                    Brock's <hi rend="i">Pacifism in the United States</hi> is one of the most impressive. The
                    study in no way attempts to trace the general history of the peace movement up to the First World
                    War. Instead Brock's major aim is "to tell the story of the religious groups whose
                    members refused military service on the basis of their objection to war, and of that section of the
                    organized peace movement which … repudiated all war" (p. vii).</p>
            <p>Admitting that the intellectual origins of American sectarian pacifism can be found in Europe, Brock
                    argues convincingly that the American experience "subtly and gradually produced alterations
                    in both the expression and organization" of the nonviolent testimony in the United States
                    (p. 18). These changes can particularly be seen in the peace witness of the Society of Friends (to
                    which Brock devotes most of his attention in the first third of the book). British Quakers had
                    little contact with the uses and practices of political power; but in America, and especially in
                    Pennsylvania, Quakers did gain power and were forced to harmonize their nonviolent commitment with
                    their political responsibilities throughout the colonial period. Although this theme is not
                    original, Brock's study does succeed in clearly defining the limits of American sectarian
                    pacifism better than most previous accounts. He ably clarifies the variety of positions taken and
                    the often ambivalent responses of such groups as the Society of Friends, the Mennonites, the
                    Brethren, and the Moravians. The issue faced by pacifists was not merely the question of military
                    service, but also the more complex and difficult problems involved in the payment of fines for
                    refusing to serve, the payment of taxes for military purposes, and the participation in governmental
                    processes when the government remained committed to the use of force and violence.</p>
            <p>In dealing with the period between the Revolution and the Civil War, Brock not only continues his
                    analysis of sectarian pacifism, but <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-066-1-091"/> also studies in depth the
                    pacifistic aspects of the nonsectarian peace movement. Here he goes over the familiar ground so ably
                    covered by Merle Curti in his pioneering study <hi rend="i">The American Peace Crusade</hi>. Brock
                    is less interested than was Curti in the institutional aspects of the peace movement. His main focus
                    is on the ideas, arguments, and experiences of those Americans adhering to the principles of
                    absolute pacifism. His major contribution, however, is not that he offers any new or startling
                    interpretation, but rather that he introduces a vast amount of new material.</p>
            <p>Brock's meticulous research and his ability to organize effectively the data he has
                    uncovered make his study extremely valuable to historians of reform and religion. His style is clear
                    and readable although this reviewer would have preferred that he discuss his research problems in
                    footnotes rather than in the text. The major weaknesses of the study tend to be ones of omission
                    rather than commission. His analysis of the arguments and ideas of nonsectarian pacifists is
                    profound, but he fails to deal with these individuals on a group level and neglects to ask if they
                    shared any common traits that might help explain their predilection for nonviolence. Brock is
                    certainly correct in arguing that pacifism was rooted in Christian ideology and the New Testament,
                    but whereas he demonstrates that group pressure within religious denominations espousing pacifism
                    often forced conformity to the nonviolent principle, he sheds little light on the motivation of
                    American nonsectarian pacifists.</p>
            <p>It is in dealing with the post-Civil War period that Brock's study suffers most. His
                    treatment of the period from 1865 to 1914 is shoddy and occupies only a minor portion of his lengthy
                    book. He justifies this imbalance by claiming that little new developed in the testimony of American
                    pacifists and that it was not until the First World War that the nonviolent aspects of the peace
                    movement shifted direction significantly. Yet the period between the Civil War and the First World
                    War saw the rise of a more militant American nationalism, a war with Spain, and the growth of the
                    United States as a world power. A deeper analysis into the reaction of American pacifists to these
                    events would have strengthened his study considerably.</p>
            <p>These criticisms, however, should not obscure the fact that <hi rend="i">Pacifism in the United
                        States</hi> is an extremely important and worthwhile study and will no doubt be very well
                    received by most scholars. Unfortunately its length, concentration on detail, and price will
                    probably make it less appealing to the general reader.</p>

            <head>Prairie Farmer and WLS: <hi rend="i">The Burridge D. Butler Years.</hi> By James F. Evans.
                    (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1969. Pp. 329. Notes, illustrations, tables, bibliography,
                    index. $8.50.)</head>
            <p>James F. Evans, head of the teaching division of the Office of Agricultural Communications at the
                    University of Illinois, has succeeded admirably in weaving together both a biography of Burridge D.
                    Butler and a detailed analysis of two important mass media organizations which he came to control
                    early in the twentieth century—the <hi rend="i">Prairie Farmer</hi> newspaper and
                    Chicago's WLS radio station. Evans meticulously covers the details of Butler's
                    career showing the growth and influence of <hi rend="i">Prairie Farmer</hi> from 1909 to 1939, when
                    circulation under Butler's leadership increased from 30,000 to more than 300,000. The
                    author presents ample evidence to document Butler's organizational skill as <hi rend="i">Prairie Farmer</hi> emerged as one of the leading midwestern farm newspapers.</p>
            <p>Clifford V. Gregory, Butler's editor-in-chief, helped him launch a number of farm programs,
                    e.g., the American Farm Bureau Federation, leadership in forming the farm block in the Midwest,
                    cooperative sales and marketing, and New Deal farm policies in the late 1920s and the successive New
                    Deal years. Evans' account of these campaigns is well stated, and he clearly shows that
                    Butler's "crusading spirit" set him apart as an important champion of the
                    farm community.</p>
            <p>Butler referred paternalistically to his loyal supporters as his "Midwest family."
                    However, this paternalism was turned into positive action, for he helped support numerous state
                    fairs, hosted several national barn dances, financed the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, farm youth groups,
                    Blackburn College, and many other worthy civic organizations.</p>
            <p>The author's comments on WLS, the voice of the midwestern farm community, make up the most
                    lively section of his narrative. Butler's association and ownership of WLS spanned the
                    years 1924 to his death in 1948, shortly after his eightieth birthday. WLS broadcasters from Chicago
                    exerted a wide influence and established programs designed to appeal to the farm community. Evans
                    discusses the WLS stars, Red Foley, Pat Buttram, Fibber McGee and Molly, Amos and Andy, Homer and
                    Jethro, Gene Autry, and George Gobel, many of whom became nationally recognized radio personalities.</p>
            <p>Evans seems to fall short of his mark in one area—the analysis of Butler's
                    personality. The author contends that the "dissimilar personalities" of
                    Butler's parents "help explain the fluidity of his own" (p. 12). Neither
                    the examples nor the arguments Evans offers are convincing when he claims Butler is a highly
                    sensitive man. In fact, the examples would indicate just the opposite. Butler comes off as a brash
                    man, whose anti-Semitism, feelings of inadequacy, schizophrenic <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-066-1-093"/>
                    seizures, arrogant attitudes, and directed tactics of intimidation toward his employees indicate his
                    rigidity, rather than his sensitivity.</p>
            <p>The author's research is conscientious, and his book offers the reader a fresh perspective
                    on the midwestern farm community from 1910 to 1960 through the active life of Butler. In short,
                    Evans has written an exciting narrative account to fill an important chapter in agricultural
                    communications history.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Mark Twain &amp; the Bible.</hi> By Allison Ensor. (Lexington: University of
                    Kentucky Press, 1969. Pp. 130. Notes, index. $4.75.)</head>
            <p>This book illustrates Dixon Wecter's comment that Mark Twain, in a protracted encounter with
                    the Bible, had "the will to disbelieve, but also a lifelong fascination with the mythology
                    …" (p. 4). Fascination appears in many Twainian allusions to Biblical scenes and
                    characters, his feeling of kinship with Adam and the Prodigal Son, and his fondness for scriptural
                    quotations, often misquoted. Ensor cites numerous examples, besides statistics gleaned from
                    Twain's writing: 295 references to Genesis, 133 to Matthew, 44 to Christ, 34 to Noah, and
                    so on.</p>
            <p>Disbelief motivates attacks upon the sacred truths of fundamentalists, who practice, Twain said,
                    "that kind of so-called housekeeping where they have six Bibles and no corkscrew"
                    (p. 78). From disparagement of the Holy Land in <hi rend="i">Innocents Abroad</hi> to savage
                    assaults upon the Bible in <hi rend="i">Letters From the Earth</hi> and elsewhere, occasional
                    reverence is overmatched by irreverence, disgust with hypocritical piety, contempt for a petty,
                    vindictive God who massacred the innocent and invented hell. A year before his death Twain concluded
                    that the Bible "has noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched
                    history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand lies"
                    (p. 73). The long confrontation offers the familiar spectacle of a rebellious Twain, scornful of
                    genteel conventions, vying with the conformist courting respectability.</p>
            <p>Ensor hews to the line with a zeal commendable, if solemn; but he might have ranged further to test
                    his contention that Twain, overstressing biblical shortcomings, was "at the same time blind
                    to its virtues" (p. 101). An unexplored topic is his appreciation of the sound and rhythm
                    of biblical language. A seasoned public speaker sensitive to modulation and pace, he was observant
                    of pulpit mannerisms, noting that clergymen often destroyed the stately beauty of the
                    Lord's Prayer by rushing through it, as if convinced that the faster they said it the
                    sooner it would be answered. The reminiscences of Charles <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-066-1-094"/> Warren
                    Stoddard tell of Twain's reading aloud from Isaiah and the Book of Ruth in a minor tone
                    powerful and moving. These matters invite consideration.</p>
            <p>Jim's engaging remarks about King Sollermun in <hi rend="i">Huckleberry Finn,</hi> the
                    entertaining discussion of the Mormon Bible in <hi rend="i">Roughing It,</hi> and Captain
                    Stormfield—all merit attention. Surely deserving notice is "The Man That
                    Corrupted Hadleyburg" for its sardonic ridicule of the unwise plea, "Lead us not
                    into temptation."</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, as Ensor maintains, Twain was not a systematic Bible student, and his strong
                    pronouncements echo those of Tom Paine and Robert Ingersoll. More questionable is the implication
                    that nowadays Twain's old-fashioned Bible baiting is outmoded. Perhaps, yet his flair for
                    vivid statement still makes lively reading and possibly, in certain quarters, continues to disturb.
                    Hellfire no longer sizzles with its former heat, and fundamentalism is not obtrusive, but neither
                    may be extinct. That <hi rend="i">Letters From the Earth</hi> (1962) shocked some readers suggests
                    that rough treatment of Holy Writ scarifies contemporary believers unenlightened by the higher
                    criticism</p>
            <p>Carping aside, <hi rend="i">Mark Twain &amp; the Bible</hi> is a scholarly exposition of the
                    shifting emotions, gentle and explosive, of a paradoxical genius who could neither take the Bible
                    nor let it alone. Like that provocative Book, which fascinated him, he too fascinates, confounding
                    critics and frustrating classifiers.</p>

               <hi rend="i">My Life with History: An Autobiography.</hi> By John D. Hicks. (Lincoln: University
                    of Nebraska Press, 1968. Pp. ix, 366. Notes, index. $5.95.)</head>
            <p>Here is a charming book written by an historian whose active academic career has spanned the last
                    half century. This autobiography of John D. Hicks also illuminates the shifting life and customs of
                    American society since the turn of the century. Since 1890, the year Hicks was born in Missouri,
                    population in the United States has increased threefold, and the passing decades have seen the
                    growing dominance of an urban America. Quite clearly Professor Hicks feels that the story of his own
                    life illustrates the comment of Richard Hofstader that "The United States was born in the
                    country and has moved to the city" (p. viii). He believes that Americans need to recall and
                    know their rural past in order to understand their urban present.</p>
            <p>The son of a Methodist preacher, Hicks grew up in a number of parsonages in several small towns in
                    Missouri. Shortly after his <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-066-1-095"/> graduation from high school the
                    family moved west to Wyoming, where Don Hicks (as he was then called) worked briefly as a
                    sheepherder before spending two years as a country schoolteacher. The author took his savings and
                    entered Northwestern University where he received a B.A. degree in 1913 and a Master's
                    degree the following year. Contrary to family expectations, the young graduate did not follow in his
                    father's footsteps, but instead turned to the University of Wisconsin. There in two busy
                    years he finished a Ph.D. under the guidance of Frederick L. Paxson and Carl Russell Fish.</p>
            <p>Hicks started his teaching career at Hamline University, and after a year's stay at the
                    North Carolina College for Women at Greensboro, moved on to the University of Nebraska in 1923. It
                    was at Nebraska that he wrote <hi rend="i">The Populist Revolt</hi> and became in turn department
                    chairman and dean of his college In his position as dean he soon learned what he viewed as the first
                    rule of good college administration: "Under no circumstances should a president, or a
                    chancellor, or a provost, or a dean appear to have any ideas" (p. 150). Later he moved on
                    to the University of Wisconsin and after a decade in Madison was named Morrison Professor of History
                    at the University of California, Berkeley. During his years in Madison he wrote the two popular
                    college history texts, <hi rend="i">The Federal Union and The American Nation,</hi> volumes that
                    have been widely used in hundreds of survey courses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">My Life with History</hi> provides a broad glimpse of a long departed rural America plus
                    an inside view of the historical profession and the world of academia. Hicks has filled his volume
                    with fascinating detail and incident, traits which earlier made his lectures popular with the
                    hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students that he knew in his long teaching career. Any
                    reader, middle aged or older, who knows middlewestern America will find this book a delight. This
                    should be especially true for those readers, young or old, who are teachers of American history.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A Search for Stability: United States Diplomacy Toward Nicaragua,</hi>
                    1925&#150;1933. By William Kamman. (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1968. Pp. xiii,
                    263. Notes, bibliographical essay, index. $7.95.)</head>
            <p>The first United States military intervention in Nicaragua lasted from 1912 to 1925. The second
                    intervention, which began with the return of United States forces in 1926 and continued until 1933,
                    is the subject of Kamman's study.</p>
            <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-066-1-096"/>
            <p>Several reasons motivated the second United States intervention: concern with the area's
                    strategic importance, a fear of "communist" influences believed to emanate from
                    Mexico, and a genuine desire for stability and democracy. President Woodrow Wilson's policy
                    of not recognizing governments that came to power by unconstitutional means—that is, by
                    revolution—was supposed to encourage democracy. Instead, it confronted the United States
                    with a dilemma; either acquiesce in lengthy dictatorial governments or intervene militarily. The
                    incumbents in Nicaragua—Liberal or Conservative—almost never permitted the
                    outs to fake office by electoral means; only revolution was effective.</p>
            <p>During the second intervention, the United States replaced Conservative President Emiliano Chamorro,
                    who had achieved his office by revolt, with Conservative Adolfo Diaz. It then defended Diaz against
                    a serious Liberal revolt. The United States gradually increased its military forces in the country
                    until, inexorably, they were drawn into war with Liberal guerrillas led by Augusto Sandino. While
                    holding him at bay, the United States supervised free elections and created a
                    "non-political" national guard to continue the work of the marines. The withdrawal
                    of the marines in 1933 left Sandino still on the field. He was killed shortly afterwards on orders
                    of Anastasio Somoza, who proceeded to use the guard as the basis for a dictatorship that still
                    endures.</p>
            <p>Kamman shows the intervention was not costly in lives nor money, nor even anti-United States feeling
                    in Nicaragua. Its real cost was the strengthening of our imperialist image in Latin America. The
                    intervention was a sorry experience for United States policy makers, including such an able and
                    skilled man as Henry Stimson, because it failed to promote a permanent solution of
                    Nicaragua's problems. Kamman's expressed hope that current policy makers will
                    learn from his study is certainly appropriate in this day of Castroite guerrillas.
                    Sandino's defiance of the marines was the beginning of the legend in the Caribbean that
                    guerrillas can always defeat regular forces.</p>
            <p>Kamman's detailed monograph is based upon United States official records and assorted
                    personal papers. The style is sometimes heavy, and the reader would benefit from a clearer
                    explanation of Nicaraguan politics, which is essentially based on the extended-family. It is,
                    however, a solid, useful study, for the author successfully leads the reader through the intricate
                    and myriad details of day-to-day diplomacy.</p>

                    Book Press, 1969. Pp. 223. Illustrations, maps, notes, appendix. $4.75.) The
                    approximately forty sketches which appear in this volume range from those concerning Little Turtle,
                    Jacob Wetzel, James Oliver, Isaac McCoy, Benjamin Harrison, and Harvey W. Wiley to others regarding
                    the Moundbuilders, Whitewater Canal, Corydon and Harrison County, New Harmony, and Conner Prairie
                    Museum. According to the author they originally appeared in such publications as <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History, Outdoor Indiana, Indiana History Bulletin,</hi> and <hi rend="i">Teaching Indiana History.</hi> Unfortunately, however, the author neglects to indicate the
                    particular source for each article. These popular sketches are quite suitable for use by students
                    and teachers of Indiana history at either the junior or senior high level, but they can also be read
                    with interest and profit by students and adults generally. (Orders for this volume should be sent to

                        Reprints of Economic Classics.</hi> (New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1968. Pp. viii, 712.
                    Illustrations. $15.00.) Coffin's <hi rend="i">Reminiscences,</hi> a classic of
                    the antislavery literature of the nineteenth century, merits careful study by persons seeking to
                    understand the role and status of the Negro in American life. Although the reminiscences relate
                    varied aspects of Coffin's eventful life, their central concern is the plight of
                    blacks—both slave and free—preceding, during, and immediately following the
                    Civil War. In an engaging and vivid manner, this Quaker native of North Carolina gives impressive
                    and convincing evidence of Negro discontent with slavery and a desire for freedom. While resident of
                    Wayne County, Indiana, and Cincinnati, Ohio, Coffin aided literally hundreds of Negroes, slave and
                    free alike, to escape the clutches of slavery. This benevolent Quaker gentleman also fought slavery
                    on the economic front, even moving to Cincinnati for a period to promote the consumption of goods
                    produced by free labor in an effort to weaken slavery by decreasing the market for items largely or
                    at least significantly dependent upon slave labor for their production. Coffin's views,
                    however modest they may now seem to some, were regarded as extreme and inappropriate by most of his
                    contemporaries in eastern Indiana and Cincinnati. As Coffin himself indicates now and then, even
                    many of his fellow Quakers considered him too militant and too aggressve in his efforts on behalf of
                    blacks.</p>

                    Smith. (Indiana Federation of Clubs, 1969. Pp. 52. Illustrations, appendix. Pamphlet.) Mrs. Smith,
                    former president of the Indiana Federation of Clubs offers highlights of the history of the
                    federation and its affiliated local clubs for the three decades, 1938-1968. Brief sketches covering
                    the periods served by federation presidents are given; considerable is indicated of the topics and
                    goals emphasized by the federation; and a roster is offered of the presidents of the thirteen
                    districts. The Indiana Federation of Clubs has made important and continuing contributions to
                    developments within Indiana. For instance, the federation has contributed significantly to an
                    enlarged emphasis upon conservation, fine arts, and the study of Indiana history. Incidentally,
                    those individuals who think the Indiana Federation of Clubs has always been exclusively for women
                    are reminded that "men have been members and in 1898 the organization had a man, Prof. John
                    Wisely, Terre Haute, as president" (p. 5).</p>
