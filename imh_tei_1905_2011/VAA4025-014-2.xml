            <p>The sincere and universal deference paid to James Whitcomb Riley at the time of
                    his death and the extraordinary tributes extended to him while he still lived,
                    are of passing wonder. It is a study in character, in moral effects and in the
                    psychology of the masses. The spirit that distinguished Mr. Riley was exactly
                    the reverse of that by which men seek prominence and popularity. The theoretical
                    virtues of simple kindliness, hearty good will and avoidance of self-glory he
                    put into practice, and mankind paid him in full, revealing that deep down in the
                    human heart exists appreciation of those virtues.</p>
            <p>A little incident, here published for the first time, illustrates notably one
                    side of Mr. Riley's character. One day a good many years ago, prior to
                    one of the meetings of the Western Association of Writers, which met annually at
                        <geogName>Winona Lake</geogName>, and in which we were both interested, I
                    chanced to meet the poet in the Bowen-Merrill book store, where he was wont to
                    loiter. The conversation turned on sundry mutual friends who attended the
                    literary meetings, among them Benjamin S. Parker, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newcastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Parker, a faithful servitor of the muse, whose talent for
                    worldly success was nil, had confided to me that he would be unable to attend <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winona</settlement>
                    </placeName> that year on account of the expense. This I casually mentioned to
                    Mr. Riley, and he at once evolved a happy plan. That was that I, as <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-014-2-004"/> an official of the organization, should invite Mr.
                    Parker to be its guest, he (Mr. Riley) to pay through me, <hi rend="i">sub
                    rosa</hi>, the railroad fare and the hotel bill for the week.</p>
            <p>My memory of this is freshened by a letter of Mr. Riley's which, under
                    date of June 19, 1898, reads: <text>
                  <body>
                     <div type="letter">
                        <salute>Dear Friend C<hi rend="sc">OTTMAN</hi>â€”</salute>

                                    yours to command, but you have overlooked informing me of amount
                                    needed for the transportation, or I would enclose same.
                                    Therefore, can't you arrange at once to meet me at
                                    Bowen-Merrill's, as I'll now be there every
                                    morning, or can be there any hour you would prefer and notify me

                           </signed>.</closer>

               </text>
                </p>
            <p>The scheme went through, but came near being amusingly embarrassing, as the
                    recipient of the courtesy was grateful, the association knew nothing about it
                    and I was enjoined from telling anybody. It was not until long after that Mr.
                    Parker knew how he came to be invited to the literary love feast that year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Riley's attitude toward the above literary association as contrasted
                    with that of some critics whose views were more nice than broad, was also a
                    revelation of the man. There is no gainsaying that at those gatherings much very
                    crude verse and much equally crude prose was spilled out on the desert air in
                    the name of letters. The review of Indiana literature that ranks highest does
                    not deign to recognize the existence of the said Western Association of Writers;
                    others did recognize it as a mutual admiration society; a professional
                    space-filling humorist of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> dubbed it the Literary Gravel Pit Association, and made dollars out
                    of it whenever it had a session, and one journalistic censor of local repute,
                    after accepting a place on its program and entering into its fellowship with
                    apparent relish one year, dished up a column of supercilious diatribe by way of
                    rebuke to aspiring small potatoes.</p>
            <p>Riley, who was a member of the association, seemingly did not share these
                    critical feelings in the least. Had the membership been of poets and literati of
                    his own caliber he could not have evinced a more hearty sympathy and fellowship.
                    In a word, amid these literary crudities as amid the crudities of the life that
                    he wrought into literature, he penetrated to <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-014-2-005"/> fundamentals and caught the spirit and meaning. The kindred souls who
                    joyously flocked together in the name of literature represented a distinct
                    movement away from sordid things and were the first to create in Indiana
                    anything that could be called a literary atmosphere. As compared with this, I
                    believe, the sometime painful limpings of the muse affected Mr. Riley not one
                    whit. Here as elsewhere he was kindly and charitable.</p>
            <p>Of course, Riley, when he attended these meetings, was always the center of
                    attraction, not alone because of his fame, but because of his fascinating and
                    unique personality and of his genius as an entertainer. He and John Clark
                    Ridpath loved to hobnob and made an admirable pair.</p>
            <p>One of these Winona gems was resurrected by Booth Tarkington in a fugitive
                    article some years ago. Its incentive was the park barber, whose fair daughter
                    was popular among the tonsorial artist's customers. In a moment of
                    inspiration, after a visit to the shop, Riley thus paraphrased Tennyson: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is the barber's daughter, And she has grown so dear, so dear.
                            I worship e'en the lather Her pa leaves in my ear.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>One of the W. A. W. meetings was made especially memorable by the attendance of
                    both Riley and Robert J. Burdette, the latter then in his full fame as a
                    humorist. The contrast between the two men as mirth provokers was interesting to
                    note. Burdette, genial as the sunlight, rollicked in fun with the abandon of a
                    happy boy, and with as little regard for probability. On the other hand, back of
                    all Riley's whimsical conceits lay a semblance of verity that made the
                    humor of them indescribably penetrating. If Burdette was a genuine humorist,
                    bubbling over like a living spring, Riley was simply <hi rend="i">sui
                    generis.</hi> The essential difference between them is, perhaps, well
                    illustrated by this.</p>
            <p>One day the two wags sat on a piazza of the hotel, the center, as usual, of an
                    interested group, when the talk turned on the experiences of the entertainer as
                    he barnstormed among the rural towns. It took the form of an impromptu narrative
                    to which first one and then the other contributed as the story <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-014-2-006"/> gamboled along. The point to be made is that, while
                    Burdette's contribution to this offhand collaboration was
                    characteristically funny, I can not today remember a word of it. On the
                    contrary, what Riley said and how he said itâ€”his dry drollery and the
                    pictures he called up before oneâ€”are indelibly impressed on my mind.
                    He may or may not, before or since, have let his fancy run along the same
                    groove; but, so far as I know, quite lost to literature is the moving tale of
                    the visiting celebrity who is met at the railroad station by the leading citizen
                    and carried off to his home. The relation of host and guest in the interim
                    before the "show" is mutually embarrassing, the former being
                    ill at ease in the presence of greatness and the latter being generally
                    miserable with overtravel, loss of rest and cinders in the ears, besides the
                    consciousness that he has only so long in which to feed, curry himself, get into
                    a dress suit and look pleasant preparatory to the evening's
                    performance.</p>
            <p>The divine tact of woman comes to the fore. In the midst of the
                    citizen's ponderous attempts at conversation the good wife thinks of
                    the rehabilitation which even great men have to undergo, and at her suggestion
                    the guest is shown into the "company" bedroom with its big
                    porcelain bowl and pitcherâ€”the latter empty, of course. He delicately
                    hints for water and the host with cheerful alacrity, but embarrassed at his own
                    oversight, brings in from the rain barrel a supply of last month's
                    vintage well stocked with wiggle tails and with a smell all its own. The unhappy
                    guest, not wishing to be intrusive, further suggests a towel. The towel is
                    brought with apologies. Then some one thinks of soapâ€”there is a
                    fleeting glimpse in the dusk of the citizen scuttling groceryward, and in due
                    time he takes the center of the scene again, having captured a cake of fancy
                    soap of the door-knob varietyâ€”the kind that gets slicker and harder
                    the more you rub it. One window of the room opens to the street so the passersby
                    can look in and be friendly. The guest tries to draw the blind. It is one of
                    these skyrocket blinds, and with an upward z-z-ipp, the whole thing mysteriously
                    disappears. ("I never did understand what became of these
                    curtains," commented Riley). The donning of the dress suit not being
                    intended as part of the public entertainment, <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-014-2-007"/> the guest scrooges back into the corner that promises most privacy, but just
                    as he is waving his arms aloft with the immaculate dress shirt over his head, a
                    bunch outside take it for some sort of a playful signal and crowd up to the
                    window for a better view, "Ah, ha. Come out o'
                    thatâ€”you needn't try to hideâ€”we see
                    you", carol sundry gay and friendly voices. They don't know
                    it's "company" till the leading citizen goes round
                    the house and explains.</p>
            <p>Here the improvised reminiscences evaporated, the gist of the merit being the
                    inimitable Riley flavor that went with the improvisation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Riley had his little literary animosities that were sometimes ludicrous in
                    their ferocity. He could not, for instance, tolerate Browning or Walt Whitman as
                    poets, and on one occasion when these were defended he expressed his scorn of
                    both with characteristic pith. Browning's intellectual subtleties were,
                    evidently, quite foreign to Riley's mental processes. "To
                    think," he commented, "of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, a real
                    poet, living with that man year after year and having to listen to the things he
                    wrote."</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if his critical judgment failed on certain sides it was broad
                    and penetrating on others, as the following letter shows. The verses in question
                    were a fugitive poem attributed to Tennyson, but not to be found in the great
                    poet's works. It was called "The Skylark," and while
                    it obviously took its cue from Shelley's famous poem it showed the
                    touch of a master hand and a truly Tennysonian warmth and imagery as if even he,
                    in an idle moment, might have experimented with the theme. The first stanza ran:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>How the blithe lark runs up the golden stair That leans through cloudy
                            gates from heaven to earth, And all alone in the empyreal air, Fills it
                            with jubilant sweet sounds of mirth; How far he seems, how far With the
                            light upon his wings Is it a bird or star That shines and sings?</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>This rather unusual poem is certainly not widely known.</p>
            <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-014-2-008"/>
            <p>I introduced Mr. Riley to it and received in return the following critique: <text>
                  <body>
                     <div type="letter">
                        <p>Dear Friend: "The Skylark" (signed Tennyson) is
                                    certainly a poem, but not one that Alfred Tennyson would write.
                                    But for Shelley's "Skylark,"
                                    obviously, this one had not been writtenâ€”which fact,
                                    singly clears the master poetâ€”at least to my mind. It
                                    is a poem and a fine poem for precisely the same reasons first
                                    and originally found and established by Shelley's.
                                    Indeed it seems, to the subscriber, an almost avowed imitation,
                                    yet by a poet who recognizes its secondary worth as compared
                                    with the divine inspiration of Shelley's poem. Possibly
                                    the credit to Tennyson is a printer's error, or might
                                    it be the work of a Tennyson brother? In any event it is not
                                    Alfred's. Find poem herewith returned.</p>

            <p>Riley was an ardent admirer of Richard Realf, the author of
                    "Indirection" and a number of other remarkable poems not so
                    famous. Before Richard J. Hinton published his Realf volume, I collected and
                    printed in a little brochure a few of the best of the poems that were floating
                    around, and it was to this booklet the following letter refers: <text>

            <p>My first acquaintance with Mr. Riley was in 1879. At that time he was an amateur
                    actor in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> Dramatic Club. I harbored the fond delusion that I was foreordained
                    to be a writer of plays and the happy idea occurred to me that a combination
                    might effect a short cut to fame for both of us. Therefore, I inflicted on him
                    the manuscript of a comedy which, though it failed of its original purpose,
                    paved the way to some very cordial letters which to the present day repose among
                    my valued relics. At least one of these letters is so characteristic of the
                    Riley of that day that I quote it in part. The sense of irksomeness, I think,
                    was due to the fact that he had been trying to come into harness after the long
                    Bohemian freedom of youth: <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-014-2-009"/>

            <p>As I recall my first and my last personal impressions of Mr. Riley I am struck by
                    the contrast. Soon after the correspondence above referred to he hunted me up at
                    my place of work in the old <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> printing office and we
                    passed what was to me a very pleasant half hour. He was then thirty years old
                    â€”an age at which most men know about what their status in life is
                    going to be, but his future was as indefinite to him as though he were just
                    emerging from boyhood, albeit he was then receiving local recognition as a
                    prodigy. He looked rural to a degree, and the first impression was of the
                    oddness of his appearance, his prominent eyes set in the midst of the blondest
                    of complexions, a wine-colored overcoat rather the worse for wear and faded
                    about the lapels, a slouch felt hat of uncertain fashion and accessories of like
                    ilk, making a combination not easily imagined by those who knew him only in his
                    immaculate after years, when his scrupulous taste in dress was notable. In
                    conversation his glance was all forward and the questions <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-014-2-010"/> of the present all bore upon the uncertainties of
                    his future. His preferred theme was a personal one, but pursued with such
                    youthful naivete that no one would think of calling it egotism in the ordinary
                    sense of the term. On the contrary, it was so individual that it gave a piquant
                    flavor to the discourse.</p>
            <p>It seemed that good friends, with the best of intentions, no doubt, seeing in him
                    a man of promise, had gratuitously assumed the role of literary sponsors. These
                    freely told him what they thought was bad in his poetry, and he mildly resented
                    the failure to recognize that he, too, was entitled to some judgment in the
                    matter. I recall, also, something like scorn for the professional elocutionist
                    and for those who thought he ought to improve his talent by taking lessons. To
                    this day, when I am so unfortunate as to have to hear one of these professional
                    readers do a Riley stunt in the cut and dried style, I feel a consuming desire
                    to give him a glimpse of Riley's little think at the beginning of his
                    phenomenal platform career.</p>
            <p>All this was a little more than thirty-seven years ago. Just six days before the
                    unexpected messenger came I spent a quiet evening with the poet in his pleasant
                    Lockerbie street home. Thirty-seven years had wrought changes. At yon end was a
                    raw genius just being welcomed by the world; at this the finished product after
                    a kindly world had done its best. Having worked out his mission on his own
                    chosen lines he was not only laden with honors and a universal respect such as
                    fall to few men, but had abundantly reaped the substantial rewards of life. The
                    room where he received his friends was a nest of culture with its laden
                    bookcases lining the walls, its touches of art, its graceful tokens of
                    friendship, and the center-and culmination of this setting of elegance and taste
                    was the poet himself, attired from head to foot with a scrupulous neatness that
                    was in itself an art. The unique personality of old, with all of its flavor that
                    can only be described as "Rileyesque," remained unimpaired,
                    but in place of the hint of verdancy and the uncertainty of one with the nuts of
                    life yet to crack, experience had wrought into him a poise, a large centrality,
                    call it what you will, that seemed too perfect for any mundane thing to disturb.</p>
            <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-014-2-011"/>
            <p>His glance now was all backward and he preferred to browse discursively in the
                    old fields, recalling this or that vanished figure that had left its impress on
                    his past, particularly the local literati that haunted the sanctums of the long
                    since defunct <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> and <hi rend="i">Journal.</hi> He spoke of his whim of
                    coupling up certain of these characters, for some obscure reason, with his
                    earlier literary idols. For example, George Harding, editor of the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>, was Charles Lamb; Charles M. Walker, of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, was Leigh Hunt, and so forth. He said that since his
                    paralytic stroke of some years ago had left his right hand disabled he had
                    virtually ceased literary production because it was temperamentally impossible
                    for him to dictate or compose in the presence of another person. Before the
                    paralysis his favorite time for composing was the late night hours after others
                    had retired and there was no longer probability of disturbance. The composing
                    process, as he described it, was exceedingly slow and painstaking. He would
                    write and rewrite, destroying completely each unsatisfactory effort and
                    beginning anew, and many times, he assured me, he was surprised by the gray dawn
                    creeping in at the windows, with at most a few lines accomplished. His last
                    words at the close of this visit, and the last I ever heard him utter, were a
                    cheery "Come again, I'm obliged to you for a pleasant
                    evening," whereby, with characteristic grace and courtesy, he reversed
                    the obligation.</p>
            <p>The world was certainly good to James Whitcomb Rileyâ€”so good, indeed,
                    by comparison with the lot of most men, that the gods seemed bent upon an
                    amiable experiment to see how it would work. It worked well. It seemed to work
                    automatically, for Riley appreciated and out of his genius repaid the world in
                    kindness. The world appreciated and proved itself reciprocal to the heart that
                    is filled with a universal kindliness. Riley, like the rest of us, had his
                    repulsions, and at times these amounted to animosities, but they were at a
                    minimum and they were not obvious. It seemed to be a settled habit with him to
                    say very little about a man unless he could say something friendly and
                    approving, and the number that came within this category were legion.</p>

            <p>During the last half of the preceding century, when immigrants from central
                    Europe were discovering America as a land of industrial promise and political
                    freedom, there were organized in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> various societies which encouraged immigration and materially aided
                    the immigrant in finding a homestead and securing a livelihood in the new
                    country. One of the wealthiest and most inuential of these organizazations in
                    the Middle West was the Swiss Colonization Society (Schweizer Ansiedlungsverein)
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As the name obviously implies its founders were Swiss Americans,
                    although later the membership became largely German, who united for the purpose
                    of encouraging and aiding the immigration of their countrymen to America.</p>
            <p>The Swiss Colonization Society was organized on January 10, 1857. According to
                    the terms of the constitution, membership was on the basis of shares; each
                    fifteen dollar share entitled the holder to two city lots or one garden lot in a
                    town, which was to be founded as soon as a suitable site could be secured. From
                    the beginning the organization was very active in the search for a tract of land
                    suitable for the settlement. The officers of the society carried on an extensive
                    correspondence for this purpose and were soon in communication with the
                    governors in most of the Middle Western States. Letters were also written to
                    various land offices, to Swiss consuls in the <placeName>

                    Frederich Muench.</p>
            <p>A Land Commission was appointed, whose duties were to be the examination of land
                    which might prove suitable for the purposes of the Colonization Society. On May
                    7,1857, a letter of instruction was sent to Mr. G. Liver, chairman of the
                    commission, <list type="footnotes">

                    the commission was to be given free rein in the selection of lands. It was not,
                    however, to negotiate for the purchase of lands, without the express approval of
                    the central government of the society. Furthermore, "the commission is
                    not to go further north than 43 latitude and is to keep in mind for purchase an
                    area of at least 10,000 acres. The commission is to make allowance for
                    approximately 6,000 town shares (town lots) and 1,000 garden shares (lots)
                    â€”. The commission has a cash capital of
                    $70,000-$80,000 at its disposal, and the central
                    government wishes if possible to buy farmland for
                    $20,000-$30,000 on credit. The society will buy only
                    farmland on creditâ€”. The commission is to make the object of its
                    mission public, as far as possible. The commission is to tour the States,

                    situation on a navigable river and if possible on a railroadâ€”. The
                    site must have a good landing place and must adjoin the river for at least two
                    miles. If, in regard to a river, it is a question of the eastern or western
                    side, the latter is to be preferredâ€”. Mr. Liver, of Milwaukee, will

            <p>A week later Mr. Selman was informed "that the Board of Directors of the
                    Swiss Colonization Society passed a resolution last night (June 15) to buy a
                    tract of land on the <geogName>Missouri River</geogName> which was offered some
                    time ago." But this action on the part of the board was not final,
                    although it would seem so, for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> land was not purchased,â€”probably because it was not all
                    in one piece.</p>
            <p>About the middle of July, Messrs. Oehlmann, Rebstock and Tuffli were sent to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry county</region>
                    </placeName> as representatives of the society to inspect the land which Mr.
                    Selman was offering. They returned in ten days with a favorable report, and Mr.
                    Selman was invited to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> "in order to give further information about the
                    land." The tract under consideration was situated two miles below the
                    town of Cannelton and comprised 20,000 acres, 4,000 of which lay along the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. The land was reputed to be fertile and rich
                    in minerals.<hi rend="sup">*</hi> The society wanted even more land
                    than was offered, and on July 31 wrote to the government land office at <placeName>

                    transaction. But a long delay ensued before the sale was consummated. There
                    seemed to be great difficulty in clearing the titles to the land and the board
                    of the society evidently gave up hopes of making the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry county</region>
                    </placeName> purchase, for in October a Land Commission was again sent to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. In a letter of November 4 the Board urgently asked Mr. Selman and
                    Judge Elisha M. Huntington, a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry county</region>
                    </placeName> land holder, if they could not furnish a clear title to a single
                    tract of 4,000 acres by January 1. An early reply from Judge Huntington assured
                    the board that such could be secured, and during the next few months the
                    following lands were bought by the Colonization Society through its agents:
                    Elisha M. Huntington, 398 acres, for $15,920; <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marshall</region>
                    </placeName> Key, 302 acres for $12,080; John James, 74 acres for

                    Dewitt, 160 acres for $2,500; Nimrod Latimer, 22 acres for
                    $264; Edwin Morris, 40 acres for $1,000; George W. Butler,
                    74 acres for $3,700; Benjamin Persinger, 200 acres for
                    $10,000; Abel Butler, 270 acres for $5,500; Samuel E.
                    Webb, 200 acres for $3,600; Eli Thrasher, 120 acres for
                    $2,400; J. B. Huckaby, 40 acres for $430; Fred H.
                    Oelschlaeger, 212 acres for $3,000; H. P. Brazee, 200 acres for
                    $5,000; John Turner, 120 acres for $1,435; William Butler,
                    200 acres, for $3,100; Ballard Smith, 480 acres for
                    $5,700; Homer Hull, 80 acres for $1,000; Nancy Field, 40
                    acres for $250; A. G. Selman, 800 acres for $3,200;
                    William Butler, 80 acres for $1,000. In all 4,152 acres were bought
                    costing $85,429. The purchase of this land in Indiana was opposed by
                    some of the branch societies of the Swiss Colonization Society and many members
                    withdrew. This did not disconcert the remaining members, since the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry county</region>
                    </placeName> tract would probably not have supplied land sufficient for the
                    original membership.</p>
            <p>In January, 1858, Mr. Louis Frey, the agent of the Swiss Colonization Society,
                    was sent to Cannelton to attend to the preliminary work connected with the
                    founding of the proposed town. At the same time the county recorder was informed
                    "of the purchase of a tract of land in your-county, upon which a new
                    town, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, will soon be laid out." The board furthermore asked the
                    advice of the recorder in the preparation <pb n="112" id="VAA4025-014-2-016"/>
                    of deeds, etc. A short time after this, the society's engineer, Mr.
                    August Pfaefflin, began the work of surveying the land and laying out the town,
                    of which 7,328 town lots and 974 garden lots were laid out.</p>
            <p>In the official plan for colonization these lots were thus described. The size of
                    the city lots in 200 blocks is fixed as follows: <list type="ordered">
                  <item>(a) In the best located sections of the city at forty feet front and
                            one hundred forty feet deep.</item>
                  <item>(b) In the middle section of the town at forty-eight feet front and
                            one hundred forty feet deep.</item>
                  <item>(c) In the outlying sections of the city at sixty feet front and one
                            hundred forty feet deep.</item>
               </list>
                </p>
            <p>The corner lots of each block are only seventy feet deep. The garden lots shall
                    be, like the city lots, divided according to their location and distance, into
                    three classes, of which those lying nearest the own site shall be laid out at
                    five-sixths of an acre, those more distant from the town site at one and
                    one-ninth acres, those furthest removed at one and two-thirds acres. The lots of
                    the last class may, if necessary, be laid out beyond the corporation line.</p>
            <p>Mr. Pfaefflin was also instructed to prepare a map of the town, which would be
                    necessary for the assignment of the lots. In addition to other duties, Mr. Frey
                    and the engineer were to examine land in the vicinity, with the view of
                    purchasing it for farmlands; since it seemed that there was a greater demand
                    among the prospective settlers for farmland than for town lots. More land was
                    bought, but there was a great deal of delay in negotiating the purchase, due to
                    the failure of some of the directors, who did not reside in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to vote on the matter. Because of this, Mr. Frey was advised by
                    the secretary to attend to pressing business in the future without waiting for
                    the approval of the directors. Early in February the society already had in its
                    possession 2,710 acres for the town site and 6,000 acres (for some of which it
                    merely held options) of farm and garden lands.</p>
            <p>Since town lots were to be apportioned by lot, the colonization plan provided
                    that a number should be reserved and given to first settlers in exchange for
                    lots which were not <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-014-2-017"/> suitable for building.
                    Whether or not a lot was capable of improvement was to be determined by a
                    committee of three, one member chosen by the lot owner, a second by the society
                    or its representative, and the third by both parties concerned. This matter of
                    improveable and non-improveable lots later caused a great deal of confusion and
                    dissension. However, each shareholder was not to be permitted thus to exchange
                    more than one lot and he must furthermore within one year of his arrival erect a
                    brick or frame house, worth not less than $125. The society was to
                    provide each settler with enough building material for a one-story, two room
                    house, the amount for it to be paid in three yearly payments. Owners of garden
                    lots might buy an additional tract of gardenland, not to exceed three and
                    one-third acres. The terms for the purchase of farmland were: one-third cash,
                    one-third in three years and one-third in six years.</p>
            <p>Lots were distributed in March, 1858, in which month the first settlers began to
                    arrive. The society placed all vacant buildings at the disposal of the
                    newcomers, but they came in such numbers, that many were forced to live in the
                    open for a time while a great many had to leave for want of homes.<hi rend="sup">*</hi> In a few weeks there were one hundred families in the
                    town.</p>
            <p>Communications from Mr. Frey, during the month of April, present a vivid and
                    interesting picture of that busy time. The agent lamented the fact that many
                    settlers had no place to stay; that they must build but find that their lots
                    were not yet surveyed. He reported that a great number of lots were so situated
                    that during the first year no three out of ten would be suitable for building
                    purposes, because they lay deep in the forest! In reply to questions and
                    reproach, Mr. Frey said the work had not progressed more rapidly because of
                    shortage of labor and building materials; furthermore, the town had been laid
                    out "zu groszartig" and the work accomplished was hardly
                    noticeable compared with the work to be done. By the end of April three of ten
                    houses which the society had planned to build were completed and were occupied
                    by six families. Twenty-one houses at that time had been started by settlers.

                    crude street business was already concentrating.</p>
            <p>During the first months Mr. Frey labored strenuously. He occupied the precarious
                    position of buffer between the worried settlers and the impatient directors of
                    the Colonization Society. He adjusted many matters that were but vaguely defined
                    in the plans of the organization, and proceeded on his own initiative at times
                    when the delay necessary for an official action of the society would have meant
                    loss to the settlement. One such occasion arose with regard to the
                    "reserve lots," those lots, which were given for lots not
                    suitable for building. Frey found the two hundred reserve lots to be scattered
                    about in almost inaccessible sections of the settlement, and turned over to
                    settlers lots situated along the Plank road. Due in part to such actions, there
                    developed among some of the directors a strong dislike for Frey. They maintained
                    that he, as well as Pfaefflin, the engineer, was not discharging his duties as
                    promptly and efficiently as he should; it seems, however, that the distant
                    officials merely failed to comprehend the task of the man who was supervising
                    the building of a town.</p>
            <p>A distressing shortage of funds was not the least of the problems which
                    confronted the pioneers. At times the workmen were paid scarcely more than
                    enough to defray necessary expenses, and in the absence of cash they were paid
                    in orders on the grocery stores. Finally, Frey asked for authority to dismiss
                    unmarried workmen, if the treasurer of the society were unable to raise
                    necessary monies.<hi rend="sup">*</hi> About the middle of July,
                    1858, all workmen who were not actual settlers were dismissed. This action is
                    reported as having called forth dissatisfaction. In a letter of August 9, the
                    agent urgently requests a remittance of $600, "since the
                    workmen have received no pay for more than a month."</p>
            <p>In spite of these various handicaps the building of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and even the improvement of its streets progressed steadily, and
                    the end of August found a town of 1,156 souls. The report of the president of
                    the Swiss Colonization Society to the Convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in September, 1858, stated that there were in the settlement 262

                    president found the great extent of the settlement to be a disadvantage since it
                    was easy to see the remoter garden lots must remain for years dead capital for
                    the owners, because they were too far away for gardens and too small for farms.
                    He therefore recommended that they be bought back and be sold again in larger
                    sections.</p>
            <p>The most important action of the Convention of 1858 was that by which the
                    government of the settlement was transferred from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There were in the Swiss Colonization Society two governing bodies,
                    a Board of Directors, and a Board of Control which attended to the details of
                    administration, subject, however, to the Board of Directors. From September,
                    1858, the Board of Control, still subordinated to the Board of Directors, was
                    situated at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Convention further limited the expenditure of the Board of
                    Control to $800 per month. Although the change secured a prompter and
                    more efficient management of the town, the two boards were at times engaged in
                    bitter wrangles over points and policies of administration.</p>
            <p>An official letter of the Swiss Colonization Society states: "This
                    association is organized more for the common benefit of the poorer class of our
                    countrymen, which consists mostly of intelligent mechanics and
                    farmers." We infer that the "mechanic" element was
                    rather in the majority, for in the planning and organization of the settlement
                    more attention was given to the development and encouragement of industry than
                    to the fostering of agricultural pursuits. The founders of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> fully expected it to become an important manufacturing center. It
                    was favorably located and the neighboring lands were said to contain rich coal
                    beds. The enormous scale upon which the town was laid out clearly showed that
                    the village was expected to develop into a thriving metropolis. The streets cut
                    through the tangled forests were conceived as the spacious thoroughfares of a
                    busy city. Those running east and west were seventy feet wide, including the
                    sidewalks, each ten feet in width; those running north and south were eighty
                    feet wide, including sidewalks of twelve feet on each side. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> seems always to have taken a great pride in the improvement of its
                    streets, for, about April, 1858, <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-014-2-020"/> each
                    society share was assessed five dollars, payable in monthly payments, the
                    revenue to be used for street and other improvements, and the early minutes of
                    the town board, as well as those of the Society's Board of Directors
                    show that much time and money were spent for that purpose. The wide, well-kept
                    streets of the town at present further attest this fact. During the earlier
                    years some of the citizens insisted, perhaps wisely, that too much money was
                    being spent on streets; that it would be more profitable for the town and for
                    share-holders in general to turn the money to the encouragement of industry.</p>
            <p>Section 12 of the first colonization plan provided that the society should
                    reserve a stretch of land which should serve as building sites for factories and
                    other large establishments. These sites were to be sold at one dollar per foot,
                    provided they did not exceed a front of one hundred feet. If more than one
                    hundred feet front was desired, every front foot over the one hundred should
                    cost three dollars. A second plan of colonization formulated in September, 1858,
                    authorized that any manufacturing firm, employing more than ten men, should be
                    given a lot of one hundred feet front and the full depth of the block <hi rend="i">gratis.</hi> Further, such establishments might borrow from the
                    society from $500 to $1,000 for two years at 6 per cent.
                    interest, with satisfactory security. But this amount was not to be paid until
                    the buildings necessary to the undertaking were erected. Although no mention is
                    made of it in the colonization plan, it seems the society would also loan money
                    on the firm's guarantee to employ a certain number of men. The rate was
                    $500 for every twenty men employed. The society itself did not
                    undertake any manufacturing enterprise, but merely aided and encouraged private
                    undertakings.</p>
            <p>From the very first, many firms encouraged by the offers of assistance and the
                    brilliant prospects of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a future manufacturing center, sought to found establishments in
                    the new town. The first ventures were, as we might expect, saw-mills. A letter
                    of February 4, 1858, shows that two companies, Kraatz and Co. and Herrmann and
                    Co. were contemplating the erection of saw-mills; in the same month <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-014-2-021"/> it was resolved to give Herrman and Co. all the
                    trees cut down in the making of the streets. This company began work in May. A
                    shingle factory, which had been granted $300, began work about the
                    same time. Soon after a brickyard was opened, and a lime kiln was started about
                    two and a half miles from the town. During the summer many petitions for
                    assistance were laid before the directors of the society. In August Mr.
                    Huthsteiner, one of the earliest pioneers and proprietor of the first hotel,
                    asked to rent some land for a saw-mill. It was decided to rent him the block
                    reserved for a park as a place to erect a portable saw-mill. In September the
                    board sold J. Endebrock a lot of forty feet front and one hundred forty feet
                    depth at one dollar per front foot for the erection of a sash and door factory.
                    A firm which wished to use a lot on the river front for a lumber yard was denied
                    the right, since the Board of Control was of the opinion that valuable lots
                    along the river should be adorned by buildings rather than be made unsightly by
                    yards.</p>
            <p>The convention of September found many industrial propositions for its
                    consideration. Messrs. Burggraf and Zins desired a lot free, that they might
                    build a foundry, the first building to cost about $1,500. This was
                    granted and in addition $1,000 was placed at the disposal of the
                    company. Pikel and Haufbauer, who also wanted a lot and $2,000 for
                    the erection of a foundry, were granted their petition. Fred Zirbel was
                    forwarded $1,000 for the erection of a flour mill, provided he began
                    the building of the same during the coming winter; if not, he was to receive but
                    $500. Peter Schreck, a brewer, was loaned $300 at
                    6% for two years. Huthsteiner and Pfaeffin received $500
                    at 6% for the aid of their saw-mill. Various other resolutions
                    similar to the above were passed by the convention. A general resolution
                    provided that all persons receiving lots for manufacturing purposes must build
                    on the same within a half year, unless otherwise provided by contract.
                    Furthermore, those persons receiving lots <hi rend="i">gratis</hi> were not to
                    be given deeds until they had kept their concerns in operation for five years;
                    until that time they were to receive warrant deeds.</p>
            <p>Through the succeeding months many manufacturing <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-014-2-022"/> projects, mostly flour mills, saw-mills and
                    wood-working industries, were organized and discussed. The most important of
                    these was the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> Furniture Company, which was organized in the spring of 1859 with a
                    capital of $50,000. This company has developed into one of the
                    town's most important establishments. The Fischer Chair Company which
                    developed from the firm of Combs, Hartman and Co. (1863) is another of the
                    pioneer industries.</p>
            <p>An interesting organization was the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> Industrial Society which was founded in October, 1858, by friends
                    of the settlement in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as well as by citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Its purpose, as stated in the constitution, was to provide work
                    for the citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to increase the prosperity of the town and the value of the
                    property by the founding of industrial establishments. The society proposed to
                    found a furniture factory, a factory for wagons, plows, etc., a factory for
                    lasts, pegs and cobblers' supplies and an extensive coopershop, since
                    these plants could use as raw material the timber standing on the Colonization
                    Society lands. Funds were to be raised by the sale of shares at $10
                    per share. As soon as two thousand shares should be subscribed, preparation for
                    the first establishment was to be begun. The second was to be started when three
                    thousand shares were taken and the third when four thousand and the fourth when
                    five thousand. Although it aroused considerable enthusiasm and was evidently
                    organized on sound principles, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Industrial Society seemingly languished away without accomplishing
                    much definite good for the town.</p>
            <p>The Cannelton <hi rend="i">Reporter</hi> of October 2, 1858, says of its

                    it was to secure funds for the execution of the society's plans. This
                    condition hardly improved, for by the summer of 1859 the society paid out very
                    little for the subsidy of industry and there was even difficulty in getting the
                    directors to meet obligations already made. Of course, the individual firms as
                    well as the Swiss Colonization Society were hard pressed, and several
                    establishments did not survive the first difficult months. <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> colony. Prospective settlers were warned that work was scarce and
                    money "tight." Sickness and a flooded <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> were further discouraging factors and everybody looked forward
                    hopefully to spring. But the hopes were realized only in part. A shoe factory
                    and several other projects seem never to have materialized and during the summer
                    of 1859 many families had to leave <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> on account of lack of work.</p>
            <p>Very little real money circulated during the first years. Each plant kept a
                    commissary department, and the employees were paid in produce, which the factory
                    had received from the farmers in payment for furniture, etc. The workmen were
                    also given orders on the local stores while cash was scarce. One man states that
                    he worked a year before he was paid his first five dollar bill in actual cash.
                    This same man, who, like many other settlers, owned stock in an establishment,
                    drew dividends but three times in thirty years,â€” and then the
                    dividends were paid in additional stock. Contrary to the opinion of some persons
                    interested in the early industrial organization of the Swiss Colonization
                    Society, the firms were not co-operative, although employees often owned shares.
                    The children of a shareholder were assured a position in the factory for life,
                    or on good behavior. By this provision, opportunity was given boys for learning
                    that particular trade. If necessary, men, not related to share-holders, were
                    employed, but stock holders and their families were preferred, and were paid
                    better wages. Wages, even if not paid in cash, were good.</p>
            <p>The town had scarcely time to recover from the depression of the earlier years
                    before the dark financial clouds of <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-014-2-024"/> the
                    Civil war enshrouded its industries and manufactures. During these dark days
                    employees, even men with families, received as little as fifty cents a week in
                    cash. After the <hi rend="i">war</hi>, however, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> industry began to flourish and the town showed evidences of
                    fulfilling all that the founders expected of it. In the years immediately
                    following the war some of the strongest firms, most of which still survive, were
                    founded. In this group are the Southwestern Furniture Co., The Chair

                    tribulations of this company occupy much space in the proceedings of the
                    Colonization Society. Its original purpose was chiefly the manufacture of hay
                    presses. These sold to the South for cotton presses, in which capacity they did
                    not prove very satisfactory. Later the firm manufactured stoves, which also were
                    not sucessful. In 1869 the "Alligator" factory, as it was
                    dubbed by the citizens, was bought by an <placeName>

                    as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>It was intended to dissolve the Swiss Colonization Society as soon as the
                    incorporation was effected. A newspaper account says the society was declared
                    dissolved in the convention of 1860, and the following disposal made of its
                    property: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The property of the Society is to be divided into three equal parts:

                            improvements in the settlement and one-third for the benefit of
                            manufacturing companies.</p>

                </p>
            <p>As long as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not incorporated as a city the administration of the property
                    of the dissolved society was to be in the hands of a board of seven members,
                    called a liquidation committee, which should be elected annually by the citizens
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At this time the value of the Swiss Colonization Society property
                    was something over $50,000. On February 24, 1877, a meeting of the
                    citizens of the town was called to discuss the transfer of the business of the
                    Swiss Colonization Society (meaning doubtless, only the liquidation committee)
                    to the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Nothing definite in regard to the matter was done until the next
                    year, on September 12, 1878, the board of the Society resolved to appoint a
                    committee to examine the society records and turn the valuable records over to
                    the city. Then, on March 20, 1879, the committee for the cession of the society
                    property reported that all lots and lands which the society still owned should
                    be transferred to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> school, for the benefit of the special school fund. Some time later
                    it was resolved that the money remaining ($133.13) be given to the
                    city to buy a small fire-engine for the Little Active Fire Company. And on the
                    same day, April 17, 1879, a motion was made that it be published in the paper
                    three times that the society board from this day be completely dissolved, for
                    which Editor Bott shall receive two dollars. It was passed. Hereupon the society
                    board adjourned forever.</p>
            <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-014-2-028"/>
            <p>The minutes of the town board during these years show that it was busied with the
                    usual affairs which come before such bodies,â€”street improvements,
                    market ordinances, etc. The records were kept in both German and English and in
                    1878 the town clerk was given a special allowance of $20 for writing
                    the minutes in the two languages. The town ordinances, it seems, were drawn up
                    in English, and in order that members of the town board might use them
                    intelligently for reference, they had to be translated into German. Still, by
                    1870 the occasional use of an English word for its German equivalent, and a
                    poorer quality of German script show a decline of the German. The minutes of the
                    board of trustees and later of the city council, were written in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> until as late as 1894. On April 16, 1865, a special session of the
                    board was called to pass resolutions on the death of Abraham Lincoln. In 1867 an
                    ordinance was passed licensing saloons. The minutes reveal that there were
                    several competing volunteer fire companies, and the trustees had to exercise
                    tact to escape the charge of partiality in assisting the different companies. In
                    1868 a fire department was established. A committee to consider the diminishing
                    of the corporation limits was appointed in 1869. This matter came up again in
                    1877, but nothing was done.</p>
            <p>In 1871 the building of a jail was proposed. The privilege of erecting telegraph
                    poles was granted in 1878, and similar action with regard to the telephone was
                    passed in 1882.</p>
            <p>On January 6, 1886, a petition from over 200 voters was presented, asking the
                    incorporation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a city. Consequently, the town clerk was directed to publish a
                    notice that on the first day of March, 1886, a poll would be taken at the market
                    house to determine whether the town should be incorporated as a city. A large
                    majority favored incorporation and a record of proceedings was filed in the
                    circuit court of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry county</region>
                    </placeName> in March, 1886. The city was divided into three wards, the first
                    extending from the southern boundary of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Humboldt street, the second comprising the territory between
                    Humboldt and Jefferson streets, and the third bounded by Jefferson street and
                    the northern corporation line.</p>
            <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-014-2-029"/>
            <p>The first meeting of the common council was held on March 31, 1886. The officials
                    were August Schreiber, mayor; Anton Moraweck and John C. Harrer, councilman from
                    the first ward; Valentine Ress and John Hess, from the second ward; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Henry</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bader and Joseph Adam from the third ward; Frederick Kaelin, city
                    clerk; William Schroeder, marshal; Alexander Gasser, Sr., treasurer, and Charles
                    Gramberg, assessor.</p>
            <p>Having now traced a rough outline of the historical development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and having observed and followed out the industrial plans of the
                    Swiss Colonization Society, we will doubtless find it of interest to retrace our
                    steps and notice those phases of the community life which differentiated <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> from other settlements of the time and gave it its distinctive
                    character as a unique Swiss American settlement. We find among the members of
                    the Swiss Colonization Society a strong interest in education. Some of the more
                    eager settlers tried as early as February, 1858, to secure a vacant house for a
                    school house. This was objected to, because it was felt that it was more
                    necessary to provide shelter for the coming settlers than to have a school
                    house. In June a committee which had been appointed to attend to the matter of
                    erecting a school house reported that there were then in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> fifty children of school age, and that in a short time the number
                    would probably be doubled. As the financial condition of the society would not
                    permit its appropriating much money for school purposes, for the time being only
                    one school building could be erected. In the same month it was decided to
                    construct a building, about 30 by 40 feet in dimensions, two-storied, with a
                    large school room and a residence for the teacher in each story. The first
                    school, under the direction of Albert Oestreicher, was opened within four months
                    of the founding of the settlement, though not in the building proposed, for a
                    year later the society was still unable to build a school house. Citizens at
                    that time were asked to contribute to the salary of a second teacher.</p>
            <p>For the first few years the struggle to keep the schools going was a difficult
                    one. The administration of school affairs was a matter of general community
                    interest and mass meeting of the citizens for the discussion of school matters
                    were <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-014-2-030"/> frequently held. Fortunately, the
                    proceedings of these meetings from 1861â€“68 have been preserved. On
                    July 14, 1861, it was resolved that two German-English free schools should be
                    established in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and as soon as the means permitted a third school, a high school,
                    should be founded. The curriculum was to include reading and writing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> and English, arithmetic, history, geography, singing and drawing.
                    (No mention is made of yodeling, but the good Swiss did at one time teach it in
                    their schools.) There were to be thirty hours of instruction a week and advanced
                    pupils were to be given work to do over Saturday and Sunday. A six
                    weeks' vacation was to be allowed in the summer, and during that time
                    the teachers were to receive half pay. The salary of the teachers was set at
                    thirty dollars per month, with residence and one cord of stove-wood a year free.
                    Before the election of teachers in 1861 a meeting was held so that all citizens
                    might inform themselves concerning the fitness of the applicants. A committee of
                    ten citizens was to co-operate with the school board in choosing teachers.</p>
            <p>In 1862 a fire destroyed one of the school buildings and the funds for building a
                    new school were made up largely by private subscription and the contribution of
                    the Colonization Society. This school was known as the South school. By 1865,
                    however, the new school was so crowded that plans for another building were
                    inaugurated. The same year the funds available were not sufficient to keep the
                    schools going the full term as free schools and during the month of December a
                    tuition fee of one dollar per pupil was charged. By 1866 the public schools
                    accommodated four hundred pupils, who were taught by five teachers. The teachers
                    at that time were Mr. Debus, Mr. Huthsteiner, Mr. Baumgaertner, Mrs. Ellen
                    Largent and Miss Hedwig Knecht. That year it was definitely decided to build a
                    two-story brick school house with four rooms, on Tenth street, between <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName> and Tell. The funds for this building were also in part provided by
                    private contributions.</p>
            <p>Money for the schools was often raised by fairs, picnics and exhibitions, which
                    were always well patronized. One picnic netted a sum of $131.90. The
                    property which the <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-014-2-031"/> Swiss Colonization
                    Society ceded the schools was also of great assistance. Besides the public
                    schools there were various private night schools in which mathematics,
                    bookkeeping and especially English were taught. The citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, though they cherished lovingly the memories and the traditions of
                    their native <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, were striving industriously to acquaint themselves with the
                    customs and language of the adopted fatherland. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, like all German Hoosier communities, was deeply interested in the
                    struggle for the legal recognition of German instruction in the public schools
                    of Indiana. This matter was decided by an act of the General Assembly of 1869,
                    which sanctioned the use of the German language in the public schools.</p>
            <p>Nothing presents clearer the intellectual attainment and cultural standing of the
                    founders of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> than the names which they gave their streets. It is a delightful
                    surprise to find in this little city streets named Mozart, Schiller and Rubens.
                    The street names Franklin, Fulton, Gutenberg, Watt and Payne show a recognition
                    of the leaders in various fields of knowledge and achievement. Humboldt,

            <p>The first church in the community was established by Catholics. Two lots on the

                    building was not laid until July 10, 1870. Two lots were sold to a German
                    Evangelical congregation in 1861, and a church was erected in 1863. At present

                    became virtually its official organ. Like all German newspapers it contained a

                    and first appeared on September 1, 1866. It was to be "not a so-called
                    political, but a local paper." After the first year it was published by
                    Martin Schmid and Son, and in the third year passed into the hands of H. G. Bott
                    and M. Schmid, Jr. The <hi rend="i">Anzeiger</hi> remained in the hands of the
                    Bott family until 1912, when it was bought by the <placeName>

                    its readers many interesting bits of literature. Some American impressions of
                    the German author and traveler Gerstaecker were reprinted in the <hi rend="i">Anzeiger</hi>, and occasionally we find selections from eminent German
                    American writers. Frequently there were copied from larger German American
                    papers verses in which the transplanted German expressed his impressions of
                    America. There were frequent satirical thrusts at the Prohibitionists; sketches
                    and poems in the Swiss dialect were always popular with the readers of the <hi rend="i">Anzeiger.</hi>

            <p>The early records of the Swiss Colonization Society expressed the hatred that its
                    members felt toward slavery and emphasized their love of republican principles
                    and liberty equality and justice. In this respect the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> were but typical of all German Americans, although the fact that
                    many of the townspeople were Swiss intensified their love of freedom and
                    democratic government. They were always actively interested in the political
                    questions of the country. By 1860 <placeName>

                    largest single body of men that came from the county during the war. The

            <p>In July, 1862, a homeguard was organized. Every man who did guard duty one full
                    night, from eight p.m. until 4 a.m., was to receive a certificate good for a
                    credit of forty cents on his taxes. Four companies of artillery were also
                    formed. The chief duties of these organizations was to keep watch along the <placeName>

                    Southwestern Furniture Company now stands, and whenever an alarm was sounded
                    from the market house, now replaced by the city hall, they were to assemble
                    there immediately. The homeguards were called out twice, once when it was

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The town again showed its patriotism in 1916. Of the national guard companies
                    mustered in for border duty in July, the <placeName>

                    German American element in Indiana, more solid than it now is, was an important,
                    as well as an uncertain factor with which to reckon in State politics. The

                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>

                    recognized Carl Schurz as their political guide and leader.</p>
            <p>During the â€˜90's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its neighbor, Cannelton, <hi rend="i">were</hi> engaged in a
                    bitter struggle for the location of the county courthouse. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>, finding it necessary at that time to build a city building, the
                    present city hall, planned the structure so that it could be used as a
                    courthouse, should the city win the fight. But in 1896 Cannelton came out
                    victorious, having subscribed $30,000 for the county building. It is
                    said that <placeName>

                    </placeName> earlier had the chance of locating the courthouse, but refused
                    because the settlers did not want any loafers hanging around.</p>
            <p>No German American settlement in the last decades of the preceding century would
                    have been complete without its Turnverein, or gymnastic society. So, also, the
                    Turnverein in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> was influential in the life of the community. Although the early
                    inhabitants were industrious and thrifty, as they had to be to withstand the
                    hard times through which they lived, they were also a people who greatly loved
                    recreation and social intercourse, and the social life of the town centered
                    largely around the Turnverein. The entertainments, which were frequent, varied
                    from mere informal gatherings to gorgeous masque balls. In May, 1859, the Swiss
                    Colonization Society gave the Turnverein a ninety-nine year lease for a lot, the
                    rent to be one dollar a year. The chief purpose of a Turnverein is the physical
                    training of youth, the development of a "sound body in a sound
                    mind." Classes for the training of children in the gymnastic arts were
                    held twice each week, and to insure general participation, the dues at one time
                    were as low as ten cents a month for each pupil. A big gymnastic exhibition was
                    held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> as early as 1859, and even Turners from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> participated.</p>
            <p>There was a Theater-Sektion of the Turnverein which deserves especial mention.
                    The group of amateur actors comprising the "Sektion" presented
                    frequent plays, and <pb n="131" id="VAA4025-014-2-035"/> seemed to be most
                    active between 1860 and 1870. Some of the prominent actors were Peter Herrmann,
                    Mrs. Wagner, Mr. and Mrs. Dreyling, Mrs. Thomas, Mr. Keck, Mrs. Bauer, Mrs.
                    Kepp, and Mr. Nebelmesser as prompter. The pieces presented were usually some of
                    the farces with which German literature abounds. Benedix was a favorite author;
                    plays by Holtei, Gutzkow, Kotzebue and Koerner were also presented. But dramatic
                    efforts in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> were not limited to comedy and farce, for at one time
                    Koerner's <hi rend="i">Hedwig, Die Banditenbraut</hi>, a
                    "heavy" drama in verse was given. Perhaps the most notable
                    offering was Schiller's <hi rend="i">The Robbers.</hi> The fact that
                    plays were often repeated shows that they were really appreciated. We see that
                    in this little German American settlement, long before the Little Theatre
                    movement became a popular fad, there existed a true people's theatre,
                    which was backed by an enthusiastic patronage. At times <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> would also be visited by professional companies of both English and
                    German actors. One such company presented <hi rend="i">Faust and Gretchen</hi>
                    and <hi rend="i">William Tell.</hi> The inhabitants of the town were such
                    enthusiastic theatre goers that sometimes there would be more than one company
                    playing on the same night.</p>
            <p>The good people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> delighted fully as much in music as they did in drama. A
                    Maennerchor (men's chorus) was organized in January, 1859, with twelve
                    members. This soon became an important organization. A brass band was organized
                    soon after the Maennerchor and when the weather was favorable a concert was
                    given every Sunday by one or the other of these musical groups, or sometimes by
                    both together. In May, 1860, the Schillersaengerbund on the <placeName>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Helvetia</hi> doubtless expressed the sentiment of the town,
                    when it said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </placeName> brought with them a love for their native pass time. The plan of
                    colonization provided that a certain hill, which was called the Rigi, in honor

                    range. A Schuetzen-verein was soon organized and frequent shooting matches were

                    early history. Nor has it altogether lost the character of a Swiss settlement.
                    The German language frequently tinged with a strong Swiss accent is often heard
                    on the streets of the town and there is everywhere an <pb n="133" id="VAA4025-014-2-037"/> atmosphere of thrift and industry. A home-coming
                    week, June 28 to July 4, 1908, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the
                    founding of the town, brightened <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s recollections of the early pioneers and their
                    activities. The unique history of the town and its Swiss character were also
                    brought out in its Indiana Centennial Celebration of July 20 to 22, 1916.
                    Frequently the Swiss flag was displayed with our own emblem and floats
                    representing incidents in the early life of the town as well as tableaux
                    illustrating the Tell tradition made valuable historical contributions.</p>
            <p>A comparison of the plans of the Swiss Colonization Society with the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> as it is today shows that the town never fulfilled the expectations
                    of its founders. A prominent citizen, who has been acquainted with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s industrial history from earliest times has analyzed the
                    situation thus: first, the founders expected altogether too much. Then, the town
                    has always been a purely manufacturing town. It received no support from the
                    surrounding territory, because the soil was so poor that agriculture did not
                    flourish. To remedy this, the Colonization Society tried to buy land at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, but found the price too exorbitant. Similar efforts at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grandview</settlement>
                    </placeName> failed. Finally, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName> was unfortunately planned to be a strictly Swiss settlement. No
                    Americans were encouraged and no outside capital was accepted.</p>
            <p>Tell City now numbers between four and five thousand inhabitants. It would indeed
                    be difficult to find anywhere a busier manufacturing center. Some of the early
                    industries still thrive. As we have seen, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tell City</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s chief product is furniture. Whereas in earlier days the
                    furniture was a cheap grade destined for the South, now much of the product,
                    which is of the finest grade, finds a market in the East.<hi rend="sup">*</hi>

                                    the Dragoons came to our camp to see if we had been attacked,
                                    also the Third Ky. Regiment was formed and started to us but
                                    returned to camp at Talpeca.</p>

                                    muscat (mesquite) plants for heges, soon after leaving the plain
                                    came to Nopalucan, the second village passed today. Here we
                                    purchased some Mexican bread. We were rear guard to day and was

                                    Butler and escort; soon after we passed another town there was a
                                    report of an attack in front. The wagons were formed in double
                                    line and the brigade closed up and prepared for an attack. some
                                    of our Company thought they could see the Lancers about a mile
                                    from road among the bushes and muscat [mesquit] plants on the
                                    left. I saw them but could not tell whether Lancers or other
                                    Mexicans; we saw clouds of dust at a distance on both sides of
                                    road in an apparant village, some sayed raised by the Mexican
                                    Lancers. Soon after came to our camp at a small mud wall village
                                    close to foot of an almost perpendicular mountain. Here we used
                                    water from a made pond that was filled in the wet season.</p>

                                    Soon after we left the mountains we passed through a village,

                                    long and was a road cut through rock some places hardly wide
                                    enough for two wagons to pass. The sides of the appearant wall
                                    so steep as to not allow a man to get out at more than one or

                                    marched through a good part of the city, found it a large

                                    an attack, but it was all a flare up to get the men in ranks, as

                                    stolen and retaking of them delayed us, so it was near dark when

                                    to allow their carriages, wagons and mules to enter; the lower
                                    rooms are the abode of mules and mustangs; and here the slaves

                                    the great Castle of Chepultepec. we were here encamped on an
                                    extensive plain, very level. our camp about a mile from Toculy,
                                    our sentinels close by the Kings mills or Molino del Rey, here
                                    we still drill three times, a day, so we did not have much time
                                    to do nothing and the most of the time it was very warm in day
                                    time but cold at night. the Castle of Chepultepec is about one
                                    mile nearer the City than Molino; it was the Mexican Military
                                    Collidge; it is built over the top of a hill altogether of
                                    stone; it is about a mile in circumference at the base about 300
                                    feet above the level plain; the castle covers near ten acres of
                                    the whole top on the side next to the City, the hill is nearly
                                    perpendicular; the base of the hill is surrounded by large
                                    gardens with old shade trees in abundance so as to make a
                                    splendid Park or Garden, on the west side a great Park of more
                                    than 20 acres, immense large cedar trees altogether, a great
                                    many of them over 3 feet, all the trees are supposed to have
                                    been planted by the ancient Mexicans; there are more than 100
                                    acres of ground in the garden. Parks and vacant courts, together
                                    with the Hill, are surrounded by a wall near 20 feet; the road
                                    from City to Molino goes through this enclosure. I noticed one
                                    cedar tree at the foot of the Hill where the road stars up to
                                    the Castle, that was 60 feet around, had an immense top in a

                                    are surrounded by a very level plain, very nearly and partly
                                    covered with water. all of the fences are ditches from 8 to 10
                                    feet wide and from 6 to 8 feet filled with water. nothing of any

                    <p>I know there is a God and that he hates injustice and slavery. I see the
                        storm coming, and I know that His hand is in it. If He has a place and work

            <p>It was Goldwin Smith who said: "The <geogName>Mississippi
                    river</geogName> was once a mental horizon and afterward a boundary
                    line." During Lincoln's youth this river had become the
                    highway for the western pioneer, and what was true of the Father of Waters was
                    true of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>.</p>
            <p>Lincoln came in touch with the outside world on this great highway. Travel by
                    boats, slow as it was, served as quite the best means of making long journeys.
                    Occasionally a passing steamer landed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Anderson</settlement>
                    </placeName> creek, and since Troy was regarded as a place of some importance
                    most of the river crafts made port there. Hence Young Lincoln, while acting as
                    ferryman during his seventeenth year, was privileged to see somewhat of life
                    from without. Notable men occasionally passed, and he may have even met with
                    some of them.</p>
            <p>A short distance above Troy, General LaFayette, while making his tour of the
                    Western States by way of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, spent a night in a
                    stone house on the river bank after his disabled steamer sank. Perhaps Lincoln
                    did not see the "Friend of Washington," but his passing and
                    the circumstance of his spending the night ashore not far from where <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> lived, furnished a theme for the pioneers for a considerable time
                    thereafter.</p>
            <p>It was while acting as ferryman at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Anderson</settlement>
                    </placeName> creek that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> made his first dollar. This circumstance, which he related in later
                    life to members of his cabinet and Secretary Seward in particular, was as
                    follows: <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-014-2-053"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I was standing at the steamboat landing contemplating my new boat, and
                            wondering how I might improve it, when a steamer approached coming down
                            the river. At the same time two passengers came to the river bank and
                            wished to be taken out to the packet with their luggage. They looked
                            among the boats, singled out mine, and asked me to scull them to the
                            boat. Sometime prior to this I had constructed a small boat in which I
                            planned to carry some produce South which had been gathered chiefly by
                            my own exertions. We were poor, and in them days people down South who
                            did not own slaves were reckoned as scrubs. When I was requested to
                            scull these men out to the steamer, I gladly did so, and after seeing
                            them and their trunks on board, and the steamer making ready to pass on,
                            I called out to the men: "You have forgotten to pay
                            me." They at once each threw a half dollar in the bottom of the
                            boat in which I was standing. You gentlemen may think it was a very
                            small matter, and in the light of things now transpiring it was, but I
                            assure you it was one of the most important incidents in my life. I
                            could scarcely believe my eyes. It was difficult for rue to realize that
                            I, a poor boy, had earned a dollar in less than a day. The world seemed
                            wider and fairer before me. I was a more hopeful and confident being
                            from that time.</p>

            <p>Young Lincoln being ambitious and desirous of bettering his condition very
                    naturally looked to the river for employment. Possessing some skill with
                    carpenter's tools he had at this time constructed a boat that he deemed
                    seaworthy enough to make the journey referred to in his conversation with
                    Secretary Seward.</p>
            <p>It has been asserted by some of his biographers that this journey was not made,
                    and one writer ventures to suggest that since the Lincolns had nothing in the
                    way of produce justifying such a trip, it was therefore merely a journey of the
                    imagination. Such a position taken is a needless effort to establish the
                    well-known poverty of the Lincolns, but since no such journey was undertaken by
                    any at that time without presuming upon neighborly assistance, which proved in
                    substantially every case to be a mutual accommodation, the proposed trip down
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Mississippi by Young Lincoln might have been fully justified,
                    since it is now known that he had on his own account a crop of tobacco. The
                    plans for the trip, as indicated in the conversation with Seward, were so
                    changed as to cause him to leave his own boat behind and take passage upon the
                    flatboat of Mr. Ray.</p>
            <p>Having made this and the later trip with young Gentry <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-014-2-054"/> down the great river, he seems to have been
                    disposed "to follow the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>," and a little later went to his old friend and patron
                    "Uncle Wood," in whom he reposed great confidence, requesting
                    that this gentleman aid him by way of a recommendation to secure a position on
                    some steamer plying up and down this river. Mr. Wood, realizing that Lincoln was
                    not of age, hesitated to advise the youth to leave his father, and refused to
                    give the assistance deemed by Lincoln essential to secure a position. It was
                    quite the rule in that day for a boy to remain with his parents until reaching
                    his majority. However, Lincoln was very insistent, and in the course of his
                    argument remarked that "it was his best chance," and
                    "a chance is all I want." After some persuasion on the part of
                    Wood, he yielded and remained with his father until well into his twenty-second
                    year.</p>
            <p>Since the river traffic along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> at that time, and for a considerable period thereafter, was great,
                    had Young Lincoln succeeded in prevailing upon his old friend Wood to aid him in
                    securing a position as pilot we might have lost our great war President, but
                    would have perhaps gained another Mark Twain. In any case, had he been so
                    fortunate as to find some "Boswell," his fame as a humorist
                    would have been secure.</p>
            <p>That Young Lincoln seems to have become resigned to his lot is evidenced by Mr.
                    Wood in stating that soon after this interview relative to his becoming a river
                    pilot he saw Lincoln whip-sawing lumber, and on asking him what he intended
                    doing with this, Wood was told that the elder Lincoln was "planning to
                    erect a new house in the spring." The letters of John Hanks concerning
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> location and the glowing accounts of Dennis Hanks on his return
                    from that region occasioned the abandonment of the plan to erect the new home,
                    and the lumber was disposed of to Josiah Crawford who used the major portion of
                    it in the construction of an additional room to his house.</p>
            <p>It was soon after Young Lincoln returned to the farm from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Anderson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Creek ferry that he formed the habit of attending the various
                    courts, but it was while acting as ferryman that he attended court for the first
                    time. His presence <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-014-2-055"/> there was not prompted
                    by mere curiosity or due to any ambition that he possessed to take up the law as
                    a profession, but he appeared as a prisoner at the bar, the first and only time
                    in his life; although, had there been debtors' prisons during a certain
                    period of his lifetime, he might have suffered imprisonment in consequence of
                    the overwhelming obligations that he assumed and which he failed to meet until
                    many years after they were incurred.</p>
            <p>The circumstance of his becoming a prisoner and his appearance in the court were
                    as follows:</p>
            <p>While acting as ferryman at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Anderson</settlement>
                    </placeName> creek on the Indiana side of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>,
                    John and Benjamin Dill, two farmers residing on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side of the river just opposite the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had become licensed ferrymen. Occasionally when busily engaged in
                    agricultural pursuits, they neglected the ferry to the extent that their ferry
                    bell would sound again and again without their hearing it; or, what was more
                    probable, on hearing it failed to respond to its call. On such occasions when
                    the bell rang repeatedly, Young Lincoln would push out from the Indiana side and
                    ferry the anxious traveler across the river, and of course received the usual
                    fee for such services.</p>
            <p>Whether Lincoln's ear was thought to be too attentive to the ferry bell
                    on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side of the river, or whether the Dill brothers wished to make him
                    an example to any and all who were disposed to take liberties with their legal
                    rights, we do not know, but in any case they decided to entrap <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> and visit him with suitable punishment. Accordingly they requested
                    a neighbor to sound the ferry bell, and when they did not respond as was
                    frequently the case, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> quickly oared across the river. Running his boat up to an opening
                    in the dense willows on the river bank where the supposed anxious passenger
                    stood in apparent readiness to step in, Lincoln was surprised to find himself
                    seized by both the supposed passenger and the Dill brothers who had up to his
                    appearance been hiding in the willows. They at once announced their intention of
                    giving their prisoner a "ducking." The youthful ferryman not
                    appearing to understand their motives became very angery, and the presumption is
                    that he manifested this <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-014-2-056"/> in no uncertain
                    manner. It never appeared clear whether the original purpose of the Dill
                    brothers was carried out or seriously attempted after the preliminary skirmish
                    with "Long Abe," but it is quite true that they at length
                    proposed to "take him before the squire" where punishment
                    could be meted out in a legal manner. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, by this time understanding his supposed offense, accompanied his
                    captors to the local justice, one Samuel Pate, who resided one mile distant down
                    the river. On their arrival at the farm home of Pate finding that gentleman out
                    on the farm at work, one of their party was dispatched to inform his honor that
                    more weighty matters needed his attention, while the others stood guard over the
                    prisoner.</p>
            <p>More or less regularity appears to have been observed in the hearing accorded the
                    youthful offender. At first it is said he was greatly disturbed on hearing the
                    statements of the two Dills and about the decoy, more especially so when it
                    appeared from some of their assertions that a jail sentence awaited him, but
                    when the â€˜Squire proposed to him to offer his version of the affair
                    and make any statement that he cared to, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> gladly availed himself of the opportunity. In doing so he freely
                    and frankly confessed that on numerous occasions he had ferried passengers
                    across the river from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> side when the travelers failed to secure a response to the repeated
                    ringing of the bell, but he disclaimed any knowledge of the fact that in so
                    doing he had violated any law, distinctly stating that he did not know he was
                    thus encroaching upon the rights of the Dill brothers; that if he had known it
                    was wrong, he would not have been guilty in any single instance. He further
                    alleged that not only was he free from intentional wrong, but in reality he
                    supposed he was conferring a great favor upon the owners of the ferry who, he
                    supposed, were at such times away from home or were otherwise engaged, as well
                    as accommodating anxious travelers.</p>
            <p>Without throwing himself upon the mercy of the court or pleading for leniency, he
                    nevertheless did so all the more effectively by impressing, as he did, both his
                    accusers and the 'squire with his sincerity, truthfulness and honesty,
                    reasserting his ignorance of the law and promising that in the <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-014-2-057"/> future he would not be found trespassing upon their
                    rights. The appeal was effective, and the court, after listening to this recital
                    of facts, dismissed him with some suitable words of advice. Thus, like
                    CÃ¦sar in chains, he had talked himself free.</p>
            <p>The 'squire became greatly interested in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, and finding him a great talker and inquisitive concerning court
                    procedure especially, urged the young man to prolong his stay, which he did. On
                    taking his leave the 'squire pressed upon him an invitation to attend a
                    sitting of his court which <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> accepted, and not only did he attend this particular sitting, but
                    became a regular attendant so long as he remained ferryman at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Anderson</settlement>
                    </placeName> creek.</p>
            <p>â€˜Squire Pate did not live to witness <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s rise to fame, but many of his family did. The house is
                    still standing in which this trial was held, and the only remaining son of Pate
                    pointed out the room in which this memorable sitting of his father's
                    court was held. The circumstance was known to a number of the old citizens of
                    the neighborhood, and a full account of this incident appeared in a local
                    newspaper in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>

            <p>Young Lincoln was in the habit of attending the sessions of the circuit court as
                    well as trials before the local justice of the peace. That he possessed an
                    ambition at this early period to become a lawyer is certainly true.</p>
            <p>His friend, David Turnham, was elected constable of the township, and had in
                    consequence gotten possession of a copy of the <hi rend="i">Revised
                    Statutes</hi> of Indiana. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> being especially anxious to read this volume and Turnham being
                    loath to have it leave the house, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> spent hours at Turnham's home devouring this book.</p>
            <p>The volume contained a copy of the Declaration of Independence as well as the
                    National and State Constitutions. These Lincoln studied, committing to memory
                    the Declaration of Independence and large portions of the National Constitution,
                    and for the first time in his life met with legal enactments touching upon
                    slavery.</p>
            <p>Aside from the flatboat trips down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <geogName>Mississippi rivers</geogName>, Young Lincoln saw
                    comparatively little of the <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-014-2-058"/> world without.
                    As has been indicated, he frequented the sittings of the circuit courts at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick county</region>
                    </placeName>, as well as at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer county</region>
                    </placeName>, and was often at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Troy</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In addition to his visits to these comparatively small places, he
                    had an occasion to go at least once a year, after approaching manhood, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson county</region>
                    </placeName>, there being a carding machine located at that place which
                    converted the fleece into rolls ready for the spinning wheel. Hand carding being
                    quite tedious and slow, Young Lincoln was sent with the wool to this machine.
                    The journey was a rather long one for that time, and occupied some three days.
                    These little excursions, together with the usual trips to Gordon's or
                    Hoffman's Mills, relieved the monotony and routine of life, and it is
                    said that these trips were gladly welcomed by the future President.</p>
            <p>The mills for grinding corn in the early days were crude affairs. The
                    "horse-mill" was the first one introduced, small mills
                    propelled by horses hitched to a "sweep." Later, and during
                    the Indiana residence of the Lincolns, Hoffman's water mill was erected
                    on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Anderson</settlement>
                    </placeName> creek. The horse mill at Gordon's was the scene of that
                    incident that Mr. Lincoln was accustomed to revert to again and again,
                    professing to think that it was one of the principal incidents of his life. The
                    circumstance was as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> and young David Turnham had gone to mill, but securing a late start
                    and having to "take their turn," it was quite late in the
                    afternoon when Young Lincoln hitched his father's old flea-bitten gray
                    mare to the sweep, and perching himself upon the accustomed seat began to urge
                    the old mare to a lively pace. He was "clucking" and
                    belaboring the horse with a switch and in the midst of his urgings he started to
                    say: "Get up here, you old hussy," when the old gray resisted
                    the continued drubbing and lifting her hind feet kicked him full in the face.
                    Before the sentence was finished the young man was knocked off the sweep and lay
                    unconscious. Young Turnham ran for help, and soon Abraham's father came
                    with a wagon, placed the unconscious youth in it, and took him home. He lay in a
                    stupor during the greater portion of the night but toward morning showed signs
                    of returning consciousness. <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-014-2-059"/> Erelong he
                    roused up and opening his eyes exclaimed:â€”"you old
                    hussy," thus completing the exclamation attempted the evening before.</p>
            <p>Mr. Herndon, the law partner of Lincoln, said that Lincoln often called attention
                    to this experience of his youth and entered into discussions with him as to the
                    mystery connected with the utterance of these particular words on regaining
                    consciousness.</p>
            <p>Occasionally Young Lincoln was privileged to get a breath of the great world from
                    without by meeting with some chance passerby or "mover" to
                    other regions in the then far West. On one occasion a wagon of one of these
                    emigrants broke down near the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> cabin and while the damaged vehicle was undergoing repairs the wife
                    and daughter on invitation spent the time in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> cabin. What was especially interesting to the youth was that they
                    had a book of stories which the lady read to him. After their journey had been
                    resumed, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, who like the great apostle to the Gentiles turned everything to
                    his advantage, proceeded to write a story of the whole affair; but giving free
                    play to his imagination and fancy he drew the account out at some length,
                    describing in detail his mounting a horse and overtaking the emigrant wagon, and
                    proposing an elopement with the young lady whose father interposed objections to
                    their marriage. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> purposed enlarging upon this story and submitting it for
                    publication, but thought differently concerning it later, and thus the story,
                    which was doubtless crude and altogether unworthy of a place in literature, was
                    lost save that we have preserved the one item of value which was that he was
                    always "scribbling and writing."</p>
            <p>It is rather remarkable that Lincoln did not appoint any of his old associates to
                    any Federal position, since there were at least some three or four of them quite
                    capable. On the score of boyhood friendship it would appear that he would under
                    ordinary circumstances have remembered them, especially when good and efficient
                    service would have been rendered by some of them in certain departments. So far
                    as can be ascertained no applications ever reached him for patronage from any of
                    his old friends, although, as has been heretofore detailed, some two or three
                    journeyed to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> for that <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-014-2-060"/> purpose, but were
                    anticipated and forestalled in such a manner as to prevent any formal request
                    being made. This characteristic seems to have been peculiar to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, for even in the appointment of his friend, Judge David Davis,
                    unusual pressure was made with some suggestion of reluctance even then. The
                    departments were not filled with his old associates, and political loyalty was
                    not especially rewarded by him. This practice was quite the reverse of that of
                    President Grant.</p>
            <p>William Ferrier, well known by the writer, was a boyhood associate of General
                    Grant. He often related the following circumstance which was characteristic of
                    General Grant, although in some respects an exceptional incident; and since it
                    serves as a contrast to the practice of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> it is here given.</p>
            <p>Ferrier was the founder and long the publisher of the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                        </placeName> Record</hi>, an Indiana newspaper in its day wielding
                    considerable power and influence. Ferrier and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grant</settlement>
                    </placeName> were boys together and were great friends. At the time of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grant</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s appointment to West Point, young Ferrier was appointed
                    to Annapolis, but was prevented from entering the Navy by reason of physical
                    disability, and another was selected in his stead who later became a Rear
                    Admiral. Ferrier drifted West and early became an editor. Like Grant, he was a
                    Democrat, but at the outbreak of the Rebellion he boldly changed his political
                    affiliation and became an ardent supporter of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. Later when General Grant became President, his old friend decided
                    to go to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> and call upon him in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House. On entering the waiting room he found a large number of
                    persons, and supposing that it would be some time before he could be admitted he
                    seated himself, and while indulging in this reflection he was surprised greatly
                    on hearing his name called. On regaining his composure somewhat he approached
                    the private office of his boyhood friend with conflicting emotions, very
                    naturally judging that his name must have been recognized as that of an old
                    acquaintance and thus given precedence; at the same time wondering whether he
                    was justified in accepting such courtesy when so many were in waiting, perhaps
                    on urgent business. On entering the room of the President he was greeted by
                    General Grant with the salutation: "How are you, William?" The
                    two old <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-014-2-061"/> friends renewed their former
                    acquaintance by reference to numerous incidents transpiring in their youth. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grant</settlement>
                    </placeName> particularly mentioned the old swimming hole and the time when
                    their clothing was stolen, while Ferrier reminded <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grant</settlement>
                    </placeName> of his driving a particularly fine span of horses down main street
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and cracking his black-snake whip. In recalling this incident
                    Ferrier suggested: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mr. President, although we have been separated all these years, I have
                            watched your career with considerable interest and pride. I have been
                            your supporter, both during the War and in the political campaign, but I
                            give it as my judgment that as great as have been the honors that have
                            been showered upon you, you have never had an occasion to be quite as
                            proud of them as you were that morning in <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
                            </placeName> when you drove those horses.</p>

                </p>

                        <settlement type="city">Grant</settlement>
                    </placeName> laughed heartily and readily acknowledged that "this was
                    probably true." After a few moments in conversation Ferrier arose
                    preparatory to taking his leave, whereupon the President motioned him to be
                    seated, and then unexpectedly asked him if there was not some position at his
                    disposal in the government which Ferrier would like to have. Ferrier, whose
                    purpose in making the call was far removed from this, replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>No, sir, Mr. President, I have no ambition at all to serve the government
                            in any appointive or elective office whatever. I am an editor and enjoy
                            my work, and do not desire to leave it.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>To which the President replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Very well, William, then I'll see to it that you are furnished
                            certain copies of government notices which are at my disposal, and these
                            can be printed by you; they will mean something to you, I hope.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>No opposition was of course made to this, but on the contrary the unexpected
                    offer was received with hearty thanks. On Ferrier's again suggesting
                    that he was unduly taking up the President's time, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grant</settlement>
                    </placeName> motioned him to his chair and asked: "Where is your
                    brother Jim?" Ferrier replied that his brother was a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. "Then, William," announced the
                    President, "I shall appoint Jim as postmaster of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>." "But, Mr. President, my brother is not now, nor
                    has he been an applicant for this position, <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-014-2-062"/>
                    whereas others have, and my understanding is that Senator â€” has this
                    matter at his disposal." "William, I must remember my odd
                    boyhood friends. Jim will be appointed postmaster at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>." "Yes, but Mr. President, while I assure you I
                    appreciate your generosity and friendship, and I feel quite sure that while my
                    brother is not an applicant for the place, he would be more than pleased to
                    receive the appointment. But my understanding is that Senator â€” has
                    already made choice of a gentleman for this place." "William,
                    I am President and Jim will be postmaster."</p>
            <p>The sequel is a matter of history and furnishes very interesting reading in the
                    light of present-day procedure. James Ferrier was appointed postmaster for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Senator â€” interposed objections, the Senate
                    refusing to confirm the appointment. On the adjournment of Congress Ferrier was
                    appointed by Grant, and when Congress reassembled the matter came up and his
                    confirmation again failed. On the adjournment of Congress once more the
                    President appointed Ferrier, and this time the Senate confirmed his appointment.
                    William Ferrier, the editor, enjoyed the government patronage in the matter of
                    public printing as long as this was at the disposal of General Grant.</p>

            <p>Lincoln was enabled to appear before the people as a successful candidate on
                    numerous occasions, and took particular pride in calling attention to the fact
                    that he had never been defeated but once when the people themselves were
                    appealed to, although his methods in some respects were anything but those of a
                    politician.</p>
            <p>He did not concern himself in local elections when he was not a candidate. Being
                    so often before the people for pilitical preferment, there were times when
                    others equally ambitious to serve their party either became Lincoln's
                    opponent or threatened to be. At such times he would seek an interview with
                    them, and with an unconscious arrogancy and priority of claim he would say: <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-014-2-063"/>

            <p>A murder had been committed, and the defendant had employed the brilliant
                    criminal lawyer. The knowledge that "a big lawyer" from an
                    adjoining state was to be connected with the case reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gentryville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a number of men journeyed to Boonville to witness this trial
                    and particularly to hear Breckenridge. Lincoln was, of course, one of this
                    group.</p>
            <p>Breckenridge had been greatly favored by nature, and possessing an enviable
                    reputation as a great lawyer he had become more or less vain. Quite in keeping
                    with the custom of the times among certain classes his dress was particularly
                    fastidious, and his raven black hair was made yet more glossy by a copious use
                    of "bear's ile."</p>
            <p>The court room was crowded, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> stood well to the rear throughout the whole of
                    Breckenridge's argument. At the close of this address a short recess
                    was taken, and during this intermission a number of the members of the bar
                    offered congratulations on the masterly effort of the great advocate. Young
                    Lincoln, witnessing these expressions of appreciation and being profoundly moved
                    by the address himself, straightway resolved to offer his congratulations also.
                    Unmindful of the fact that he was not a member of the bar, that he was dressed
                    in his accustomed blouse, and buckskin breeches, with his coarse black hair
                    disheveled and in wild confusion, he pressed forward, offered his hand to the
                    great man and was on the point of expressing his pleasure at hearing the
                    argument, when Breckenridge deliberately turned his back upon the youth, not
                    deigning to notice him.</p>
            <p>Years went by, and when Lincoln was in the <placeName>

                    exclaimed as he <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-014-2-065"/> grasped the proffered hand:
                    "Oh, yes I know Mr. Breckenridge. I heard you address a jury in a
                    murder trial at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, when I was a boy. I remember that I thought at the time
                    it was a great speech, and that if I could make a speech like that I would be
                    very happy."</p>
            <p>It will be observed throughout that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s ambition "to rise in the world" was
                    overmastering. It was said of a great German that he was the
                    "God-intoxicated man." So it might well have been said of
                    Young Lincoln that he was intoxicated with a consuming desire to acquire
                    knowledge.</p>
            <p>Very naturally one would be led to believe that had such a hungry mind been
                    supplied with books in abundance his advancement would have been rapid. But
                    there is even in this wasted pity and sympathy, judging by some certain things
                    transpiring a little later.</p>
            <p>When Lincoln entered upon the practice of his chosen professionâ€”the
                    lawâ€”and had more or less leisure for study, he read but few books.
                    Associated as he was with Stuart, Logan and Herndon, and the latter possessing a
                    rather pretentious library, yet <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> rarely read these books. It was his custom while out on the circuit
                    to take on these six weeks' journeys school texts, and a great deal of
                    his time was taken up with literature of a lighter character than one would have
                    supposed true in his case. A great deal of his reading was desultory, and he
                    appeared to revel in those publications of a humorous or witty character.
                    Judging by his tastes in this regard, had he been privileged to have access to
                    such publications as <hi rend="i">Judge</hi> or <hi rend="i">Puck</hi>, he would
                    have been greatly delighted.</p>
            <p>It may well be doubted therefore whether any other course than that which he did
                    pursue would have proven any better than the self denial which was imposed upon
                    him, and compelled his complete mastery of the few classics that fell into his
                    possession.</p>
            <p>Contrary to the statement of Colonel Lamon and others who alleged that Lincoln
                    did not read the Bible during his youth, it is indisputably true that he read it
                    again and again. Indeed, if there were no other evidence than his public
                    addresses and State papers to verify this, that would be quite <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-014-2-066"/> sufficient for the very spirit and sentiment of
                    many of them are traceable to the King James version of the Bible.</p>
            <p>But we do not need to rely upon this source altogether for information in the
                    matter, since his associates assert that he was accustomed to read the Bible
                    very much, and such a practice in a youth, which was not at all common then and
                    for that matter is not so today, would well be calculated to occasion comment.</p>

                    Address, likened it to the productions of one of the ancient prophets, and spoke

                    the appellation of a seer.</p>

                    Progress</hi> again and again, and so familiar did he become with it that he
                    could repeat many pages from memory. He particularly admired Aesop's
                        <hi rend="i">Fables</hi>, and so often did he read them that he could have
                    said, as did Lord Macaulay of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s <hi rend="i">Paradise Lost</hi>, that if every copy had
                    been destroyed, he could have reproduced it from memory. Dennis Hanks said that
                    "Young Lincoln would lie down on his face in front of the fire, with
                    Aesop's <hi rend="i">Fables</hi> before him," and read to his
                    stepmother and the "illiterate Denny," as Abraham called him.
                    When some point in the story appealed to him as being funny or humorous, he
                    would laugh and continue laughing so heartily that both Mrs. Lincoln and Dennis
                    would be compelled to join him, although Hanks asserted that "most of
                    the time he did not know what he was laughing about, although Abe said he
                    did."</p>

                    of the family on their arrival in Indiana. The mother of Lincoln was accustomed
                    to read these books to both her daughter Sarah and little Abraham, and it is
                    said that Aesop's <hi rend="i">Fables</hi> possessed a peculiar
                    fascination and charm for him while yet a mere lad at his mother's

            <p>What marvelous transformation was thus wrought in the life of a single youth, and
                    what potential possibilities are wrapped up in a single soul! Left, as Lincoln
                    was, a motherless lad at the tender age of ten, living for one winter in a
                    half-faced camp with no teachers and no schools worthy of the name, yet strange
                    to say mastering some of the world's best classics, which fate, or
                    chance (that Victor Hugo says is only another name for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>) had thrown in his way, and with the Indiana wilderness as his <hi rend="i">Alma Mater</hi> he matriculated at an early age. His curriculum was
                    history, theology, mathematics, literature and woodcraft. His major was history;
                    his frat house, a half-faced camp, and his college campus, a clearing that he
                    had made with his own hands. He left brush college during his freshman year to
                    devote himself exclusively to athletics, in which he particularly excelled,
                    especially with the ax and maul. After a time he took up the study of law,
                    having found a copy of Blackstone's <hi rend="i">Commentaries</hi> in a
                    barrel of plunder which, strange to say, he had purchased from one poorer than
                    himself. He later entered upon the practice of his chosen profession which he
                    followed until he was called to be the chief executive of the nation.</p>

                    fiction ever conceived or invented by literary genius! It is passing therefore
                    strange that the boy Lincoln has for the most part been refused those things
                    that in later years were so marked in his character and which were beyond
                    question sufficiently prominent in his youth as to cause his early associates to
                    remember him by them.</p>
            <p>An effort has been made in the performance of this self-imposed task to show that

                    universally allowed in Mr. Lincoln as a man was also noted in him as a boy and

            <p>It is believed that sufficient data has been offered to substantiate the claim

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and therefore while yet a resident of Indiana, he possessed that

                    strange and weird melancholy, his quaint humor and rare wit, his consuming
                    ambition, certain weaknesses, his abiding faith in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>, his superstitious beliefs, his Calvinistic fatalism which he
                    usually hitched on to a sort of Arminian faith, his freedom from bad habits, his
                    methods in original investigation, his peculiar style in controverted questions,
                    his power with the pen, his honesty and truthfulness, and in fact every
                    characteristic that has been noted in him again and again as a man.</p>
            <p>It is also believed that there is sufficient data submitted to justify the claim
                    that not only was the foundation of Mr. Lincoln's character laid in the
                    Indiana wilderness, but the beginning of all that afterwards made him great
                    asserted itself during these early years.</p>
            <p>It is of course not asserted that Mr. Lincoln's style, both in public
                    address and in composition, was at all perfected while a mere youth, for he
                    seems to have made steady progress in this to the very last. But it is claimed
                    that there is sufficient evidence to warrant the belief that his peculiar style
                    in debate, his platform mannerisms, his cool, calculating logic and irresistible
                    wit and humor were quite as characteristic of his boyhood efforts as they were
                    later noted and so generally commented upon.</p>
            <p>It is recalled that he could set an entire neighborhood laughing and talking
                    about his productions. He impressed himself upon Judge Pitcher and the Baptist
                    minister so as to cause each of them to express keen appreciation of his ability
                    with the pen when his manuscripts on National Politics and Temperance were
                    submitted to them. It would seem to be only a reasonable supposition and not
                    mere conjecture that the man who wrote the second Inaugural Address, the Cooper
                    Institute speech, and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> oration in the day of his power and maturity would have manifested
                    some intimation <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-014-2-069"/> of this great ability and
                    latent power earlier in life a thing which he seems to have done quite often,
                    but more particularly in the compositions above referred to.</p>

            <p>The Lincolns and Hankses left Indiana in the month of March, 1830. John Hanks,
                    after spending four years in the Indiana home of the Lincolns, returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and then moved to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the year 1828. He wrote such glowing accounts of the new country
                    that it caused Dennis Hanks to make a journey to this region with a view of
                    removing there.</p>
            <p>The terrible blight of milk-sick which began its ravages in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gentryville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the year 1818 continued for the next ten years. Dennis Hanks
                    lost all of his cattle in consequence of its ravages, and had been seized with
                    the disease himself, but recovered. When Dennis Hanks decided to leave Indiana
                    for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, he influenced his mother-in-law, Mrs. Lincoln, who did not wish to
                    be separated from her daughter. She seems to have been largely responsible for
                    the removal of the Lincolns also, and accordingly both families and that of Levi
                    Hall, another son-in-law of Mrs. Lincoln, began to make preparation for this
                    change during the winter of 1830.</p>
            <p>The farm of Thomas Lincoln was disposed of to the elder Gentry, if indeed it was
                    not already his by reason of having loaned the money for its purchase
                    originally. At least, a quantity of corn and a drove of hogs were disposed of to
                    Mr. Gentry, and such other changes were wrought as proved necessary to make this
                    journey to begin life anew. Thomas Lincoln had a "chuck
                    wagon," the woodwork being his own construction, but since it was
                    "ironed off," it was a subject of considerable comment, for
                    such vehicles were exceedingly rare. It was necessary to have suitable teams of
                    oxen, and accordingly there began more or less "swapping and
                    dickering". In the main this was done by Dennis Hanks, John Johnson and
                    Abraham Lincoln. Allen Brooner stated that two of these oxen <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-014-2-070"/> were obtained from him, Abraham Lincoln and John
                    Johnson making this trade. There was considerable "haggling"
                    over the trade on the part of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Johnson</region>,
                            <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
               </placeName> not entering into the
                    matter save in an incidental way. Brooner long afterward, in speaking of this
                    circumstance, said: "If anybody had asked me that day to pick out a
                    President, I'd a quickly made choice of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson</region>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>The elder Hall sold the other yoke of cattle to Thomas Lincoln, but these were
                    purchased by proxy, he having sent his son Abraham and Dennis Hanks to do the
                    trading. Wesley Hall delivered the team to Hanks and Young Lincoln.</p>
            <p>Hall was present on the occasion of the beginning of the journey to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. However, the Lincolns only journeyed that afternoon as far as
                    Gentry's in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gentryville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and remained over night with that gentleman. During the night
                    Young Lincoln made a judicious selection of notions, such as needles, pins,
                    thread, knives, forks and spoons, his purchase amounting to just thirty dollars.
                    With this "peddler's outfit" he purposed realizing a
                    profit by disposing of it along the way at the farmhouses. This he seems to have
                    succeeded in doing beyond his expectations, for "he wrote back after
                    his arrival in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> stating that he doubled his money".</p>
            <p>The people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gentryville</settlement>
                    </placeName> were loath to see the Lincolns leave, and it is said that on the
                    morning of their final departure quite a crowd collected to bid them farewell.
                    Many of them accompanied the Lincolns some distance on their journey, among them
                    being the elder Gentry. One man in telling of seeing them begin their journey
                    stated that "Abe drove the oxen, having a rope attached to the horn of
                    a lead ox, and with a hickory â€˜gadâ€™ in his free
                    hand."</p>
            <p>None of the party of thirteen ever returned to the scenes of their fourteen
                    years' residence in Indiana save Abraham, and, as has been stated, he
                    spent three days in and about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gentryville</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the political campaign of 1844 making three speeches in that
                    county. He was the guest of the Gentrys most of the time. However, after making
                    the speech at Carter's schoolhouse he accepted the urgent invitation of
                    "Blue Nose" Crawford to accompany him home. He was much the
                    same Lincoln then that his old friends had known fourteen <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-014-2-071"/> years before. He quite readily recognized all of
                    his old neighbors, calling them by their given names, and made inquiry as to
                    certain things in which he had been especially interested prior to his leaving
                    there. He expressed a desire on reaching the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford</region>
                    </placeName> home to see the old whip-saw-pit where he had stood as the
                    "under man" on many an occasion whip-sawing lumber.</p>
            <p>Sometime after Lincoln had been in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House, seventeen years having elapsed since seeing his boyhood home
                    and meeting with his old friends, a gentleman from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gentryville</settlement>
                    </placeName> visited him in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, his purpose in making the journey being merely to gratify his
                    curiosity and pleasure in beholding the greatness of his old boyhood friend. On
                    his arrival at the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House he found quite a number of people in waiting. He sent in his
                    name, and supposed, of course, that the rule here would be something similar to
                    what he and the then present occupant of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House had been accustomed to in their boyhood in going to
                    Gordon's Millâ€”first come, first served. But he was greatly
                    surprised a few moments after making his presence known to hear his name called,
                    and on entering the private office of the President he was warmly greeted with
                    the old time cordiality. They had conversed but a short while when Lincoln said
                    to him: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> waiting for him. After they had dined Lincoln said: "Now
                    come with me", and leading the way they reached a room on the second
                    floor. After entering, the President turned the key, he then pulled off his
                    coat, and seating himself on the small of his back with his feet resting upon
                    the table he began asking numerous questions concerning his old neighbors. The

                            always a jokin' and cuttin' up, and I
                            couldn't see anything in him then that looked like my notion of

                    He was the very embodiment of the homlier virtues of truth, sincerity and

            <p>General Andrew Jackson has ever been popularly regarded as one possessing that
                    democracy of spirit scarcely equalled by any other chief executive of our
                    nation. It may be altogether fitting in this connection to relate an incident
                    having to do with this element in "Old Hickory". An old
                        <geogName>Shenandoah Valley</geogName> neighbor of the writer often related
                    the following circumstance concerning <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName>, and since it seems good enough to be true, and judging by the
                    character and standing of the old neighbor, it is believed to be true.</p>
            <p>Some twenty-five teamsters were hauling iron ore to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
                    </placeName> from a point in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, each man driving a four-horse team. It was while Jackson was
                    President that on one occasion, after the wagons and teams had been disposed of
                    in the big wagon yards at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, an uncle of the informant, Baker by name, proposed to the crowd
                    that they go over to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House and pay their respects to "Old Hickory".
                    Practically all of the men opposed the proposition, since they were in their
                    work-a-day garb, and it was suggested by some that on their next trip they come
                    prepared for this visit to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House by each bringing along suitable apparel. But Baker was
                    insistent, and so much so that one man, to some extent spokesman for all the
                    rest, said, addressing Baker: "If you'll do all the talking,
                    we'll go." Whereupon Baker replied: "Certainly,
                    I'll do that provided all of you will do what I ask you to
                    do." When it was asked as to what was expected of them, Baker drew his
                    black-snake whip about his neck and tying the free end of the lash into a bow
                    with the stock hanging down in front, not unlike a yoke, said: "Now,
                    men, all of you do as I have and then fall in line by twos and follow
                    me." This was done, and the twenty-five Virginians marched up to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White</region>
                    </placeName> House, with Baker leading them. When the door opened in response to
                    their ring, an old-time colored man stood looking out upon this strange sight,
                    manifesting surprise, and then bowing quite low he asked what was wanted. Baker,
                    true to his promise, acted as spokesman and straightway requested that the party
                    be taken in and given an audience with the President. The door closed behind the
                    old colored man, and ere long it was opened again, and with another low bow the
                    old fellow announced: "Gemmen, de President's busy and
                    can't <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-014-2-075"/> see you." But Baker
                    was not to be disposed of so easily, for now quickly stepping up near the old
                    man and lifting his voice, cried out: "We came to see the President,
                    and we are going to do so before we go away." Just then a voice within,
                    with a sort of military ring in it, was heard asking: "What's
                    the matter out front? What does that crowd of men want?" Presently the
                    door was thrown wide open, sending the old servant with it, and Jackson stood
                    facing Baker and his twenty-four neighbors. The President, without any word of
                    greeting or salutation, immediately asked: "What's wanted,
                    men?" Baker, having uncovered and each man doing so in like manner,
                    replied: "Mr. President, we are Virginians and your friends, and we
                    have no business with you at all save that we just wished to call and see you,
                    that's all." <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName>'s brow, which at first was knitted into a frown, at once
                    cleared, and turning about face he said to Baker and his men: "Follow
                    me." Baker leading the way and the men following by twos, each one with
                    his hat under his arm, filed into a "big room on the right."
                    As they entered it was observed that quite a number of well-dressed gentlemen
                    were in the room, and seeing the Virginians following Jackson they all arose and
                    quickly stepped back near the wall with a look of astonishment and wonder upon
                    each face. Jackson did not stop until a small table was reached on the opposite
                    side of the room from the door of entrance, and going behind this and resting
                    his hand upon it with a sort of lurking twinkle in either eye, he said,
                    addressing Baker who now stood immediately in front of him: "You say
                    that you are Virginians and wish to see me. Is there anything I can do for
                    you?" to which Baker replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>No, sir, Mr. President, we have not come to ask any favor of you, as I
                            said. These men with me are my neighbors. We are all Virginians and your
                            friends and supporters. We are teamsters and haul iron ore to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
                            </placeName>, and I proposed that we come over and call on you. Some of
                            the men did not want to come dressed as we are, and I told them
                            we'd go just as you see us."</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>While Baker was making this explanation it was observed that a peculiar look came
                    over the President's features as if he were especially pleased, and
                    then he said: "You say <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-014-2-076"/> you just
                    wished to see the President, and now that you have seen â€˜Old
                    Hickoryâ€™ what do you think of him?"</p>
            <p>Baker, apparently being equal to just such an emergency as this, quickly
                    observed: "Mr. President, we think he does pretty well for a
                    â€˜shell barkâ€™." Some of the men composing the
                    party afterward confessed grave fears as to just how this familiarity of their
                    spokesman would be received, but all suspense was quickly relieved by Jackson
                    giving himself up to unrestrained laughter. Straightening up to his full
                    stature, with his features set hard, and looking toward the gentlemen standing
                    about the wall, he said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Gentlemen, you are all Englishmen and accustomed as you are to certain

                            like this. You very naturally ask what is the secret of our greatness as
                            a nation and how we are going to maintain our liberties. I'll
                            answer you by saying that we have had two wars with your nation,
                            although now we are happily at peace. I had something to do in both of

                            here, and as long as men in their work-a-day clothes think they have a

                    gave words of greeting. General Jackson was quite democratic, hating kings and

                    spirit, while Lincoln possessed all of the democracy of <placeName>

            <p>In the year 1818 Abraham Lincoln experienced a great misfortune in the death of
                    his mother. The many exacting duties incident to pioneer life doubtless
                    constituted a factor in producing that strange melancholy that ever possessed
                    him, but to be bereft of his mother at the age of ten was perhaps <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-014-2-077"/> in the main responsible for this. At least it
                    justifies the belief that such a sad misfortune at this period of his life,
                    together with some of the attending circumstances, readily took advantage of a

            <p>Comparatively little is known concerning Nancy Hanks and there is small wonder,
                    since nothing eventful transpired in her life beyond those things common to the

                    her more immediate relatives as to her obscure origin. She certainly did not
                    attempt to correct this belief, and doubtless was possessed with the same idea
                    as were others. That there has been a more or less labored effort on the part of
                    certain biographers of Mr. Lincoln to account for his exceptional ability by
                    professing a marked partiality for his maternal ancestry is known to all.</p>

                            angular with an expression of melancholy which fixed itself in the
                            memory of anyone who ever saw or knew her. Though her life was seemingly
                            clouded by a spirit of sadness, she was in disposition amiable and
                            generally cheerful. Mr. Lincoln said to me in 1851, on receiving the <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-014-2-078"/> news of his father's
                            death, that whatever might be said of his parents and however
                            unpromising the early surroundings of his mother may have been, she was
                            highly intellectual by nature and had a strong memory, acute judgment,
                            and was cool and heroic. From a mental standpoint she no doubt rose
                            above her surroundings, and had she lived, the stimulus of her nature
                            would have accelerated her son's success. She would have been a
                            much more ambitious prompter than bis father ever was.</p>

            <p>That Mr. Lincoln possessed the melancholy self-control, cool and calculating
                    judgment and natural goodness of his mother is apparent, and even marks of
                    facial resemblance are conceded. Some certain and important traits of character
                    are also traceable to the father, and taking it all in all these latter
                    qualities are quite as important as were the others. That faculty and habit of
                    story telling so natural to the President, his peculiar and quaint method of
                    relating them and their appreantly inexhaustible supply were characteristic of
                    not only his father, but true of his uncles, Mordecai and Josiah, as well as of
                    many of his <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> cousins.</p>
            <p>Without suggesting any lack in the family of his mother of that greatest of all
                    traits which he possessedâ€”that of honestyâ€”and for which he
                    is so justly famed, it must be said in all fairness that whatever by nature,
                    example and precept he received from the mother that caused a nation to call her
                    son "Honest Abe", certainly honesty was a dominant trait of
                    the father and the one characteristic that stands out so prominently in the life
                    of practically every <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>. Dennis Hanks confessed that Lincoln was indebted to his father for
                    his uncompromising honesty rather than to the Hankses.</p>
            <p>Judging by the data in hand, therefore, it may be said that the Lincolns were the
                    equal of the Hankses in social standing and ancestry, and in fact there is
                    discerned a favorable comparison in substantially all other things ordinarily
                    considered in such matters.</p>
            <p>It should particularly be said that the meagerness of knowledge concerning Nancy
                    Hanks, and more especially her early death, furnished a large field for
                    conjecture and the freest possible play of the imagination. Since Thomas Lincoln
                    lived until the year 1851, having ever remained a simple-minded, illiterate
                    pioneer, never at any time distinguishing <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-014-2-079"/>
                    himself, it became the fashion to speak lightly and even disparagingly of him as
                    compared to his wife, Nancy Hanks, who dying while quite young, became a subject
                    for adulation and eulogy, and whatever was deemed wanting in the father and
                    husband was readily supposed to have been possessed by the mother and wife.</p>
            <p>That Nancy Hanks was somewhat exceptional and in every way worthy of such an
                    illustrious son appears to be abundantly evident in spite of the meagerness of
                    data at hand. That she must have wielded a strong influence upon him is equally
                    true, and perhaps even greater than we can possibly know. Yet, in all fairness
                    it must be said that Mr. Lincoln seldom mentioned his mother in later life, but
                    again and again paid great tribute to his stepmother and it was the stepmother,
                    not Nancy Hanks, of who he spoke when he used the oft-quotetd lines (usually
                    misquoted): "Al that I am and ever hope to be I owe to my angel of a
                    mother."</p>
            <p>Any attempt to account for the remarkable career of Abraham Lincoln must give a
                    large place to the plans and purposes of the Almighty. The Jewish nation spent
                    four centuries in a strange land before it produced its great prophet, military
                    leader and law-giver, Moses. We do not ordinarily attempt to account for the
                    career of Moses by emphasizing his lineage and learning so much as we do the
                    fact that God was with him from the time he was placed in the little pitch
                    basket among the bulrushes of the Nile until the day when he climbed the mount
                    to die.</p>
            <p>Bishop Charles Fowler, in his lecture on "Abraham Lincoln",
                    related the following incident in the life of the President which transpired
                    when Lincoln was twenty-eight years of age. A short distance from
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, an old-fashioned
                    camp-meeting was in progress in a grove. A party of seven men, composed of
                    physicians, lawyers and ministers, had decided to attend these services one
                    night.</p>
            <p>On this particular occasion Lincoln was in a hilarious mood, joking with the
                    lawyers, preachers and doctors in succession, and even thrusting humorous
                    remarks upon the horses drawing the vehicle in which they were riding. He <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-014-2-080"/> kept every one laughing by his stories and
                    "yams", until the grove was reached.</p>
            <p>That evening a pioneer minister preached a sermon of unusual power, occasioning
                    considerable religious excitement. While the discourse throughout was stirring
                    and thoughtful, the peroration was particularly so. In this he referred to Moses
                    leading the children of <placeName>
                        <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                    </placeName> out of Egyptian bondage, and laid stress upon the fact that God had
                    called him for such a purpose in the fulness of time. Then, as was frequently
                    the case in pulpits of that day, he pronounced a curse upon African slavery in
                    America, prophesying that "the Almighty would raise up a leader to
                    smite this curse." As he closed his remarks he lifted his hands
                    beseechingly, and in a burst of prophetic fervor exclaimed: "Who knows
                    but that the man destined to liberate the slaves in our land is here
                    tonight."</p>
            <p>On the return journey of the group, for whom <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> had furnished so much amusement and fun, he was strangely silent,
                    so much so as to speak only occasionaly when addressed by some member of the
                    party. This silence was noted by all, and elicited more or less comment on the
                    following day. Sometime during the day after the journey taken, one member of
                    the camp-meeting visitors had occasion to call on <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>, and found him still gloomy and depressed. Thinking to rally him by
                    some reference to the occurrences of the evening before, he proceeded to do so,
                    and thereupon <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> remarked as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>You remember, of course, what the preacher said about slavery and in his
                            peroration that "God would raise up a man to smite
                            slavery", and closed by saying: "Who knows but that he
                            is here tonight." Well, you and others may thing me foolish,
                            but I had the conviction then and still have it that I am that man.</p>

                </p>
            <p>At the time of the death of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s mother there was mourning in practically every home of
                    the entire neighborhood, for that dread disease peculiar to the pioneer days,
                    known as milk-sick, had appeared in epidemic form and attacked beasts as well as
                    men. Thomas and Betsy Sparrow, who had in part reared Nancy Hanks, and who had
                    followed the Lincolns to Indiana, living in the abandoned half faced camp, were
                    both stricken with this scourge and died <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-014-2-081"/>
                    about the same time Mrs. Lincoln did. In fact, of the twenty-five families in
                    this settlement, many of whom were former <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> neighbors of the Lincolns, more than half were claimed by this
                    strange malady.</p>
            <p>Medical assistance was not to be had nearer than thirty miles; and even had there
                    been sufficient attention, it is altogether doubtful whether the ravages of this
                    destroyer of the pioneers could have been arrested.</p>
            <p>One may form some idea of the extent to which the pioneers were governed by stern
                    necessity when it is recalled that Thomas Lincoln, the husband, on the death of
                    his wife was forced to perform a part of the offices of an undertaker. There
                    being no one save himself in that community sufficiently skilled with tools to
                    construct a coffin, he did this, and at the same time made coffins in which to
                    bury Thomas and Betsy Sparrow. He was not a stranger to this kind of work, since
                    he was in the habit of doing it for the entire community. The lumber with which
                    the coffin for Nancy Hanks Lincoln was made was whipsawed out of a log unused in
                    the building of the wilderness cabin. Dennis Hanks and Thomas Lincoln sawed the
                    planks, and while they were thus engaged, Abraham whittled out the wooden pins
                    which the elder Lincoln used to fasten the planks together, there being no nails
                    in this part of the world at that time.</p>
            <p>The writer knew two persons who were present at the funeral of Nancy Hanks
                    Lincoln. Her burial, which took place a few hundred yards to the south of the
                    cabin home, was denied even the usual committal services, there being no
                    officiating minister present. Indeed, at this time there was no church or
                    minister nearer than thirty miles.</p>
            <p>The writer on one occasion had pointed out to him the spot near the foot of the
                    grave where little Abraham stood weeping while the rude casket was being
                    lowered. The Reverend Allen Brooner, then a mere lad, was present on this
                    occasion. He lost his own mother a few days after the burial of Mrs. Lincoln and
                    she was buried by the side of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s mother; consequently the circumstances became indelibly
                    fixed in his memory. No stone marked these graves for years, and when it was
                    proposed to erect a small monument to the <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-014-2-082"/>
                    memory of Nancy Hanks Lincoln, there was some difference of opinion as to which
                    of the two graves was hers, but the statement of Brooner was final.</p>
            <p>Although Abraham was but ten years of age at this time, yet impressed with the
                    fact that his mother's memory was entitled to the usual funeral
                    services that he had been accustomed to witness, he wrote a letter requesting
                    the services of Parson Elkins, an itinerant Baptist minister who resided in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and who had visited the home of the Lincolns in that State,
                    frequently conducting services there and doubtless officiated at the burial of
                    his baby brother. At any rate, Elkins had impressed himself upon the mind and
                    heart of the lad so that he did not hesitate to presume upon his good offices by
                    asking that he travel a hundred miles through this wilderness.</p>
            <p>The boy's confidence in thus presuming upon the willingness of the
                    pioneer preacher to come to him in his need was not misplaced, for although he
                    made this journey and preached the funeral discourse at the grave side without
                    remuneration, yet, like Mary in breaking the alabaster box of precious ointment,
                    Parson Elkins' offices on this occasion have enshrined his memory in
                    the hearts of Christendom and his name by this one deed alone has been redeemed
                    from that oblivion to which it would have otherwise been consigned.</p>
            <p>One may stand at the grave side of the mother of Lincoln today, look through the
                    woods to the north and see the little knoll on which then stood the cabin where
                    now looms up with comparatively large dimensions a high school building
                    immediately in front of the cabin siteâ€”an institution that would have
                    been regarded by Lincoln in his youth as Heaven sent.</p>
            <p>Marked changes have been wrought since that mournful pioneer funeral procession
                    took its sad way down the slope and through the wood to the elevated spot where
                    his mother sleeps. In making this little journey now one crosses the steam
                    railroad track, passes beneath the telephone and telegraph wires, and walks by
                    the mouth of a coal mineâ€”all telling of another civilization and
                    another age, for they all came after <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s removal to <placeName>

            <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-014-2-083"/>
            <p>It is claimed, and not without sufficient grounds, that the place where the
                    future President spent his youth and reached his majority, and where he formed
                    and matured his character, possessing as he did while yet a youth substantially
                    all of those eminent traits that we are accustomed to note in him as a man, that
                    place where his mother now sleeps and where his only sister lies buried, is of
                    the greatest possible interest, and in view of such world-wide admiration of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> it is deserving of suitable recognition by our general government.</p>
            <p>The State of Indiana some years since, aided by individuals, erected a modest
                    monument to the memory of Nancy Hanks Lincoln, the mother of the President, and
                    made purchase of the grounds adjoining her burial place which now constitute
                    what is known as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> park.</p>
            <p>As commendable as was this belated tribute, unfortunately the site of the cabin
                    home of Lincoln was not included in this purchase and this place yet remains in
                    the hands of private individuals. Should there come a time (and it will) when
                    this spot shall have been appropriately honored beyond that hitherto attempted,

                            Nation's crisis; but it was here in Indiana that these enduring
                            traits of character found their setting, without which he would have
                            failed in his gigantic task, and, possessing them as he did, they later
                            fashioned him into a mighty leader destined under God to give this
                            nation a new birth of freedom, that "the government of the
                            people for the people and by the people might not perish from the
                            earth."</p>

            <p>In a year after the death of Mrs. Lincoln, Thomas Lincoln made a visit to his old
                    home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, leaving Dennis <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-014-2-084"/> Hanks, Abraham
                    and his sister Sarah in the wilderness. The motive in making this visit became
                    apparent to those remaining behind when on his return he brought with him a
                    bride and her three children, Matilda, Sarah and John D. Johnson, children by a
                    former marriage. The second Mrs. Lincoln, who was destined to wield a remarkable
                    influence over the future President, was a woman somewhat above the average
                    pioneer. Her coming to this destitute home was timely, since Abraham had now
                    reached that age when he stood in need of just such encouragement and sympathy
                    as she was eminently capable of giving and which she freely bestowed upon him.</p>
            <p>In an interview with Mr. Herndon she said, in speaking of this period and of
                    Abraham in particular: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I Induced my husband to permit Abe to read and study at home as well as
                            at school. At first he was not easily reconciled to it, but finally he
                            seemed willing to encourage him to a certain extent. Abe was a dutiful
                            son to me always. We took particular care when he was reading not to
                            disturb him, and we let him read on and on until he quit of his own
                            accord.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Mrs. Lincoln had been left a widow, and at the time
                    of her marriage to Thomas Lincoln was living "on an alley of the town
                    in a log cabin," she was highly regarded by her neighbors and possessed
                    a pride and bearing quite beyond that which her condition would ordinarily
                    appear to warrant. The proud spirit that characterized her then was never broken
                    by any of the vicissitudes of her later years. She was quite superior in many
                    ways to her husband. Her gifts and graces were so pronounced as to call forth in
                    later years splendid tributes of praise from both her own children and her step
                    son. The changes wrought in the wilderness cabin home soon after her coming
                    occasioned neighborhood comment, and made such an impression upon Dennis Hanks,
                    an inmate of the home and later her son-in-law, as to cause that gentleman to
                    pay her grateful praise.</p>
            <p>Aside from the refinement and culture which she possessed, tending to inspire her
                    household to emulate her, she caused her husband to make certain needful changes
                    in the cabin by hanging a door, laying a floor and cutting a window. <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-014-2-085"/> She brought with her certain household effects,
                    such as beds, bedding, bureau, many cooking utensils, knives and
                    forksâ€”in all a four horse wagon load, so that there is small wonder
                    the cheerless cabin took on new life and caused Abraham in later life, when
                    recalling these scenes, to say: "She made me feel like I was
                    human."</p>
            <p>It is claimed that at this time young Abraham was a good boy, affectionate,
                    loving his parents well and obedient to their every wish. Although anything but
                    impudent or rude, he was sometimes uncomfortably inquisitive when strangers
                    would ride along or pass by his father's fence, and he always, either
                    through boyish pride or to tease his father, would be sure to ask the first
                    question. For this his father would sometimes knock him over, but when thus
                    punished he never "bellowed, but would drop a kind of silent unwelcome
                    tear as evidence of his sensitiveness or other feelings."</p>
            <p>So inquisitive and eager for news was he that on one occasion when a stranger
                    rode up to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> home to make inquiries as to the road Abraham straightway asked:
                    "What's the news, stranger?" Before any reply could
                    be made the father, who was attempting to give proper directions of the way,
                    turned and rebuked his son for his interruption. In a moment or two young
                    Abraham again asked: "Stranger, what's the news where you come
                    from?" This time the indignant father, desiring to silence the
                    inquisitive son, quickly swung his arm, struck the boy full in the mouth with
                    the back of the hand, knocking him down. Young Lincoln, on regaining his feet
                    and perching himself at a safe distance on the fence, as the stranger was
                    drawing rein preparatory to ride on his way, once more eagerly asked:
                    "I say, stranger, what is the news?"</p>
            <p>During his Indiana residence up to the time of his mother's death,
                    Abraham Lincoln had not been privileged to attend school. Soon after the coming
                    of his step mother to the home he was sent to school, his first teacher being
                    Mr. Dorsey who "kept school" not far from the Little Pigeon
                    church. In all he attended three different sessions or terms during his Indiana
                    residence, one at ten years of age, another at fourteen and a very brief term
                    during his seventeenth <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-014-2-086"/> year. The entire
                    time thus spent in the school room was less than one year during his life, and
                    he was indebted to his step mother for the privilege of attending school at all
                    after reaching an age when such an opportunity might reasonably promise profit.
                    Such privilege was accompanied by a keen appreciation and gratitude that enabled
                    him richly to repay her in later years for her kindness and partiality. The debt
                    that mankind owes this elect lady can never now be paid save in grateful
                    remembrance of her timely foresight, and thankfulness for wisdom and direction
                    perhaps not altogether of Earth. From the first <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> and his step-mother became great friends. In her old age she
                    expressed a decided partiality for him, even indicating a love beyond that for
                    her own son.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName>'s great stature and lumbering gait were a subject of
                    neighborhood comment, and Mrs. Lincoln and his father often joked him concerning
                    them also. The elder Lincoln was in the habit of remarking that "Abe
                    looked like he had been chopped out with an ax and needed the jack plane to
                    smooth him down." Mrs. Lincoln said to him on one occasion when she saw
                    him "bump" his head as he came through the cabin door:
                    "Abe, I don't care much about the mud you carry in on the
                    floor, for that can be scrubbed, but you must be careful with my whitewashed
                    ceiling and not damage it." The next day Young Lincoln hunted up a
                    crowd of youngsters, and after causing them to wade through a pond of muddy
                    water, he marched them to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> cabin, picked them up one by one and made them walk across the
                    ceiling with their muddy feet. When Mrs. Lincoln came home and noted the
                    condition of the ceiling she laughed right heartily. Abraham then walked a long
                    distance after lime, prepared whitewash, and once more made the cabin ceiling
                    immaculate.</p>
