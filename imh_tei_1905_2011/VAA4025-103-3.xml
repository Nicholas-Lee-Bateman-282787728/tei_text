                    family conditions.&quot; Next to news about recent hot weather and the comings and goings of IU
                    professors, notice of the course likely generated little interest in the small, south-central <placeName>

                    resignation of its lead faculty member, zoology professor Alfred C. Kinsey, in September 1940. The
                    marriage course proved to be an important moment in Kinsey&apos;s intellectual history.
                    Fascinated by the intimate sex histories of course participants that he had begun to record, and
                    discouraged by the turn to laboratory work in evolutionary biology, he gave up teaching the course
                    after seven sessions in order to focus on the initial data for what would become his two largest and
                    most comprehensive works, <hi rend="i">Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</hi> and <hi rend="i"

                <p>Marriage courses appeared on two- and four-year college campuses across the country beginning in the
                    late 1920s, amid dramatic cultural change in the lives of teenagers and college-aged young people.
                    Secular educators attempted to teach Christian morals and values while realizing that modern
                    technology and urbanization had irreversibly transformed marriage. The first version of the IU
                    marriage course in summer 1938 (with one important exception) followed the standard format of other
                    marriage courses throughout the <placeName>

                    scientific field of sexology. The course included optional personal conferences with the lead
                    instructor, also a common practice. But Kinsey&apos;s lectures for the course began to diverge
                    from standard marriage instruction rhetoric. The shift began when students told him how much they
                    appreciated learning about the uniqueness of people&apos;s sexual anatomy and desires, and when
                    he began to do more intensive research in sex, with data from marriage course students and from
                    other nonstudent groups. As Kinsey discovered the diversity of sexual behavior among undergraduate
                    and graduate students, faculty wives, and heterosexuals and homosexuals in <placeName>

                    its obvious focus on improving nuptial bonds, was not designed to answer. As changes in the texts of
                    Kinsey&apos;s lectures show, over time he focused less on how a healthy sex life enriches and
                    stabilizes marriage and more on a broad range of human sexual experience. While the question of sex
                    in marriage would remain one focus of Kinsey&apos;s analysis, it would no longer be the only
                    one.</p>
                <p>Changes in Kinsey&apos;s lectures during the marriage course show his increased interest in
                    applying his own version of scientific method to sex research. The importance of a biological
                    approach to social problems, which Kinsey first learned from his graduate advisor, William Morton
                    Wheeler, became increasingly clear to him as he gathered sex histories and read more widely in the
                    developing field of sexology. As historian Stephen Garton has written, the study of early sex
                    research &quot;is a means of exploring how sexologists, psychiatrists, hygienists, sociologists,
                    and reformers constructed commonplace knowledge about sex.&quot; This article shows how Kinsey
                    constructed human sexuality, for his students and for himself, using his conception of scientific
                    method. Based on more than twenty years of biological research, he learned (and taught) that a large
                    sample size and broad geographic distribution were necessary if a research project were to yield
                    significant results. Those precepts, combined with faith in standard scientific method (observation,
                    recording, and interpretation of naturally occurring entities and events), would be solid
                    foundations on which he could base valid conclusions. As he wrote to his friend and former graduate
                    student Ralph Voris in late 1939, &quot;We will prove to these social scientists [psychologists,
                    psychiatrists, and sociologists] that a biological background can help in interpreting social
                    phenomena.&quot; After he gave up the marriage course in September 1940, Kinsey was able to
                    devote most of his research time to gathering sex histories, downplaying the counseling angle of the
                    individual conference, refining his interviewing technique, and figuring out patterns in his data,
                    using scientific method as he did so.<hi rend="sup">3</hi></p>

                    their sexual behavior and mindset as a result of new knowledge and shifts in contemporary social
                    mores. Much of what we can learn about IU students&apos; reactions to the marriage course comes
                    from their written course evaluations. Students not only provided feedback on the course itself but
                    also defended it against campus gossip, supporting Kinsey as pressure for his resignation grew.
                    Their comments suggest how seriously they took the course and reveal their dislike of lecturers who
                    spoke in unhelpful generalities or predicted married lives full of strife. The comments also provide
                    insight into the development of Kinsey&apos;s thinking and teaching on sex and suggest how young
                    people in a small midwest- ern college town were managing their sexual feelings and desires.<hi

                <p>Finally, I contest the common perception that the IU marriage course and Kinsey&apos;s sex
                    research in general were the products of Kinsey&apos;s overripe obsession with sex, as
                    biographer James H. Jones has argued. Jones postulates that Kinsey moved from studying gall wasps to
                    studying human sexuality with such intensity and thoroughness because he was driven by guilt about
                    his homosexuality, masturbation, and self-mutilation. For Jones, all of Kinsey&apos;s work is
                    rooted in that guilt, despite the fact that Kinsey himself never made connections between his
                    personality, his sexual identity, and his work, and despite the fact that Jones admits that
                    &quot;almost certainly, Kinsey did not consider himself a homosexual or masochist.&quot;<hi
                        rend="sup">5</hi> Compounding the difficulty of Jones&apos;s theory, most of his claims
                    about Kinsey&apos;s sex life come from interviews with three anonymous sources. Neither Jones
                    nor his fellow Kinsey biographer Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, who interviewed the same anonymous
                    individuals, has released the interview transcripts for other scholars to verify. Facing
                    unverifiable quotes from anonymous sources, it is difficult to lend credence to such claims about
                    the relationship of Kinsey&apos;s sex life and work. Instead, this article will suggest that
                    Kinsey&apos;s interest in studying sexuality stemmed from his failure to advance a

                    &quot;marriage crisis&quot; of the 1920s and 1930s. The 1920s had seen significant changes
                    in gender roles and sexual mores in American society: woman suffrage, the rise of popular
                    Freudianism, public debates over artificial birth control (and thus the separation of sex from
                    procreation), an increasingly visible youth culture, and the rise of what Colorado judge Ben Lindsey
                    would name &quot;companionate marriage.&quot; In this type of marriage, romantic love and
                    sexual congruence took priority over financial stability and family background, and adults made
                    their own choices about partners with little to no parental input, no expectation of children, few
                    moral qualms about divorce, and unproblematic use of pre- and post-marital birth con- trol. In his
                    desire to hold on to some traditional values in the face of such increasingly popular marital
                    choices, Ernest Groves, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,
                    began teaching junior and senior men the skills he thought they needed to navigate dating and mating
                    in a new social climate. Drawing from his classes and from his individual conferences with many of
                    the students, Groves wrote a textbook on marriage education; and with the publication of <hi

                <p>By 1938--when Kinsey began the IU marriage course--marriage education in high schools and colleges
                    was a small industry, with approximately 250 U.S. colleges and universities hosting such courses.
                    Marriage courses often combined lecture and small-group discussion, or lecture and individual
                    conferences with instructors as regular features. The most prominent figures in marriage
                    education--including Groves, Joseph Kirk Folsom (Vassar College), and Henry Bowman (Stephens
                    College)--used the personal conference as part of standard marriage course practice. Evidence does
                    not support Jones&apos;s statement that &quot;[student] conferences allowed Kinsey to
                    transform his private needs into professional duty,&quot; at least not in that

                <p>Kinsey&apos;s shift from studying gall wasps to the marriage course, and then to studying human
                    sexual behavior, came in the context of more general changes in the study of entomology and
                    evolution. By the mid-1930s, Kinsey&apos;s taxonomy-based gall wasp research was increasingly
                    out of sync with the laboratory-based focus of the new intellectual movement known as the
                    evolutionary synthesis. He learned, from presenting his own evolutionary theory at a 1936 meeting of
                    the American Association for the Advancement of Science, that the audiences for evolutionary studies
                    expected synthetic theories with broad applications, regardless of his insistence on the limited
                    nature of his conclusions. Kinsey was not interested in changing his entomological research
                    methodology to match evolutionary theory&apos;s new emphasis on mathematical population
                    genetics, so he made a decision, over time, to adapt his scientific method to a human research
                        population.<hi rend="sup">9</hi></p>
                <p>Kinsey&apos;s fifteen years of work with secondary science educators (and students in the field)

                    records of his involvement in Indiana high school biology curriculum development suggest that he had
                    given considerable thought to the problem of teaching human sexuality (including masturbation and
                    venereal disease) and reproduction to young people before the marriage course began. He argued in
                        <hi rend="i">Methods in Biology</hi> that if sex and reproduction were taught without
                    &quot;any reference to the social and moral problems involved, and above all avoiding any
                    emotional display in the presentation of the material, the reactions of the students should present
                    no difficulties.&quot; Kinsey also identified a more serious problem underlying poor sex
                    education. &quot;Under the guise of science,&quot; he continued, &quot;we too often have
                    sex instruction which is a curious even if a well-intentioned mixture of superstition, religious
                    evaluation, and a mere perpetuation of social custom.&quot; Kinsey thought it best to use his
                    version of the scientific method (large sample size, wide geographic distribution, and data obtained
                    by observation) for evaluating materials to teach high school students about biology and human
                    reproduction. His approach to teaching college students about sex would be no different.<hi

                <p>In early 1938, an informal IU student group, including leaders of the Association of Women Students
                    (AWS), contacted Kinsey about chairing a course in the summer. There were many reasons why some
                    among the 6,000-member IU student body became interested in hosting a marriage course. First, some
                    students had likely become aware of the growing number of marriage courses at other campuses through
                    reading the <hi rend="i">Indiana Daily Student</hi> &quot;Collegiana&quot; column (which
                    compiled news from campuses across the country). Second, college-aged men and women were acquiring
                    venereal diseases (mostly gonorrhea and syphilis) in increasing numbers across the country in the
                    late 1930s, and students may have wanted advice on how to prevent infection before marriage or on
                    how to manage the effects of the diseases. Third, students had grown increasingly less interested in

                    longtime campus marriage instructor and IU School of Medicine professor Thurman B. Rice. Rice
                    thought that couples should not learn anything about sex before marriage but instead should learn
                    through trial and error afterward. The information in his marriage course lectures never went beyond
                    vague comparisons to amphibian and mammalian reproduction. IU students also regularly complained in
                    the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> about the dullness and uselessness of Hygiene 101, a required one-hour
                    health course for campus freshmen. Fourth, Kinsey was already discussing sex education in his
                    biology pedagogy classes for secondary education students, and those students would have been aware
                    of his expertise in the subject. There was a ready on-campus audience for a course on marriage that
                    offered some clear and practical advice on its realities, including sex, law, economics, pregnancy,
                    and family dynamics.<hi rend="sup">11</hi></p>
                <p>Furthermore, recent local crackdowns on student life, both on and off campus, may have fostered
                    general student discontent with IU authorities. In November 1937, soon-to-retire Dean of Women Agnes
                    Wells forced the closing of a popular off-campus bar, Nick&apos;s English Hut, for being less
                    than two hundred feet from a church. But students--underage and over twenty-one--still knew where to
                    obtain moonshine and homebrew Female students were banned from smoking on campus but lit up anyway,
                    and students owned cars in ever-higher numbers even though they were forbidden from driving on
                    campus. Cars literally moved the university&apos;s social life off-campus, and opportunities for
                    unsupervised mixed-sex outings expanded significantly. In their second sociological study of<placeName>

                    people increasingly used the freedom and privacy of the automobile for intimate encounters, even as
                    teachers, librarians, and parents refused them information about sex. Requesting a marriage course
                    that offered more detailed and practical information than the obligatory hygiene course or the
                    Christian-based lectures advertised in the weekly religion section of the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> may
                    have been another way for students to express their discontent with the extant rules governing their
                    mobility and actions, to learn more scientifically about their bodies, and to study the behaviors in

                        1938.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> The marriage course also had the initial support of the new dean of
                    women, Kate Hevner Mueller. It is not clear if the AWS asked Kinsey to lead the course or if he
                    offered to do so; in any event, he became its chair. (While Jones and Gathorne-Hardy both state that
                    Kinsey approached the AWS to volunteer to lead the course, the two AWS members whom they interviewed
                    could not remember who approached whom. Mueller thought that Kinsey volunteered to give the course
                    but could only confirm that her office was not involved in starting it.) The IU Board of Trustees
                    approved the request on June 9, 1938, and Kinsey recruited seven other IU faculty and staff members
                    to lecture on their areas of specialty Part of their work as a group involved becoming familiar with
                    literature on marriage education, family life, reproductive biology, and sexuality The new chair was

                    human pairing and sex behavior was comparatively scanty, and that general information about it was
                    more often based on &quot;gossip and guesses&quot; than on scientific fact. Human marriage,

                    intercourse often psychologically damaged those who remained virgins until wed. Delaying marriage
                    until the mid-twenties, as was increasingly common, not only precluded adjusting to another
                    person&apos;s sexual desires and becoming familiar with one&apos;s own, but also made
                    adjusting to married life difficult in general. Given that taboos against premarital intercourse
                    were unlikely to change anytime soon, and &quot;adequate and mutually satisfying means of
                    contraception&quot; were unreliable or hard to obtain, the marriage course would provide tools
                    for students to tackle their difficul- ties. Kinsey concluded his lecture by telling students that
                    &quot;each man in his own field will present something of the special material which will
                    provide the material by which you can work out your own solution.&quot; While he did not
                    explicitly advise students to experiment with sex before marriage, many students heard this lecture
                    as a tacit admission that doing so would be good for their health.<hi rend="sup">16</hi></p>
                <p>Kinsey&apos;s second lecture, &quot;Reproductive Anatomy and Physiology,&quot; was the
                    fifth in the series. He showed black-and-white lantern slides of male and female embryonic genitalia
                    in development, then genitals of mature men and women. He informed students that coitus was
                    impossible without erection, but that women did not need to be aroused for intercourse to occur; and
                    that the clitoris, not the vagina, was the primary source of women&apos;s stimulation, although
                    many men were unaware of this. The next slides were of penile erection, aroused male and female
                    genitals, and different coital positions, all from Dickinson&apos;s <hi rend="i">Human Sex
                        Anatomy</hi>. Kinsey briefly covered pregnancy prophylaxis (tubal ligation, vasectomy, condoms,
                    and diaphragms) but warned the audience that his lecture was only a glimpse of what sex was and what

                    </quote>. At the end of this lecture, Kinsey reiterated the theme of his first address, that the
                    &quot;art&quot; of sex was essential to happy marriages. Ideas on how to learn that art
                    might be found in books such as <hi rend="i">A Marriage Manual</hi> (which he recommended for
                    student reading) and <hi rend="i">Human Sex Anatomy</hi>, but Kinsey subtly placed more emphasis on
                    &quot;working out adjustments&quot; in practice than on reading about them. Reproductive
                    Anatomy&quot; was as explicit as lectures on sex in marriage education courses got, mirroring
                    lectures by physicians such as Raymond Squier at Vassar College.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> In this
                    lecture, however, Kinsey left the question of when students should actually learn the art of
                    reproduction--before or after marriage--unanswered.</p>
                <p>In &quot;Individual Variation&quot;, the seventh lecture in the series, Kinsey emphasized the
                    variations of human genitals and sexual behavior. Kinsey drew graphs on the chalkboard of average
                    clitoris and penis lengths, showing in some cases how their lengths overlapped. His aim in doing so
                    was to show how men and women diverge both within and between the sexes, and to demonstrate that
                    these divergences blur rather than reify sexual differences. Furthermore, Kinsey advised, there was
                    no such thing as abnormal behavior, as &quot;nearly all of the so-called sexual perversions fall
                    within the range of biologic normality.&quot; As many men were ignorant of the fact that female
                    orgasm was comparable to male orgasm, they needed to learn that most women needed manual stimulation
                    of the clitoris to ensure sufficient lubrication for penetration and orgasm. While women could have
                    intercourse without being aroused, as Kinsey had stated in the &quot;Reproductive Anatomy and
                    Physiology&quot; lecture, if their husbands were skilled lovers there was no <list

                    variation in marriage would lead to mutual respect and understanding as partners worked patiently
                    toward achieving what Kinsey posited as a primary goal of marital coitus--not children, but
                    simultaneous orgasm. This lecture, like &quot;Reproductive Anatomy and Physiology,&quot;
                    informed students that their bodies and thoughts were normal, that it would take time to reach a
                    mutually satisfying pattern of behavior, and that orgasmic equality (with the implied use of birth
                    control) was a crucial element in successful marriages.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p>
                <p>Law professor Fowler V. Harper delivered the second and fourth lectures, which outlined basic legal
                    guidelines and procedures for marriage and divorce. The third lecture, probably by Kate Mueller,
                    does not survive. Zoology professor Robert L. Kroc gave the sixth lecture of the course,
                    &quot;Endocrine Basis of Sex and Reproduction.&quot; Kroc discussed male and female hormonal
                    development, menstruation, ovulation, pregnancy, and menopause. He also told the students that women
                    could not depend upon a safe time in their hormonal cycle to prevent pregnancy; he recommended
                    condoms, diaphragms, or abstinence as reliable forms of birth control.<hi rend="sup">19</hi></p>
                <p>After Kinsey&apos;s lecture on variations, Edmund S. Conklin, chair of the psychology department,
                    spoke on the psychology of sex and love. Conklin downplayed the importance of sex in marriage and
                    emphasized many other possible reasons for marital unhappiness. The next lecture, given by Kroc,
                    covered the biological reasons for fertility and sterility. The final lectures of the course came
                    from sociologist Harvey Locke, who dourly surveyed the state of modern marriage and who, like
                    Conklin, downplayed sex as a basic factor in marital happiness; campus women&apos;s doctor Edith
                    Schuman, who spoke mostly about venereal diseases and their effects on women and children; and

                <p>After the second-to-last lecture, Kinsey passed out questionnaires to the students. He compiled the
                    anonymous data (except for gender) from all ninety-eight, recording his aggregate results on a copy
                    of one of the forms. He (or an assistant) then typed out the written comments in long lists, one for
                    the course as a whole and others for each lecture individually The questionnaire began with a series
                    of general queries about the entire course; ninety-seven respondents said the biology section was
                    most significant to them and fifty-five wanted the &quot;Individual Variation&quot; lecture
                    to expand into two lectures, one focusing on sex education for children. The respondents agreed that
                    men and women should hear the lectures together; that the course should continue as a noncredit
                    elective; and that enforcing mandatory attendance at all lectures reinforced the importance of
                    attending the whole series. Kinsey noted that he had met with thirty-two students individually
                    regarding &quot;marital problems and personal sex adjustments.&quot; Those conferences, as
                    Kinsey would tell Herman Wells, were not just opportunities for advice, but actually became the
                    first sex histories Kinsey collected. He kept the specific data from his conferences confidential
                    but shared the results of the questionnaire with Wells and the other instructors.<hi rend="sup"

                    gave them confidence about themselves, fulfilled a genuine need for knowledge not available
                    elsewhere, gave them new understandings of life, and fostered healthy attitudes about marriage. And

                    </quote>Comments on the first session of the marriage course strengthened Kinsey&apos;s
                    conviction &quot;that knowledge can do no harm and may be the means of working out adjustments
                    that are fundamental.&quot; For the woman quoted above, earlier knowledge of genital anatomy and
                    the basic mechanics of arousal, coitus, and orgasm would have saved her and her husband years of
                    unsatisfactory sex and probably tension over other matters as well. Indeed, in 1928 Katharine Bement
                    Davis had found that while 257 of 438 women said that knowing more about sex beforehand would have
                    helped them adjust to married life, only 29 thought that that knowledge would have caused them harm.
                    In his obstetrical practice, Dickinson also discovered that women had orgasms more easily from
                    marital coitus if they had had a premarital medical exam and sex instruction, if not premarital sex.
                    Based in part on work like Davis&apos;s and Dickinson&apos;s, Kinsey&apos;s lectures in
                    particular struck a chord with the audience. The first session of the marriage course was a

                    histories he had collected. Wells was impressed with the synopsis of comments from the summer
                    session: &quot;Your summary of student answers to the marriage course questionnaire is
                    sufficient proof of the worthwhileness of the course, if there were no other substantiating
                    evidence.&quot; Kinsey also gave copies of the summary to the marriage course staff, telling
                    them that &quot;the results of our questionnaire indicate nearly unanimous approval of our
                    program while offering constructive criticisms that should help in our further
                        presentations.&quot;<hi rend="sup">23</hi></p>
                <p>Course content changed and expanded from the summer. Edmund Conklin was not invited back (Kinsey
                    wrote &quot;given one semester only&quot; across the top of Conklin&apos;s lecture).
                    Kinsey added a lecture on &quot;Sex Education. New lecturers included Professors Carroll
                    Christenson and James Moffat, who both spoke on the economics of marriage; <placeName>

                    John Mueller, who discussed the sociology of the family.<hi rend="sup">24</hi></p>
                <p>At the end of the term, Kinsey again compiled the student comments to pass out to course staff,
                    Wells, and the IU trustees. Overall, the students deemed the course a success (some lecturers
                    notwithstanding). While the majority reacted positively to the course as a whole, their comments
                    reflected gendered differences in students&apos; reception of the information. Married and
                    unmarried women admitted that they had been in the dark about sex and were open to hearing about
                    both the spiritual highs and unromanticized lows of marriage. The men as a group wanted as much
                    information as possible about the manifestations of intercourse--more position ideas, illustrations,
                    verbal descriptions, and films. They were also more likely to request instruction on contraception
                    and abortion. Some male students were clearly coming to the marriage course with a measure of sexual
                    experience or knowledge that the women, unless they were<list type="footnotes">

                <p>Before the spring 1939 series began, Kinsey shared the most recent student evaluations with the

                    </placeName>, on the wealth of information he was finding in the case histories. Kinsey&apos;s
                    correspondence makes clear that, while some of the sixty-four men and thirty-three women brought
                    more than one problem to the private meetings, a handful of issues preoccupied most of them.
                    Fifty-nine of the students, he wrote, wanted advice on petting, twenty-nine on premarital
                    intercourse, thirty on reproductive anatomy and physiology, and thirty-six on masturbation. Nine
                    also asked about homosexuality. The histories were beginning to dominate Kinsey&apos;s
                    attention. In this interval, Kinsey also had an unpleasant exchange with Rice, who thought that the
                    course&apos;s lectures on sex were designed for prurient rather than educational purposes.
                    Kinsey was treading on turf that physicians had claimed for themselves, and Rice was angry that he
                    had not been asked to participate in the course. Kinsey replied that Rice&apos;s concerns were
                    unfounded, but Rice was unconvinced that Kinsey had genuinely answered his objections: &quot;The
                    course has set up a chain of circumstances over which you have no control, being responsible only
                    for the first link.&quot;<hi rend="sup">26</hi></p>

                    presentation of sexual material, although their thoughts on premarital sexual behavior were less
                    clearly gendered than before. Some who had already planned to stay chaste before marriage reported
                    that the sex-related lectures helped them to learn more about their bodies so that they could be
                    better spouses in the future. One man thought that &quot;these discussions tend to discourage
                    fornication, because we realize now that satisfactory intercourse is obtained only after <hi
                        rend="i">many</hi> attempts-- and attempts now out of wedlock will only prove
                    embarrassing.&quot; A woman agreed: &quot;I believe a thorough understanding of
                    one&apos;s own body means less fear of it. An intelligent attitude makes for a stronger will
                    power and self-control and realization of the importance of preserving a <pb id="VAA4025-103-3-031"
                        n="253"/>healthy body for marriage.&quot; Others wanted to put their sexual knowledge to use
                    immediately or even saw it as a seduction tool. One man declared that &quot;frank discussion
                    never leads to so many maladjustments as repression,&quot; and another believed that
                    &quot;most girls are glad to know that the fellow has taken this course. It gives them an
                    assurance to know that if pre-marital intercourse is done the fellow knows plenty about
                    it.&quot; All of the students agreed on two principles: that &quot;knowledge can do no
                    harm&quot; and that &quot;you can work out your own solution.&quot; What they did with
                    their newfound knowledge was up to them, and in their course comments they expressed appreciation
                    that Kinsey trusted them enough to handle it.<hi rend="sup">28</hi></p>
                <p>Kinsey was a busy man in the summer of 1939, as he was not only leading a fourth session of the

                    their heterosexual friends.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Inspired by the sex histories he had already taken
                    in the marriage course, he set off to find more. While he considered the job of educating students
                    about marriage important for their health and well-being (in one instance, Kinsey requested that an
                    IU physician pro- vide ongoing treatment for a student with gonorrhea), the data he was gathering
                    about human behavior--and his method for collecting it--had the potential to make a broader impact
                    on American society. He had come to an understanding of the potential significance of his own work,
                    as he began to envision how an objective, scientific approach could transform the study of sexuality
                    beyond marriage and bring it to a wider audience. Kinsey wrote to Voris:<list type="footnotes">

                    sociologists in the course is much less than had been anticipated.&quot; Despite that ominous
                    prelude, the spring 1940 session proceeded, with Kinsey giving revised versions of the four lectures
                    that he had given in previous sessions (he added the fourth, &quot;Sex Education,&quot; in
                    the fall 1939 session). In &quot;Bases of Society,&quot; he asserted that
                    &quot;individuals can reach their finest development as a result of marriage.&quot; Such
                    optimism about the place of marriage in the human life cycle had been less prominent earlier in the
                    course, suggesting that Kinsey took seriously students&apos; belief that marriage could indeed
                    be a means to happiness. However, &quot;Reproductive Anatomy and Physiology&quot; revealed
                    distinct changes in Kinsey&apos;s thinking and teaching over the past year and a half. As he had
                    stated concerning the basics of coitus in a summer 1938 lecture: &quot;It is quite possible to
                    know all that need be known about the anatomy and physiology of reproduction and still grasp nothing
                    of its art.&quot; At that time, Kinsey had not gone into detail about how to learn such an art,
                    beyond recommending <hi rend="i">A Marriage Manual</hi> and hinting that premarital experimentation
                    was wise. In this session, Kinsey spent more time on the mental stimulation accompanying arousal,
                    foreplay, and intercourse--not precisely a discussion of the &quot;art&quot; of sex but of
                    how attraction begins and then changes over time:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In the human erotic reaction, we depend on a combination of physical and psychological
                            stimulation. The capacity of an individual to respond to a psychological stimulus depends on
                            the previous experience the individual has had, [and] the set that he has toward it, so that
                            ultimately there may be built up such mental associations around sexual contacts that the
                            psychological stimulus alone will bring forth erotic response.</p>
                    </quote>In the space of a year and a half, Kinsey had shifted from suggesting that premarital sex
                    would make marital sex more pleasurable--and blaming &quot;prudish ideas&quot; for sexual
                    unreadiness-to testing broader theories on the development of human arousal and sexuality in

                <p>The same lecture also included, for the first and only time in the marriage course, Kinsey&apos;s
                    thoughts on the relationship between sex and love. Even as he argued for the importance of love and
                    happiness in inspiring and sustaining marital relationships, he insisted that feelings and emotions
                    could not withstand the scientific scrutiny that sex could. Whatever his personal feelings on the
                    subject, he had little use for love as a point of scientific inquiry:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Now intercourse consists of a series of physiological reactions which are as mechanical as
                            the blinking of an eyelid&#x2026; . Emotional acceptance of this series of physiological
                            events may be what you recognize as love. It may provide the inspiration for the writing of
                            the poet, and the philosopher, of all mankind, but fundamentally, at base, the first part of
                            the story is a story of mechanical responses which are as inevitable when the stimuli are
                            provided as any other ordinary reflex of any other part of the body.</p>
                    </quote>In this analysis, love was, at its most fundamental level, an emotion that people attributed
                    to a natural desire for intercourse. Perhaps attaching feelings to sex was unique to humans, but the
                    desire for intercourse and reproduction was not, as Kinsey illustrated through the example of male
                    moths following the scent of females from miles away in order to mate with them. Love was not
                    physiological, but it could become part of the &quot;mental associations around sexual
                    contacts&quot; that people would bring to their sex lives. Neither did love guarantee or even
                    portend a mutually satisfying sex life in marriage. Finally, Kinsey added that while birth control
                    may have separated sex from procreation, it did not separate idealizations of love from marriage. In
                    this version of the &quot;Reproductive Anatomy and Physiology&quot; lecture, Kinsey began to
                    articulate one of the guiding principles of his future research: to understand the nature of human
                    sex behavior, it was necessary to divorce sexual behavior from<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-036" n="258"
                    />love. Behavior and even arousal were quantifiable phenomena that could be observed and studied
                    objectively, but love was not.<hi rend="sup">33</hi></p>
                <p>The 1940 version of the lecture on &quot;Individual Variation,&quot; while framed in a
                    marital context, was not much concerned with the wedded life. It was a thumbnail sketch of how
                    Kinsey was beginning to tackle problems beyond the scope of the marriage course. Kinsey articulated
                    three additional developing principles of his sex research: first, that the only kinds of abnormal
                    sex were none at all or those which caused harm; second, that all other forms of sex, however rare,
                    were simply variants on the complex continuum of human behavior; and third, that sex researchers
                    were likely to bias their results according to their own values, and thus should make a special
                    effort to be neutral:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>There is practically nothing in human sexual behavior &#x2026; which deserves the term
                            abnormal in the sense that it interferes with physiological well-being. There are cases when
                            you might label a phenomenon abnormal in the sense that it interferes with the well-being of
                            the species and in connection with that the only sexual abnormalities are celibacy, refusal
                            to marry; abstinance [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], failure to have intercourse; and delayed
                            marriage, and that is a very different list than is ordinarily given in the books. In
                            actuality, the classification into normal and abnormal that is usually made merely
                            represents the type of behavior that the classifier has not happened to engage in</p>
                    </quote>Further, Kinsey identified the problem of understanding the interrelationship of the sexual
                    body and social culture, stating that the reasons behind human behavior were never easily
                    explainable: &quot;It is one of the most difficult factors for the student of
                    biology&#x2026;even more so for the student of sociology to determine how much is environmental
                    and how much is acquired.&quot; Even a decade later, when he published <hi rend="i">Sexual
                        Behavior in the Human Male</hi>, Kinsey felt he still had not solved this fundamental problem to
                    his satisfaction, but neither had anyone else.<hi rend="sup">34</hi></p>

                <p>Kinsey&apos;s last lecture in the spring 1940 series was &quot;Sex Education.&quot; He
                    was aware that many in the audience had never heard a forthright lecture on the subject, and so he
                    designed the talk as much for the adults as for their future children. He began by arguing that sex
                    education should be given to children by parents and not &quot;experts.&quot; Parents should
                    begin sex instruction when the child was between five and seven years of age, when sex had no erotic
                    connotation and before he or she would begin to learn about it from other children. Both boys and
                    girls needed to know that having sexual feelings was a healthy sign of growing up, and that
                    sublimation of such feelings usually caused emotional harm: &quot;I have seen people who are
                    completely unstrung by the attempt to avoid it and get along without sexual outlets.&quot; Boys
                    especially needed to learn that masturbation was not harmful, as they had on average 3.5 orgasms per
                    week in adolescence, compared to less than one for girls. &quot;If you can set your boy straight
                    on that subject you will have saved them eight years of worry.&quot;<hi rend="sup">35</hi></p>
                <p>After covering the basic problems faced by adolescents, Kinsey described how he had begun to collect
                    sex histories. When students in earlier sessions of the course came to him for personal conferences,
                    they most frequently asked him about premarital petting, and he realized how pervasive it was.
                    Kinsey concluded that he could collect data from those conferences in order to investigate petting
                    and other behaviors, and how they affected people after marriage. He then offered some statistical
                    backup, taken from his case history data, for a related theme that he had been hinting at in
                    previous lectures: &quot;There is statistical correlation between premarital petting and
                    effective sexual adjustment at the marriage. There is practically no correlation between premarital
                    intercourse and ease of adjustment after marriage.&quot; He also addressed a topic that a
                    handful of students had inquired about--homosexuality--stating that &quot;biologically, it is
                    still part of the normal sexual picture, and the individual who suffers through the social
                    condemnation which is a result of the branding of the phenomenon as abnormal has the most difficult
                    sexual problem that I know of. It is a phenomenon that society will some day [face] with more
                    objectivity.&quot; Kinsey&apos;s direct references in the lecture to individual conferences
                    and sex histories indicate their signifi-<list type="footnotes">

                    thinking. The reference to homosexuality and its normalcy reinforces the fact that Kinsey was moving
                    away from marriage per se as a subject for analysis and toward studying the whole of human sexual
                        behavior.<hi rend="sup">36</hi></p>
                <p>The comments that Kinsey collected from the spring 1940 session were more serious and defensive in
                    tone than those he had received in earlier sessions. With the objections of Rice, Schuman, both
                    Muellers, and Kohlmeier circulating around campus, the students who wrote about the course as a
                    whole used the opportunity to register their opposition to critical gossip. Mixed in among praises
                    for the course were comments condemning &quot;outsiders.&quot; &quot;I also feel sorry
                    that outsiders criticize the biology lectures so much,&quot; stated one man. &quot;It is too
                    bad that &#x2026; biology, where students are uninformed, [is] relegated to such a small part of
                    the course.&quot; Another wrote, &quot;I fail to see where anyone could take offense at any
                    of the lectures if they attend with an open mind.&quot; A woman agreed, echoing
                    Kinsey&apos;s own language: &quot;The persons who criticize [the lectures] are those who
                    have not heard them, and still uphold Victorian views of prejudice and ignorance concerning sex and
                    marriage relations. The ice should be broken sometime.&quot; Several students saw a broader
                    picture of what the unpleasant gossip said about education at Indiana University. One man wrote:
                    &quot;Of what good is a col- lege education if we do not know how to live and what life is all
                        about?&quot;<hi rend="sup">37</hi></p>
                <p>Most students insisted that Kinsey keep the course going. One woman alluded to possible ulterior
                    motives on the part of critics: &quot;Do these objectors want us to get [sexual information]
                    from &apos;quack Dr. Books,&apos; street conversation, or perhaps they want us to learn of
                    the dangers [by] making mistakes?&quot; One man described with regret his own sexual experience
                    prior to the course:<quote rend="blockquote">

                <p>By the summer of 1940, Kinsey was increasingly aware of the objections of several IU faculty to the
                    explicit content of the course, and in particular to the idea of the normality of masturbation and
                    homosexuality In May 1940, Albert Kohlmeier, who had lectured in five of the six marriage course
                    sessions to date, wrote a letter to President Wells as chair of the University Committee on
                    Religion, stating his concern &quot;regarding the moral and social implications of the present
                    methods of conducting the non-credit course on marriage.&quot; Later in the summer, feeling
                    pressure from IU sociologists, campus physicians, local Christian leaders, and some parents, Wells
                    asked Kinsey to choose one of two courses of action: resign from the marriage course and continue to
                    take the sex histories of students, or continue to teach in the marriage course but allow the IU
                    health center to take over the individual counseling sessions. A brief flurry of letters to Wells
                    followed, including a petition with 163 signatures asking that Kinsey not be forced to resign under
                    such conditions. As Kinsey pointed out to Henry G. Nester, chair of the Butler University physiology
                    department, it was culturally acceptable for physicians to give sex advice, however muddled with
                    morals, but the same men and women objected to anyone else (including a biology professor such as
                    Kinsey) giving explicit, practical, nonjudgmental instruction. But Kinsey did not worry over the
                    loss of the marriage course for long. Ten days after he sent his resignation letter to Wells, he
                    wrote to IU graduate student Glenn Ramsey about the heterosexuality/homosexuality scale on which he
                    was working.<hi rend="sup">39</hi></p>

                        VD preven tion campaigns, and it is not surprising that Kinsey&apos;s students would

                <p>Kinsey continued to take the histories, and the marriage course proceeded under the leadership of his
                    old opponents, Rice and Schuman, through fall 1942. According to Kate Mueller, the course ended due
                    to wartime exigencies, not because it devolved into the jumble of pro-eugenic, antisex, misogynistic
                    information that one student&apos;s notes indicated. IU student and future Kinsey collaborator
                    Clyde E. Martin, the author of the extant notes on the fall 1940 marriage course, was highly
                    sarcastic and critical of three of the lectures. In one lecture, Willis D. Gatch apparently told
                    male students: &quot;You have as much right to marry a woman and starve her to death as any
                    other man&#x2026; . Don&apos;t worry too much about brains. A too profound intellect [is]
                    sometimes evidence of abnormality.&quot; When Kinsey left the course, his scientific tone and

                <p>In its initial sessions, the IU marriage course was comparable to other courses in the secular

                    idealistic discussion of the joys of marriage, personal conferences with instructors, and explicit
                    instructions about sex. The early sessions of the course were a<list type="footnotes">

                    sexology of Katharine Bement Davis, Hannah and Abraham Stone, and Robert Latou Dickinson. Opponents
                    of the companionate marriage concept were eased off the stage of the marriage course, and it was
                    their protests that eventually led to Kinsey&apos;s resignation.</p>
                <p>During his time directing the class, Kinsey moved from focusing on marital sexuality to exploring and
                    declaring the normalcy of most other forms of sexuality as well. In his final set of lectures,
                    Kinsey also showed signs of the philosophical and scientific approach he would soon apply to the sex
                    research for which he gained wide renown. He built his philosophy on those elements of the marriage
                    education and sexology literature that he had initially valued: firm statistics, clear language, a
                    nonjudgmental attitude toward most types of behavior, an absence of religious or moral judgment, and
                    a desire to teach the &quot;truth&quot; about sex in marriage as much as anyone could. While
                    those principles continued to guide him, he also read and thought more about sex as a cultural,
                    social, and physical phenomenon, and kept taking sex histories as the course continued.
                    Kinsey&apos;s 1938 marriage course lectures chastised a world where premarital contact was
                    forbidden and marriage was fraught with problems, and subtly promoted sexual learning before
                    marriage. His 1940 lectures described the psychological nature of sexual experience, called for love
                    to be removed from scientific studies of sex, pointed to the almost infinite variation in human
                    behavior, declared the naturalness of most sexual behavior (except for abstinence), and questioned
                    the relationship between body and mind. The honest responses that Kinsey believed he had elicited
                    from students and others during individual sex conferences led him to think that personal, private
                    interviews constituted the best way to gather mass amounts of information on sexual behavior. As of
                    1940, Kinsey still had more questions than answers, but he now had a set of research principles--and
                    a working interview form--that satisfied his desire for scientific validity and truthfulness.<hi

                    like others of its kind, the IU marriage course was about much more than &quot;domestic family
                    affairs.&quot; Over a two-year period, Kinsey transformed the course into a venue for asking the
                    kinds of broad questions that no scientist had yet answered about human sexuality. By the time that
                    Kinsey&apos;s tenure as chair of the course ended in 1940, he had started to craft the ideology

                    encouraged him to pursue another endeavor. Twelve lectures on &quot;domestic family
                    affairs,&quot; given in a noncredit marriage course on a midwestern college campus, turned into
                    &quot;a noble experiment&quot; by its first chair to investigate not just marriage but the

                    education, promised the peaceful practice of varying religious beliefs, and provided for settlement

                    maintain these strictures through heavy-handed government enforcement, they hoped to wield the
                    societal reins through a dialogue among like-minded, property-holding white males. But the frontier
                    confounded many expectations. As settlers poured onto the new lands, nascent governmental bodies
                    struggled to keep pace with their numbers. Highly structured religious groups found themselves
                    unable to provide the needed leaders and buildings. To make matters worse, many of the settlers who
                    flooded into the Ohio Valley seemed unruly, even rebellious, and from their ranks came an
                    ever-increasing number of property-holding males, now eligible to vote and contend for public
                    offices.</p>
                <p>Even on the frontier, however, there were still ways to distinguish one group of men from another. In
                    the Early Republic, as during the Colonial era, the possession of slaves (still possible just across
                    the Ohio River in Kentucky), apprentices, and wives helped to distinguish successful men of property
                    from their lesser competitors. These three groups provided essential labor and connoted social
                    capital as well. But the frontier, with few towns and partially cleared farms scattered through a
                    forested wilderness, provided excellent opportunities for human possessions to make off.
                    Property-owning men faced the question of how to maintain control in such a volatile environment.</p>
                <p>One of the ways in which these men appealed to one another was through the public press, in terms
                    that maintained both their actual assets and their social standing in the new republic. Some of the
                    best examples of how this played out come from newspaper advertisements for three categories of
                    runaways--slaves, apprentices, and wives.</p>
                <p>From the perspective of free adult men with at least some property (i.e., the electorate), runaway
                    slaves, runaway apprentices, and runaway wives constituted particular nuisances. They provoked
                    debate and dialogue about the socio-legal code of bound labor. The efforts of slaves, servants, and
                    aggrieved wives to resist the control of their masters provides an important window into how the
                    electorate&apos;s ethos of what we might call &quot;controlled liberty&quot; functioned.
                    By definition, the system offered liberty for some and not for all, and the runaway ads tell us as
                    much about how it would ultimately fail as they do about how it was justified and maintained.</p>
                <p>Looking specifically at runaway ads in the early territorial newspapers offers advantages to the
                    historian seeking to understand the maintenance of social order in the region. The Northwest
                    Territory would be divided into some of the first post-Revolutionary states added to the U.S. <pb
                        id="VAA4025-103-3-045" n="267"/>--a process that in itself proved a bold experiment. Also, while
                    some excellent scholarship has examined runaways in the eighteenth-century Mid-Atlantic,<hi
                        rend="sup">2</hi> little work examines this phenomenon on the turbulent frontier of the Early
                    Republic. Finally, this study addresses the key issue of people using the newspapers as a form of
                    public dialogue and as an auxiliary of law enforcement in an area where law and order could be
                    scarce.</p>
                <p>Controlling these categories of people, whose labor fell on a sliding scale between completely forced
                    and potentially voluntary, was deemed important enough for white, propertied men to take their
                    private difficulties into the public sphere, often through the local newspaper. They placed
                    advertisements for their runaways in an effort to restore public confidence in the system of
                    hierarchically controlled labor,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> and more directly, to defend their
                    reputations. A man who chose to advertise struck a delicate balance: provide enough information
                    about the runaway to secure his/her return, and also maintain personal honor by projecting an image
                    of a master somehow too just and liberal to rightfully run away from.</p>
                <p>Looking at Ohio Valley newspapers from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries can tell us
                    quite a lot about the practical side of how Americans struggled to protect both individual rights
                    and collective law and order. I argue that frontier citizens collectively chose to utilize

                    who ran away from those who claimed them were seen as obstacles both to personal economic success
                    and to a broader societal order. Notably, the imagery of the Revolution had variously portrayed

                    her British husband, or as slaves of British masters. Yet despite the Revolution&apos;s emphasis

                <p>Article Six of the 1787 ordinance had stated that &quot;there shall be neither slavery nor
                    involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the
                    party shall have been duly convicted.&quot; The exception to the rule applied to runaways:
                    &quot;That any person escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in
                    any one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person
                    claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid.&quot; Despite what appeared to be an outright
                    ban, slavery, in various forms, continued in the region for decades.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> For a

                    slaves, the slaves already in the territory could still be considered as property. <placeName>

                    attempt to reunite with (or at least to visit) relatives from whom they had been sold away. They
                    might take to the woods temporarily to avoid a particularly harsh punishment, or as a gesture of
                    defiance towards a master. Female slaves sometimes ran away to escape unwanted sexual advances, or
                    took their daughters with them to avoid such a fate. And some slaves took to their heels to strike a
                    subversive blow at slavery itself by &quot;stealing&quot; themselves.<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p>
                <p> Several factors made a slave more or less likely to run away: age, gender, skills, and familial
                    situation were all critical. Young men in their late teens and early twenties comprised by far the
                    majority of runaways. They were better prepared for the physical rigors of escape, could put up the
                    fiercest resistance if cornered, and often had no wives or children to tie them to their owners. A

                    Billy G. Smith notes, &quot;an African American woman on the road was an oddity that would
                    arouse suspicion, and thus some female runaways disguised themselves as men.&quot; Smith adds

                <p>If a slave managed to escape his or her immediate surroundings, the master often wrote a newspaper

                <p>Such ads served several purposes. When slaves ran off, they hurt their owners financially. Mr. Craig
                    wanted his skilled papermaker returned, and the fear that some might &quot;harbor him&quot;
                    was a genuine concern when a slave with marketable skills ran off. He also suggests a fondness for
                    James, noting the slave&apos;s friendly manners and clear speech. Much of the ad was designed to
                    assuage those who might take pity on an escaped slave, pointing out that James had been well treated
                    and would be freed while still relatively young. The ad may also have been directed at James--it is
                    not unreasonable to think that a trained craftsman could read. While the literacy rate among all
                    escaped slaves in this era was only 1 to 2 percent, among mulatto runaways like James it may

                <p>Thus an advertisement for a runaway slave was not simply a financial transaction, but could be an
                    exercise in self-fashioning to the community at large--not unlike a modern press release. And it

                    considerable spleen emanated from the ad. Jim was &quot;often drunk&quot; and
                    &quot;became lazy and did not love to work,&quot; despite the fact that he had been

                <p>Owners sometimes offered no reward in their ad (about 24 percent of the time in Franklin and
                    Schweninger&apos;s study), and rewards over &#x0024;50 were comparatively rare. Mulattos
                    tended to carry higher value, as did slaves who could write their own passes. Slaves in those
                    categories also had a better chance of passing for freemen and making good their escape. Owners
                    often held off placing an ad when they felt a slave might be quickly apprehended, but placed larger
                    rewards when they feared the runaway was leaving the state. While Franklin and
                    Schweninger&apos;s study of runaways who were still within the South indicates that,
                    &quot;generally owners offered 5 percent or less of the value of the runaway as a

                    patriarchal standing. Viewed from the present, the ads remind that free labor was far from a
                    foregone conclusion and that slavery seemed perfectly plausible to many white Americans.</p>
                <p>RUNAWAY APPRENTICES</p>
                <p>African American slaves were not the only unfree laborers in the Ohio Valley. Even those who abhorred
                    slavery assumed that unfree labor was necessary in certain businesses and trades. In particular,
                    many of the skilled trades still relied upon apprentices, albeit with mixed results. Apprentices,
                    usually pre-teens or young teenaged boys, worked for room and board, plus the opportunity to learn a
                    valuable trade. Often provisions were made for the boy&apos;s education; in cities the terms of
                    an apprenticeship might even stipulate attendance at night school. Apprentices usually served
                    indentures of four to seven years--making them not unlike white indentured servants--or until the
                    age of twenty-one. Masters practiced deferred gratification in accepting apprentices. The youth
                    would produce little valuable labor early on, and would still need food, shelter, and clothing. But
                    after a year or two, when his skills had progressed, he compensated his master with unpaid labor.<hi
                        rend="sup">23</hi></p>
                <p> Apprenticeships traditionally had a familial, patriarchal quality. With a kindly master, an
                    apprentice&apos;s quality of life was relatively good. Some apprentices even married their
                    master&apos;s daughters and inherited businesses. But the situation held the potential for
                    considerable abuse by the unscrupulous. Masters and apprentices had legal recourse in dire
                    circumstances, though actual enforcement of the law on this point was not uniform.</p>

                <p>The laws of the Northwest Territory allowed a justice of the peace to place poor or orphaned children
                    in apprenticeships until boys were twenty-one or girls were eighteen. Indiana Territory reserved
                    that right for the courts. Even under the best circumstances, apprenticeships were often
                    involuntary--the child was sent away by a poor family to avoid the cost of upkeep--and tended toward
                    the tedious. There were other drawbacks as well. The indenture might stipulate that the apprentice
                    &quot;not Committ fornication nor Contract Matrimony within the said term.&quot;<hi
                        rend="sup">24</hi> For boys in the throes of puberty, this restriction must have been difficult.

                <p>In an increasingly literate republic, popular literature was often intended to inspire morality and
                    virtue. Among the bestselling books of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was the
                    autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. But alas for the tradesman whose bonded workman read the volume.
                    Franklin was easily America&apos;s most famous and successful runaway apprentice, having fled
                    his older brother&apos;s print shop. In his autobiography, he did claim that it was one of the
                    great mistakes of his life, as his brother had not treated him unfairly. But Franklin&apos;s
                    subsequent accomplishments seemed to many to justify his flight. The wildly popular autobiography
                    went through seven editions in the 1790s, and was a favorite, not surprisingly, among
                    printers&apos; apprentices. (The same decade also witnessed the formation of artisan
                    organizations that tried to stanch the flood of runaways.) An unsuspecting master might suggest the
                    book to an apprentice as a handbook for success, but, as W. J. Rorabaugh notes, Franklin&apos;s
                    autobiography put dangerous messages into impressionable minds, seeming to say &quot;leave your
                    master, become rich, famous, and renowned.&quot;<hi rend="sup">25</hi></p>
                <p>Franklin&apos;s story said something greater about the American saga as well, according to David
                    Waldstreicher. Franklin&apos;s success was based upon talents, hard work, and an indomitable
                    will. But eggs were broken to make that omelet. <list type="footnotes">

                        man&#x2026; . America is also the story of the James Franklins, the not-so-fortunate sons

                <p>As with slave owners, craftsmen held wildly disparate views of their runaway charges&apos; value.
                    Because apprentices could not be held for life and one rarely had to pay cash up front to secure the
                    contract, the rewards offered were usually much lower than those for slaves. Often the amount was in
                    pennies rather than dollars. Of the seventeen runaway apprentices sought in the <hi rend="i">
                        <hi rend="i">Western Spy</hi>
                    </hi> between 1799 and 1806, for example, nine would bring a reward of twenty-five cents or less.
                    Given that such ads typically cost at least fifty cents to post for each of the first three weeks,
                    why bother to post an ad for an apprentice deemed worth less than half that cost? Even if we assume
                    that, as with slaves, apprentice rewards often amounted to only 5 percent of the assumed value of
                    the runaway, the numbers still do not add up.<hi rend="sup">27</hi></p>
                <p>Perhaps, as some argue with ads for escaped slaves, postings served to reassure the public that the
                    apprenticeship system itself was legitimate. Masters used print ads to assert that the contract had
                    been wrongfully violated-an attempt to negate the runaway&apos;s flight which implicitly stated
                    that something was awry. While increasingly tough laws provided for the punishment of apprentices
                    who broke their agreements, enforcement seems to have been lax, and at least among the existing
                    states, master and apprentice alike understood that fleeing across the state line made prosecution
                    nearly impossible.<hi rend="sup">28</hi></p>
                <p>Far more than with runaway slave notices, ads for runaway apprentices seem to have been motivated by
                    spite as much as by the need for financial remuneration. The evidence for this motive is sometimes
                    subtle, as with Isaac McCoy&apos;s ad calling for the return of Squire Davis, a slight
                    eighteen-year-old who fled McCoy&apos;s wheelwright shop in<list type="footnotes">

                    McCoy was not desperately in need of the boy. Some postings were more blunt. Carpenter William H.

                    his eighteen-year-old apprentice William Strickling. Similarly, William Salter noted that the return
                    of apprentice Joshua Merryman would bring but one cent&apos;s reward: &quot;I will pay no
                    other expence; nor give one thank for so doing.&quot; John Van Nuys&apos;s offer of nine
                    cents for the return of William Flin, about twelve years old, seems almost generous, given that Flin
                    was &quot;a noted Thief and Liar, and many other failings too tedious to enumerate.&quot;
                    Sarcasm also pervades the offer for Philip Drum, a seventeen-year-old Dutchman who fled Robert
                    McGennis of <placeName>

                <p>Despite such examples of anger and frustration, some craftsmen did offer reasonable rewards for the

                    sense, all runaway apprentice notices served greater social functions: to discourage apprentices
                    from running away and to keep others from hiring such cheap labor in a labor-poor territory.
                    Although wheelwright Paul Huston offered only twelve cents for the return of apprentice Robert
                    Crawford, he added, &quot;All persons are forbid from harboring him at their peril.&quot;

                <p>RUNAWAY WIVES</p>
                <p>Married women occupied an odd niche in the pantheon of unfree laborers. On the one hand, they
                    presumably entered into their marriage contract more voluntarily than apprentices. Yet unlike an
                    apprentice, wives &quot;served&quot; not a fixed term of years, but until the death of their
                    spouse or themselves. Nor did wives learn a skilled trade with the understanding of future
                    independence. Unlike a slave, a wife gained considerable personal, legal, and (assuming she was not
                    left shackled by debt) financial freedom upon the death of her husband.</p>
                <p>Eighteenth-century marriages have usually been understood, as Kathleen Brown writes, &quot;as an

                    rights to the home and children. Divorces, for reasons discussed below, were often difficult to come
                    by. Yet women still had options. If physically abused or abandoned, they might &quot;sue for
                    separate maintenance [which required legal proof of the husband&apos;s wrongdoing], seek refuge
                    with sympathetic neighbors, friends, or relatives, or search for employment to provide their own
                        living.&quot;<hi rend="sup">35</hi></p>
                <p>Some gentry wives won enough in their separate maintenance suits to live by themselves. For most
                    wives, though, separation proved a difficult decision, as their chances for financial survival alone
                    were not good. Women might run a tavern or a small shop, or perform domestic work. Even meager
                    independence, Brown asserts, &quot;often represented an improvement over living conditions in
                    which a husband humiliated her with his adultery, drank, or gambled away family
                        resources.&quot;<hi rend="sup">36</hi></p>
                <p>Some unhappy spouses found immediate relief by fleeing the situation, either alone or with a new
                    lover. In cases where one spouse left the other, proving abandonment and securing legal redress was
                    more straightforward for women than for men. When wives ran away, they might still use their
                    husband&apos;s name in legal and financial dealings, potentially racking up debts and sullying
                    his reputation. Men, therefore, &quot;turned to the courts in these situations both to protect
                    their estates and to level economic sanctions against their errant wives.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                <p>By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, however, attitudes in America were shifting.
                    The idea of a marriage based on love and passion, as well as finances, was taking root.<hi

                    enter into contracts, dispose of property, or conduct business generally, without her

                    American men denigrated women in the process. Or, as Linda Kerber writes, the &quot;traditional

                <p>Divorce was, by design, scandalous and difficult to effect. Modern concepts such as
                    &quot;irreconcilable differences&apos;&quot; and &quot;no-fault&quot; divorces
                    were completely alien. Poorly matched couples were expected to live unhappily ever after. But one of
                    the key legal shifts in the nation after the Revolution was the possibility, if not the likelihood,
                    of securing an absolute divorce. (Not coincidentally, this shift paralleled the growing belief in
                    romantic marriage.) Prior to 1775, only the New England colonies had allowed for absolute divorce,
                    but by the late 1790s all the states except <placeName>

                        circumstances.<hi rend="sup">40</hi></p>
                <p>The Northwest Territory, as provided for in the Ordinance of 1787, could adopt appropriate laws from
                    the existing states, rather than draft entirely new ones. For divorce, the territory adopted the <placeName>

                    </placeName> code, it was nevertheless quite strict, allowing divorce only in cases of bigamy,
                    adultery, or impotency, and requiring legal proof of one of the offenses. Legal separation--which
                    did not allow for remarriage--was possible in cases of &quot;extreme cruelty,&quot; although
                    the code did not elaborate on what constituted the latter. If the court granted the couple a divorce
                    and they had no children, the wife was legally entitled to the property she had brought to the
                    marriage, as well as to &quot;reasonable&quot; alimony. If children were involved, the court
                    would split the estate as it saw fit. All of this was assuming the husband brought suit.<hi

                <p>If the wife initiated proceedings, the court would decide how much, if any, of her former property

                    divorce suits were occasionally granted in cases of truly despi- cable behavior by husbands. But the

                    paternalistic control, not equity.</p>
                <p>The difficulties and high costs of securing a divorce encouraged many people in bad marriages simply
                    to flee. For wealthier couples in England and America, unhappy unions might practically (if not
                    technically) be sundered by a permanent separation, where the wife was allowed enough alimony for
                    her support. Men and women from the lower economic classes seemed to prefer bigamy and serial
                    monogamy to the social and financial costs of seeking a legal divorce. Cases of bigamy were not
                    often prosecuted, unless one of the parties later became wealthy.<hi rend="sup">43</hi></p>
                <p>Most &quot;runaway wife&quot; advertisements followed a basic pattern. They served as a

                <p>Those sentiments were echoed by Sergeant John Bentley of the 5th U.S. Regiment at Fort Wayne. When he

                    with &quot;INJUSTICE.&quot; He further warned others against contracting with her, or

                    about his wife Rebecca on Christmas Eve, 1800. Apparently she did come back, but by early 1807, the
                    hapless Gates again notified the public of her desertion, this time with the preamble

                <p>While petitioners for divorce had no choice but to look to the legislature or the courts, Americans
                    on the frontier of the Early Republic often relied upon the community for general law enforcement.
                    Without a professional police force and with only a few sheriffs, deputies, and justices of the
                    peace, communities developed a law enforcement strategy that was somewhere between a neighborhood
                    watch and outright vigilantism. While such a system respected the republican desire to be free from
                    excess government and taxes, its results must often have been discouraging. When criminals could be
                    located and arrested, there was little guarantee that the local jail could hold them until the
                        trial.<hi rend="sup">56</hi></p>
                <p>Newspaper ads for runaways in the Ohio Valley, then, performed numerous functions for the citizenry
                    The ads were meant to safeguard men&apos;s investments--financially, as well as emotionally and
                    socially By alerting the public to the presence of runaways, masters/husbands sought to diminish the
                    absconded&apos;s chances of getting a better &quot;contract&quot; elsewhere--as a free
                    laborer, artisan, or spouse--by implying that those who fled did so from impure or unjust motives.
                    The advertisements aided the greater patriarchal order&apos;s system of unfree labor by seeking
                    to delegitimize any justifications for running off. At the same time, the ads served
                    masters&apos; needs to fashion their images and defend their public honor to the community at
                    large, by insisting that they were blameless in any broken contract. Along with these reasons, I

                            forty-five men escaped either the jail or the custody of deputies. Certainly the jail was
                            shabby, a conglomeration of poorly fitted wood planks, with no concrete and a weak
                            foundation. But note that the vast majority who escaped were not violent criminals, or even
                            thieves, but debtors. Quite possibly, the frontier community at large was sympathetic toward
                            debtors, because the local economy was often precarious. They may have been loath to track
                            down, or even complicit in the escape of, men who differed from them only in luck. Further,
                            the threat to the community posed by at-large debtors did not justify, for most settlers,

                <p>Men of property faced a difficult situation on the frontier of the Early Republic. Having overthrown
                    a strong, centralized government in the Revolution, they had to balance their hard-won liberty with
                    real-world concerns about the nature of power and control in their society. In general they wanted
                    order and justice, yet in many instances they lacked the technology or funding necessary to see to
                    the enforcement of their own laws. Rather than pay for such instruments through taxation, or risk
                    possible oppression from law officers, they opted to rely upon friends and neighbors by throwing
                    certain legal concerns into the public arena. The frontier newspapers were vital to this process.
                    They allowed the propertied citizenry to seek lost spouses, apprentices, and slaves, to vent
                    frustrations, to search for criminals, and to enjoy petty revenge, all for a few pennies per week--a
                    small price to pay for their liberty.</p>

                <p>1963 was a good year to seek a faculty position in higher education. Universities were burgeoning
                    with the influx of students born to World War II veterans, and the prospects for further growth
                    seemed limitless. State financial support was high, with no end in sight. Thus, finishing my Ph.D.
                    in English at the University of Wisconsin, I visited many schools at their invitation. At each place
                    I went, I attended a reception where I was introduced to faculty in the department by their titles:
                    Assistant Professor X; Associate Professor Y; Professor Z; etc. At Indiana University, however, I
                    and other candidates with me were introduced to faculty by their first names, no matter their rank
                    or age. I sensed something different about <placeName>

                <p>When I started at IU in the fall of 1964, the things I had sensed in the interview the year before
                    turned out to be accurate: the campus was collegial, friendly, humane, understated, and, if such a
                    word can be used about a campus, happy.</p>

                <p>These characteristics owed a great deal to the personality of Herman B Wells, president of IU from
                    1937-1962, and university chancellor from 1962 until his death in 2000. Wells was an enormously
                    generous person, one who valued every member of the academic community, from a custodian to the most
                    senior and distinguished professor. He treated each with respect, reaching out to them as only
                    someone with his deep regard for others could do. Wells and I became good friends (we also happened
                    to share the same fraternity, Sigma Nu) when I myself became active in administration, first as
                    chair of the English Department in the mid-1970s, later as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences,
                    and then, from 1980 to 2001, as chancellor of the <placeName>

                    before: Herman Wells.</p>

                <p>In 2007, Indiana University begins a major transition. A new president took office on July 1; five or
                    six trustees with relatively little experience on the board make up its majority; a new <placeName>

                    one would expect major differences between 1964 and 2007. University-wide enrollment then was
                    36,397; full-time faculty numbered 1,539. Student enrollment in 2006-07 has climbed to 97,959; the

                    were just beginning to establish campuses in their own right. Even IUPUI would not be founded until

                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Obviously, leading IU in 2007 requires a set of skills much different from those
                    needed in 1964. The task may require, as well, a different set of values (I say
                    &quot;may&quot; because some of the values espoused by Herman Wells are still valid).</p>
                <p>The constituencies to which IU&apos;s new president must respond are far more numerous than they
                    were when I arrived at the university In addition to the students, families, faculty, and staff who
                    remain central to the university, these constituencies today include more than 495,000 living
                    alumni, the communities and regions in which IU has campuses or centers, all of the members of the
                    General Assembly (as opposed to the handful of key legislators who, in Wells&apos;s time, tended
                    to call the shots), a board of trustees much more into micromanaging than ever before, and a State
                    Commission for Higher Education that has attempted since its establishment in the 1970s to get its
                    arms around public higher education in Indiana.</p>
                <p>The issues awaiting the university&apos;s new leadership, while not unlike those of 1964, are
                    much more complicated and complex. As the percentage of the operating budget from the state has
                    decreased over the last thirty years, the gaps must be made up. Some of that need has resulted in
                    higher tuition, but there remains great pressure on the IU Foundation and on the development
                    officers of the individual campuses<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-071" n="293"/>and schools to raise private
                    funds, as well as a push for more external funding from federal agencies, foundations, and industry
                    There exists here and elsewhere in the country a new emphasis on public universities as engines for
                    economic growth in their states. <placeName>

                    between 1.2 and 1.5 billion dollars from the state over the next decade in support of the
                    initiative. Interest in IU&apos;s athletic programs, especially football and basketball, stands
                    at an all-time high; these programs exert their own demands upon the university&apos;s fiscal
                    resources. Meanwhile, as undergraduate tuition has increased, students (and in some cases their
                    families) view themselves as customers entitled to certain rights and privileges; their further
                    expectation that undergraduate education should lead directly to employment translates into enormous
                    interest in the quality of placement offices. Several years ago what was initially created in the
                    1970s as the Indiana Vocational and Technical College was transformed, at the urging of Gov. Frank
                    O&apos;Bannon, to a community college. The campuses of Ivy Tech now offer general education
                    courses as well as vocational and technical training. This major shift offers challenges, especially
                    to IU&apos;s regional campuses, and perhaps opportunities as well. The tension between IUPUI and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which has existed for many years, has grown greater in recent years as IUPUI faculty
                    and alumni urge the trustees and the state to recognize their campus&apos;s research strengths,
                    and even to consider IUPUI an equal, in its quality, power, and authority, to campuses in <placeName>

                <p>This final issue raises an important question that will continue to face IU&apos;s leaders in the
                    coming years. Is Indiana University one university or a university system-that is, are we a single
                    entity with multiple campuses, or a collection of campuses under one name, such as the University of
                    Wisconsin? Presidents and board members have consistently advanced the idea that IU is one
                    university Tom Ehrlich, who served as IU president from 1987 to 1994, coined the phrase
                    &quot;one university with eight front doors.&quot; Ehrlich&apos;s slogan really
                    didn&apos;t hold because of the feeling that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the dominant campus; the phrase turned into &quot;one university with one front
                    door and seven trap doors&quot;! Myles Brand, president from 1994 to 2002, tried the phrase
                    &quot;America&apos;s new public university,&quot; but that did not get very far either,
                    as alumni wanted to know what was wrong with America&apos;s <hi rend="i">old</hi> public
                    university.</p>
                <p>As these unsuccessful labeling efforts suggest, the controversy over IU&apos;s identity reflects
                    a broader cultural critique of higher education. The <pb id="VAA4025-103-3-072" n="294"/>existence
                    of such a critique should not surprise us. During the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viet Nam">Viet Nam</country>
                    </placeName> and Watergate years, the military and government came in for close scrutiny. The
                    questionable practices of savings and loan associations, healthcare providers and insurance
                    companies, and corporate CEOs and their boards of directors, have each garnered similar public
                    attention in their time.</p>
                <p>The attacks on higher education flourished between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s. The reasons for
                    the appearance during this period of such books as <hi rend="i">Profscam: Professors and the Demise
                        of Higher Educatio</hi>n (1988) by Charles J. Sykes; <hi rend="i">The Closing of the American
                        Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today&apos;s
                        Students</hi> (1987) by Allan Bloom; and <hi rend="i">Tenured Radicals: How Politics has
                        Corrupted our Higher Education</hi> (1990) by Roger Kimball are quite clear: each of these
                    attacks responded to the growing practice, especially in research institutions, of providing
                    significantly greater rewards to faculty members for their research activities than for the quality
                    of their teaching or service. My colleagues on the Committee for Institutional Cooperation (CIC,
                    comprising the chief academic officers of the Big Ten plus the University of Chicago) recognized
                    this skewed rewards system and tried to identify means to enhance rewards for good teachers.
                    Obviously, research, because it is reviewed by external entities (whether faculty committees or
                    advisors to agencies and foundations), is much easier to measure than teaching. Still, significant
                    advances have been made against the skewing of the reward system, and the attack on
                    &quot;children teaching children&quot; (a reference to graduate students taking over much of
                    the undergraduate teaching load) has subsided.</p>
                <p>There were, however, consequences to these attacks. As legislatures across the country decreased the
                    proportion of state contributions to the operating budgets of public higher education institutions,
                    universities made up the difference in hefty tuition increases, often outpacing rises in inflation.
                    Parents came increasingly to expect proper training, placement, and care for their children, and
                    students, acting in the role of customers, expected special treatment. I have heard many presidents
                    point out that the phrase &quot;state supported&quot;-a normal synonym for public higher
                    education in Herman Wells&apos;s time-changed to &quot;state assisted,&quot; and has
                    more recently become &quot;state located.&quot; In some states the percentage of the budget
                    from the legislature rests in single digits. The state-provided percentage of IU&apos;s
                    operating budget was 48 percent in 1976 and 23 percent in 2006; for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the figures are 52 percent in 1976 and 22 percent in 2006. In such an atmosphere of
                    questioning <pb id="VAA4025-103-3-073" n="295"/>and criticism, university trustees or regents want
                    detailed information about policies in which they took no interest at all in past decades. The
                    responsibility of continual explanation, defense, and advocacy falls heavily on administrators at
                    all levels of institutions like IU.</p>
                <p>Another casualty of the critical attention focused on universities has been the average
                    administrative term of office. During my first decade or so at IU, it was typical for chairs of
                    large departments to serve up to 25 years; the same was true of deans. While the number of years was
                    somewhat less, presidential service tended to range into double digits. Now, chairs and deans come
                    and go with much greater frequency, while the typical college president in this country serves an
                    average of five or six years. This change adversely affects the potential for long-range
                    planning--which is in my opinion crucial to the success of higher education institutions--and it
                    also leads to real confusion among citizens concerning the priorities (because they seem to change
                    so often) of institutions like <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName> and Purdue, in this state, and of comparable institutions in surrounding states.</p>
                <p>Herman Wells was as richly endowed with leadership skills as anyone I have known. But the number of
                    constituencies and the demand for accountability that characterize today&apos;s public
                    university would have taxed his talents to the fullest. What skills, then, are needed to respond to
                    these many constituencies and to satisfy their needs, requests, even demands? What skills will
                    tomorrow&apos;s leaders require to meet the challenges presented by the issues that face not
                    only the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and IU leaders need, above all, enormous energy. The staggering demands on their time
                    come not only from faculty, staff, students, and alumni, but also from groups such as the state
                    Chamber of Commerce, and from entities formed either by the governor or the state legislature to
                    revamp the <placeName>

                    </placeName> economy as it shifts away from manufacturing and agriculture and toward technology. The
                    president in particular must meet with individuals interested in technology transfer, with state
                    government officials planning trips abroad who need information about the countries they will be
                    visiting, with various economic groups focusing on the life sciences or medical research in general,
                    with legislators concerned about the relationship between IU&apos;s School of Education and the
                    state&apos;s K-12 schools, with managers of the Clarian Health Partners experiment that joins
                    the IU and Riley hospitals with Methodist Hospital in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These and other meetings come on top of one-on-one conversations with members of a
                    board of trustees <pb id="VAA4025-103-3-074" n="296"/>that delves more deeply, from my perspective,
                    into the organization of the institution than was the case in the last thirty years. Some want to
                    know in detail the admissions process; others are looking at outsourcing entities such as the motor
                    pool, the bookstore, food services in the residence halls, printing services--indeed anything not
                    directly related to the academic mission of the institution. Herman Wells certainly had energy, but
                    that energy was directed to a smaller number of individuals and a smaller cluster of issues.</p>
                <p>Faculty and alumni, as perhaps has always been the case, expect their leaders to have excellent
                    academic credentials while also demonstrating strong managerial experience. That combination is
                    becoming increasingly difficult to find. Some institutions have gone to an outside and inside
                    &quot;president,&quot; though not calling it as such--meaning that one individual focuses on
                    fundraising, alumni activities, and legislative relations, while the other, almost like a
                    co-president, focuses on the academic needs of the institution and on the best means to enhance its
                    reputation and strengthen its faculty.</p>
                <p>&quot;Vision&quot; is an overused word in higher education, as it is elsewhere in American
                    culture. Nonetheless, the president is expected to demonstrate vision and to lay out a clear
                    plan--even a &quot;strategic plan&quot; --that points the institution in the directions it
                    needs to go to meet its priorities and to respond to its multiple constituencies and issues.
                    Everyone wants a bit of the president&apos;s time, wants him or her to manage the institution
                    well, to continue to demonstrate strengths as an academic, and to express a vision that still
                    remains grounded in sound business practices. As more than one person has said, institutions of
                    higher education looking for a president are trying to find someone who is like &quot;God on a
                    good day&quot;.</p>
                <p>The business of running an institution the size and complexity of IU, then, differs significantly
                    from Herman Wells&apos;s time. In the many presidential staff meetings I attended in my 23 years
                    as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> chancellor and vice president for academic affairs for IU, it was difficult at times to
                    know if I was in an academic institution or not. We talked about bond ratings and the intricacies of
                    bonding authority for certain new buildings, about how IU would present itself at the State Fair,
                    about the need to update the infrastructure of an old campus like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, about legal issues surrounding affirmative action and disabilities, and about other
                    matters that simply were not on the table during Wells&apos;s presidential tenure.</p>
                <p>Wells was a wonderful fundraiser. While we expect the same of the president and his staff in 2007,
                    the stakes are much higher: fundraising <pb id="VAA4025-103-3-075" n="297"/><figure>
                        <p rend="center">Herman B Wells, with IU faculty on the day of his inauguration as university

                    </figure>has become the source of such a significant percentage of the budgets of individual schools
                    and campuses, as well as of public universities in general. The same is true of external research
                    support from federal agencies and national foundations. The call for more faculty research is as
                    much about institutional financial needs as it is about raising academic reputations. Imagine how
                    challenging it is for a president and his staff to balance the time devoted to fundraising and to
                    legislative relations, both state and federal, with time needed to maintain contact with major fed
                    eral granting agencies as well as major foundations, with time needed to cultivate prospective major
                    donors. That in itself might be considered a full-time job, but is only a portion of what a
                    president must do. The challenge is greater in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName> because ours is not a wealthy state, and the legislature supports two major research
                    institutions, while IUPUI seeks to become a third.</p>
                <p>Thanks in part to these fiscal pressures, Division I athletics have, for good or ill, become bigger
                    than ever at institutions like IU. The income derived from television and radio broadcast rights,
                    from adver-<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-076" n="298"/>tising in football or basketball programs, and from
                    the sale of logo T- shirts, sweatshirts, and every other kind of item is staggering. Alumni interest
                    in athletics, always high, is even higher now than it was in Wells&apos;s time because of the
                    impact of television, especially ESPN, which televises hundreds of college basketball and football
                    games each year. The Big Ten TV Network will begin soon; each institution in the Big Ten expects to
                    net an additional five to eight million dollars in revenue annually from the network&apos;s
                    broadcasts. The fact that the University of Tennessee, Ohio State University, and the University of
                    Michigan have been battling for several years over which school&apos;s stadium would have the
                    largest seating capacity is one more indication of how close universities have come to
                    professionalizing intercollegiate sports.</p>
                <p>In addition to being more dependent than ever before upon commercial revenue, the contemporary
                    university must also respond to the diversification and globalization of American culture. Given all
                    the controversy surrounding affirmative action, it remains the case that ethnic groups expect not
                    only to be heavily recruited at places like IU, but also to find there assistance through mentors,
                    tutors, academic support centers, and advisors for especially difficult courses, most notably in
                    mathematics. For a small state such as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName>, the challenge is even greater. With a minority population so much smaller than that of
                    surrounding states such as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region>

                    </placeName>, and <placeName>

                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName> draws from a smaller minority applicant pool; the battle to get the best and brightest
                    from that pool is fearsome. The president, of course, does not actively recruit, but he or she is
                    certainly expected to encourage appropriate actions to enhance diversity at all levels of the
                    institution, as well as to speak out with some regularity on the importance of exposing university
                    students to the kind of diversity that they will surely encounter in the decades after they have
                    graduated.</p>
                <p>More than most university presidents, Herman Wells understood the concept of globalization long
                    before that word became commonplace. Having said that, Wells did not have to deal with the large
                    number of international students attending IU (although there were more than at many other
                    institutions in his time), nor did he have to deal with the growing belief that undergraduates must
                    spend a significant time overseas--and by that I mean not just several weeks, but preferably a whole
                    semester or year, learning another language and about another culture. The Eurocentric model is
                    fading, as the importance of <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7000198" reg="Bharat">India</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000111" reg="Zhonghua">China</country>
                    </placeName> in particular becomes more apparent and as the need for university-to-university
                    relationships, student and faculty exchanges, and sup-<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-077" n="299"/>port in
                    helping to build institutions of higher education in such countries grows each year. The president
                    is expected to have a real sense of these external forces; people anticipate that he will have a
                    plan for further internationalizing campuses such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and for achieving global literacy for all IU students.</p>
                <p>With all of these demands on a president&apos;s time, one cannot overlook the fact that faculty
                    and students in particular, and to a lesser degree staff, perceive the president as their leader and
                    therefore expect him or her to take a significant interest in them. With all the other groups and
                    individuals the president must deal with, he needs to remember that his primary audiences are
                    faculty and students. This means that the president must be visible at faculty events, involved in
                    faculty hires at advanced levels, knowledgeable about major shifts in disciplines and professional
                    schools and how to deal with them, while also interacting on a personal level with student leaders.
                    Is there enough time in a day? In a week or a month?</p>
                <p>Institutions of higher education are not dictatorships, as they were not in Wells&apos;s time.
                    People expect the president and his team to be good consensus-builders, and that, obviously, takes
                    time as well as much careful planning and effort. New initiatives don&apos;t spring full-blown
                    from the president&apos;s head. They are gradually introduced, fleshed out, widely discussed and
                    debated; then, assuming some consensus gathers around them, action can be taken. Wells had to do the
                    same thing, but, as I have said, the circle of constituents involved was much smaller and the number
                    of groups needing to be placated was also smaller. That, as many know, is one of the criticisms of
                    higher education-it is not nimble enough. I can think of many examples when IU has been nimble if
                    necessary, but it is not the customary mode of behavior.</p>
                <p>When all is said and done, university leaders hope to be beloved. That was certainly true of Herman
                    Wells. I think it is much more difficult now for any university president to be beloved; to expect
                    agreement on any of the complex issues I&apos;ve commented on, as well as among the various
                    constituencies of the institution, is extraordinarily challenging. Praised for candor, honored for
                    good achievements, noted for some striking and successful initiatives--all might be possible, but
                    &quot;beloved&quot; is probably not going to be a word used at a president&apos;s
                    farewell reception.</p>
                <p>And that brings me back to the underlying values of higher education. When I came to IU in 1964, I
                    found it, as I indicated earlier, collegial, friendly, humane, understated, even happy. Each of
                    these values is, in my opinion, becoming more problematic at IU and other institutions<pb
                        id="VAA4025-103-3-078" n="300"/>like it in the first part of the twenty-first century. Years
                    ago, the collegiality of the campus resulted from the fact that many faculty were hired at the same
                    time in the same department or school as the university expanded significantly its faculty ranks.
                    With departments such as English or History hiring six or more faculty in a given year, collegiality
                    was almost built in. Now, it is more common that one and at the most two might be hired, and, given
                    the pressure on them to achieve tenure, they might not have the time to get to know colleagues in
                    related departments or schools. That&apos;s one reason why the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus some seven years ago initiated a series of information sessions and monthly
                    programs for all new faculty on important topics--the point was not solely the topic or the
                    information, but rather to get new faculty together so that they would know their peers across
                    campus and be ready to participate fully in campus service when the time came that they achieved
                    tenure. Unfortunately, the pressure on tenure is such that most chairs and deans will encourage
                    young faculty to focus on their research and teaching, and not do much service; thus, when faculty
                    members receive tenure, they are not in the habit of serving the community and the campus. One can
                    see this in the membership of the elected Bloomington Faculty Council, which has changed only
                    slightly over the last several decades. I&apos;m told by my colleagues on the CIC that this is a
                    major problem for the other Big Ten institutions, as well.</p>
                <p>While IU remains a friendly place, the competition for resources creates tensions among schools,
                    deans, faculty and staff, even students, and those tensions undermine the natural inclination, on a
                    campus such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington&apos;s</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to remain friendly and open. Internal competition for research awards and other kinds
                    of recognition is intense, and while such competition may enhance the campus reputation, I
                    don&apos;t believe it leads to the kind of friendly atmosphere that I experienced forty years
                    ago.</p>
                <p>The competitive spirit strikes, as well, at other aspects of university life. The interest on the
                    part of several trustees in outsourcing many activities, such as the university&apos;s
                    bookstores, overlooks a major strength of a campus like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington&apos;s</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In part because of the size of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, employees on campus have worked here for dozens of years, as have their siblings,
                    perhaps their parents, even their grandparents. That tradition has created a peculiar and unique
                    culture among Big Ten institutions. All the staff members that I know, no matter where they work,
                    have enormous loyalty to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus and to IU, and take great pride in the ways in which their work contributes to
                        the<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-079" n="301"/>success of the institution. If the trustees continue to
                    outsource other entities not directly contributing to academics, inevitably over time individuals in
                    charge of these units will have little or no loyalty to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and IU, little or no sense of pride in how they are advancing the institution. The
                    money saved from this outsourcing is not great and is, in most cases, one-time funding only. This
                    gives the current trustees additional resources to devote to infrastructure and renovations, but it
                    leaves future trustees with no such resources, without knowledge of what prices might be charged by
                    the external agency that wins the bidding process and becomes the &quot;owner&quot; of the
                    bookstore, residential food services, printing services, or whatever. In terms of maintaining <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> culture, outsourcing is shortsighted; in terms of the resources gained, it makes the
                    current trustees look good at the expense of burdening their successors. Inevitably, outsourcing
                    leads to layoffs or to shifts to new jobs which may or may not take advantage of the
                    employee&apos;s strengths built over time. In short, outsourcing is already making the campus
                    less humane than it was in Wells&apos;s time and has the potential of destroying a culture that
                    made the campus so attractive to me when I arrived here in 1964.</p>
                <p>One of the many reasons why Herman Wells was beloved was because he was so visible. A president gives
                    a face and a voice to a university. Now, however, that face and voice may be more visible to
                    constituencies and audiences outside of IU campuses than it is to those on-campus constituents who
                    want the president to be at once their colleague and leader. That traditional presence before
                    faculty, staff, and students is not just an agent of collegiality--it is itself an act of
                    collegiality: if the president is known, the campuses feel that he or she knows about the people and
                    the character and the value of the work that they do. I have said elsewhere that I deeply regret
                    that outgoing IU president Adam Herbert&apos;s enormous warmth did not get sufficient attention
                    during his term. That may be a result of the structure of the job. Perhaps the values that Herman
                    Wells stood for--a sense of commonality, of working to achieve and to advance common educational and
                    institutional results--are now irretrievable. Still, they are the ones that Wells embodied, and the
                    new president, along with the people who help to arrange the structure of his job, would do well to
                    try to find twenty-first-century ways to show that the IU presidency continues to stand for the
                    things that people in the University will do and believe in for four years, or eight years, or their
                    entire lives.</p>

                    pain as well as joy growing up. Kurt VonnegutJr. was born into the fourth generation of a
                    spectacularly prosperous German American extended family of farmers, merchants, and artisans that
                    first arrived in Indianapolis in the years before the Civil War. As his Uncle John Rauch observed in

                    which later became Vonnegut Hardware. Its success made the Vonneguts aristocratic leaders of their
                    community and allowed the men to pursue professions. Kurt&apos;s grandfather, Bernard, and
                    father, Kurt Sr., were licensed architects, responsible for many of the architectural gems of
                    Indianapolis, including <hi rend="i">Das Deutsche Haus</hi>, the L. S. Ayres department store (and
                    its legendary clock), the William H. Block building, the Lyric Theatre, and the Bell Telephone
                    downtown headquarters. Kurt&apos;s mother, Edith, despite a traumatic childhood, was similarly
                    the beneficiary of the Lieber Brewery fortune, which afforded her an elite education, grand tours of
                    European churches, museums, and castles, and high expectations for the future. Kurt and
                    Edith&apos;s wedding party at <pb id="VAA4025-103-3-084" n="306"/>the Claypool Hotel in 1913 was
                    an extravagant celebration, both in cost and scale, an event &quot;long remembered in
                    Indianapolis,&quot; according to Uncle John. &quot;The next year,&quot; however,
                    &quot;came the First World War and then prohibition. The curtain fell on a glorious scene--never
                    to be witnessed again.&quot; The xenophobic furies unleashed by the war effectively

                    vandals with yellow paint, became the Atheneum. Kurt and Edith grew so afflicted with <hi rend="i"
                        >Weltshmerz</hi> for their lost prewar world that they were unable or unwilling to pass along
                    much German language, music, or culture to their youngest son, Kurt Jr., who arrived in 1922.
                    &quot;They volunteered to make me ignorant and rootless as proof of their patriotism,&quot;
                    Vonnegut recalled ruefully. His parents separated him so thoroughly from his ancestral past, he
                    wrote, that the German soldiers who captured him at the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, far from being
                    brothers, &quot;might as well have been Bolivians or Tibetans for all they meant to

                <p>By the time of the Great Depression, the Vonneguts&apos; financial fortunes also went into steep
                    decline. There were no missed meals at their elegant home on North Illinois Street, but Kurt Sr.
                    could not find a commission for a decade and a half after the stock market crash of 1929. The family
                    found itself juggling creditors (enduring a growing, humiliating reputation as
                    &quot;charge-account deadbeats&quot;) and sinking on capital made of quicksand. The stress
                    of these losses no doubt contributed to Edith&apos;s suicide on Mother&apos;s Day weekend
                    1944, with her youngest son visiting home while training to go overseas at Camp Atterbury. It also
                    &quot;gutted&quot; the spirit of Kurt Sr., who, after the war, became a recluse, eventually
                    living out his life in solitude as a potter in <placeName>

                    &quot;empty graces and aggressively useless possessions&quot; whose passing they mourned,
                    the house was full of books, magazines, and art, and they inoculated their children against what
                    they saw as the twin poisons of organized religion and racism. As to the former, Kurt inherited the
                    ancestral creed of free-thinking skepticism, although he often termed himself a
                    &quot;Christ-worshipping agnostic,&quot; referring to the Christ of the Sermon on the Mount.
                    As to the latter, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Vonnegut remembered, was as divided by Jim Crow segregation during his childhood as
                    any southern city. Of his parents, he said, &quot;I&apos;m grateful that I learned from them
                    that organized religion is anti-Christian and that racial prejudices are stupid and
                        cruel.&quot;<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p>
                <p>Still, loss is a dominant motif of his youth. Like his elder siblings, Bernard and Edith, he had no
                    reason to return home once he left for the larger world. &quot;The planet (my parents) loved and
                    thought they understood was destroyed in the First World War.&quot; The warm &quot;folk
                    society&quot; prepared for the next generation had disintegrated. In future years Vonnegut, like
                    millions of other displaced, &quot;rootless&quot; Americans, would pose this question when
                    visiting his native city: &quot;&apos;Where is my bed?&apos;&quot; He eventually
                    ended up on the East Coast, convinced that the Midwest was a lonelier, less hospitable place to
                    practice writing or the arts. &quot;No writers live there,&quot; he said in 1969.
                    &quot;[A]s a writer, you don&apos;t feel you&apos;re pulling your weight, doing
                    man&apos;s work.&quot; In a similar vein, he commented on the persistence of the <placeName>

                    regarded as an evasion of real life by means of parlor tricks.&quot; Over the decades he saw
                    many of the downtown buildings created by his family bulldozed in favor of parking lots. He observed

                    many back home, who either ignored or condemned his writing. He maintained that his use of raw
                    language and imagery, his pessimism, and the &quot;bad manners&quot; exhibited in his later
                    books, were an attempt at last to break through the mendacious middle-class propriety with which he
                    had been raised. &quot;Even when I was in grammar school,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I
                    suspected that warnings about words that nice people never used were in fact lessons in how to keep

                <p>On a snowy January day, I read this collection of essays on Indiana law from cover to cover. Written
                    by two judges of the Indiana Court of Appeals, one member of the Indiana Supreme Court staff, one
                    federal district judge, six professors (three of them historians), and six practicing attorneys, the
                    articles provide broad overviews of major topics in legal history (civil liberties, crime, family
                    law, women&apos;s rights, race, and courts) as well as some less expected topics such as poor
                    law and education. The volume also includes a section on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> bench and bar and an appendix entitled &quot;History of Official Indiana
                    Statutes,&quot; a gem of an essay by the Indiana Legislative Council never mentioned in the text
                    but very useful to all who cite <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName> statutes.</p>
                <p>Readers of this journal will have seen the &quot;teaser&quot; article,
                    &quot;Indiana&apos;s Legal History,&quot; by editors Bodenhamer (a professor of history
                    at IUPUI) and Shepard (Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court) in the December 2005 <hi rend="i"
                        >IMH</hi>. That article, like the revised version of it that serves as the book&apos;s
                    introduction, deals well, albeit briefly, with the broad strokes of law and economics not addressed
                    elsewhere in the book. The introduction also establishes the theme of &quot;narrative and
                    counter-narrative&quot; in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName> legal history, a theme that the editors see as being at times in step with and at other
                    times isolated from national legal culture. Several essays adopt this thematic style; other chapters
                    are narrative; and two, filled with bulleted paragraphs and ubiquitous acronyms, consist largely of
                    policy analysis.</p>
                <p>As to the articles themselves, some pruning is in order. For example, the reader encounters the
                    creation of the Indiana Juvenile Court Act of 1903 in three chapters (pp. 73, 119, 152). The right
                    of paupers to counsel is also addressed three times (pp. 114, 203, 328), as is <hi rend="i">In re
                        Leach</hi>,<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-092" n="314"/>which admitted women to the bar (pp. 183,
                    281,331). Near the end of the book two subsections, &quot;Admission to Practice Law&quot;
                    (p. 265) and &quot;Admission to the Bar&quot; (p. 279), cover roughly the same ground within
                    twelve pages of one another.</p>
                <p>Admittedly many readers will not read every essay, but if they pick and choose topics, they may miss
                    relevant materials buried in unexpected chapters or expect to find discussions that have been
                    overlooked. James Madison&apos;s &quot;Race, Law, and the Burdens of Indiana
                    History&quot; deals with African Americans, but neither here nor in any other chapter do Native
                    Americans appear. Madison covers major pre-Civil War slave/servant cases, including <hi rend="i"
                        >State v. Lasselle</hi>, involving the right of a slave woman, Polly, to freedom (p. 42). Yet
                    Polly&apos;s circumstances receive fuller treatment in chapters titled &quot;<placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName> Judges&quot; (p. 306) and &quot;Political Pragmatism and Common Sense&quot;
                    (p. 326), hardly the places where most readers would look. And while the volume includes an index,
                    neither Polly nor Mary Clark, an African American litigant in another well-known freedom suit (p.
                    42) appears in it (Lasselle is indexed to pp. 42 and 326, but not 306). The indexer has also left
                    out district court (territorial), circuit courts (local and federal), and the U.S. Supreme Court,
                    although an entire chapter treats the &quot;U.S. Supreme Court on Circuit in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region>

                    </placeName> courts and lawyers.</p>
                <p>The volume contains very few textual errors, but two deserve mention. Alexander Hamilton did not
                    defend John Peter Zenger in 1735 (p. 133), because he wasn&apos;t born until 1755. And the
                    Indiana Supreme Court, not that of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, heard <hi rend="i">Bayh v. Sonnenburg</hi> (p. 208).</p>
                <p>Despite minor flaws, the book also warrants compliments. Every state should have a book like this,
                    and the authors and editors deserve a great deal of credit for adding this one to the four existing
                    volumes in the Law, Society and Politics in the Midwest series. Many of the essay writers have
                    searched extensively for materials, developing their chapters despite the scarcity of modern legal
                    historical research.</p>
                <p>With the exception of David Bodenhamer&apos;s works on the grand jury and on antebellum crime,
                    few <placeName>

                    1970s and practiced extensively elsewhere. The authors of similar state studies on the East and West
                    coasts could cite multiple local analyses of order books, probate records, trial court records, and
                    loose papers-- the stuff of modern studies of how law affected everyday people. <placeName>

                    in available legislative, appellate, and secondary materials. They have identified and explained the

                    arrangements, and major judicial turning points. It is now up to the next generation of legal
                    historians to dig deeper and discover how Indiana law worked.</p>

                <p>What is striking about this story is its similarity to the larger narrative of Irish American

                    </placeName> most notable Irish trader was Dublin-born George Croghan, whose mid-eighteenth-century
                    trade network extended from <placeName>

                    During the period of mass immigration in the nineteenth century, Irish began to settle <placeName>

                    </placeName> in increasing numbers, attracted by the opportunity for work-first, the building of
                    roads, then canals, and finally the railroad. Like most Irish immigrants at this time (1830-1860),
                    they were unskilled laborers who were in search of work.</p>

                    age, Irish blue-collar factory workers became a common sight in these cities.</p>
                <p>Irish immigrants were also active politically, serving in the General Assembly and in city and town
                    offices. As was true elsewhere, they supported the Democratic party. Irish Hoosiers fought in the
                    Civil War alongside other Irish regiments from the Northern states. Like other Irish they founded
                    their own ethnic organizations such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Ardent nationalists, they
                    supported the cause of Irish independence throughout the nineteenth century, contributing thousands
                    of dollars toward this effort.</p>
                <p>In the twentieth century, especially after the Second World War, Indiana&apos;s Irish began to
                    move up economically. They became more American than Irish, loyal patriots as well as proud
                    Catholics. Their Irish identity began to fade as they grew further removed from <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000078" reg="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> and their immigrant roots. Then, in the late 1960s, an ethnic revival captured the
                    imagination of millions of Americans. Among the Irish, music and dance enjoyed a revival as city
                    after city in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and elsewhere sponsored heritage festivals. Being Irish was &quot;in&quot;
                    among a new generation of American-born Hoosiers who claimed Irish ancestry. By 1990 they numbered
                    almost one million, or about 18 percent of the state&apos;s population. Giffin has added a
                    discussion of this cultural awakening to his original essay. A number of illustrations and a useful
                    index further enhance the value of this new edition.</p>

                <p>In 1859, the State Board of Agriculture ordered the construction of a state fairground on thirty-six
                    acres of land on the north edge of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Barns and sheds would hold the livestock, and a few administrative buildings were
                    erected. In April 1861, this site became Camp Morton, where thousands of new volunteers, answering
                    President Lincoln&apos;s call to arms, camped and drilled.</p>
                <p>Not until early 1862, after the fall of Forts Henry and Donalson in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007825" reg="Tennessee">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, did Camp Morton become the repository of more than 3,000 Confederate prisoners of war.
                    In <hi rend="i">Den of<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-095" n="317"/>Misery</hi>, James R. Hall reminds us that
                    during the Civil War, the North was as capable of inflicting degradation and humiliation on its
                    captive combatants in places like Camp Morton, as was the South at sites such as <placeName>

                <p>The author is a career journalist and freelance writer, interested primarily in resurrecting the
                    controversy surrounding wartime conditions at Camp Morton. He dismisses as &quot;a scholarly
                    undertaking &#x2026; no more, no less,&quot; the 1940 <hi rend="i">Camp Morton,

                <p>I would have preferred Hall to have used the eight-volume document collection devoted to prisoner of
                    war camps--<hi rend="i">The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union
                        and Confederate Armies</hi> (1894-1899)--together with other primary sources available at the
                    Indiana Historical Society and the Indiana State Library, in order to present a more balanced
                    assessment of the facts underlying the controversy.</p>
                <p>Hall does make extensive use of the testimony of Dr. John A. Wyeth, a survivor of Camp Morton, who
                    published an article in the April 1891 issue of <hi rend="i">Century Monthly Magazine</hi>,
                    recalling the dreadful conditions and treatment meted out to inmates. Wyeth was serving in the 4th
                    Alabama Cavalry when he was taken prisoner by Union troops in October 1863, and was not released
                    until February 1865. Hall neatly summarizes Wyeth&apos;s allegations as &quot;a firsthand
                    and often shocking and explicit account of starvation, exposure to extreme cold and heat, beatings
                    by prison guards, and even cold-blooded murder of innocent prisoners within the confines of this
                    Northern prison complex&quot; (p. 17). In a September 1891 article in <hi rend="i">Century
                        Monthly</hi>, officials and members of the Indiana Grand Army of the Republic disputed these
                    charges, but Hall dismisses the defense as &quot;generally sarcastic and condescending, often
                    downright arrogant&quot; (p. 66), and maintains that since 1891 no one has taken
                    Wyeth&apos;s claims seriously. Few historians would dispute that conditions at Camp Morton grew
                    progressively worse from late 1863 on, due in large part to the prison&apos;s coming under the
                    jurisdiction of the federal Commissary General of Prisons, which tightened regulations and decreased
                    provisions in retaliation for cruel treatment of Union troops at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2021938" reg="Andersonville">Andersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and elsewhere in the South.</p>
                <p>When it comes to evaluating the charges of Wyeth and other prisoners, however, one must also
                    acknowledge that officials at Camp Morton, as well as federal inspectors, apparently tried to make
                    conditions tolerable. Reports by honorable men from both the Confederacy and the Union contain
                    conflicting evidence of how the camp was run and of how much the inmates suffered.</p>
                <p>Hall provides a substantial service to Civil War historians by listing in an appendix all of the
                    Confederates who<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-096" n="318"/>died at Camp Morton. Official figures put their
                    number at 1,763 out of the entire prison population of 12,082. They were eventually laid to rest in
                    a special section of Crown Hill Cemetery in <placeName>

                    introductions and fifty-two pages of detailed notes, Reinhart provides information on battles,
                    skirmishes, and marches; qualifies and corrects accounts of the numbers killed and injured on both

                <p>The most interesting letters, seventeen in all, were written by an infantryman who called himself

                    Prussian-born organizer of the regiment. One of the motifs in the letters is the pride taken by the
                    officers and infantrymen in their colonel&apos;s leadership qualities and in his paternalistic
                    affection for them. The soldiers also express ethnic pride in their courage and their important
                    contributions to the Union cause. Aware that nativists questioned their patriotism as
                    &quot;foreigners,&quot; the German Americans had something to prove, and took defiant
                    satisfaction in proclaiming it in print.</p>

                    of diarrhea, lung infection, and swollen feet. His letters reveal no devotion to freedom, great
                    leaders, moral principle, or ethnic pride. In different ways, Antaxerxes and Brandes are both part
                    of, and help to tell, the German American story.</p>

                <p> It is appropriate that Carolyn S. Bridge is listed as compiler rather than editor of this volume on
                    the 69th Indiana Volunteer Infantry. She provides only five pages of preface and introduction and
                    offers occasional<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-098" n="320"/>footnotes and headnotes. The book consists of a
                    wide variety of documents including an 1891 record of the regiment&apos;s activities;
                    reminiscences told at reunions and published in the proceedings; poetry read at reunions; letters
                    sent to family and to newspapers; soldier biographies; a bibliography, timeline, and map; company
                    rosters; and a ten-minute compact disk of regimental poetry and song. Soldiers&apos;
                    reminiscences and letters occupy about half of the volume&apos;s four hundred pages, but the
                    texts have not benefited from many editorial emendations. Bridge composed the brief biographies of
                    the infantrymen, but they are nowhere summarized into a collective biography that would offer social
                    statistics about the regiment. In short, what this project lacks is editorial and scholarly
                    ambition, beyond the energy required to compile materials and write up facts. Instead, it remains
                    for the reader to put together a comprehensive understanding of the regiment&apos;s
                    accomplishments, their larger significance, and their connection to existing scholarship. Indeed,
                    this volume is more a regimental scrapbook than a regimental history. However, it can be a useful
                    and interesting scrapbook.</p>
                <p>The first document is Lt. Col. Oran Perry&apos;s account of the events of August 1862, describing
                    how a thousand men were mustered into service in the regiment, a &quot;big, unwieldy thing,
                    good-natured, but awkward and dangerous&quot; (p. 3). The first battle, at <placeName>

                <p>My guess is that Jason Hiner is too young to have been around for Indiana University&apos;s
                    1952-53 season--<hi rend="i">season,</hi> notjust the NCAA championship that crowned it. During that
                    year so many Hoosier frustrations were shed, replaced by joyful firsts--IU&apos;s first
                    100-point game, first outright Big Ten championship, first taste of No. 1 national ranking. I am old
                    enough to have made that joyride, not with a reporter&apos;s shackles but with the unrestricted
                    glee of a fan. As a senior at Huntington High School, late on a midweek March night with static
                    complicating the in-and-out faintness of the only attainable radio signal, I suffered through the
                    agonizing final seconds of the NCAA championship game: IU up 69-68, <placeName>

                    </placeName> with the ball, &quot;shot from the corner-r-r at the
                    buzzer-r-r&#x2026;&quot;</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="i">Mac&apos;s Boys: Branch McCracken and the Legendary 1953 Hurryin&apos;
                        Hoosier</hi>s, Hiner captures the unique quality of IU fans&apos; year-their fatalistic
                    resignation throughout, conditioned by past second places and near-misses; their undying
                    hopes--&quot;wouldn&apos;t it be fantastic if&quot;? Both extremes of pessimism and
                    optimism collided for so many Hoosiers while that game-determining shot hung in the air--a shot they
                    couldn&apos;t see, <pb id="VAA4025-103-3-100" n="322"/>because there was no TV Everything hung
                    on what that radio voice would say, after a silence that seemed like weeks.</p>
                <p>My read-through of &quot;Mac&apos;s Boys&quot; was as swift as a &apos;53 fast break.
                    I quibbled with Hiner at times: &quot;I don&apos;t need all this play-by-play; I
                    don&apos;t care who scored to make it 6-4 in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> game.&quot; I winced at some of the hyperbole: Did this team&apos;s feats
                    really cleanse college basketball of the stains of the 1950s gambling scandals? But as I was
                    quibbling a bit and wincing a little, I was racing through the pages to get to the delicacies: the
                    91-79 jinx-ending blowout at <placeName>

                <p>And that volatile championship game--three technical fouls against the Hoosiers, none against their
                    excitable coach, whose fuse was tested by an official scorebook change that kept <placeName>

                    </placeName> shot, against an IU team that had lost only three times all year, always on last-second
                    shots.</p>
                <p>This one missed, to a state-spanning feeling of deliverance.</p>
                <p>IU had earned a previous NCAA basketball championship in 1940. But the 1953 victory came after the
                    tournament had matured into national attention and just as television was dawning. Hiner captures
                    the significance of the marriage of IU basketball and television, which would spread a little
                    Hoosier heaven around on many a winter night to come.</p>
                <p>Hiner&apos;s research is impressive. He culls from at least ten books, surely a hundred
                    contemporary newspaper accounts, and a good dozen radio and TV recordings. That is how he beat the
                    handicap of setting out on his task too late to talk to key people--McCracken and his partner wife,
                    Mary Jo; scoring center Don Schlundt; the team&apos;s unsung great player, Dick Farley; and
                    several others. He used printed and recorded works that brought in the McCrackens&apos; voices.
                    And he used others&apos; testimony to show how revolutionary was Schlundt&apos;s scoring,
                    and how crucial was Farley&apos;s remarkable defensive work against opponents of all heights.</p>
                <p>Schlundt&apos;s fellow All-American, guard Bobby Leonard, is still around, to Hiner&apos;s
                    great benefit, because no one was more forthcoming. Leonard was maybe even more of a fan favorite
                    than Schlundt: he played with a sense of imminent explosion, of fire, of determination, of being the
                    team&apos;s rogue. Hiner confirms the last on page 149: &quot;When McCracken laid down the
                    ground rules at the first practice of the 1952-53 season, he placed special emphasis on his players
                    avoiding three things: smoking, drinking and gambling &#x2026; . &apos;I think everybody
                    knew that, for Bobby, those were three of his favorite occupations,&apos; said (teammate) Jim
                    Schooley.&quot;</p>
                <pb id="VAA4025-103-3-101" n="323"/>
                <p>So, Bobby Leonard was a rascal, but a great player and leader. A Hoosier all-timer-as was this team.</p>

                <p>Personal letters written by American soldiers from combat areas of operation can be insightful
                    artifacts. While veterans&apos; war stories, told years after the event, can be warped by tricks
                    of time and memory, letters often offer more immediate and honest assessments. Daniel H.

                    </placeName>, lends particular insights into a war still intensely debated today.</p>
                <p>Young FitzGibbon was not the average soldier in Southeast Asia, having graduated from West Point and
                    serving as an officer in <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viet Nam">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>. His letters reveal the thoughts and feelings of a more &quot;elite&quot; group
                    of servicemen. Given his background, it is perhaps not surprising that FitzGibbon never wavered in
                    his support for the war. However, his letters do indicate a growing concern with the ways in which
                    higher-ups were conducting the fighting. In one letter written in mid-1968, he frankly noted,
                    &quot;We&apos;ve had trouble getting contact with [the enemy] under favorable circumstances
                    although we&apos;re pushing quite a bit--this is one of the reasons I think this war will never
                    end in our favor&quot; (p. 86). This and other negative observations by the young Hoosier
                    regarding the U.S.&apos;s conduct of the war would prove prophetic, and it is interesting to see
                    how his sense of the war&apos;s imminent failure grows.</p>
                <p>FitzGibbon&apos;s letters also offer a sense of the day-to-day life of a low-level officer
                    leading men directly into combat. After one of his first combat experiences, he writes his parents
                    that he was &quot;definitely excited and &#x2026; my heart was beating swiftly.&quot;
                    These are not always easy letters to read. In the same correspondence he explains that
                    &quot;[o]ne does not go through combat and experience what I have experienced without being
                    affected in some manner. I have come to notice a certain smell in the air when someone is killed on
                    an operation&quot; (p. 65).</p>
                <p>Even the seemingly mundane events of FitzGibbon&apos;s time in <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viet Nam">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> often come across as interest-<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-102" n="324"/>ing. In one letter,
                    for example, he writes that &quot;with the rainy night, the hammock helped a little, although
                    even with a poncho over head the soaking rain made it difficult to sleep&quot; (p. 53). Overall,
                    these letters represent an interesting set of historical artifacts for anyone wishing to get a sense
                    of a young officer&apos;s trials and tribulations in <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viet Nam">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>. It would be of interest to read FitzGibbon&apos;s letters alongside those of
                    nonofficer-level draftees who experienced combat--the kind that appear, for example, in <hi rend="i"
                        >Dear America: Letters Home From <placeName>
                            <country key="tgn_1000145" reg="Viet Nam">Vietnam</country>
                        </placeName></hi>. Read together, they would reveal a wide spectrum of experiences, thoughts,
                    and feelings about a war that does not seem to go away.</p>

                <p>In this intriguing book, Edward Watts explores how Americans in the first half of the nineteenth
                    century constructed and used the history of French colonialism in North America. That history, Watts
                    persuasively argues, became a tool in debates about &quot;what type of nation the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would become,&quot; with one model--the destructive and racist British empire--set
                    against its kinder, gentler French counterpart. Thus, &quot;even as the French <hi rend="i"
                        >themselves</hi> were erased&quot; from the North American continent, &quot;their memory
                    retained a powerful presence in conversations the nation had about itself&quot; (pp. 11, 13).</p>
                <p>Watts has uncovered a remarkable array of nineteenth-century sources treating the history of French
                    colonialism in just this way. The French show up in discussions of Indian policy, interracial
                    marriage, middle-class masculinity, and the politics of westward expansion, and Watts treats these
                    topics in some detail. Watts also pays attention to the differences between the interpretations
                    advanced by western and eastern intellectuals and politicians. Western models, he argues, tended to
                    include the French as part of the story, embracing their adaptation to the wilderness and their
                    ability to build relationships with the region&apos;s Indians. Less locally-driven histories,
                    however, tended to treat the French as backward, if sympathetic, failures.</p>
                <p>Watts also considers the manner in which Americans used the French<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-103" n="325"
                    />in their efforts to negotiate the shifting currents of middle- and upper-class masculinity.
                    Nowhere is this analysis more successful than in his discussion of Francis Parkman&apos;s
                    ambivalent analysis of the French and the West they once controlled. Watts demonstrates that
                    Parkman&apos;s dismissive and highly critical reading of French colonial history in his
                    seven-volume <hi rend="i"><placeName>

                        rend="i">The Oregon Trail</hi>.</p>
                <p>Watts offers an especially rich analysis of the role of the French in national debates about the
                    nature of the white, patriarchal family. Proponents of strict, white, patriarchal social structures
                    considered the French and their Metis children &quot;monstrous exceptions&quot; to the
                    desired norm, while opponents of this stifling homogeneity noted the humanity and hope offered by
                    the alternative French society (chapter 4).</p>
                <p>Whether through &quot;idealization&quot; or &quot;debasement,&quot; then,
                    nineteenth-century writers marginalized the actual French by turning them into caricatures to serve
                    political ends. Perceptive of this historical trend, Watts seems less aware of his own idealization
                    of the French colonial past. For Watts, French <hi rend="i">habitants</hi> in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> country lived largely free of greed, eschewing the grasping capitalism of British
                    America in favor of a &quot;neighborly, egalitarian, and village-based&quot; way of life (p.
                    57). Amplifying Carl Ekberg&apos;s optimistic interpretation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> society, Watts insists that &quot;the ethos of inclusion and egalitarian
                    cooperation [was] practiced by the habitants&quot; (p. 89). A brief look into <placeName>

                <p>In the area of Indian relations, Watts argues that the Illinois French &quot;rarely were in
                    conflict with their Indian neighbors,&quot; living instead in the progressive bliss of <hi

                    </placeName>. Perhaps nowhere is Watts&apos; s rosy view of French colonialism more apparent

                    </placeName>, but Watts still makes the incredible claim that &quot;most habitants had little or
                    no contact with forced labor&quot; (p. 60). In his view, French slavery, governed by the
                    &quot;Code Noire&quot; [sic], was designed not to extract a maximum of profitable labor, but
                    to move slaves toward emancipation and racial integration. Even after omitting lower <placeName>

                    </placeName> from his study, this argument is hardly persuasive. To be fair, this is not a book
                    about actual French colonial history. But Watts loses an opportunity to explore<pb

                    nineteenth-century historiography because he may not recognize them as such. Readers would do well
                    to remember that the French write &quot;empire&quot; in the same way as their neighbors
                    across the channel.</p>

                <p>Home ownership was a common trait among Chicagoans well before the great fire of 1871, according to
                    Margaret Garb. In fact, she writes, it served as a marker distinguishing the city&apos;s middle
                    class from the working class. The surprising twist is that working-class Chicagoans--through
                    extended family, neighborhood networks, and other inventive means--scraped together down payments
                    with greater urgency than did the city&apos;s middle-class residents. Houses were so basic in
                    construction (often without utilities) that they offered a sounder financial investment for wage
                    laborers (both skilled and unskilled) than they did for the middle class who preferred apartments or
                    long-term leases on single-family homes, while investing their surplus dollars in higher-earning
                    business ventures.</p>
                <p>This ownership pattern continued after the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> fire, although, as the author demonstrates in her opening vignette, attempts by the
                    city council to regulate fireproof building materials such as brick and stone threatened to curtail
                    affordable housing for the working class. Workers protests against these new construction codes
                    devolved at times into physical confrontations, heralding an era of increased class strife. The
                    working class&apos;s capacity to purchase their own residences eroded during the 1880s as a
                    combination of technological improvements, the mortgage market, and stricter housing codes limited
                    their purchasing power. Water and sewer hookups, for example, entailed installation assessments and
                    ultimately raised property taxes. The growing involvement of financial institutions in the
                    residential mortgage market formalized a lending process that had been previously flexible and
                    creative. As housing prices climbed, the collateral once used by young couples to buy their first<pb
                        id="VAA4025-103-3-105" n="327"/>homes (reputation and family standing) would not satisfy
                    flinty-eyed bankers.</p>
                <p>Behind the toughening of indoor plumbing standards stood a variety of reformers whose investigations
                    into lower-class life created a drumbeat of criticism over unhealthy conditions in neighborhoods
                    that still relied upon corner pumps and backyard privies. In calling for improvements that might
                    alleviate the scourges of typhoid, cholera, diphtheria, and smallpox--clearly legitimate
                    considerations--social workers pressed city agencies to become, in essence, housing police whose
                    enforcement of tightened codes pushed the price of new housing beyond the reach of average workers.
                    At the same time, the growing value of residential housing during the late 1880s lured middle-class
                    buyers into this market as they envisioned owning their own piece of the &quot;American
                    Dream.&quot; Developers, most notably Samuel E. Gross, used the art of advertising to promote
                    this investment in a family&apos;s financial future. Finally, in the depths of the catastrophic
                    1890s depression, these builders switched to upscale construction, sealing the fate of affordable
                    housing for <placeName>

                    </placeName> working class. This emblem of the American Dream, once the proud possession of ordinary
                    folk, became, in the last years of the nineteenth century, a fading glimmer. Tenements and
                    subdivided single-family residences would suffice in the future, just as new waves of immigrants
                    flooded the city. In the next century, reformers would once again raise their voices against
                    tenement life, demanding that the city rid itself of another generation of inadequate housing.</p>
                <p>The author, a historian at Washington University St. Louis, offers a sound study based on a
                    conscientious examination of the primary sources. It is written in a scholarly mode, tainted on
                    occasion by repetition. Several of the photographs offer revealing glimpses into the world of

                    chapter and then developed at greater length at the end of the book, although this last unit has a
                    curious tone, reading more like a community history than the type of tightly woven analysis typical
                    of the earlier chapters.</p>

                <p>This book joins a number of other works that have placed the &quot;labor question&quot; at
                    the center of Progressive Era politics. Georg Leidenberger argues that the ability of labor unions
                    to connect their interests to a civic or public interest explains how they became, in a
                    &quot;progressive moment,&quot; the lightning rod for a movement for municipal ownership and
                    control of the <placeName>

                <p> Workplace and community-wide strategies that stretched the structural limits of the American
                    Federation of Labor created a style of unionism capable of altering the landscape of power in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Unions of the teamsters and the teachers were the base for this transformation.
                    Teamsters&apos; use of the sympathy strike--which included for example, the refusal to deliver
                    goods to department stores when their women workers went on strike--was the vehicle for building a
                    broadly based movement and for helping to make <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> one of the most highly unionized cities in the country at the time. The teachers union
                    recognized the need to engage in coalition-building and politics for their workplace demands, but
                    also connected effectively with middle-class reformers. </p>
                <p>These two unions, Leidenberger argues, brought to the fore an insurgent &quot;metropolitan
                    unionism&quot; in the wake of the city&apos;s 1903 streetcar strike. Coalition building and
                    articulation of the public interest in a safe, worker-controlled workplace helped to bring victory
                    in that strike, which involved a significant amount of support for the strikers from the
                    city&apos;s middle-class residents. Unions came out of the strike with the ability to articulate
                    a &quot;public interest&quot; agenda that centered on municipal ownership and management of
                    the transit system. Mobilizing in the community and through their workplaces (teachers, for example,
                    sent home petitions with school children), workers led the effort that brought reform mayor William
                    Dunne to political leadership in the city.</p>
                <p>Rather than seeing middle-class reformers at the center of the Progressive Era, Leidenberger insists
                    that it was the working class that articulated the need for radical reforms. Middle-class allies
                    were not as yet wedded to the notion of workers as pawns of graft and boss control, but rather
                    viewed them as the potential base for a vibrant democratic agenda. The working- and middle-class
                    coalition offered public control of commodities such as streetcar service as its carefully
                    articulated solution to private greed--notions about functionalist politics and professional
                    efficiency and distance were not as yet operative</p>

                <p>Leidenberger convincingly argues that these more familiar definitions came to define the <placeName>

                    labor power. This pro-business agenda was part of a national effort that sought to stanch the growth
                    of labor power, one city at a time, through community networks. Spatial power, exemplified by the
                    teamsters&apos; control of the distribution network, had led to political power, and employers
                    sought to reverse that advantage by eliminating the sympathy strike. In doing so, they also brought
                    about a public relations campaign more sophisticated than the countersubversive one developed to
                    squelch the eight-hour movement after the Haymarket riot fifteen years earlier. This campaign sought
                    to label labor unions as antithetical to the public interest and began to break down the alliances
                    between labor and middle-class reformers, although the full story of how this happened needs more
                    development than Leidenberg has given it. On the heels of the streetcar strike, the municipal
                    ownership campaign faltered and then failed. &quot;Good government&quot; functionalist views
                    of regulation, led by middle-class reform organizations, ended the public transit campaign and
                    superceded the labor-centered coalition.</p>
                <p>Leidenberg&apos;s book is an important contribution to labor history as well as to the history of
                    twentieth-century reform. His conclusion--that historians&apos; definitions of Progressive Era
                    reform do not consider the rise and defeat of alternative &quot;progressive moments&quot;
                    shaped by labor insurgencies and counterinsurgencies--provokes a host of questions for future
                    researchers.</p>

                <p>There has been a recent flourishing of books on women&apos;s experiences in the U.S. Civil War.
                    Nurses&apos; letters have appeared, the work of female spies has been recounted, and historians
                    have even recovered women&apos;s experiences on the battlefield. As Nina Silber notes in <hi
                        rend="i">Daughters of the Union</hi>, Confederate women&apos;s work has long been more
                    famous than that of their Unionist counterparts, a bias that started during the war itself. But <pb
                        id="VAA4025-103-3-108" n="330"/>Northern women are now getting their due, in books like Jeannie
                    Attie&apos;s <hi rend="i">Patriotic Toil</hi> (1998), Judith Ann Giesberg&apos;s <hi
                        rend="i">Civil War Sisterhood</hi> (2000), and Elizabeth Leonard&apos;s <hi rend="i">Yankee
                        Women</hi> (1994).</p>
                <p>Silber pulls much of this history together in one highly readable volume. Because of its breadth,
                    hers is probably the single best book for anyone seeking to understand Northern women&apos;s war
                    experiences. Silber discusses new forms of female employment, as well as how women managed homes and
                    businesses in men&apos;s absence. She traces women&apos;s tentative entry into electoral
                    politics as well as their volunteer war work, fundraising, and humanitarian aid. A chapter on
                    &quot;Wartime Emancipation&quot; describes some of the ways in which freedom for African
                    American women changed the war effort, especially for women in the antislavery cause.</p>
                <p>Silber also draws on a rich array of primary sources written by ordinary women on the homefront. Many
                    offer poignant commentary on the hardships of war, as well as on women&apos;s interest in
                    national events and fervent hopes for victory. Sources from working-class and African American women
                    are not as well represented as those from more prosperous Northerners, but Silber pays welcome
                    attention to Southern women as they were reincorporated into the Union, and to the economic and
                    racial inequalities that typified both regions. In her chapter on nursing, for example, she notes
                    that most black women working in Union hospitals were classified as &quot;cooks and
                    laundresses&quot; and paid far less than white &quot;nurses,&quot; though both groups
                    did similar work.</p>
                <p>While many authors emphasize the war&apos;s potential to liberate women, Silber is pessimistic.
                    She notes that Northern women were subjected to intense criticism for their supposed lack of
                    patriotic zeal, and she finds a simultaneous public debate over women&apos;s victimization.
                    Sometimes the two intertwined, as when <hi rend="i">Harper&apos;s Weekly</hi> contrasted the
                    impoverished &quot;soldier&apos;s wife&quot; with the &quot;contractor&apos;s
                    wife&quot; who ignored calls for patriotic sacrifice and went shopping with the profits of her
                    husband&apos;s government contracts (p. 73). Silber&apos;s outlook is perhaps overly gloomy,
                    especially in the final chapter, when she offers Mary Surratt--hanged for her role in
                    Lincoln&apos;s assassination--as a key example of how &quot;the federal government had
                    raised the bar in terms of expecting obedience and allegiance from its female citizens&quot; (p.
                    261). But she makes a valid point when she says that women learned that &quot;the war, and their
                    government, demanded their allegiance more than it encouraged their critical interaction&quot;
                    (p. 11).</p>
                <p><hi rend="i">Daughters of the Union</hi> raises important questions about women&apos;s changing
                    relationship to government and citizenship in the nineteenth century. Along the way, the author

                <p>Justin Nordstrom&apos;s analysis of anti-Catholic popular publications during the Progressive Era
                    views this expression of nativism as a part of the rural-urban conflict that punctuated the period.
                    The city, and Catholics who resided there, represented strange peoples and customs, sexual
                    licentiousness, and lack of simplicity. Nativists grafted their movement onto progressivism and,
                    working on the principle of guilt by association, sought to make Catholics scapegoats for modernity.
                    In the South, where Catholics were rare, as they were in most rural areas, such anti-Catholicism was
                    particularly intense.</p>
                <p>Anti-Catholicism was an ultra-nationalist variation on the American propensity to believe in
                    conspiracy theories. Most threatening to this frame of mind was the idea that Catholics vested
                    ultimate authority in a hierarchy whose epicenter lay abroad. American distrust of centralized power
                    in any form, whether governmental or religious, had deep roots in the nation&apos;s history,
                    dating back to the colonial period. Protestants were troubled by the doctrine of papal
                    infallibility, which seemed undemocratic. Yet most charges were not original, nor were they specific
                    to North America or limited to the time. They were as old as the Protestant Reformation--and they
                    remain today, separating Protestantism and Catholicism.</p>
                <p>Believing, or even reading, these extremist periodicals presupposes a degree of gullibility. The
                    writers charged that Catholics wanted to overthrow the government, make America subservient to the
                    Pope, abolish freedom of worship, suppress dissent, and control the world. Priests and nuns had
                    illicit sex, murdered the offspring, and buried them beneath convents. Priests exploited the
                    confessional to manipulate women for sex. The most sensational and titillating publications were
                    stories of the captivity, kidnapping, and sexual abuse of women and children, described in graphic,
                    almost pornographic, detail.</p>
                <pb id="VAA4025-103-3-110" n="332"/>
                <p>The nativists had no plan of action, no solution to the Catholic menace. They viewed the
                    dissemination of information as an end in itself. Although they might have raised the decibel level
                    of hatred, they appealed largely to those who already harbored anti-Catholic beliefs. Nor did their
                    anti-nativist opponents convert many bigots. Each side, in effect, was preaching to the choir.</p>
                <p>Nordstrom&apos;s study provides a window for understanding an important, long-lived
                    spiritual/militaristic metaphor through its manifestation in a specific context. Like most good
                    monographs, it seeks to explore the macrocosm through a microcosm and to provide a building block
                    for further studies. The book is thought-provoking and diligently researched in primary sources.</p>
                <p>Although useful to specialists, the book is narrowly conceived, especially chronologically, a fact
                    that will limit its audience. The text contains little that is original, offering instead a parade
                    of academic experts more appropriate for footnotes. The author&apos;s style is flawed by jargon
                    and overuse of certain words and phrases, the most ubiquitious of which is
                    &quot;trope.&quot;</p>
                <p>Some of Nordstrom&apos;s conclusions are arguable, such as his implication that nativism declined
                    with World War I and the extinction of certain journals. In fact, the anti-Catholic prejudice of the
                    Progressive Era might have changed form, but it actually grew. The influence of the Ku Klux Klan in
                    the 1920s, the attacks on Catholic presidential candidate Al Smith in 1928, and the immigration laws
                    of the 1920s designed to bar Catholics, among others, are cases in point. <hi rend="i">Dangers on

                    Stewart describes the creation of an American cinema through its links to the Great Migration of
                    African Americans from the South during the first twenty years of the last century. This is a
                    brilliant move that sheds fresh light on two familiar stories. Through extensive,<pb
                        id="VAA4025-103-3-111" n="333"/>finely detailed research and well-judged interpretation, Stewart
                    recovers what was at stake in the production of images and narratives that sought to describe the
                    &quot;reality&quot; of black people in the raw, new medium of silent-era film. Well versed
                    in the tradition of black film scholarship that charts Hollywood&apos;s development of racialist
                    images, Stewart seeks to move beyond it through postcolonial and feminist theoretical models. From
                    this grounding she develops a way of seeing &quot;preclassical film&quot; that establishes
                    the active part played by African Americans in America&apos;s early film culture.</p>
                <p>An impressive aspect of Stewart&apos;s work is her skillful use of extant film, old newspapers,
                    correspondence, and other archival sources, including those held at Indiana University&apos;s
                    Black Film Center/Archive. This research allows her to recover the complex social life of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago&apos;s</settlement>
                    </placeName> Black Belt as it responded to a white-dominated cinema, helped to create the spaces of
                    a modern urbanism, and produced the &quot;race film.&quot; This study revises the
                    presupposition, fostered in the pioneering work of Thomas Cripps and Daniel J. Leab, that silent-era
                    cinema related to the black community only as an instrument of racist stereotyping.</p>
                <p>Stewart opens her study with a consideration of &quot;preclassical&quot; film&apos;s
                    strategies for addressing the representational challenge posed by the New Negro. She argues that
                    while whites experimented with the motion picture as a new way of policing blackness, it proved an
                    unwieldy instrument, producing images that resisted cooptation into received racial categories. Her
                    interpretation of films in the sub-genre she calls the &quot;misdirected kiss&quot;
                    admirably supports this point. In Stewart&apos;s handling, silent-era film is also a record of
                    African Americans moving into a public sphere of new physical and emotional freedom.</p>
                <p>The creation of a vibrant film culture in early twentieth-century black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> is the core of her project. Stewart&apos;s presentation of the social collision
                    between the uplift projects of its old settler elite and the emerging power of Southern migrants
                    through their engagement with the new mass medium makes for compelling reading. Class-inflected
                    debates over the propriety of certain leisure activities, the place of women in public spaces marked
                    by race and vice, and the vexed issue of patriotism in the fight for democracy at home and abroad
                    play significant roles in defining what film meant and how it was used by black audiences and
                    filmmakers. Stewart highlights the complex social impulses that drove black critical response to
                    film as a popular amusement and as a medium for conveying certain social truths.</p>
                <p>In her closing chapters, Stewart turns our attention to those African Americans who played active
                    roles, as actors, directors, managers, critics, and theater owners, in creating Amer-<pb
                        id="VAA4025-103-3-112" n="334"/>ican cinema. Oscar Micheaux, the most famous filmmaker of the
                    race film era, is her primary subject here. The isolated figure of previous studies develops as part
                    of the social and institutional networks that made him an influential and productive artist. In her
                    detailed and sensitive reading of Micheaux&apos;s 1920 film, <hi rend="i">Within Our Gates</hi>,
                    she argues that Micheaux took the narrative invention of D. W. Griffith&apos;s <hi rend="i"
                        >Birth of a Nation</hi> (1915) and applied it to African American rhetoric of racial uplift. In
                    so doing, he indicated &quot;the unreliability of cinematic representation of Blackness in
                    general&quot; (p. 237). This insight is by itself worth the price of admission.</p>

                    </placeName>. Singh&apos;s subtitle, &quot;Race and the Unfinished Struggle for
                    Democracy,&quot; suggests that black African descendants continue to be traumatized by a type of
                    neo-liberalism that critiques white supremacy and racial capitalism, but does not include blacks as
                    complete partakers of the democratic ideal. Within this context, Singh writes convincingly that
                    global democracy remains an unfinished project because its ideals are linked to superficial notions
                    of universalism, paternalism, and American exceptionalism, all of which prevent blacks from engaging
                    in processes and positions that would help to dismantle global racism and foster transnationalist
                    poitics that might make democracy a universal reality. Connected to this global perspective is a
                    black reality that recognizes freedom as an ideological construction, dictated by race and the
                    ideals of white supremacy, that sees democracy as a praxis that involves protest and
                    blacks&apos; right to act as their own agents of change.</p>
                <p>Through an examination of various social and political movements in twentieth-century American

                    </placeName> mythologized position as the great preserver and practitioner of democracy in the
                    world. Using frameworks that examine such forms of activism as self-autonomy, dissent, a black
                    critique of the dialectic of race and nation, the establishment by blacks of a counter-public space
                    that deconstructs liberalism, and the practice of a black self-determinism that challenges the
                    erasure of racism from the American fabric, Singh shows that this country has not been a nation into
                    which black people could successfully integrate, &quot;but an empire they needed to oppose--not
                    a beloved community of shared traditions and aspirations, but a coercive state to be
                    overthrown&quot; (p. 197). Indeed, for the majority of people of African descent, black is a
                    country and &quot;blackness&quot; has been a terrain, a space that seemingly necessitates
                    automatic occupation and domination, forcing black people to endure an experience that has led many,
                    like Langston Hughes, to continue to proclaim that, &quot;America never was America to
                    me.&quot;</p>
                <p>This volume possesses much strength. But it places the struggle for global democracy too much between
                    the black and white binary. This is an approach that W. E. B. DuBois and Martin Luther King, Jr.,
                    would have critiqued as unacceptable, since other oppressed voices are needed to move the <placeName>

                    should have defined more clearly such phrases as &quot;nation-state&quot; and such concepts
                    as &quot;rethinking&quot; race and nation; &quot;reconstructing&quot; democracy;
                    &quot;internationalizing&quot; freedom; &quot;Americanizing&quot; the Negro; and
                    &quot;decolonizing&quot; America, so that the very people about whom he is writing can
                    assess these ideas and understand them in such a way that they feel compelled to engage in the
                    universal struggle to end oppression.</p>

                <p>Many decry urban sprawl, while a much smaller number of equally vocal advocates argue that sprawl is
                    not really a problem at all. Robert Bruegmann contributes to this debate by looking at sprawl in an
                    historical context. The book addresses the issue from three perspectives, considering the patterns
                    of urban development that constitute sprawl, the development of anti-sprawl movements, and attempts
                    to deal with sprawl.</p>
                <p>Bruegmann makes a convincing argument that sprawl has been a persistent feature of urban development
                    throughout history. Defining sprawl as unplanned, low-density, scattered urban development, he
                    describes sprawl in times and places ranging from ancient Rome and seventeenth-century London to the
                    present. While many consider sprawl as a new problem arising in recent decades in the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, he describes its occurrence early in the last century, explaining that it probably
                    reached its peak (in terms of the low density of development) in the period from 1930 through 1970.</p>
                <p>The book goes on to describe three anti-sprawl campaigns--in <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7002445" reg="England">England</country>
                    </placeName> in the 1930s, in the post-war <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and in recent decades, extending from the <placeName>
                        <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to much of the rest of the world. Bruegmann argues that the leaders of each movement
                    were elitists intent on furthering their own interests, and that their arguments about the problems
                    created by sprawl were often ill-supported by evidence. His final section, describing attempts to
                    deal with sprawl, focuses on the limitations and unintended consequences of such efforts.</p>
                <p>This book presents a great deal of very good information enhanced by Bruegmann&apos;s historical
                    perspective. I wish that I could recommend it to my friends who are ardent but uncritical opponents
                    of sprawl--they would benefit from having solid information about alternative views. Unfortunately,
                    Bruegmann&apos;s choice in taking an advocacy position against those who oppose sprawl will make
                    it easy for them to dismiss this book (as has already happened in a flurry of negative reviews).</p>
                <p>Bruegmann is honest and straightforward about his position. Since the vast majority of the work
                    dealing with sprawl stresses its negative aspects, he says he is seeking to redress the balance of
                    opinion. But doing so leads him at times to make arguments that are less effective and convincing
                    than they might have been, had he taken a more balanced approach. His broad definition of the
                    phenomenon leads him to classify virtually all urban growth and develop-<pb id="VAA4025-103-3-115"
                        n="337"/>ment as sprawl, but he then fails to identify quantitative or qualitative differences
                    in patterns of development that would acknowledge the considerable differences between sprawl in
                    late twentieth-century Atlanta and seventeenth-century London. The discussion of the anti-sprawl
                    campaigns includes lists of the problems attributed to sprawl alongside evidence of why these may
                    not really be problems. Bruegmann does seem to realize that he may be overdoing it, at one point
                    admitting that he &quot;is not trying to suggest that all of the charges against sprawl are
                    false&quot; (p. 138). But that is what his subsequent arguments appear intended to do. The
                    author&apos;s argumentative tone is very unfortunate. Amidst a highly polemical body of
                    literature, Bruegmann&apos;s book provides a valuable historical perspective on the problem of
                    sprawl based on good research and scholarship. But by adopting the position of an advocate against
                    those opposed to sprawl, his work can be too easily dismissed as yet another polemic.</p>

                <p>Corless &quot;Corky&quot; Evans became interested in the history of the Evansville State
                    Hospital when she became an employee in 1996. In 1999 she discovered that one of her ancestors had
                    lived in the hospital from approximately 1900 to 1913, and she set out to prepare a history of the
                    institution, known formerly as the Southern Indiana Hospital for the Insane and also as Woodmere.
                    Because the hospital&apos;s business records were burned, Evans turned to local history sources,
                    particularly newspapers. These volumes present full typescripts of articles, correspondence, and
                    census data relevant to the hospital for the years 1899 through 1903. Headlines report expenditures
                    and building plans, court decisions for individual insanity cases, and the deaths and escapes of
                    patients.</p>

                    these exterior images with an interior landscape of memory and emotion. This process--which Jones

                <p>Historians of the Civil War will no longer be able to complain about a dearth of sources on German
                    immigrant soldiers and their families. This volume contains selections from 343 letters written by
                    78 immigrants, out of a much larger set of 956 Civil-War period letters by 258 authors, all part of

                <p>Begun by Van Tassel as a monograph to accompany a Civil War exhibit at the Western Reserve Historical

                <p>This book is a facsimile of a 1902 work, compiled by former Civil War private and later newspaper
                    publisher Henry Harden. Harden solicited and then published the diaries, letters, poems, stories,
                    and photographs of veterans of his own 90th Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Although a reprint of such
                    a volume is always praise-worthy, it is unfortunate that the modern &quot;editing&quot;
                    consists of one two-page introduction. Given the lack of structure in the book, an index would have
                    been of immense value.</p>

                <p>This pictorial survey of urban train station design covers a one-hundred-year period (from roughly

                    famous stations through color photographs of their basic physical structure and artistic details.
                    Although created as a coffee-table book, <hi rend="i">Still Standing</hi> transcends simple visual
                    depiction of these stations, with brief discussions of their design in the context of the growth and

                <p>Kent State University Press&apos;s Writing Sports series publishes reprints of classic sports
                    books (with an emphasis on baseball because of its historical standing as the national pastime). <hi
                        rend="i">The Cleveland Indians</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Cincinnati Reds</hi> are the first two
                    books in the series, originally published in the late 1940s, but updated here with new introductory
                    biographical material on authors Franklin Lewis and Lee Allen.</p>
                <p>Lewis&apos;s history of the Indians covers the organization&apos;s development in the late
                    nineteenth century, its 1920 World Series victory, and concludes with its 1948 pennant race.
                    Allen&apos;s look at the Reds covers a similar timeframe: the team&apos;s organization
                    shortly after the Civil War, its 1919 National League pennant, and its 1940 World Series
                    championship. Both books are absorbing in their telling of many of the lesser-known or forgotten
                    stories of baseball personalities and events, and they are important contributions to a discussion
                    of the role of sports in defining culture and society.</p>
