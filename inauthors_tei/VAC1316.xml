				<head rend="center">PREFACE</head>
				<p>"K<hi rend="sc">NOWLEDGE</hi> and learning generally diffused throughout a community
					being <hi rend="i">essential to the preservation of a free government</hi>, it shall be
					the duty of the General Assembly .... to provide .... a general and uniform system of
					common schools." This quotation is introduced here to show that the makers of the
					Constitution of the State appreciated the truth that the first purpose of public education
					is the preparation of the youth for the duties and responsibilities of intelligent
					citizenship. They offered no other reason for the provision for schools. Is it not
					reasonable to suppose that a very important part of this "knowledge and learning" is a
					thorough understanding of the governments&mdash;both National and local&mdash;under which
					we live? It has seemed to the author that in the study of this subject the emphasis has
					been put too constantly upon the National Government and too little attention has been
					given to the institutions of the State and to local administration. The well-being,
					security and comfort of the citizen depend more intimately upon the management of local
					and State affairs than upon the administration of the General Government. It is in the
					hope that it may be helpful to a realization of the importance of the State and local
					governments and to a clearer conception of the obligations which grow out of the civic
					relation, that this book has been prepared.</p>
				<p>It makes no pretension to be an abridgment of the statutes of Indiana nor a text-book on
					the history of the State. It is an attempt to give a concise outline of the governmental
					machinery and the forces by which it is operated. To convey a better idea of the origin
					and <pb id="VAC1316-004" n="iv"/> growth of our institutions, an historical sketch of
					Indiana precedes the discussion proper. It has not been possible within the scope of the
					book to include all the details and variations of local government. Peculiarities in the
					government of township, town or city should be noted and the attention of pupils called to
					them. Concrete illustrations serve to simplify the complexities of government. The
					Constitution is appended in the hope that it will be the object of careful study: with
					this idea in mind many of its provisions have not been incorporated into the text. A copy
					of some of the recent editions of the Revised Statutes should be in the possession of each
					school. When reference has been made to the Revised Statutes it is to Horner's Revision of
					1896. A scrap-book in which may be preserved clippings giving the proceedings of primaries
					and conventions, sample ballots, official blanks, and accounts of historical events will
					be helpful in arousing the interest of pupils.</p>
				<p>It is desired to acknowledge the obligations due to many friends for favors, and
					especially to Mr. John W. Cravens, editor of the Bloomington <hi rend="i">World</hi>, for
					criticising the manuscript and offering timely suggestions as to the management of local
					affairs.</p>
				<p>Criticisms and suggestions that will help to make the book more serviceable will be
					heartily welcomed.</p>

				<div2 type="section">
					<head rend="center">INTRODUCTION.</head>
					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="b">1. The State.</head>
						<p>"As applied to an American Commonwealth the word State signifies a political
							community of free citizens, occupying a territory of defined boundaries, organized
							under a government sanctioned and limited by a written constitution, and established
							by the consent of the people. Each State or Commonwealth maintains a <pb
								id="VAC1316-008" n="8"/> republican form of government, which is guaranteed by the
							United States."</p>
						<p>Hence, when we speak of the State of Indiana, we may mean one of four things: (1)
							That portion of the earth's surface contained within defined boundaries; (2) the
							people living within that territory bound together by a common interest and organized
							for their protection and common welfare; (3) the body of rules or laws which regulate
							the people in their relations one with another and which restrain their officers; (4)
							the government, that is, the persons selected to make the laws and to enforce them. In
							its fullest sense, the State signifies all of these things; the land, the people, the
							laws and the government.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="b">2. The Land.</head>
						<p>In these days, a community of people in order to constitute a State must have a
							permanent abode&mdash;a definite territory, within which, it and it alone,<ref
								target="note_001" rend="super" id="ref_001">1</ref> exercises authority, and beyond
							which its laws are of no effect.</p>
						<p>The character, extent, situation, and development of the land determine the
							occupation of its citizens. And these occupations in turn determine, largely, the
							necessity for laws, the nature of these laws, and the number and duties of officers.
							Since the discovery of natural gas in Indiana there has been enacted a body of laws
							regulating its use and distribution. Similar laws are found in few other States. On
							the other hand, we have no need of laws which are necessary to the peculiar conditions
							found in the vast State of Texas, the manufacturing States of the East or the
							sea-coast States of California and Louisiana.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="b">3. The People.</head>
						<p>The habits, beliefs and political ideas of the people, adapted so as to fit the
							physical conditions of a new country, will mould the constitution, laws and
							institutions. Indiana's system of government, more than <note id="note_001"><ref
									target="ref_001" rend="super">1</ref> For some purposes the National Government
								has authority within a State, which is superior to any power which that State may
								possess. (See T<hi rend="sc">HORPE'S</hi>
								<hi rend="i">Government of the United States</hi>, page 91.)</note>
							<pb id="VAC1316-009" n="9"/> that of any other State north of the Ohio River,
							resembles the systems of the southern States. This is because the early settlement of
							the State was chiefly by people from the South. Michigan, in its political
							institutions, resembles the New England States for a similar reason. Then, too, the
							spirit and temper of the laws may change as the ideas of the people enlarge, as the
							sentiment changes, as industries develop, as immigration modifies the character of the
							people of the State. Thus the thoughts, feelings and conceptions of the people are
							reflected in their constitution and laws.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="b">4. The Laws.</head>
						<p>There are two kinds of law-making: the one, by the people directly; the other, by
							persons chosen to represent the people and to act for them. In the first place a set
							of men, selected by the people, meets in a convention and prepares a system of laws
							and maxims in the form of a written document. This document is submitted to the people
							for their approval or disapproval. If it be ratified by a majority of the legal
							voters, it is thereby enacted into law. It is then the Constitution, the fundamental
							law of the State. It describes the framework of the government, defines the powers and
							duties of the officers and declares the rights of the people. It can be changed only
							by the act of the people, in the manner provided in the Constitution itself. No
							officer or set of officers can change it and all acts or orders contrary to it are
							absolutely void.</p>
						<p>But direct legislation by the people on all matters would be clearly impossible. This
							difficulty is avoided by provisions in the Constitution, giving authority to the
							representatives of the people to enact laws, subject, however, to certain limitations
							therein prescribed. These laws are called statutes. The statutes must always be in
							conformity with the Constitution. The representatives may change statutes, but they
							cannot change the Constitution. Whether the laws are made directly or indirectly, the
							people are <pb id="VAC1316-010" n="10"/> responsible for the good or evil flowing from
							them and for their enforcement.</p>
						<p>The Constitution and statutes of Indiana must not conflict with the Constitution,
							treaties and laws of the United States. If there is a conflict the former must give
							way before the higher authority of the United States.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="b">5. The Government.</head>
						<p>The government is the instrument by which the State expresses and enforces its will.
							The people by means of the ballot select the men who are to represent them in the
							making of laws, those who are to interpret the laws and those who are to carry the
							laws into execution. This body of officials constitutes the Government. As private
							citizens these men may not be superior, in fact, may even be inferior, to the average
							citizen; but in their official capacity they stand in the place of the State and
							should command the respect and obedience which all citizens owe to the State. Officers
							must be made to suffer for conduct which dishonors the dignity or majesty of the
							State. Hence, provision is always made that they may be removed from office or
							otherwise punished for official misconduct.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="b">6. Importance of State and Local Governments.</head>
						<p>It is true that some of the national questions are vital and momentous, fraught with
							the greatest consequences to the welfare of the individual and of the Nation. But
							where there is one such national question, there are twenty within the scope of State
							authority; questions, too, that touch our life and happiness to the very quick. We are
							dependent upon the State for our civil and religious rights; for the right of
							suffrage; for the means of education; for the rules of marriage and the definition of
							the legal relations of husband and wife, and of parent and child; for laws regulating
							contracts, agency, partnership, debts, insurance, almost all corporations, the
							ownership and distribution of property and the exercise of trades; and for the
							definition of crimes and the punishment thereof (except <pb id="VAC1316-011" n="11"/>
							crimes against the laws of the United States and those committed on the high seas, or
							against the law of nations). "To enumerate the particulars of this vast range of
							powers, to detail its parts, would be to catalogue all social and business
							relationships, to examine all the foundations of law and order."</p>
						<p>Efficiency and honesty in the local government, in the school district, the township,
							the county, and the city contribute more than the National Government, to the
							well-being and happiness of the home, the family and the daily life of the citizen.
							When it is realized that, in Indiana, the expenditure in county governments exceeds
							$8,000,000 annually and that the indebtedness of towns, cities and counties aggregates
							more than $14,000,000,<ref target="note_002" rend="super" id="ref_002">1</ref> the
							importance of good local government can be appreciated. Governor Wright continually
							urged upon the people that it was more important to select good county commissioners
							than good Congressmen. Moreover it is only through an active participation in local
							government that a citizen is prepared to discharge intelligently his duties in the
							government of the Nation, which seems more picturesque and momentous.</p>

							<head rend="b">7. The First Explorers.</head>
							<p>Before 1670, the French had passed up the Great Lakes and had established on their
								shores trading posts and missions. It is possible, though the evidence is slight,
								that the Maumee had been explored as early as 1656. It is pretty definitely
								established that during the winter of 1669-70, La Salle passed down the Ohio River
								as far as Louisville. Joliet and Marquette explored the Mississippi River in 1673.
								And it was in an effort to again reach that river that Indiana soil was traversed by
								La Salle in 1679. In that year, he with a few followers established Fort Miamis on
								the St. Joseph of Lake Michigan and in December pushed up the river to the place now
								occupied by South Bend, crossed by a <pb id="VAC1316-013" n="13"/> portage of four
								or five miles to the headwaters of the Kankakee, and proceeded down the Illinois.
								During the next few years he crossed and recrossed Indiana soil in his perilous
								journeys to and from Canada and in his visits to the various Indian tribes.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="part">
							<head rend="b">8. Early Settlements.</head>
							<p>In 1695, a French settlement was made at Kaskaskia, one at Cahokia in 1700, and
								another at Detroit in 1701. Juchereau, an officer from Montreal, established a fort
								on the Ohio&mdash;erroneously called the Ouabache<ref target="note_003" rend="super"
									id="ref_003">1</ref>&mdash;near the site of Cairo, in 1702; but it was abandoned
								within three years. In 1712, Louis XIV. granted to Antoine Crozat, a wealthy officer
								in his service, the commerce of the Mississippi Valley from the Gulf to the Illinois
								River, together with the Missouri and Ouabache. For its government, Louisiana was
								dependent upon the province of New France. In 1717, Bienville was appointed governor

								capital was at Mobile.</p>
							<p>In 1723, the Territory of Louisiana was made dependent directly upon the home
								government, with the capital at New Orleans. Although Indiana was subordinate to the
								Louisiana Province, the French officials at Detroit claimed and actually exercised
								jurisdiction over the Indian tribes living on the upper Wabash.</p>
							<p>Early in the eighteenth century the French determined to establish posts at
								advantageous points. François Morgan, Sieur de Vincennes, was sent by the governor
								of Canada to establish a post near the village of the Ouiatanon tribe of the Miamis.
								This was about 1720 and may be regarded as the earliest post within Indiana. It was
								on the north side of the Wabash, about four miles below the present city of
								Lafayette. Vincennes, a few <note id="note_003"><ref rend="super" target="ref_003"

								no further settlements were made in Indiana for many years.</p>
							<p>For administrative purposes, Indiana was divided somewhat indefinitely between the
								provinces of Louisiana and Canada: Vincennes was in the Illinois district of
								Louisiana, and was governed from New Orleans through Fort Chartres, Illinois;
								Ouiatanon and Fort Miamis were governed from Quebec through Detroit. This line of
								separation was later fixed in the vicinity of Terre Haute.</p>

							<head rend="b">9. The Character of the French Settlers.</head>
							<p>There was a marked difference between the character of the French colonists of the
								Mississippi Valley and that of the English on the Atlantic coast. The latter settled
								in permanent families, cultivated the soil, engaged in trade and industries in fixed
								communities. The Englishman was jealous of his political rights and insisted upon a
								large degree of self-government. The French pioneers were chiefly of three classes:
								the Catholic missionaries, the soldiers and the fur-traders. Their life did not
								permit of permanent homes. Even when an effort was made to till the soil, it was
								done in a rude way. The Frenchman, too, was indifferent as to his political rights,
								submitting to most arbitrary rules and exactions. But the French, in their treatment
								of the Indians, excelled the English in sagacity. The courage, devotion, and
								self-sacrifice of the missionaries have scarcely been equalled in history. They
								united many tribes in friendship to the French. The wily fur-traders and the
								soldiers also were skilful in the arts of conciliation. The <note id="note_004"><ref
										target="ref_004" rend="super">1</ref> Just when the post at Vincennes was
									established is a matter of controversy. The years 1680, 1702, 1716, 1727, and
									1735, have been given by different historians as the proper date of its
									establishment, but that of 1727 seems to be supported by the most reliable

								<hi rend="i">voyageurs</hi> were, peculiarly, a product of the conditions and
								circumstances of the new world.</p>
							<p>The English bluntness and arrogance constantly irritated the Indians. But the
								practical Briton was gradually drawing to himself their traffic by offering better
								bargains. The English never assumed to occupy or dispose of their lands without
								having first purchased them of the natives. On the other hand, the French and the
								Spanish claimed not only the sovereignty over the land, but also absolute ownership
								of the soil.<ref target="note_005" rend="super" id="ref_005">1</ref></p>

							<head rend="b">10. Rival Claimants for the Mississippi Valley.</head>
							<p>The inevitable contest for possession of the Mississippi Valley culminated in the
								French and Indian War.</p>
							<p>The English based their claims upon four things: 1. The voyages of the Cabots
								(1497, 1498), whose patents reserved to the Crown dominion over such lands as they
								discovered; 2. Royal charters from 1609 to 1665, which granted territory extending
								from ocean to ocean; 3. Treaties with the Iroquois and the Miamis; 4. The
								explorations of British traders in the valleys of the Ohio, Tennessee, and
								Cumberland Rivers.</p>
							<p>The French rested their title upon the following grounds: 1. Verrazano's voyage
								(1524) along the coast from the mouth of the Savannah to Newfoundland; 2. The
								discovery and exploration of the St. Lawrence River by Cartier (1534, 1535-1540); 3.
								The discovery and exploration of the Ohio River by La Salle; 4. The exploration of
								the Mississippi River by Joliet and Marquette in 1673, Hennepin in 1680, and La
								Salle in 1682, and the early occupation by actual settlement along its banks and

							<head rend="b">11. Results of the French and Indian War.</head>
							<p>In 1759, Quebec, the bulwark of the province of Canada, fell; in the following year
								Montreal capitulated, and the French governor, Marquis de Vaudreuil, surrendered all
								Canada to the English. In this same year, Detroit surrendered without resistance,
								and in the spring of 1761, Ouiatanon was occupied. Vincennes was not taken at this
								time, being a part of the Louisiana province and "not included in the capitulation"
								of Quebec. But by the Treaty of Paris (1763), France surrendered to England all her
								vast possessions east of the Mississippi River except a small area in Louisiana.</p>
							<p>Undoubtedly, the claims of France were the more substantial, and it is equally
								beyond doubt that the world has gained immeasurably by the transference of this
								immense area from a nation having Gallic customs and polity to one having English
								laws, traditions and institutions. Mr. Fiske has said, "The triumph of Wolfe marks

							<head rend="b">12. The Last Posts Surrendered.</head>
							<p>Though the formal conveyance of this territory occurred on February 10, 1763,
								actual occupation was delayed several years because of the enmity of the Indians.
								The natives believed the English would dispossess them of their lands. Under the
								masterly and efficient leadership of Pontiac was formed a conspiracy to make a final
								effort to drive out the English. The plot was well-nigh successful. Detroit barely
								escaped capture and was the only fort held by the English west of Pittsburg. No
								attempt to seize Vincennes was made, as the French still had possession here. The
								vigorous policy of the English, the refusal of the French generals <pb
									id="VAC1316-017" n="17"/> and French governor of Louisiana to lend him aid, and
								the desertion of some of his allies, convinced the great chieftain of the folly of
								continuing the struggle. At Ouiatanon, in the spring of 1765, Pontiac declared his
								willingness to make peace. This declaration was carried out, with the usual
								ceremonies, at Detroit soon after.</p>
							<p>On the tenth day of October, 1765, Captain Sterling formally took possession of
								Fort Chartres in the name of the English. This was the most important post west of
								Detroit. But it was not till May 19, 1777, that an officer, bearing a royal
								commission to take possession, appeared at Vincennes.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="part">
							<head rend="b">13. Proclamations of British Officers.</head>
							<p>(I.) Upon the occupation of Fort Chartres, Captain Sterling issued the proclamation
								of General Gage, the Commander-in-Chief of British forces in America. It was very
								liberal in its tone. It granted to the French inhabitants "the liberty of the
								Catholic religion," and the choice of selling their estates and retiring, or of
								remaining and enjoying the same rights, privileges and security as other subjects.
								They were only required to take the oath of fidelity and allegiance.</p>
							<p>(II.) The happy carelessness of the French on the Wabash was interrupted in 1772 by
								the announcement of a later proclamation by General Gage. He ordered all settlers
								along the river to quit that country instantly and retire to other colonies. The
								leading citizens protested against these arbitrary commands and the British ministry
								disavowed the policy of Gage. The motive of such an unjust order is to be found in
								an examination of the land policy of Great Britain after 1763.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="part">
							<head rend="b">14. The Western Land Policy of Great Britain.</head>
							<p>Before the French title to the Northwest Territory was extinguished, the British
								government had insisted that the Sea was the western limit of the colonies, and had
								encouraged settlements west of the mountains. But when English <pb id="VAC1316-018"
									n="18"/> possession was assured by treaty, her policy changed. It is evident from
								reports of the period that Great Britain was jealous of the strength and progress of
								her colonies. To be debarred from this broad rich territory, to see it remain a
								wilderness, was extremely mortifying to the colonists who had spent blood and money
								in its conquest. In spite of royal proclamations, official threats, and military
								expulsions, hardy pioneers penetrated the new territory.<ref target="note_006"

							<p>The narrow designs of the home government culminated in the Quebec Act of 1774. By
								this act, Parliament extended the limits of Quebec to the Ohio and Mississippi
								Rivers on the south and west, restored French law and institutions, abolished trial
								by jury in civil cases, guaranteed the Catholic clergy their extensive property
								rights, and assured the people the free exercise of their religion. The object of

							<head rend="b">15. Virginia's Conquest of the Northwest.</head>
							<p>The French settlers in the northwest were not reconciled to the English occupation,
								in spite of the conciliatory Quebec Act. The inherited enmity of five centuries
								could not readily be transformed into loyal attachment. But the friendship of the
								Indians was transferred from the French to the English. In the first year of the
								Revolution, Indian bands were supplied with arms and incited to fall upon the
								unprotected settlements west of the Alleghanies. Oftentimes the pioneers were
								themselves culpable for offering provocation to the Indians.</p>
							<p>Colonel George Rogers Clark proposed to Patrick Henry, governor of Virginia, to
								strike at the heart of the Indian difficulties by capturing the English forts. The
								Governor <note id="note_006"><ref target="ref_006" rend="super">1</ref> "It has been
									estimated that from 1765 to 1768, some 30,000 whites settled beyond the
									mountains."</note>
								<pb id="VAC1316-019" n="19"/> and Council approved the plan, for they saw, also,
								that success would give them a diplomatic advantage in the peace negotiations. With
								difficulty, Clark raised a small force of men, surprised the garrison at Kaskaskia,
								and possessed the place without opposition (July 5, 1778). He soon despatched a
								delegation of French to Vincennes. Lieutenant-Governor Abbot and the garrison were
								absent at Detroit. When matters had been explained to the French settlers there,
								they at once took the oath of allegiance, garrisoned the town, and hoisted the
								American flag. But the British recaptured Vincennes, December 15, 1778. The intrepid
								Clark was not dismayed by this threatened destruction, though cut off from aid, with
								short supplies and with but a small force of one hundred and seventy men. With
								unfailing spirits and incomparable courage, his men undertook in the midst of
								winter, a march of one hundred and sixty miles across inundated plains and swampy
								prairies. At last they arrived before Vincennes. The tact and boldness of Clark did
								not fail him here, and on February 25, 1779, Governor Hamilton surrendered. No other
								single exploit in Northwestern history is comparable with this in daring, in perils
								overcome, in hardships endured, and in momentous consequences. For when the battles
								of the Revolution had been fought and when our commissioners were engaged in the
								diplomatic contest, the strongest argument they could make for the Northwest
								Territory was that of conquest and actual possession. The great debt the United
								States owes to Clark's energy, courage, and strategy has been tardily recognized by
								the American people.</p>

							<p>The whole Western land question was one of extreme difficulty and required great

								Articles of Confederation on the ground that the United States should assume
								jurisdiction over the western lands without regard to the conflicting claims, and
								lay it out preparatory to forming new States. This delay was preventing the plan of
								government from going into operation, obstructing the financial policy, and
								encouraging the enemies of the United States in their hope of internal quarrels and
								disruption.</p>
							<p>New York was the first claimant State to comprehend the significance of the trend
								of things, and exercised a most laudable generosity. On March 1, 1781, a deed was
								given to the United States to all her western claims. This same day Maryland

							<p>(a) <hi rend="i">The Form of Government Established</hi>.&mdash;(I.) In the <hi
									rend="i">first stage</hi>, the management was almost absolutely in the hands of
								the governor and judges, who were appointed by Congress for three years. They had
								power to adopt and publish in the district such civil and criminal laws of the
								original States as seemed best adapted to the circumstances, which laws were to be
								in force unless disapproved by Congress. The governor was commander-in-chief of the
								militia, and was empowered to appoint, in each county or township, magistrates and
								other civil officers necessary to preserve peace and order.</p>
							<p>(II.) In the <hi rend="i">second stage</hi>, the people exercised more power. Upon
								attaining the number of five thousand males, a territorial government might be
								organized. It was to consist of a governor, a legislative council and a house of
								representatives. Authority to make all laws was to be vested in the house, council,
								and governor, who had an absolute veto. The governor, also, had arbitrary power over
								the sessions of the General Assembly, having the right to convene, prorogue and
								dissolve it. The council and house, in joint session, had the authority to elect a
								delegate to Congress, with the right to participate in the debate but not to vote.
								After repeated requests, the suffrage was extended and the congressional delegate
								was elected by a popular vote.</p>
							<p>(b) "<hi rend="i">The Compact</hi>."&mdash;But the part of the Ordinance which has
								given it an immortal fame and a rank among the fundamental documents of our country
								is that designated as the "articles of compact between the original States and the
								people and States in the said territory," which was to "forever remain unalterable
								unless by common consent." It guaranteed freedom of "worship and of religious
								sentiments," the right of trial by jury, "benefit of the writ of <hi rend="i">habeas
									corpus</hi>," representative legislation, <pb id="VAC1316-023" n="23"/> benefit of
								common law in judicial proceedings and it avowed the sanctity of contracts.
								"Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the
								happiness of mankind," schools and the means of education were to be forever
								encouraged. This was the beginning of that liberal educational policy which has in a
								large degree contributed to the intelligence, morality and prosperity of the
								Northwest. The relation of the Territory and new States to the National Government
								and to the other States and citizens thereof, is defined. The number of new States
								to be formed, with their boundaries and conditions of admission among the States,
								was prescribed. But most important of all was the last article, which declared:
								"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory,
								otherwise than in the punishment of crime whereof the party shall have been duly
								convicted." All statesmen and students of American political history have concurred
								in assigning this clause as the dominant influence during the formative period,
								which secured freedom in the Northwest Territory, and determined the result of the
								Civil War. Mr. Webster has said of it: "I doubt whether one single law of any
								law-giver, ancient or modern, has produced effects of more distinct, marked, and

							<head rend="b">25. The Battle of Tippecanoe.</head>
							<p>The continued sale of lands by the Indians alarmed some of the more aggressive
								chiefs. Under the leadership of Tecumseh and his brother the Prophet, two Shawanee
								warriors, a confederacy was organized among certain tribes to resist further sales,
								to punish chiefs conveying lands, and to prevent the survey and settlement of lands
								already ceded. Tecumseh's theory was, that no tribe had the right to dispose of its
								lands without the consent of the other tribes. The hostile design of the
								confederates was anticipated by Governor Harrison, who marched into the Indian
								country with a strong force. His purpose was to induce the tribes to return to their
								own lands and villages. But before a conference could be held, Harrison was attacked
								about daybreak on November 7, 1811, while encamped near the Tippecanoe River. The
								soldiers and militia, who had slept on their arms, endured the terrific assault
								bravely and the Indians were compelled to retire. The confederacy was broken up and
								the Prophet's town destroyed. By the Treaty of Greenville, July 22, 1814, peace and
								friendship were again established.</p>

							<head rend="b">26. A Change of Governors.</head>
							<p>On September 24, 1812, Governor Harrison received news of his appointment to the
								command of the Army of the Northwest, with the rank of Brigadier-General. From that
								time the Secretary of the Territory, John Gibson, was acting-governor until the
								arrival of Governor Posey (May 25, 1813). The influence of Governor Harrison, with
								the exception of his advocacy of slavery, was for the advancement of the Territory.
								His management of Indian affairs was just and humane. Again and again he recommended
								to the legislature liberal provisions for education&mdash;from the common school to
								the university. In 1806, Vincennes University was incorporated, and he was one of
								the trustees and served till his withdrawal from the Territory.</p>
							<p>The legislature of 1813 had ordered the capital of the <pb id="VAC1316-029" n="29"
								/> Territory to be located at Corydon "from and after the first day of May, 1813."
								At the first session held there in December, 1813, the two houses addressed replies
								to the governor's message. A law prohibiting dueling was passed at this session.</p>
							<p>In 1814, the legislature granted charters to the first banks&mdash;The Farmers' and
								Mechanics' Bank at Madison and the Bank of Vincennes. The latter, in 1817, became
								the State Bank of Indiana and adopted the former as a branch. In 1821 the State Bank
								was closed by order of the court.</p>

							<head rend="b">27. The First Constitutional Convention.</head>
							<p>In 1816, Congress passed an enabling act authorizing an election of delegates who
								were to determine whether or not a State government should be formed. If statehood
								were desired, they had the power to proceed at once to the formation of a
								Constitution or to order an election of delegates who should perform that duty. The
								convention met on June 10. Of the forty-three members, but few later attained any
								pre-eminence in politics or the professions. The majority of them were plain,
								common-sense pioneers who had a strong belief in the rights of men and a clear
								perception of justice. The convention completed its work June 29 and adjourned the
								same day.</p>

						<div4 type="part">
							<head rend="b">28. The Constitution.</head>
							<p>The Constitution, though not so democratic, did not differ materially from that now
								in force. It contained a bill of rights, and prescribed a republican form of
								government with three departments,&mdash;legislative, executive, and judicial. The
								General Assembly met annually. The term of senators was three years; that of
								representatives, one year. The governor's term was three years. He had the usual
								executive powers. He, also, appointed judges of the Supreme Court, to serve for
								seven years. The General Assembly elected the other State officers (secretary,
								auditor and treasurer of State). All white male citzens who had resided within the
								State <pb id="VAC1316-030" n="30"/> one year were given the right of suffrage.
								Slavery was forever prohibited. Every twelve years the people had an opportunity to
								vote upon the question of calling a general convention to amend the
								Constitution.</p>

						<div4 type="part">
							<head rend="b">29. Slavery in Indiana.</head>
							<p>When the Ordinance of 1787 was passed, slavery already existed in Indiana. The
								interpretation placed upon the Ordinance was that it prohibited the further
								importation of slaves, but did not free those then held in the Territory. The
								settlers, most of whom were from the Southern States, were eager for its further
								introduction. From 1796 to 1807, six petitions were presented to Congress asking for
								an abrogation or modification of the sixth article of the "Compact" which forbade
								slavery. These petitions were denied. But in the face of this opposition, the number
								of slaves had increased from twenty-eight in 1800 to two hundred and thirty-seven in
								1810, under a law permitting slavery by indenture.<ref id="ref_016"
									target="note_016" rend="super">1</ref> The sentiment against slavery gradually
								increased in the Territory. In the Constitutional Convention of 1816, the friends of
								freedom were overwhelmingly in the majority and slavery was forever prohibited. But
								so difficult was it to uproot this institution of evil that, in spite of
								constitutional prohibition, a few slaves were held in the State for several years
								afterward.</p>

							<head rend="b">30. Beginning of State Government.</head>
							<p>The first general election under the Constitution was held on the first Monday of
								August, 1816, and Jonathan Jennings was chosen governor. The first General

								Waller Taylor United States senators, and later chose the secretary, the auditor and
								the treasurer of State.</p>
							<p>On December 11, 1816, the President signed the resolution of Congress which
								formally admitted Indiana into the sisterhood of States.<ref id="ref_018"

							<p>The task of inaugurating a new government among a frontier people, poor in purse,
								scattered far and wide, and devoid of means of communication and transportation, is
								arduous and exacting. Our first governor and legislators met the difficulties with
								tact, wisdom, intelligence and patriotism. Many obstacles prevented the
								establishment of an adequate system of public instruction. But several academies and
								library associations were incorporated within a few years.</p>

							<head rend="b">31. Removal of the Capital.</head>
							<p>In 1820, commissioners selected the present seat of government, which is within a
								few miles of the geographical centre of the State. In that year there was no white
								colony within fifty miles of the place. In 1825 the capital was removed to
								Indianapolis; at that time it required ten days to go one hundred and twenty-five
								miles.</p>

							<head rend="b">32. State Enterprises.</head>
							<p>(1) The most worthy venture was the Indiana State Bank. The State owned half of the
								stock and participated in its management. Its career was honorable and successful,
								bringing large profits to the State and to private stockholders. The charter
								extended from 1834 to January 1, 1857. Manufactures increased, private corporations
								were organized, and prosperity seemed assured. But with the panic of 1837 came a

								brought disaster and misery to the people.</p>
							<p>(2) The successful prosecution of canal enterprises in the Eastern States
								encouraged the advocates of State highways and waterways in the West. The State had
								received cessions of land from the Indians and extensive grants from the National
								domain, and in 1836 it authorized the expenditure of more than $10,000,000 for the
								building of canals, roads and railroads. Many of the projects were wholly worthless;
								mistakes were made in the organization and management of others; the cost exceeded
								the estimates; the proceeds from the canal lands did not meet expectations; the
								panic of 1837 made it impossible to borrow money, so that the State was almost
								bankrupted and its credit well-nigh ruined. It was found necessary to transfer some
								of the public works to private corporations and wholly to abandon others. The total
								loss to the State was about $8,000,000.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="part">
							<head rend="b">33. A New Constitution.</head>
							<p>On January 18, 1850, the legislature authorized the assembling of a constitutional
								convention, which was to be composed of one hundred and fifty delegates. It met on
								October 7, and after four months of assiduous deliberation it completed its task and
								adjourned February 10, 1851. The Constitution was ratified by the people August 4.
								The vote on the Constitution was 109,319 for, and 26,755 against, its adoption. The
								vote on the thirteenth article, which provided for the exclusion and colonization of
								negroes and mulattoes, was taken separately and resulted in 109,976 for and 21,066
								against. It took effect November 1, 1851, and the first general election under it
								was held in 1852.</p>

							<p>In response to the President's call for 75,000 troops and Governor Morton's
								proclamation for 6000 volunteers&mdash;Indiana's quota&mdash;nearly 20,000 men
								offered their services. The difficulty was not to get men enough but to get few
								enough. In all, Indiana <pb id="VAC1316-033" n="33"/> furnished over 200,000 men for
								the suppression of the Rebellion, and they were found on almost every battle-field
								of the war. Individuals, corporations, towns and cities contributed money. The State
								not only furnished men, but supplied them with food, clothing and munitions until
								the General Government could meet the demands made upon it. Not satisfied with
								putting men into the field, the people established a relief corps and supplied the
								fighting soldiers with many comforts and conveniences. They made provision for the
								needy families of absent men, and cared for the children of those who perished.</p>

							<p>In the summer of 1863, the State rose as one man to repel the bold invasion of John

							<p>All in all, Indiana's record during the war is one that reflects great honor upon
								her name. And it is fitting that the finest soldiers' monument in the world should

							<head rend="b">35. Indiana in National Politics.</head>
							<p>While Indiana's position in National affairs has not been so conspicuous as that of

							<p>Three of her Congressmen&mdash;John W. Davis, Schuyler Colfax and Michael C.
								Kerr&mdash;have served as Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p>
							<p>She has had representation in the Presidents' Cabinets as follows: Caleb B. Smith
								and John P. Usher as <pb id="VAC1316-034" n="34"/> Secretaries of the Interior, Hugh
								McCulloch as Secretary of the Treasury under three Presidents, James N. Tyner and
								Walter Q. Gresham as Postmasters-General, Richard W. Thompson as Secretary of the
								Navy, William H. H. Miller as Attorney-General, and John W. Foster and Walter Q.

							<p>The importance of Indiana in presidential elections is shown by the fact that from
								1868 to 1892 a candidate from Indiana was found on one ticket or the other. In 1868,
								Schuyler Colfax was elected Vice-President on the Republican ticket. In 1884, Thomas
								A. Hendricks, the Democratic candidate for the Vice-Presidency, was elected but did
								not live to serve out his term. In 1888, Hon. Benjamin Harrison was elected
								President and as the Chief Executive of the Nation exhibited statesmanship of the
								highest order.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="part">
							<head rend="b">36. Education.</head>
							<p>By an act of Congress (March 26, 1804) the sale of certain public lands was
								provided for, "with the exception of the section numbered sixteen, which shall be
								reserved in each township for the support of the schools within the same; also, of
								an entire township .... for the use of a seminary of learning." By the enabling act
								of April 19, 1816, this grant was re-affirmed <pb id="VAC1316-035" n="35"/> and one
								entire township in addition was reserved for the use of a seminary. President Monroe
								designated what is now the civil township of Perry, in the county of Monroe, to be
								devoted to this purpose.</p>
							<p>In pursuance of the act of 1804, the first General Assembly of the Territory
								incorporated Vincennes University, November 29, 1806. The trustees were authorized
								to raise $20,000 by lottery. The school was opened for instruction in 1810. On
								January 20, 1820, the State Seminary was established at Bloomington. Later, the
								assistance heretofore given the Vincennes University was diverted to the State
								Seminary. January 24, 1828, the Seminary was converted into the Indiana College by
								act of the General Assembly. The institution was changed in 1838 to the Indiana
								University.</p>
							<p>In 1869, Purdue University, the agricultural and mechanical college of Indiana, was
								located at LaFayette. The institution was opened to students in 1874. It is
								maintained at the expense of the State.</p>
							<p>The Indiana State Normal School was established in 1865, the object of which is
								"the preparation of teachers for teaching in the common schools of Indiana."</p>
							<p>Besides these State schools there are some twelve other institutions&mdash;colleges
								and universities&mdash;which are doing valuable and efficient work.</p>
							<p>Thus, the State school system began with higher education and not with the common
								schools. Under the first Constitution "no efficient school law was ever passed."
								Several academies and seminaries for secondary instruction were established; but
								these were supported in part by tuition fees. This was a period of preparation and
								experiment. Difficulties and impediments seemed to make fruitless every effort to
								establish a general system of education. In 1840, one-seventh of the adult
								population were unable to read. Of the children of school age, not 50,000&mdash;less
								than one-fifth&mdash;were attending primary and <pb id="VAC1316-036" n="36"/> common
									schools.<ref target="note_020" rend="super" id="ref_020">1</ref> In 1850, Indiana
								stood twenty-third in the list of States in regard to popular education, with only
								three slave States below her. Under the Constitution of 1851, the progress of the
								common schools has been rapid and substantial. The law of 1852 contained the essence
								of the present system. It has been modified and strengthened by subsequent
								amendments. The fundamental principle is that the educational system must be general
								and uniform, dependent for its support partially upon taxes derived from the local
								communities and partially upon revenues from the State.</p>
							<p>Gradually the cause of the common schools won its way and the indifference and
								obstinacy of its opponents were overcome. To-day Indiana ranks among the first
								States in regard to her educational system.</p>

							<head rend="b">37. Conclusion.</head>
							<p>It is impossible within the scope of this book to depict adequately, even the
								political history of Indiana, not to speak of the social life and industrial
								development. In the appendix will be found statistics illustrating her present
								condition. But they fail to convey a clear conception of the marvellous growth
								within the period of eighty years. The population has increased from 70,000 in
									1816<ref rend="super" target="note_021" id="ref_021">2</ref> to nearly 2,500,000
								in 1897. The number of acres under improvement has risen from 1,750,000 in 1817<ref
									rend="super" target="note_022" id="ref_022">3</ref> to over 15,000,000 in 1897.
								The annual products of farms in 1816 were scarcely sufficient to furnish sustenance
								to the settlers. Now they are worth more than $100,000,000. The value of
								manufactured products has advanced from $191,000<ref rend="super" id="ref_023"
									target="note_023">4</ref> in 1810 to about $250,000,000 in 1897. Facilities of

								annually. Religious worship, instead of being conducted under the shelter of trees,
								or in barns or log houses, is now performed in six thousand churches valued at more

								power; they are not free to follow the bent of their own wills; for their official

									pecuniary concerns of the township. At the annual June session of the county
									board, with the advice and concurrence of the board,<ref id="ref_160" rend="super"
										target="note_160">1</ref> he levies a tax on the property of such township for
									township, road and other purposes, and reports it to the county auditor, who
									enters it in the tax duplicate. The treasurer collects the amounts levied and upon
									the warrant of the auditor pays to each trustee all the money belonging to his
									township. The trustee examines and settles all claims against the township and
									keeps accounts so as to show the receipts and expenditures of each fund and of the
									whole revenue. He must register and number the township orders or warrants,
									showing the fund on which each is drawn, the number, date and amount of the
									warrant, to whom issued, for what purpose and when redeemable; and also a complete
									statement of all outstanding indebtedness of the township. On the first Monday of
									August of each year he must post up a statement showing the indebtedness in
									detail; within ten days after filing his annual report he must have a copy of it
									published in a newspaper. His records and books must always be open for
									inspection. By an act of 1897, the county board is required to meet in March of
									each year to audit the warrants of the trustees. They have power to investigate
									the purpose of each warrant, its legality, the propriety and the reasonableness of
									the purchase, and the need of the article purchased or service rendered. Any
									taxpayer may appear before the board and make exception to the payment of any
									warrant. The board of audit reports to the circuit court the protested orders. The

									record of each recipient must be given. The reason for giving aid must be shown in
									each case. Two copies of this record are filed in the office of the auditor every
									three months; one copy is sent to the board of State charities; the other is
									retained by the auditor, and the commissioners cannot lawfully pay out money for

								addition for each city therein. Their authority is limited in civil cases to their

						<p>A <hi rend="i">case</hi> is a contested question before a court&mdash;a suit or an

							two parties to every action; the one making the complaint is known as the <hi rend="i"
								>plaintiff</hi>; the adverse party is the <hi rend="i">defendant</hi>. There are two
							classes of cases. A <hi rend="i">criminal case</hi> is undertaken by the State as
							plaintiff and prosecuted for the punishment of a person charged with a public offense;
							the entire people of the State are the injured party, because the peace and dignity of
							the State have been violated. All other cases are <hi rend="i">civil cases</hi>. There
							are two kinds of public offenses. All crimes and offenses punishable with death or
							imprisonment in the State prison are called <hi rend="i">felonies</hi>; all other
							offenses against the law are called <hi rend="i">misdemeanors</hi>.</p>
						<p>(a) <hi rend="i">Procedure in Criminal Cases</hi>.&mdash;Any justice, on complaint
							made on oath charging the commission of any felony or misdemeanor upon any person,
							must issue a warrant for his arrest and cause him to be brought before his court for
							trial or examination. When the accused<ref id="ref_169" rend="super" target="note_169"
								>1</ref> has been arrested by the proper officer he is taken before the justice. If
							the justice has jurisdiction,<ref id="ref_170" rend="super" target="note_170">2</ref>
							he proceeds to try and determine the case. Either the accused or the State may demand
							a jury; otherwise the case will be decided by the justice alone. The defendant may
							appeal from the verdict of the court to the criminal court or to the circuit court.
								<note id="note_169"><ref rend="super" target="ref_169">1</ref> See <hi rend="i">Art.

						<pb id="VAC1316-092" n="92"/>
						<p>If the offense is serious, if the punishment which the justice may assess is
							inadequate to it, and if the justice thinks the evidence sufficient, he may hold the
							accused to bail for appearance before the proper court or commit him to jail in
							default of bail.<ref id="ref_171" rend="super" target="note_171">1</ref> But this does
							not determine his guilt or innocence. It is merely a preliminary examination to hold
							one against whom there is suspicion.</p>
						<p>The more serious criminal cases are tried in the criminal courts, or, where such do
							not exist, in the circuit courts. Before the commencement of any term of these courts
							a <hi rend="i">grand jury</hi> is summoned.<ref id="ref_172" rend="super"

							of every person under bail on a criminal charge and not indicted and into violations
							of the criminal law generally.<ref id="ref_173" rend="super" target="note_173">3</ref>
							Jurors having knowledge of crime must disclose it to the jury and they must preserve
							secrecy as to their proceedings. They may compel witnesses to attend and testify. The
							prosecuting attorney appears before the grand jury to give information or advice, or
							to question witnesses; but no officer or person can be present when the jury expresses
							its opinion or votes. If, after hearing the testimony, five of the jurors concur in
							the opinion that the evidence against any person is sufficient to warrant his arrest
							and trial, the formal accusation of the person of the crime or misdemeanor is signed
							by the prosecutor and indorsed by the foreman of the jury as "A true bill." This is

							to quash or set aside the indictment. If the court<ref id="ref_177" rend="super"
								target="note_177">3</ref> overrules the motion, the defendant is then arraigned by
							the reading of the indictment or the information to him by the clerk. He is required
							to enter immediately his plea. If he pleads "guilty," he is sentenced at once; if he
							pleads "not guilty," the trial proceeds. In case he is too poor to employ an attorney
							the court may assign one to defend him. The State is represented by the prosecuting
							attorney. Every criminal action must be tried publicly in the county where the offense
							was committed, unless the defendant can show that he cannot receive a fair trial
							because of bias and prejudice. In that case a change of venue may be granted by the
							court. He has also a right to a trial by an impartial jury of twelve men; but the
							defendant and the prosecutor with the assent of the court may submit the trial to the
							court, unless the crime is a capital offense. In the selection of the jury the
							defendant may, without assigning a cause, object to twenty jurors in prosecutions for
							capital offenses; to ten jurors in prosecutions for offenses punishable by
							imprisonment; and to three jurors in all other prosecutions. The prosecutor has the
							same number of peremptory challenges. Each party may also challenge for cause any
							number of jurors, and the judge must decide whether the cause alleged is a good ground
							for the exclusion of the jurors. After the jury has been empaneled and sworn the
							prosecuting attorney presents the case of the State and offers the evidence to support
							it. The defendant or his counsel then states his defense and supports it with his
							evidence. Each party may then offer rebutting testimony. The usual arguments by the
							attorneys and the charge to the jury follow. The judge must inform the jurors that
							they are the exclusive judges of all questions of fact, and that they have the right
							also to determine the law. The jury <note id="note_175"><ref target="ref_175"

							is thereupon issued under the seal of the court directed to the sheriff, giving notice
							to the defendant of the commencement of the suit. The clerk is required also to give
							notice of all civil actions brought against parties who are non-residents or absent

					<div3 type="chapter">
						<head rend="b">116. Municipal Corporations.</head>
						<p>County government is sufficient for the needs of a community which is sparsely
							settled and little developed. As the varied industries unfold and as transportation
							facilities multiply, the population naturally increases and congregates in towns and
							cities. Thence it follows that many new problems arise as to the preservation of
							health, the maintenance of order, the protection from fire, the construction of
							water-works, the improvement and lighting of streets, the opening of parks, and many
							other matters promoting the public convenience. Because the needs of communities
							differ widely on account of diversity in size, location and people, these problems can
							be solved satisfactorily only by the people who are most deeply interested in them. In
							consequence of such conditions the State has created special local governments. Such
							governments are known as municipal corporations. They have more extensive powers than
							those of counties, and, as the cities increase in size, the number and scope of these
							powers increase. While municipal corporations co-operate slightly in the
							administration of general State laws, their chief function is the administration of
							local affairs.</p>

						<head rend="b">117. Classification of Municipal Corporations.</head>
						<p>In some States municipal corporations are divided according to population into
							hamlets, villages, towns or boroughs, and cities of different classes and grades. In
							Indiana the popular use of the terms "village," "town" and "city" is somewhat vague;
							but the only municipal corporations authorized by law are towns and cities. The
							classification is not so clearly made as in some States. There is no minimum
							population required for towns; and while there is a minimum required for cities, a
							town having a much greater population may or may not become a city, as the majority of
							its voters prefer. The term village is popularly used to designate a community or
							neighborhood where the people are gathered into a small settlement which may or may
							not have a town government. If the majority of the voters of a small community desire
							it, they may be incorporated into a town with a government distinct from the township.
							If the majority of the voters of a town having over 2000 inhabitants desire it, the
							town may be incorporated into a city. Incorporation is made under general State laws
							which define the form of government and the powers enjoyed under it. The Constitution
							requires that all laws shall be general and of uniform application throughout the
							State, where a general law is applicable. In legislation affecting cities, the laws
							have been enacted for cities having over 100,000 <note id="note_181"><ref rend="super"

							100,000 inhabitants; for cities having between 35,000 and 49,000 inhabitants; and for
							cities in general (having a population less than 35,000 inhabitants). Thus the General
							Assembly seems to recognize four classes of cities.<ref id="ref_182" rend="super"

							<head rend="b">118. Incorporation and Organization.</head>
							<p>When the people of a community desire a government of larger powers than those
								possessed under the township organization, they take the proper steps prescribed by
								statute to attain that end. It is first necessary to procure an accurate survey and
								map of the territory to be included within the town limits. A correct census of the
								people residing within the district must also be taken. A petition signed by
								one-third of the qualified voters of the district is then presented to the county
								board of commissioners. If satisfied that the requirements have been complied with,
								they declare that the territory shall be an incorporated town with the consent of
								the voters; and they order an election to determine that point. Although a majority
								of the electors may favor incorporation, the town is not deemed incorporated until
								its officers and board of trustees have been elected and a president chosen.
								Therefore, it is provided that the town shall be divided into not less than three
								nor more than seven districts and that an election shall be held to fill the town
								offices. The officers are one trustee for each district, a clerk, a treasurer<ref
									id="ref_183" rend="super" target="note_183">2</ref> and a marshal. The inspectors
								must file with the county <note id="note_182"><ref rend="super" target="ref_182"
										>1</ref> This is in part an evasion of the Constitution; for in each class,
									except the last mentioned, there is but one city: in the first class Indianapolis;
									in the second, Evansville; in the third, Fort Wayne. Many other laws have been
									passed applicable only to cities having more or less than a certain population
									specified in the law.</note>
								<note id="note_183"><ref rend="super" target="ref_183">2</ref> The offices of clerk
									and treasurer may be held by the same person.</note>
								<pb id="VAC1316-098" n="98"/> clerk a certified statement of the names of the
								persons elected. A correct plat of the town must also be filed in the office of the
								recorder. When all these steps have been duly taken the community is deemed an
								incorporated town, and a statement of that fact must be filed with the county
								clerk.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="part">
							<head rend="b">119. The Trustees</head>
							<p>are elected for a term of two years, one from each district, by the voters of the
								whole town. They are divided into two classes as nearly equal as possible, one class
								retiring each year. They are the most important officers of the town. They have
								power to make and establish such by-laws, ordinances and regulations, not repugnant
								to the laws of the State, as may be necessary to secure the following ends: the
								purchase of property for the use of the town; protection against fire; the abatement
								of nuisances; the preservation of the public health; the prohibition of gambling;
								the maintenance of peace and order; the prevention of vice and immorality; the
								licensing and regulation of auctioneers, peddlers and vendors of intoxicating
								liquors; the construction and improvement of streets, sidewalks and sewers; the
								lighting of streets; and the erection of school-houses. They fix the annual tax
								levy, and may require the marshal to collect the taxes and pay them over to the town
								treasurer or they may authorize the collection to be made by the county treasurer.
								They also elect three school trustees for a term of three years, one retiring
								annually. This school board has charge of the educational affairs of the town.</p>
						</div4>
						<div4 type="part">
							<head rend="b">120. The Administrative Officers</head>
							<p>are elected annually. The clerk has charge of the books and papers of the trustees
								and keeps a record of their proceedings. He sees to the publication of the
								ordinances and gives notice of town elections.</p>
							<p>The treasurer has charge of the town funds and accounts. He pays out money only
								upon the warrant of the president of the board attested by the clerk. He is required
								to make <pb id="VAC1316-099" n="99"/> an annual settlement with the trustees, who
								must publish a financial statement.</p>
							<p>The marshal has the powers and duties of a constable in enforcing the by-laws and
								ordinances of the town. There is no judicial department distinct from that of the
								township. Justices of the peace have jurisdiction over violations of the ordinances.
								The salaries of the town officers are fixed by the trustees.</p>
							<p>An incorporated town may be dissolved if a majority of the voters favor its
								dissolution, provided the total vote cast equals two-fifths of the entire number of
								voters.</p>

							<head rend="b">121. The City Government.</head>
							<p>It will occur even to a casual observer that there is a close resemblance between
								the form of the city government and that of the State. The charter<ref id="ref_184"
									rend="super" target="note_184">1</ref> corresponds to the Constitution; the mayor,
								to the governor; the administrative boards and officials, to the executive officers
								of the State; the city council, to the General Assembly; and the city courts to the
								State judiciary.</p>
							<p>Mr. Bryce has pointed out that the functions of city government are tripartite:
									(<hi rend="i">a</hi>) to assist the central or State government in administration,
								as in enforcing the police laws, collecting taxes, and in the execution of certain
								protective laws; (<hi rend="i">b</hi>) to do those things which properly pertain to
								local matters and which are regulated by local laws, subject to the general laws of
								the State, such as providing for education, caring for the poor and for the public
								health; (<hi rend="i">c</hi>) to perform duties of a purely business nature, such as
								pertain to all kinds of public improvements. The city is, in respect to the first
								and second functions, a political being; and in respect to the third, <note

						<head rend="b">134. Political Parties.</head>
						<p>In all countries where the individual citizen is free to have and to express opinions
							and is an actual participant in government, there must of necessity be diverse views
							as to the proper policies to be pursued by the State. When a body of voters agree to
							the same political creed and effect an organization to carry out their theories in
							some particular way, they constitute a political party. Party organization of itself
							is not a bad thing. Ideas of government can only be enacted into law through the
							medium of parties. Individuals acting separately can accomplish little. Besides, the
							conduct and administration of the party in power are watched closely by the other
							party to discover, if possible, some act that will give it an advantage. The evils of
							parties appear when corrupt managers attempt to make a party the instrument of private
							gain and advancement, and seek to confuse the voters and to convince them that loyalty
							to party and loyalty to State are identical. But, in fact, these interests are often
							in conflict, and then the true patriot must make the cause of his party subordinate to
							the welfare of his State. When public affairs are administered corruptly it is due in
							part to the negligence and selfish love of ease of the "better class."</p>
						<p>From the very beginning of the National government public questions have not only
							divided men into parties in respect to national affairs, but they have also extended
								<pb id="VAC1316-108" n="108"/> into the politics of the State, the county and even
							of the city and the township&mdash;wholly obliterating the natural party lines. It is
							difficult to find a rational answer to the question: "Why should the election of a
							town trustee or a county treasurer depend upon a man's belief in free trade or
							protection; in free silver or a gold standard?" The reply of the party man is, that in

						<head rend="b">135. The Organization.</head>
						<p>The success of a party depends very largely upon the excellence of its organization.
							The purposes of party organization are to keep the party united and enthusiastic, to
							bring new members into it, to instruct its adherents on the issues and to select the
							candidates for the offices. This organization consists of three parts: the primary,
							the convention and the committees.</p>
						<p>The term primary is used in two senses. It may signify the assembling of all the
							voters of a party, residing within defined limits, in a mass meeting for the purpose
							of naming the candidates and delegates and of performing other party services. Or it
							may denote an election for the same purposes, at which only members of the party may
							vote. In either case it is practicable only within narrow limits.</p>
						<p>A convention is a meeting of the delegates selected at primaries or mass meetings for
							the purpose of making nominations and selecting delegates to other conventions. Such a
							method is uniformly used to determine nominations for President, for State officers,
							for congressmen, for State senators and representatives, for circuit judges and
							prosecutors and usually for county and city officers. The convention may also adopt a
							platform endorsing the national administration of their party (if in power) and <pb
								id="VAC1316-109" n="109"/> arraigning the opposite party; it may appoint the
							committees for the district and prescribe certain regulations for the direction of the
							officers and committeemen. The importance of primaries and conventions has been too
							much ignored by the better element. Where one party is greatly in the majority a
							nomination is virtually equal to an election. And where parties are more evenly
							balanced, after the nominations are made the voter often has but a choice of two
							evils. Keener interest and greater activity in primaries and conventions will, in a
							degree at least, prevent the election of corrupt or inefficient officers.</p>
						<p>While primaries and conventions are important in the preliminary stages of the
							campaign, great consequence attaches to the management of the campaign by the
							committees. The former are merely temporary bodies; the latter are permanent and
							frequently are composed year after year of the same men, who become expert in the
							conduct of committee affairs. The members of the national committee are appointed at
							the time of the national convention.<ref id="ref_206" rend="super" target="note_206"
								>1</ref> The State central committee has the general direction of the campaign
							within a State. In Indiana each party has a State central committee, composed of
							thirteen members, one selected by the convention of each congressional district. The
							county central committees&mdash;usually one from each township&mdash;the township
							committees, the city committees and the ward committees all act under the general
							supervision of the State committee, with a certain degree of independence allowed to
							each. They control the raising and expenditure of funds, the organization of meetings,
							the selection of speakers, the formation of clubs, the preparation of parades, the
							taking of a poll and many other matters, some of which are not proper and
							legitimate.</p>

						<p>Immediately on closing the polls the election board counts the ballots remaining

							prepare the certificate and send it to the person elected. The county clerks on the

							representatives in the General Assembly: these are sent to the secretary of State.

							highest number of votes. The governor, thereupon, transmits to them their commissions.
							Each clerk of the circuit court also makes out two certified statements of the number
							of votes each candidate for governor and lieutenant-governor has received; one of
							these he transmits to the speaker of the next house of representatives through his

						<p>is the pride of every citizen of Indiana. The present efficient system by which the
							means for the support of the schools are provided has been generally commended by
							schoolmen. But it is the result of many years of experiment. It is based upon the
							theory that their maintenance should be furnished partly by the State and partly by
							the local communities. Experience has shown that in this case local self-government is
							not the ideal plan; for it leaves the poor, ignorant and indifferent communities alone
							in their poverty and ignorance. Neither is support wholly by the State the ideal
							method, for this makes the people dependent, indifferent and perhaps extravagant.
							Under the present system the aid given by the State secures at least a minimum term to
							the poorer districts and stimulates the local authorities to more earnest effort.</p>
						<p>The school fund is the permanent endowment of the schools. It includes money loaned
							at interest and rented lands. The principal must remain a perpetual fund <pb

							<p><hi rend="i">The Surplus Revenue Fund</hi>. When the surplus revenue of the United
								States was distributed among the States in 1836, the share allotted to Indiana was
								$860,254. The next year the General Assembly set aside for school purposes
								$537,502.96 of this fund. By the terms of the act of distribution the State is bound
								to repay this money or any part of it whenever it is called for by the United States
								government.</p>
							<p><hi rend="i">The Saline Fund</hi> and the lands belonging thereto. By the enabling
								act of 1816 Congress granted to Indiana all the salt springs within the State and
								the lands reserved about them. In 1833 the legislature ordered these lands to be
								sold and the proceeds to be appropriated to the common schools. The amount received
								from this source was about $85,000.</p>
							<p><hi rend="i">The Bank-tax Fund</hi>. When the State Bank of Indiana was chartered,
								in 1834, it was stipulated that each share not owned by the State should pay an
								annual tax of 12½ cents, to be applied to the school fund. From an observance of
								this provision there accrued to the fund $80,000.</p>
							<p><hi rend="i">The Sinking Fund</hi>. In order to take stock in the State Bank and to
								make loans to individuals who wished to take stock in the bank, it was necessary for
								the State to borrow money. This loan was to be paid from the proceeds of a sinking
								fund, which consisted of the unapplied balances of the loan made to the State; the
								sums (principal and interest) paid on the loans made by the State to the
								stockholders; and the dividends or profits received by the State as a stockholder.
								It was provided that after the payment of the loan made to the State and all
								expenses the residue should be a permanent fund and be appropriated to the cause of
								common schools. This sinking fund was so skilfully managed that the school fund has
								realized the generous sum of $4,255,731.87.</p>
							<p><hi rend="i">The Seminary Fund</hi>. Under the provisions of the Constitution of
								1816 county seminaries were established, the support of which came from exemption
								moneys, fines for breaches of the penal laws and "unclaimed gaming money recovered."
								When the reorganization of the school system was effected by the Constitution of
								1851 and the laws of 1852 it was provided that all the buildings and property
								belonging to these seminaries should be sold and the proceeds be added to the common
								school fund. The exact amount received from such sales is not known, but it exceeded
								$100,000.</p>
							<p><hi rend="i">Fines and Forfeitures</hi>. All fines assessed for breaches of the
								penal laws of the State and all forfeitures on recognizances are turned into this
								fund. Great carelessness or corruption in the collection and management of such
								moneys existed prior to 1868. But since that time the annual increase of the fund
								from this cause has averaged more than $50,000. The total amount realized is about
								$1,600,000.</p>
							<p><hi rend="i">Escheats</hi>. While nominally a source of revenue, for fifty years
								only $1278 has been added to the fund from money derived from "the sale of escheated
								real estate."</p>
							<p><hi rend="i">All lands granted</hi> to the State with no special purpose mentioned
								in the grant; and the proceeds of the sale of <hi rend="i">swamp-lands</hi>. The
								swamp-lands granted to Indiana in 1850 by Congress aggregated 1,257,588 acres. But
								from this gift nothing has been realized directly for the school fund. The proceeds
								were recklessly, if not dishonestly, expended in the draining and surveying of the
								lands. It was also the purpose of the legislature that whatever surplus might remain
								after the construction of the Michigan road from the lands donated for that object
								should be applied to the school fund. But all the proceeds were absorbed in the
								building of the road.</p>
							<p><hi rend="i">Estrays</hi>. After the payment of expenses attendant upon the
								impounding and sale of animals astray or adrift the proceeds from such sales are
								added to the school fund. The receipts from this source have been about $1000.</p>
							<p><hi rend="i">Delinquent Tax Funds</hi>. When lands are returned delinquent for

						<p>The management of the school fund is intrusted to the counties in the care of the
							county auditors. The money <pb id="VAC1316-121" n="121"/> is loaned by them at the
							rate of six per cent. If for any reason there is a loss of any part of the principal
							or interest, that deficit must be made good by the county and not by the State. No
							part of the revenue derived from this fund can be used for any other purpose than for
							tuition. No buildings or equipment may be purchased with it; not even a school
							superintendent may be paid from it.</p>

						<head rend="b">147. The School Revenues</head>
						<p>consist of all moneys from whatever public source expended or which may be expended
							upon the public schools. They are of two kinds: the State revenue and the local
							revenue. The former is made up of the State tax (11 cents on the $100 and 50 cents
							poll); interest on the common school fund; and unclaimed witness fees. The local
							revenues include the interest on the congressional township fund; liquor licenses; the
							surplus dog-tax fund; and local tuition taxes.</p>
						<p>The State revenue is apportioned semi-annually. The county auditors report
							semi-annually to the superintendent of public instruction the amount of revenue for
							tuition <pb id="VAC1316-122" n="122"/> collected and ready for apportionment in each
							county. The State superintendent apportions this to the several counties upon the

							Upon the same basis each county auditor apportions to the school corporations<ref

							revenue received. However, he must first ascertain the amount of congressional
							township revenue each school corporation receives and must apportion the State
							revenue, so as to equalize the amount of tuition for each city, town and township,
							according to the enumeration of the children; but the income from the congressional
							township fund cannot by such apportionment be diminished, diverted or distributed to
							any other township. Each school corporation may levy a special tax for the
							construction and repair of buildings and for other necessary expenses (except for

						<p>The State has recognized that the character of the schools depends more upon the
							character, scholarship and professional training of the teachers than upon buildings

							instruction of its teachers by establishing institutions of higher learning. The State
							Normal School, located at Terre Haute, includes the normal school proper and the model
							school. The latter serves as a practice and model school for the normal students. The
							normal school proper is designed to "confer that knowledge which constitutes the
							science of education and to train students in the art of instruction and school
							management." A department of pedagogy is a part of the curriculum of Indiana
							University. There are, besides, the following supplementary educational agencies:
							county and township institutes, giving instruction in methods; the reading circles,
							imparting culture and professional knowledge; and the teachers'

						<p>Indiana has answered the demand for higher education by the establishment of the
							Indiana University and Purdue University. The latter institution, located at La
							Fayette, embraces now a government "experiment station" and six special schools
							bearing upon the scientific and industrial life of the State. It derives sustenance
							from three sources: (1) the interest on a permanent endowment obtained from the sale
							of lands donated by the United States, from gifts from Hon. John Purdue and from
							grants by <note id="note_241"><ref rend="super" target="ref_241">1</ref> W. A. B<hi

							Congress; and (3) a revenue of one-twentieth of a mill upon every dollar of taxable
							property in Indiana. The school has grown constantly in favor and efficiency.</p>
						<p>Indiana University, located at Bloomington, has made rapid progress in the last dozen
							years. Its income is derived from three sources: (1) rents from unsold lands donated
							by the United States; (2) interest on the permanent endowment, which is in part the
							proceeds of land sales and in part a fund obtained by State taxation; and (3) revenue
							from a tax of one-fifteenth of a mill on the dollar.<ref id="ref_242" rend="super"
								target="note_242">1</ref> Work of a literary and scientific nature is offered in two
							hundred and twenty-three courses classified into seventeen departments, including the
							school of law. There are more than fifty members of the faculty who have received
							their training at thirty-eight of the leading universities of Europe and America.
							Well-equipped libraries, museums and laboratories give excellent opportunity for
							breadth of culture and special investigation. The university has no preparatory
							department of its own. It draws its students directly from the secondary schools. The
							graduates from one hundred and thirty commissioned high schools are admitted to the
							freshman class without any examination except in English. Since this relation has been
							established, the courses of the high schools have been enlarged, systematized and made
							more nearly uniform, and the attendance of the university has grown from 144 in 1884
							to 944 in 1897. This illustrates well how intimately the interests of all the
							educational institutions are interwoven and how steadily the influence of higher
							education permeates down to the most elementary schools.</p>

					<head rend="b">THE CONGRESSIONAL SURVEY.</head>
					<p>According to the system adopted in 1785, the surveyors first establish a meridian line
						starting from some conspicuous object, as a <hi rend="i">principal meridian</hi>. A
						parallel at right angles to this is selected as a <hi rend="i">base line</hi>. East and
						west of the principal meridian, at every sixth mile, are run additional meridians,
						called <hi rend="i">range lines</hi>; north and south of the base-line, at every sixth
						mile, are drawn additional parallels called <hi rend="i">township lines</hi>. This
						divides the land into squares of 36 miles each, called <hi rend="i">townships</hi>. The
						townships are numbered north and south of the base line, and the ranges east and west of
						the principal meridian.</p>
					<pb id="VAC1316-163" n="163"/>

						<p>D<hi rend="sc">IAGRAM</hi> I.&mdash;Illustrating the division of land into townships.
							P M=principal meridian; B L=base line. The figures mark the townships; the Roman
							letters, the ranges. B is in township 2 south, and range 4 east.</p>
					</figure>
					<p>Each township is divided by lines parallel to both the base line and the principal
						meridian into 36 sections, each containing one square mile or 640 acres. These sections
						are numbered beginning at the northeast corner.</p>
					<p>Distinguishing marks are located at the corners of the sections and at the half-mile
						points between them, and are recorded in the surveyors' books. From these
						starting-points, the sections are subdivided into halves, quarters, eighths, and
						sixteenths by the local surveyors. With such a system, the location and description of
						land is a comparatively easy thing.</p>
					<p>The first principal meridian is a line running due north from the mouth of the Miami
						River, and forms the eastern boundary line of the State. The second principal meridian
						runs from the mouth of Little Blue River. The only base line which runs through the
						State is the parallel of 38° 30' north latitude. In Indiana the townships are numbered
						north and south from this line and the ranges east and west from <pb id="VAC1316-164"
							n="164"/> the second principal meridian, with the following exceptions: the lands in
						"Clark's Grant," the French Lands in Knox County, and the lands lying east of the
						"Greenville Line" (see § 22 and foot-note 1). The last mentioned were surveyed west from
						the first principal meridian and north from a base line 15 miles north of the parallel
						of 38° 30'.</p>

				<head rend="center"><hi rend="sc">A</hi><lb/> SERIES OF TEXT-BOOKS<lb/>
					<hi rend="sc">ON THE</hi><lb/> ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</head>
				<p rend="center">By JOHN S. HART, LL.D.,<lb/>
					<hi rend="i">Late Professor of Rhetoric and of the English Language in the College of New
						Jersey</hi>.</p>
				<p>The Series comprises the following volumes&mdash;viz.: <list type="simple">
						<item>Language Lessons for Beginners,</item>
						<item>Elementary English Grammar,</item>
						<item>English Grammar and Analysis,</item>
						<item>First Lessons in Composition,</item>
						<item>Composition and Rhetoric.</item>
					</list></p>
				<p>Hart's Composition and Rhetoric is more generally in use throughout the country than any
					other work on the subject.</p>
				<p>Prof. Moses Coit Tyler says of it: <q rend="blockquote"><p>"In the transition from
							grammar to what may be called the mechanics of literary workmanship, we are obliged to
							insist upon a particular text-book&mdash;Hart's 'Composition and
							Rhetoric'&mdash;simply because that book is the only one as yet in the market which
							deals so fully and so well with the topics which we desire to emphasize."</p></q></p>
				<p>Its Practical Character is one of its most valuable features. Rhetoric is an art as well
					as a science, and no text-book for the class-room is of much value which is not well
					furnished with "Examples for Practice." In this respect, this book is far ahead of any
					other work of the kind.</p>
				<p>Its Adaptability to all grades of schools is another feature of value. It is equally in
					place in the graded school, the academy, the female seminary, and in the higher
					institutions of learning.</p>
				<p>The Thousands of Schools of every grade, in all sections of the country, in which this
					book is being used, not only with satisfaction, but with enthusiasm, testify to its merit.
					Unless peculiarly meritorious, no book could possibly attain the widespread popularity
					which has been accorded to this manual.</p>

					Houston's New Physical Geography is the realization of what a text-book on this subject
					should be. It is a book that will gladden the hearts of teachers and pupils. It is
					concise, comprehensive, up to the times, and in every respect <hi rend="i">an ideal
						text-book</hi>.<lb/> Great care has been taken to avoid the mistake, common to most
					books of its class, of crowding both text and maps with a mass of technical detail which
					simply confuse and bewilder the pupil. As a working text-book for class-room use,
					Houston's New Physical Geography stands to-day at the head of the list of similar works,
					and is practically without a peer.</p>

					Roll-Book, No. 2, is arranged on the same general plan, as regards spacing, etc.,
					excepting that each page is arranged for a month of five weeks; but, in addition, the
					names of the studies generally pursued in schools are printed immediately following the
					name of the pupil, making it more <pb id="VAC1316-174" n="6"/> convenient when it is
					desirable to have a record of all the studies pursued by a pupil brought together in one place.<lb/>
