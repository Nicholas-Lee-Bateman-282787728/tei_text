            <p>Traditionally biographers are fond of identifying their subjects according to professions or
                    positions held, describing them as politicians, generals, presidents, theologians, or the like. It
                    would be misleading, however, to try to understand Claude G. Bowers by classifying him either as a
                    celebrated journalist, the author of several well-received historical works, an influential
                    political aide, a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> ambassador for two decades, or a speech writer for the Democratic party for half a
                    century. Indeed, Bowers served in each of these capacities, but he should be remembered above all as
                    a fervent partisan of liberal democracy. Before reaching adulthood this democrat became a confirmed
                    Democrat, convinced that the Democratic party represented the forces of economic and social justice
                    in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Bowers's many professional endeavors were not ends in themselves; instead,
                    they offered this partisan Hoosier diverse forums that he used to expound his liberal political
                    creed and to promote the Democracy.</p>

            <p>School, the stories of Civil War veterans, sermons, political speeches, and reading offered Claude
                    more than a rudimentary education in Whitestown. Contemporaries recognized oratory as an edifying
                    art that provided them with opportunities for both entertainment and social gatherings. Claude
                    eagerly attended the meetings of the local debating society directed by the Lutheran minister and
                    the schoolmaster. Political rallies and the county fair in <placeName>
                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                    </placeName> eight miles away also attracted the denizens of <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the summer and the autumn. Once, after hearing Democratic Senator Daniel W. Voorhees
                    lash out at his opponents, Claude was presented to the solon, who laid his hand on the
                    lad's head. Bowers later remembered this and remarked, "I felt I had been
                        anointed."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> So partisan was the nine-year-old Claude that he was
                    almost frightened to death when he heard a Radical Republican warn his audience: "In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>

                    which is hot, they're all Democrats."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Claude's years in Whitestown left a lifelong legacy of pleasant memories that helped shape
                    his confidence in the innate intelligence and capacities of the common man. Tinkling sleigh bells,
                    heated political debates, county fairs, childish pranks, and the accurate aim of tobacco chewers
                    toward ever-present cuspidors were but some of Bowers's <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone County</region>
                    </placeName> recollections. More important were the attitudes he took with him from his hometown. He
                    later asserted, "I think I learned more of the American mind from the villagers of
                    Whitestown than I ever learned afterwards."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Forged in rural Indiana,
                    his lifelong respect for the dignity of hard work and the opinions and sentiments of the people
                    would remain with him as he climbed the ladder of political importance and experienced the
                    sophistication of cosmopolitan and diplomatic life.</p>

                    </placeName> Street. During the last decade of the century the Hoosier capital was a prosperous but
                    unsophisticated metropolis that grew from 128,000 to 170,000 souls. The first electric streetcar ran
                    up muddy, unpaved <placeName>

                    </placeName> Avenue from the downtown business district; several railroads made the city an
                    important regional center; and business enterprises were attracting a steady stream of rural and
                    immigrant laborers. Meat-packing, ironworks, lumberyards, breweries, brickworks, and commerce were
                    some of the diverse sources of employment. The tall Soldiers' and Sailors'
                    Monument on the Circle was nearing completion, and the chairman of the Monument Commission, the
                    father of one of Claude's friends, al-lowed the adventuresome boy to climb the off-limits
                    shaft to survey his new home.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

                    British statesmen, particularly those of orators such as John C. Calhoun, John Philpot Curran, and
                    William Gladstone. On Sun-days Claude attended churches of various denominations in order to listen
                    to the long but carefully worded sermons. He watched the "Divine Sarah" Bernhardt
                    and other visiting performers at English's Opera House on the Circle. At Tomlinson Hall at <placeName>

                    the speeches of both parties' candidates. How-ever, the faculty at <placeName>

                    his intellectual growth as a teenager. He particularly enjoyed classes in civil government and
                    politics. Bowers was president of the school's Senate, an organization for students modeled
                    after the chamber in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

            <p>Bowers's Republicanism proved of short duration. In the epic encounter of 1896 between
                    William McKinley and William Jennings Bryan, the Hoosier youth sided with the Democrats. Of the
                    Republican platform, Bowers opined: "There is one bad feature about the thing. It was
                    written by the upper class. It was formulated in Wall street. Now has the interest of Wall St ever
                    been know[n] to coincide with the interests of the masses?"<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Of the
                    Re-publican standard-bearer, McKinley, Claude wrote, for his "abilities I have little
                        respect";<hi rend="sup">10</hi> however, it was Bryan's advocacy of an
                    economic policy in favor of the common man that won Claude for the Democracy. Bowers agreed that the
                    Republican party's untiring efforts to keep prices high through protective tariffs and by
                    vigorous adherence to the gold standard were, in fact, tantamount to crucifying the citizenry on a
                    "Cross of Gold." After hearing Bryan in person in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Bowers was so impressed with the Democratic orator that "from that hour I
                    thought in terms of politics."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bowers found the model for his political ideals in Thomas Jefferson. As president of the high school
                    debate team, Claude chose to defend Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s influence on the early American republic at the state oratorical contest in
                    1898. When the Hoosier youth researched his subject, he found <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s ideas "obnoxious."12 Bowers saw <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the proponent of an aristocratic-dominated political system and Jefferson as the
                    spokesman for a democratic America. Because it was too late to change his topic, Bowers focused his
                    oration on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s role in securing the ratification of the Constitution—something
                    he could sincerely admire—and earned first place at the contest. Thereafter, however,
                    Claude for life identified himself as a "Jeffersonian Democrat," by which he meant
                    a proponent of government by all of the people in the interests of the majority of the people.</p>
            <p>College was not in Bowers's future. Only the sacrifices of his mother and the frugality of
                    both had allowed him to complete high school. Instead, Bowers found a temporary job in 1898 with a
                    publisher in <placeName>

                    in Congress, Ralston jokingly pro-posed him as a congressional candidate. The partisan orator also
                    found time to contribute two pieces to the <hi rend="i">Jeffersonian Democrat,</hi> a publication of
                    the national party. Indiana's future Democratic Senator John Worth Kern read these articles
                    and described them as "crackerjacks."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>In his twenty-first year Bowers began his long career as a journalist. In 1900 he became the major

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he wrote for the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Star</hi>. His
                    editorials revealed his adherence to the goals of the progressive movement, the proponents of which
                    were well represented in both major parties. These reformers confidently believed that active
                    participation by the people in the political system would make government serve the interests of the
                    majority of the citizenry instead of the special concerns of those of great wealth.
                    Bowers's editorials urged the adoption of primary elections to make politicians more
                    responsive to public opinion, and his every published piece reflected his strong belief that

                    him into the progressive movement. He did not abandon his liberal tenets during the conservative
                    1920s, and he was a fervent supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. For Bowers,
                    liberal democracy meant an active government that would ensure the rights of the majority against
                    the influence of a wealthy oligarchy represented in his eyes by the magnates of banking and
                    industry. Although a severe critic of Wall Street, the Hoosier Democrat believed in capitalism. He
                    insisted, however, that this system must be controlled by the state in the interest of the
                    citizenry. Inherent in Bowers's faith in liberal democracy was his trust in the
                    people's ability to guarantee their rights through the electoral process.</p>
            <p>At least in part because of Bowers's party ties and his oratory the Democrats made him their
                    congressional nominee in 1904 and 1906 for the usually Republican <placeName>

                    middle-class Republican and Democratic reformers who made up the progressive movement. He championed
                    the expansion of democracy through women's suffrage and the direct election of senators and
                    promised to regulate monopolies and to outlaw giant trusts such as Standard Oil. As expected, Bowers
                    was soundly defeated in 1904, the year of Republican Theodore Roosevelt's landslide
                    presidential victory.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In his active 1906 campaign the Democratic journalist
                    once again vowed to fight "to control and regulate the great financial interests of the
                        nation."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> He managed to attract Republican voters by lauding the
                    progressive reforms achieved by President Roosevelt and noting, "If I had been a member of
                    congress during the last two years, I would have supported all the reform measures of the president
                    … because they were patriotic American measures."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> After a
                    very close contest the election officials declared Bowers the loser by eight hundred votes, but the
                    Democratic candidate never agreed with this verdict. "I was elected and counted
                    out—no question about that.…"<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Despite his
                    political disappointments he campaigned throughout Indiana for the Democratic national ticket of

                    moderate political solutions that would avoid conservative government by the elite as well as

                    piracy," he declared in 1913, "and the Socialist party with the red flag of

                    progressive reforms, Bowers undertook many of the tasks that senators normally handled
                    themselves—overseeing the office, tending to liaison duties with the public and
                    politicians back home, and on occasion taking care of speaking engagements. In addition to his

            <p>Bowers was almost forty years old when he arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> with his wife and young daughter. His slight stature certainly belied his future
                    importance, but acquaintances were immediately impressed by his seriousness of purpose and his
                    historical and political knowledge. Bowers's rather sunken, doleful eyes and prominent ears
                    likewise endowed him with no special aura of respectability. However, his general demeanor did offer
                    intimations of a man of forthright opinions who favored an informal, middle-class life-style.
                    Particularly later, when as an ambassador he was forced to dress in formal garb, his obviously
                    awkward countenance conformed more to the world's notion of a small-town Hoosier than to
                    that of a sophisticated, upper-class diplomat.</p>
            <p>Bowers had added another dimension to his public life by 1917. Just as his political convictions had
                    taken him into journalism and to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, they likewise found expression in his historical writings.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> While
                    working for Senator Kern in 1916, Bowers published his first book, <hi rend="i">The Irish
                    Orators.</hi> In this study the author displayed his deep respect for formal political discourse by
                    eulogizing the Hibernian statesmen he had first encountered in his afternoons of reading in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    laudatory biography that emphasized the importance of his former employer in passing President
                    Wilson's New Freedom legislation.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> During the next fourteen years
                    Bowers would contribute other well-received works that reached a large national audience. For him
                    history served as a lesson for those interested in current political issues. In <hi rend="i">The
                        Party Battles of the Jackson Period</hi> (1922) he argued that "the election of Jackson
                    was due to the rising of the masses" and vigorously defended the democratic policies of the

               </hi> (1929) the Hoosier Democrat blamed the Radical Republicans for humiliating the
                    defeated white southerners following the Civil War. The author later admitted that his thesis
                    reflected his boyhood notions of the Republicans' Reconstruction policies, but Bowers
                    buttressed his conclusions by consulting boxes of diaries and letters supplied him by the United
                    Daughters of the Confederacy.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> As later historians have observed, certainly one
                    of Bowers's purposes in writing <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> was a partisan political
                    consideration. In 1928 Republican Herbert Hoover proved to be the first strong presidential
                    candidate of his party in the South, so Bowers realized that his book would serve to remind southern
                    Democrats in 1929 of the Republicans' Reconstruction measures.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
                    Despite the political focus of his writings he later published a praise-laden biography about an
                    Indiana Republican, <hi rend="i">Beveridge and the Progressive Era</hi> (1932). Like Kern, Senator
                    Beveridge was an effective advocate of progressive political reform and a friend of the author.</p>
            <p>Bowers's historical works originally met with critical acclaim, but today his reputation as
                    a historian is tarnished. In 1926 Samuel F. Bemis, later president of the American Historical
                    Association, reviewed Bowers's <hi rend="i">Jefferson and Hamilton</hi> and wrote,
                    "The author of the <hi rend="i">Party Battles of the Jackson Period</hi> has done even a
                    better thing with the party battles of the Jefferson and Hamilton period." Bemis lauded
                    Bowers's research and noted that the work served "as a good antidote to the
                    several recent studies extolling the marvels of Federalism and glorifying too exclusively the genius
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Likewise, Charles R. Lingley praised <hi rend="i">The

                    … [Bowers's] conclusion, all judicially minded will have to agree."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> However, more recent historians have reinterpreted Jefferson's
                    contributions and Reconstruction, and their conclusions differ from those of Bowers. Dumas Malone,
                    the outstanding mod-em Jefferson scholar, maintains that the label "Jeffersonian"
                    should not be used to describe twentieth-century politicians, and he care-fully reminds the readers

                    Writing of the post-Civil War period, a leading contemporary historian, Kenneth M. Stampp, singles
                    out for attack Bowers's conclusions in <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> and argues that the
                    policies of the Radical Republicans are worthy of praise because they reflected their commitment to
                    guaranteeing the new rights of the former slaves. Stampp charges that Bowers viewed blacks as
                    "ignorant, barbarous, sensual Negroes who threatened to Africanize the South and destroy
                    its Caucasian civilization."<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Indeed, Bowers's advocacy of
                    liberal democracy did not lead him to champion the cause of black Americans in his historical works
                    or in politics. Like so many of his liberal and conservative contemporaries in the 1920s, the
                    Hoosier author was not sympathetic to the plight of the freedmen and depicted them in pejorative
                    terms. For example, in <hi rend="i">The Tragic Era</hi> Bowers referred to their "bizarre
                    notions of labor," "indulgence in sexual promiscuity," and
                    "indolence," and he noted that many black troops in the postwar South
                    "were children, acting as children would under the circumstances."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

                    of Bowers. In one speech for Wagner the Hoosier journalist included the admonition "Beware

                    Democratic convention that nominated the "Happy Warrior" for the presidency.
                    Bowers entertained his audience with a bitter attack on the Harding-Coolidge years. He charged that
                    "privilege and pillage are the Gold Dust twins of normalcy" and argued that
                    "under the rule of this regime the average man has no more stake in the government for

            <p>Like many other progressives Bowers did not embrace a concern for civil rights for blacks, but he was
                    a bitter foe of religious bigotry in the 1920s. His first work, <hi rend="i">The Irish Orators,</hi>
                    praised the efforts of Roman Catholic patriots in <placeName>

                    with disapproval that by 1922 its members "fairly swarmed in Indiana from the river to the
                        lake."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> He was particularly distressed at the religious fanaticism
                    displayed in the 1928 presidential campaign against Al Smith, a Roman Catholic. Later, in his
                    autobiography, Bowers recalled the intolerance that marked the 1928 contest and condemned the
                    "marching men in uniforms of bedsheets and pillowcases, the fanning of the flames of hate,
                    the burning of crosses, intimidation—all quite similar to events in <placeName>

                    nominating speech for Roosevelt at the 1932 Democratic convention, but during the campaign the
                    partisan journalist spoke for the national ticket in <placeName>

                    candidate's schedule pre-vented him from delivering his own speech. In his election-year
                    editorials Bowers continued to attack the policies of President Hoover. Bowers blamed the Great
                    Depression on "the policies of the Coolidge regime of complete subservience to Wall Street
                    …" and argued that "Mr. Hoover has done little and has done the little

            <p>Bowers played a part in shaping Roosevelt's view of himself and his administration as
                    contemporary continuators of Jefferson's democratic principles. At Bowers's
                    request the future president had, in 1925, written his only book review, a laudatory critique of <hi rend="i">Jefferson and Hamilton</hi> for the <hi rend="i">Evening World</hi>. Reflecting on this
                    work, Roosevelt remarked: "I wonder if, a century and a quarter later, the same contending
                    forces are not again mobilizing. Hamiltonians we have today. Is a Jefferson on the
                        horizon?"<hi rend="sup">51</hi> As president, Roosevelt readily accepted the role of
                    the "new Jefferson" and went to great lengths to associate himself with the
                        Virginian.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> The Hyde Park executive often quoted Jefferson and on occasion
                    instructed his subordinates to search for statements by the third president that could be used to
                    support New Deal initiatives. In his appointments Roosevelt favored Democrats who were known

                    particularly deserving in the president's eyes to be a part of his administration.</p>
            <p>The president-elect in 1933 offered Bowers the choice of several European ambassadorial posts.

                    Bowers acidly observed, "It seems no one is for it but the mass of the people."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> As the political fortunes of the right and the left ebbed and flowed, Bowers
                    remained correctly neutral, but in his diplomatic dispatches he angered the conservative Republicans
                    in the State Department by siding with the democratic parties in the center of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>'s political spectrum.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bowers never became accustomed to the rather meaningless social life of the diplomatic corps.
                    Reflecting his background and his beliefs, he went out of his way to be a democratic,
                    "shirt-sleeves" ambassador. His frequent comments on diplomatic entertaining
                    re-veal his forthright, commonsense approach: "This evening went to a tea at the home of
                    … the counsellor of the French embassy.… We got away as soon as possible. Lord
                    spare me from such an empty life."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Nevertheless, in many ways he was
                    forced to conform to the aristocratic requirements of his position. Since the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> owned no embassy in Madrid, Bowers rented a large ducal palace which served both as his
                    residence and offices.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> The building occupied an entire city block and included
                    a Goya salon built around a series of this Spaniard's paintings, a sacristy and chapel, a
                    marble-floored dining room with paintings on the ceiling and a table that seated more than twenty
                    guests, a tennis court, and a large formal garden with a stone terrace. The staff required for the
                    embassy consisted of a butler, two footmen, two chefs, a doorkeeper, a gardener, a kitchen maid, two
                    house maids, and a charwoman. These servants' wages totaled $253.00 a month, and
                    their food allowance came to an additional $165.00. Because of his limited personal
                    resources, Bowers hired a French chef only when he gave formal state dinners.</p>
            <p>Entertaining in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> represented myriad, often unique problems. The government was a parliamentary
                    democracy, but the instability of the party coalitions meant frequent ministerial changes. Bowers
                    twice offered luncheons for the prime minister, only to discover after it was too late to cancel the
                    function that the honored guest was in fact an ex-minister and prohibited by protocol from
                    attending. One typical menu described by Bowers demonstrates the elaborateness of these affairs as
                    well as the ambassador's faulty French: <list type="footnotes">

            <p>During the summer months the Spanish government and the accredited foreign missions left sweltering
                    Madrid for the cool ocean breezes from the Bay of Biscay in the northern city of San Sebastian. Just

                    residents complained that the future monarch's attire was too casual. They say, he wrote,
                    that the prince "lowers the tone" of their resort.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> In August
                    of 1934 Bowers reported that a friend saw the future king at a night club "with Mrs

            <p>The ambassador's duties of course involved far more than the boring rounds of social

                    sail-ors arrested in Iberian ports, Bowers devoted most of his energies in his first three years in

                    commercial accord between the two nations, but sensitive economic interests in each country so
                    complicated negotiations that no treaty was signed.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Bowers did successfully

            <p>Spanish elections in February, 1936, brought to power the Popular Front, a coalition of moderate
                    groups and the Socialist and Communist parties. The traditional conservatives opposed these
                    republicans' program to secularize public education and to initiate land reform and
                    personal income taxes. Terrorist attacks between the right and the left became increasingly frequent
                    following the election. In July, 1936, the frightened conservatives, led by a military uprising,
                    resorted to civil war to overcome the Popular Front government. Soon the conflict turned into a
                    drawn-out struggle between the conservative army troops commanded by General Francisco Franco and
                    the forces of the moderate-leftist political parties under the leadership of Prime Minister Manuel
                    Azana.</p>

                    </placeName> and Benito Mussolini's <placeName>

                    </placeName> to assist General Franco, and the ambassador, of course, emphasized this intervention
                    in his many reports to the State Department.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> True to his democratic
                    principles, the ambassador confessed to his diary, "My sympathies are wholly with the
                        Government."<hi rend="sup">65</hi> How-ever, many career diplomats in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> were conservative Re-publican appointees of Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover.
                    Unlike Bowers, these foreign service officers feared the alliance of the small Communist party with
                    the Popular Front government of the republic far more than the totalitarian forces backing General
                        Franco.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Suspicious of political appointees, Undersecretary of State
                    William Phillips reportedly had acquiesced to Bowers's ambassadorship in Madrid only after
                    Roosevelt exerted pressure.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> The undersecretary was convinced that the Popular
                    Front victory in 1936 meant that "<placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> may become Communistic," and he consistently opposed the ambassador's
                        suggestions.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> Bowers certainly held foreign service officers in low esteem.
                    Typical of his views of professional diplomats was a comment to his wife that "the more I
                    see of career men the more I doubt their interest in or partiality for democracy."<hi rend="sup">69</hi> Bowers was very aware of the hostility of some career officers toward him.

            <p>Despite the treaty's implications the commissioners had difficulty persuading the Indians to

                    councils.… They liked the festivities with which the negotiations were accompanied, and

            </p>
            <p>Difficulties regarding treaties were aggravated by the mobile, loose structure of the Indian groups.
                    Chiefs frequently moved their bands; individuals changed villages. Intertribal marriages,
                    over-lapping territories, and changing alliances were hard for whites to understand. They negotiated
                    business deals, etc., with a "chief," often not realizing that the Indians had
                    village chiefs, ceremonial chiefs, or war chiefs, who might have only temporary or limited
                    authority. Moreover, the Indians were not cognizant of state boundaries. During the early 1800s they
                    roamed throughout the Old Northwest Territory and even across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Regional groups functioned independently and signed different treaties. Individual
                    chiefs had varying attitudes, and young warriors were more likely than their elders to support
                    Indian confederation and oppose cooperation with Americans.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Loyalty to the French, British, or Americans constantly changed, usually according to which group
                    exhibited the most power at the time. French influence was strongest during earlier periods when fur
                    trading was the main source of subsistence for the Indians. Intermarriage accounted for Potawatomis
                    or Miamis with French names who were eligible for government annuities and reserves. Many of those
                    with mixed blood had some schooling and attained leadership position; usually they supported the
                    white man's cause and so influenced other tribal members. American farmers were intruders
                    and often squatters on Indian lands; therefore, most of the tribesmen were happy to get guns,
                    ammunition, whiskey, and other trade goods from the British and were <placeName>

                    Many isolated and organized aggressive acts occurred between the Potawatomis and the Americans. Both

                    influence. After the Treaty of Ghent was ratified in 1815, the Potawatomis reluctantly recognized
                    that Americans controlled the area. By this time the fur trade would no longer support the Indians;
                    thus, they became more and more dependent on government annuities from the <placeName>

            <p>Congress passed laws trying to bring about the civilization and assimilation of the Indians. Some
                    money was appropriated, and hoes, plows, and livestock were sent to the Indian agents. The Quakers
                    developed a program to teach the tribes agricultural methods and tried several times to set up a
                    mission near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. A few chiefs gave passing interest to these experiments, but most of the Indians did
                    not progress past their small gardens. This increased their vulnerability to seeking trade goods on
                    credit and being willing to give up land to pay off their debts. White traders and land-hungry
                    settlers reacted; they especially welcomed the treaty of October 16, 1826, since it not only opened
                    up new sections of land but also made possible a road to get there.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Individuals in the whole area knew of the impending treaty for months. James Barbour of the
                    Department of War officially notified the commissioners of their appointment on May 24, 1826,<hi rend="sup">13</hi> and from that point on the three received a deluge of letters from men
                    seeking jobs or business opportunities. Some applied for them-selves; others had relatives or
                    political figures recommend them. Sometimes a long list of supporters' names was attached
                    to add weight to the recommendation. The most common reason given for deserving a job or getting a
                    contract was the need for the money, not the applicant's ability to do the work
                        efficiently.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Staff for the treaty-making session were finally selected and supplies contracted for. Colonel
                    William Marshall was chosen secretary. James M. Ray, an Indiana state legislator, was the
                    assist-ant. In a report of the treaty council written in 1884, Ray claimed that Marshall was ill and
                    that he, Ray, actually served as secretary.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Benjamin B. Kercheval

            <p>Approximately two weeks after Cass's opening statement, "Au ba, nau, bee,"
                    one of the Potawatomi chiefs, and "Legro," a Miami chief, both declared that they
                    did not wish to sell any more land. Legro summarized: "You speak to us with deceitful lips,
                    and not from your hearts.… You say the game is going away, and we must follow it; who
                    drove it away … Before you came, the game was plenty … We own there is game
                    there [in the West], but the Great Spirit has made and put men there, who have a right to that game,
                    and it is not ours—."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> The commissionners responded that,
                    unlike the British, Americans did not take land without negotiations. They noted the amount of
                    silver, blankets, and trinkets that the Indians possessed because of the Americans' past
                    benevolence at treaty negotiations and pointed out that the chiefs and wise men knew that
                    "we give you more in annuities and presents, than all your land is
                        worth.—"<hi rend="sup">26</hi> By the following day the Potawatomis had
                    agreed to cede some lands, but only a part of what the commissioners wanted. It was at this point
                    that Indiana's Governor Ray interjected the idea of lands for "a road from <placeName>

            <p>In Article I of the treaty of 1826 the Potawatomis ceded a tenmile-wide strip of land north of an

                    annuity of one hundred dollars for each man, woman, and child. Two thousand dollars were set aside
                    for education "as long as the Congress of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

            <p>Whether these annuities and grants were much or little has been interpreted in different ways by

                    with the red man. By the Mississinewa treaty of 1826 a goodly portion of north-ern Indiana was

                    to be selected. When the treaty was negotiated and signed, no one knew how much land was being ceded

                    </placeName>). The somewhat circuitous route stretched for 102 miles from the river to the lake and
                    avoided the daunting swamps along the Kankakee River. Not unil 1830 did the state legislature, after

            </p>
            <p>According to the treaty of 1826 and the congressional act of March 2, 1827, the state of Indiana was
                    entitled to select one section of land for each mile of road—in the final analysis
                    264-plus sections—proceeds from the sale of which would be used to build the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Road. Years of debate, anxiety, and even some violence centered around the phrase
                    "one section of good land contiguous to the said road, for each mile of the same, and also
                    for each mile of a road from the termination thereof, through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName> river.…" For the Potawatomis to grant lands through populated
                    southern Indiana was, of course, impossible; the sections for miles of the road south of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> would have to be chosen from territory north of the river. Differences of opinion among
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> secretary of war, secretary of treasury, the General Land Office, and the Indians
                    caught the state in the middle in the question of which lands were eligible for selection. Two
                    questions were paramount: 1) must the Indians grant sections for land south of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and 2) if so, must the remaining sections other than those along the route of the road
                    be selected from unceded territory? Early interpretations indicated that the sections would be
                    chosen from territory already acquired in existing treaties, but the federal land office later
                    determined that sections selected for the portion of the road north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> must be contiguous to the route and that other noncontiguous sections must come from
                    land not previously ceded by the Indians.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

                    from their difficulty. "He procured an ox and a great quantity of whisky from the public
                    authorities and invited the tribesmen to a feast, and in the presence of the ensuing barbecue and
                    spree the white man's view was accepted and the work [choosing sections in Indian

            <p>Not only was the language in which Article II was couched open to varying interpretations it was also
                    unrealistic. It is difficult, for example, to imagine the Potawatomi tribe's having an
                    attachment to the American people or the soil of Indiana as such or to believe that a road would
                    benefit them much in their travels. In any event, any value accruing lasted only twelve years until
                    the time of their departure from Indiana in 1838. It is further ironic that part of the

                        Tipton Papers</hi>, wrote that these reserves were "granted to chiefs, half-breeds,
                    fifty-eight Indian scholars, and a few white men with claims against the Indians."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Some of the recipients fit more than one of the categories. George Cicott,
                    although French-Canadian, was considered a chief following his marriage to a Potawatomi. His reserve
                    eventually was laid out as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Joseph Bertrand, Joseph Barron, and William Burnett married sisters and a daughter of
                    Topinbee, a principal chief. All of these, by having this close contact with the Indians, became
                    proficient in the Potawatomi language and served as interpreters. Barron had served as a messenger
                    for William Henry Harrison, and Bertrand established an important trade center at the junction of
                    the <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName> and the Old Sauk Trail across northern Indiana.
                    Louison's mother was a Potawatomi as was Zachariah Cicott's wife. Eliza C.
                    Kercheval was listed as receiving a reserve. She was not identified in the treaty, but it was
                    probably no coincidence that Benjamin B. Kercheval was one of the signers and identified as a
                    subagent. Brothers William and Henry Conner signed the treaty as interpreters and received reserves,
                    as did another brother, James. The Conner family had been raised among the Christian Delawares and
                    had served Indiana, state and territory, in many capacities including negotiations with the Indians.
                    Hyacinthe Lasselle, an Indian trader and the son of a British Indian agent, also received a reserve.

                    that the Indian had received a fair price. This often led to some King Solomon judgments, as when
                    Harriet Isaacs requested that her land be leased to some "industrious prudent man"

                    accepted by the War Department, to establish the academy with the Baptist Board of the General
                    Convention. The treaty in 1825 supplied Johnson's school with six thousand dollars yearly
                    for twenty years. Thomas Henderson was the superintendent of the school, and Johnson handled the
                    finances. Subsequently, the Creeks agreed to appropriate twenty-four thousand dollars to educate
                    some of their children there.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

            <p>Choosing the youths was not an easy task. A rumor was started that the boys would be used as slaves

                    boy refused to go. Several hundred dollars' worth of presents helped induce some parents to

                    farm journals or record books kept by Amos Lemmon between 1902 and 1937. Although most of the pages
                    are filled with notations concerning bovine behavior, careful gleaning yields a sizable harvest of
                    information. Readers can gain insights into work habits, customs, economics, family life, and
                    general conditions in the Hoosier state during the thirty-five years covered by the volumes.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    obtained a license and taught school for a while. If many personal accounts and reminiscences can be
                    believed, teaching in the common schools of that time could be an occupational hazard; but,
                    evidently, Lemmon escaped personal injury within the walls of reading, writing, and arithmetic.

            <p>For twelve years, beginning in 1871, Lemmon was a store clerk at <placeName>

                    town where he worked, and they set up housekeeping in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. On one Sun-day afternoon in 1882 Amos left the house for a time. Caddie was washing
                    the dirty dishes from the noon meal. When he returned, his wife had disappeared. The body was
                    eventually found in the cistern that was beneath a kitchen pantry. Evidently Caddie in-tended to
                    hang the wet dishcloths in the pantry to dry; but the flooring over the cistern gave way, and the
                    waters took her life.</p>
            <p>By the next year, 1883, Lemmon had returned to Corydon in <placeName>

                    employment is usually necessary. A brother, D. F. Lemmon, offered Amos the position of deputy clerk

                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>

                    practicing politics, attending lodge meetings, and going to church services, Lemmon was also
                    acquiring a second wife, plus a farm that was located two-and-one-half miles southeast of Corydon.</p>
            <p>In fact, Lemmon had not been back in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName> very long after Caddie's death before he realized that he needed another
                    helpmate. A party at New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> provided the romantic back-drop and the right woman. Upon seeing "a small
                    lovely red-haired lady," Medora (Dora) Sonner, and being smitten by Cupid's arrow,
                    Lemmon reportedly said that he was going to marry her. The matrimonial knot was tied on June 15,
                    1884. She was twenty-one (b. 1863; d. 1951), and he was approaching thirty-four. A newspaper source
                    states that by 1897 three children had been born to this union; however, two only were living at
                    that time—John Hardin (b. 1889; d. 1975) and <placeName>

                    </placeName> Lemmon Vogt (b. 1888; d. 1973).<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The move to the farm occurred on
                    April 11, 1904. Amos continued his duties at the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Courthouse and, each morning, left a lengthy list of chores for his wife to do. She had
                    to milk six to ten cows; drive them to pasture; take care of the calves, dogs, and cats; watch the
                    children; and manage a multitude of household tasks. It is no wonder that Dora, being constantly
                    overworked, lost her patience. On one occasion, having had her fill of daily back-breaking work,
                    Dora lashed out with a barnyard language that stopped her petrified husband in his tracks.
                    Apparently, he had never dreamed that his diminutive Dora posessed a smidgen of such ribald
                    assertiveness. The farm record books do not reveal whether Lemmon ever changed his domineering
                    demeanor and attitude to-ward his wife. Generally, men of that time did not.</p>
            <p>The farm records do reveal some interesting expenditures for shoes and clothing. In 1902 Amos spent
                    770 for a new dress for his wife, 450 to get Hardin's shoes half-soled, 550 for mending <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>'s shoes, and $3.00 for a new pair of shoes for himself. In 1905
                    Hardin got a new suit and hat that cost $6.00, while <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>'s new dress and trimmings for it came to $4.35. During these early
                    years items purchased from the grocery store included sugar, salt, black pepper, salmon, oysters,
                    buttermilk, bran, meal, flour, rice, meat, raisins, oranges, crackers, maple molasses, and coffee.
                    Matches and "coal oil" (kerosene) were bought to start the fires in the stoves and
                    to light the kerosene lamps. How much talent <placeName>

                    each. If Dora paid for the lessons out of the egg money, about ten dozen eggs were needed for one
                    lesson. Hoosier farm families in 1905 were getting 12c to 150 a dozen for eggs. They received 17c to
                    200 for a pound of butter and 80 a pound for hens. Dora sold one lot of pre-serves and jelly for
                    which she received 75c.</p>

            <p>For pasture and hay the Lemmons spread lime and sowed timothy, bluegrass, sudan grass, and alfalfa;
                    thus, they "cut alfalfa," "took in hay," "put up 4 tons
                    of straw," and "shredded fodder" for their livestock, which included
                    cattle, sheep, and hogs. Of course, a team of horses was standard for the early part of the
                    twentieth century. Obviously, much grain and roughage was grown on the farm; nevertheless, some
                    supplements for the livestock and poultry had to be purchased. Those supplements included chicken
                    feed, laying mash, oyster shells (for chickens), and "feed and salt for animals."
                    Some of those well-fed barnyard creatures were selected for the Lemmons' table because the
                    journals tell about the butchering of pigs, hogs, and cattle.</p>
            <p>The pages of the journals are filled with the events and activities associated with the farm animals.

                    "set hen, in, Toilet." Josephine had kittens. On February 9, 1935, Lemmon
                    "altered Pigs" (the polite way of saying "castrated"). Princess
                    "dropped" heifer calf by Stockwell. Pride was bred to Dempsey, who had a ring put

                    </placeName> Maid, Flossie, and Lady Lee. These cows, and all of the others, were kept for milk
                    production and breeding: "Fern in heat, not bred, would not stand." The bulls were
                    called upon not only to service the cows on Lemmon's farm but also all those that the
                    neighbors brought in. Some of their names—Ruler, Senator, Prince, Victor, Don, Bud,
                    Socks, and Lad—possibly echoed a modicum of their male proficiency.</p>
            <p>In addition to the daily and seasonal tasks the work on a farm goes on and on. General maintenance
                    and gradual improvements are all a part of rural life. Lemmon's record books mention this
                    type of activity. For instance, the walls of the cistern were given a coat of cement to prevent them
                    from leaking; a roof on the wood-house was finished; an addition to the barn was constructed; and a
                    pond was dug in the barn lot.</p>
            <p>Because the elements played such a vital role in agrarian prosperity or despair, every farmer kept an
                    eye on the weather. Lemmon <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-083-3-066"/> was no exception. In August, 1911,
                    he noted, "Rains came after a long dry spell." Other pithy comments about the
                    weather reveal that the farm record keeper at various times had to stop threshing because of rain,
                    saw the season's first frost, experienced the "greatest snow for years,"
                    and shivered in twenty-two-below-zero temperatures. All newspapers of the period printed much
                    information about the bitter winter of 1917–1918. Lemmon penned a succinct description,
                    "Coldest weather ever known by any person living," and the freezing temperatures
                    mandated his cutting more wood to keep the stoves burning full blast.</p>
            <p>Visiting with friends, relatives, and neighbors was an important feature of rural life in the early
                    1900s. Lemmon's notation for August 13, 1905, catalogs the number of visitors at the
                    family's home, and on Amos's birthday in 1920 twenty people came to the farm.
                    Hardin's and Georgia's visits home were events to be re-corded in the journals.
                    For example, Hardin came from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> at Christmas in 1925 and gave his parents a radio. Sunday basket dinners at the church
                    or local meeting grounds were enjoyable occasions. And June 15, 1934, had to be a red-letter day. It
                    was Dora's and Amos's golden wedding anniversary.</p>
            <p>Local, national, and world news are all reflected in the pages of the three journals. Neighbors and
                    other Harrison Countians are mentioned—especially when they died, were shot accidentally,
                    committed suicide, had a stroke, or were killed by a train. Events of the time influenced the lives
                    of the Lemmons. Hardin entered the army in December, 1917, during World War I and returned
                    "at 2 o'clock a.m." on September 14, 1919. Amos bought Liberty Bonds and
                    heard rumors that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> kaiser had abdicated. When peace was declared on November 11, 1918, Lemmon was able to
                    write, "4:30 a.m. received telephone [message] of Peace Terms signed at 1:30 a.m."</p>
            <p>The closing of banks ("only 5% available at Corydon Banks"), President
                    Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Banking Holiday, and the conditions of the economy concerned everybody
                    during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Lemmon's account books illustrate some of the
                    harsh realities. Eggs were 8c a dozen, butter was 11c a pound, and "top" hogs
                    brought just 3c a pound. This was a great contrast to the high prices of the World War I era, during
                    which, according to Amos's records, butter rose to 50c a pound and eggs were 61c a dozen.</p>
            <p>Mundane prices and national events, however, do not take precedence over concerns about accidents and
                    poor health. In 1914 Amos mentioned that he fell and broke his left arm. Four years later he penned,
                    "Fell from wagon and broke my hand." By 1923 he was having trouble with his eyes
                    ("Went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> about my eyes"). Someone has written in the margin of the journals that Amos
                    went blind later in life. Lemmon's penmanship—never too good— <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-083-3-067"/> showed steady deterioration. Amos worried about the
                    "flu going around" in 1932 and about his and Dora's being sick during
                    January and February of 1934. Amos Lemmon died on March 12, 1935; Dora in 1951; <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> in 1973; and Hardin in 1975. All are buried in Corydon's Cedar Hill

            <p>Amos, as he wrote his daily entries in his farm journals, probably did not think about preserving a
                    historical record for the years 1902 to 1937. Nevertheless, this was what he did; and, by his so
                    doing, later generations have the opportunity to understand a little better the rural life of his
                    time.</p>

            <p>During the last ten years publishers have disseminated a rash of illustrated history books containing
                    scores of photographs combined with a general history of the community or area being documented. The
                    primary purpose of these efforts is to sell nostalgia, not necessarily to provide a scholarly
                    historical analysis. <hi rend="i">Magic <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the 1920s, is not just another picture book, however. It is a serious
                    attempt by Dwight W. Hoover to use photographs in the same way that historians have utilized more
                    traditional original materials.</p>
            <p>More specifically, Hoover is attempting to use the recently salvaged collection of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> photographs acquired by the Bracken Library at Ball State University and taken by
                    photographer W. Arthur Swift either to confirm or refute the series of generalizations about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> made by Robert and Helen Lynd in their classic book <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi>. For example, the Lynds contended that by the 1920s <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> had become completely integrated with the national economy, thus losing its character
                    as a "county seat town" that served as the hub of a local distribution network.
                    According to Hoover, however, the visual evidence indicates that at least in the area of food
                    production <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> was still independent from the national economy. Another interesting insight garnered
                    from the Swift photographs concerns the role of women. Statistical evidence suggests that by the
                    decade of the 1920s more and more women were leaving the home for jobs in industry. Photographic
                    evidence reveals that, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> at least, they appeared to be taking their traditional roles with them by working in
                    kitchens, bakeries, cleaning establishments, and similar businesses.</p>
            <p>Hoover's conclusions from his survey of the Swift collection are incisive and based on a
                    healthy respect for the things that photo-graphs cannot show. He quite rightly notes that Swift, as
                    a commercial photographer, only took photographs that people commissioned him to take. Consequently, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s lower classes, particularly its black citizens, are mostly invisible. On the
                    other hand, he concludes that few interior photographs of factories were taken because there was
                    little demand for them when it is more <pb n="[279]" id="VAA4025-083-3-069"/>

                    would be better organized if the photographs were numbered so that they could be coordinated with

            <p>The Indiana State University Folklore Archives collection, be-gun in 1967, has become a major
                    resource for the study of the survival, and the scope, of oral traditions in Indiana. In this volume
                    Ronald L. Baker has drawn heavily on the collection's tape recordings and transcripts to
                    explore Hoosier humor, offering a selection of over 350 tales and jokes that attest to the continued
                    appeal of humor in folk studies.</p>
            <p>A few of the examples reflect the rural spirit that many readers probably associate with the folk
                    tradition, including Rufe, the man who was such a liar that his friends had to call his hogs. The
                    vast majority of the items, however, are products of an urban world. Grouped in twenty-three
                    sections covering everything from shaggy dogs to schoolteachers, the tales concentrate upon such
                    staples as religion, sex, and ethnicity. Baker's examples show how often humor is still
                    used to explore taboos or to define one's group against outsiders. Ethnic remarks directed
                    toward Jews, blacks, Irish, Poles, and especially Kentuckians are almost a third of the entries.
                    Frequently crude, and occasionally cruel, these verbatim records stand in sharp contrast to the more
                    literary reeditings found in many earlier collections—a point brought sharply home by the
                    inclusion of thirty examples from the materials assembled fifty years ago by the Works Progress
                    Administration (WPA). A majority of entries date from the years between 1968 and 1972 and
                    occasionally include specific references to events and personalities of that time.</p>
            <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-083-3-071"/>
            <p>Baker's introduction gives a useful summary of the current de-bates about the proper form of
                    folklore studies. It offers an especially good discussion of the role of context and presentation
                    for folk tellers and thus suggests that popular published works, like Jokelore, may themselves soon
                    be supplanted by audiovisual collections. All of the items in the volume were collected from Indiana
                    residents, but relatively few entries are set in recognizable Hoosier locations or are, apart from
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> jokes, concerned with distinctive Hoosier traits. The state's special passions
                    for sports and politics receive very little attention. The book is instead a celebration of
                    Indiana's participation in national and international traditions of humor as well as an
                    earthy introduction to modern Indiana folkways.</p>

                    </placeName>'s meat-packing industry. Exposing unsafe and unsanitary working conditions, it
                    contributed to the climate of opinion that demanded passage of federal meat inspection laws. One
                    would expect a book on Packingtown to address the is-sues raised by Sinclair's novel. This
                    is not, however, the purpose of Louise Carroll Wade's book. Its focus is on how Lake
                    Township, located south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and west of Hyde Park, was transformed between 1865, when the Union Stockyards was
                    constructed, and 1888, when it was annexed by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>While <hi rend="i">

                    trade and its connection to the meat-packing industry, Wade's depiction of packingtown
                    barons as hard-working, civic-minded industrial statesmen seems overly flattering.
                    "Creative, productive labor, not the acquisition of dollars, was their goal and their
                    measurement of their own success," she claims (p. 220). On the other hand, labor leaders
                    come off, for the most part, as myopic, while rural critics are disparaged as "jealous
                    hayseeds" (p. 92). Claiming that industry leaders were concerned about prevention of
                    cruelty to animals, Wade writes, "Livestock crossed the northern plains in greater style
                    than ordinary passengers" (p. 191). In line with the booster slogan that she has chosen for
                    her title, Wade argues that the hundreds of thousands of yearly tourists regarded Packingtown as an
                    eighth wonder of the world.</p>
            <p>It was John Stephen Wright who first predicted that the day would come when no part of the animal
                    would be wasted. While Wade's research is prodigious in showing the tremendous
                    technological <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-083-3-072"/> changes that made this prophecy a reality, there
                    is little examination of how modernization affected labor conditions. Wade notes that workers chafed
                    at the ten-hour day and periodic layoffs and wage cuts; but she claims that, compared to other
                    industrial workers, their earnings and job security were good.</p>
            <p>Wade's central thesis is developed in a section called "Forging a
                    Community." Discussing the neighborhoods, voluntary organizations, and political coalitions
                    that comprised the Packingtown environs, she argues that a variety of ethnic, fraternal, and
                    religious organizations provided the "social anchors" for the township's
                    "wonderful growth." If this assertion is valid, then Wade does not adequately
                    explain why a majority of voters endorsed annexation in the 1888 plebiscite.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Pride do not negate the fact that Wade has produced a first-rate piece of
                    research. Perhaps the best quotation is from a brief section dealing with working conditions for
                    women. <placeName>

                    to know Erminie Wheeler-Voegelin, who was professor of history and ethnohistory at Indiana
                    University. The atlas is dedicated to Dr. Wheeler-Voegelin.</p>
            <p>The atlas spans a period of approximately three centuries from the 1600s to the 1880s and encompasses

                    </placeName>. The history and location of Indian settlement is sketched from pre-historic times
                    through the French, British, and American wars to the end of the nineteenth century. The bulk of the
                    atlas, however, consists of two synchronic sections. In six chapters entitled "Frontier in
                    Transition," which cover the period from 1770 to 1790, and in another six entitled
                    "Indian Villages," which focus on the 1830s, the organization proceeds not
                    chronologically but geographically from East to West. The chapters, however, are more than just an
                    enumeration of settlements in the last half of the eighteenth century or of the locations of Indian
                    settlements in <placeName>

                    </placeName> or Indiana in the 1830s. The text provides an account of the events that led a
                    particular tribe to locate in a particular place. Finally, there are topical chapters that serve to
                    define the limits of settlement or population growth. These embrace such subjects as natural
                    vegetation circa 1600, subsistence patterns, and epidemics. Each chapter contains at least one map
                    correlated with the text of the chapter.</p>
            <p>Although specialists may quibble over the location of a particular village or the dates that it was
                    inhabited, the atlas is a valuable and long-needed resource. The text is clear and concise and draws
                    upon an extensive bibliography. The thirty-six color maps, by Miklos Pinther, are easy to read and
                    visually attractive. Sepia-tone pictures drawn from the works of Henry R. Schoolcraft and others
                    enhance the text. In all, the atlas is both valuable and elegant and promises to be useful both to
                    scholars and others interested in the history and Indians of the Old Northwest.</p>

            <p>Donald B. Marti has undertaken the unenviable task of selecting supposedly significant and
                    representative agricultural fairs for this modest-sized directory. Although there are several
                    thousand fairs and festivals held each year in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, the author has chosen only 205 of them for inclusion in this volume. Each entry
                    contains succinct data (from one paragraph to two pages in length) covering such items as the
                    fair's brief history, location, attendance, <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-083-3-077"/> types of
                    displays, sponsorship, and unique characteristics, as well as a brief bibliography.</p>
            <p>The value of this work is enhanced by a scholarly introductory essay (with footnotes) that presents a
                    brief but illuminating history of agricultural fairs in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. They came to this country from Europe, but nowhere in the world have they become more
                    popular than in America. Every state in the union has an annual agricultural fair of some kind. For
                    many contemporary city people the state, county, or privately sponsored agricultural fair (say by
                    the 4-H clubs or Future Farmers of America) is often the only contact they have with a rural
                    institution that symbolizes a link with past farm heritage.</p>
            <p>Some interesting facts emerge from this selective but well-written directory. The largest state fair
                    (in terms of attendance) is that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, and the largest county fair is the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Los Angeles County</region>
                    </placeName> Fair at Pomona. The Indiana State Fair is the fifth largest in the nation. Its present
                    location in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was established in 1892. In the Great Depression of the 1930s the Works Progress
                    Administration erected some of the buildings on the fairgrounds. The WPA was also responsible for
                    the construction of similar permanent buildings in other states. If the number of entries in
                    Marti's directory is proportional to actual incidence, the geographical area most heavily

            <p>Michael Kammen's book is a survey of American perceptions and understanding of the
                    Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> over the past two hundred years. The author reviews attitudes toward the document held
                    by generations of politicians, judges, educators, foreign observers, and the American public. He
                    concludes that the Constitution has endured successfully in spite of a substantial <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-083-3-078"/> amount of ignorance, misunderstanding, and lack of concern. Public
                    perceptions of the document have been shaped not by thorough study but by often inadequate teaching
                    in the schools, by periodic celebrations and publicity surrounding the anniversaries of its
                    drafting, and, particularly in the twentieth century, by the periodic eruption of controversy over
                    constitutional issues.</p>
            <p>The Constitution did not become important as a national symbol until about 1860. Prior to that time
                    general lack of knowledge about the document was not alleviated by the few school textbooks of the
                    day. The proceedings of the Constitutional Convention were not published for several decades, and
                    potential experts such as James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who could have clarified and explained the document's contents, chose not to
                    do so. Supreme Court judges, with few exceptions, did not see themselves as interpreters for public
                    edification. Even the celebration planned for the Constitution's fiftieth anniversary in
                    1837 was blighted by a severe depression.</p>
            <p>The Constitution received widespread attention in the 1860s as a basis for many of the issues debated
                    during the Civil War and as a result of amendments proposed during Reconstruction. The celebration
                    of the document's centennial in 1887, though marred by poor planning and insufficient
                    funding, served to arouse a certain amount of interest that carried on into the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>The vigorous debates of the Progressive Era and the simultaneous publication of important books on
                    constitutional topics by scholars such as Charles <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> and Charles A. Beard gave impetus to calls in the 1920s for better public education
                    about the Constitution. Periodic celebration of September 17 as Constitution Day, the publication of
                    a few handbooks on the Constitution, and emphasis on questioning applicants for citizenship about
                    their understanding of the document were the chief results. General public interest in some aspects
                    of the Constitution was sparked by the court-packing controversy of 1937, but many scholars
                    ex-pressed concern that the general public tended to equate the Constitution with the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p>The role of the Constitution in the resolution of controversial issues in recent times does not seem
                    to have improved general knowledge about the document. A variety of polls have indicated widespread
                    ignorance concerning the provisions of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, a situation Kammen
                    feels is likely to continue. He sees some potential for the media, especially television, to aid in
                    improving the state of affairs through carefully prepared documentaries and interviews and through
                    television coverage of Supreme Court proceedings.</p>
            <p>The title, <hi rend="i">A Machine That Would Go of Itself</hi>, is taken from a frequently quoted
                    comment made by James Russell <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the 1880s. Kammen uses it to underscore his opinion that the Constitution is not
                    self-executing but needs widespread study and understanding. <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-083-3-079"/>
                    Intended for a lay audience, his book is informative, entertaining, and at times witty. Liberally
                    sprinkled with quotations and references to published materials concerning the Constitution, this
                    work awakens the reader to the amazing durability and flexibility of this seminal document and to
                    the importance of every American's having a solid acquaintance with it.</p>

                    </placeName> in the last half of the nineteenth century. Often aligning American interests with
                    those of the western colonial powers, the imperialists asserted the primacy of material concerns.
                    Considering it important to share the uniqueness of American political values with others, idealists
                    sought to protect Chinese independence and self-determination. Imperialism and idealism
                    "formed a potent prescription for the expansion of American influence in the
                    world" (p. 3).</p>
            <p>Among those who would expand American influence in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>, Anderson maintains, were the eight men who represented the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in Peking from 1861 to 1898. They are the subjects of this study. In six chapters the
                    author analyzes the envoys' thoughts and actions, from Anson Burlingame, an idealist and
                    "self-proclaimed harmonizer of the Eastern and Western civilizations" (p. 16) who
                    emphasized reconciliation and cooperation, to Charles Denby, a former Indiana state legislator who
                    "usually, although not consistently" (p. 144), took the imperialist position.
                    Anderson characterizes American policy in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> as inconsistent and ambiguous. Dualisms prevailed: moralism and materialism, liberalism
                    and conservatism, altruism and self-interest, interventionism and isolationism. Almost every
                    minister had a different opinion on what to emphasize. Some held firm to either imperialism or
                    idealism; others vacillated. In an epilogue Anderson argues that John Hay's famous open
                    door notes integrated the conflicting policies, ending decades of ambivalence. The <placeName>

                    part of America's cultural identity. The roots of this paradox reach back to the
                    experiences of the early European colonists in their simultaneous quest for material survival and
                    political self-determination. The nineteenth century envoys to <placeName>

                    the envoys and the historical past and between the envoys and State Department officialdom are thin.
                    Events, moreover, are not viewed from the perspective of the Chinese or from that of the European

            <p>This study considers the neglected subject of campaign styles; and, by linking the topic with recent
                    findings on voter turnout, Michael E. McGerr attempts to explain how and why the political system
                    changed between the 1860s and the 1930s. The issues are important, and the book is often insightful.
                    Unfortunately, it is also seriously flawed on conceptual and factual grounds.</p>
            <p>The author nicely describes the political world of the 1860s and 1870s: the partisanship of voters
                    and newspapers and the high level of participation in the clubs and parades that typified the
                    "spectacular" campaign style. Mugwumps challenged this system, unsuccessfully at
                    first, but their influence and example grew during the 1880s. In 1892 both parties adopted an
                    "educational" campaign style-one that included polls, pamphlets, and better
                    organization. McGerr argues that this kind of campaigning bored voters; hence, in 1896 the parties
                    began shifting to an "advertised" campaign: packaging candidates, using posters
                    and slogans, emphasizing the candidate's personality, and centralizing control in the
                    national party headquarters. Newspapers were similarly trans-formed, as the old partisan style was
                    increasingly replaced by in-dependent or sensational journalism. McGerr concludes with a useful
                    discussion of the reaction to low voter turnout during the 1920s.</p>
            <p>Although McGerr correctly assesses the beginning and end phases of this transformation in campaign
                    styles, he fails to show where and when it took place. The changing balance between local, state,
                    and national control of campaigns is poorly described and never proven. The analysis of local
                    campaigns relies excessively on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Haven</settlement>
                    </placeName>—reflecting an overdependence on newspapers from those cities. Using
                    contemporary state party histories (and existing historical studies) would have corrected this
                    problem and the neglect of important midwestern states. McGerr could have learned, for example, that
                    serious polling and a state organization of clubs did not originate on the east coast in the
                    mid-1880s but existed in Indiana in 1880. Such sources would also have provided data for his
                    essentially unverified claims about the nature of campaigns after 1900, which assertions are untrue
                    for Indiana and probably for elsewhere as well.</p>
            <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-083-3-082"/>
            <p>Most important, the explanation of how and why the transformation occurred is too simple and ignores
                    the political implications of fundamental socioeconomic development in this era. McGerr notes the
                    impact of some specific changes but misses the consequences of broader patterns-such as the way
                    urbanization and improvements in transportation destroyed the necessity and rationale for local
                    campaigns. He is correct that lower turnout did not occur because the wealthy conspired, but he
                    neglects the broader truth that many people feared and wished to reduce the political influence of
                    ethnic and racial minorities and the lower class. In addition, McGerr's notion that
                    partisanship shaped political style and participation is incomplete. Partisanship was itself shaped
                    by socioeconomic and cultural forces and by factors like party organization, which also directly
                    influenced political style and participation.</p>

            <p>The social changes wrought by industrialization and urbanization in the late nineteenth century,
                    Richard Jules Oestreicher states, produced within the working class "intertwining
                    tendencies toward class solidarity and fragmentation" (p. xviii). Offering <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a case study, Oestreicher examines on one hand the emergence in that city of a
                    "subculture of opposition" that provided the basis for expressions of
                    working-class unity and on the other hand the ethnic and occupational differences that undermined
                    class consciousness and collective action. Oestreicher's laudable goal is to link the
                    familiar aspects of Gilded Age labor history—the rise of the American Federation of Labor
                    and the Knights of Labor and the 1886 strikes for the eight-hour day—to the social
                    history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s workers. In so doing he revises standard interpretations of the labor
                    movement in the 1880s and offers a new perspective on working-class behavior and consciousness in
                    late nineteenth century America.</p>
            <p>The sources of fragmentation within the urban working class were manifold. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s varied industrial economy accounted for diverse occupational experiences.
                    Large factories increased in number, but small shops did not disappear; even within an industry the
                    scale and organization of production varied. There were both contrasts between skilled and unskilled
                    workers as well as variations in the wages and working conditions within the skilled ranks. <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-083-3-083"/> Ethnic differences further divided the working class. Not only
                    did each nationality occupy a different position within the local economy but the internal strength
                    of each of the different ethnic communities also made class unity seem an impossible goal.
                    Oestreicher, however, is unwilling to accept the class versus ethnicity approach to American labor
                    history. Turning to the specific class character of the ethnic communities, Oestreicher emphasizes
                    their shared dependence on wages and their fundamental insecurity due to frequent layoffs, illness
                    or accident, and arbitrary discipline. He also notes the shared commitment to mutualism, solidarity,
                    and egalitarian politics, values that conflicted with middle-class ideas of competition,
                    individualism, and personal success.</p>
            <p>These bonds were resources for those who tried in the 1880s to build a subculture of opposition by
                    providing the institutions or vehicles necessary for the assertion of working-class consciousness
                    and mobilization for class action. Evidenced by a strong labor press, increased numbers of
                    educational forums and social events, and a vigorous Independent Labor party, this subculture was
                    most overtly manifested in the expansion of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> labor movement. What fueled this expansion was the rise of the Knights of Labor. The
                    order's rituals of fraternalism, centralized structure, spirit of solidarity, and stimulus
                    toward industrial organization not only recruited more <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> workers into the ranks of organized labor but generated a spirit that could transcend
                    class fragmentation. The greatest moments for the subculture occurred in 1886 when thou-sands of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> workers struck for the eight-hour day, marched in a Labor Day demonstration, and voted
                    for Independent Labor party candidates. Oestreicher attributes the loss of solidarity and absence of
                    collective action after 1886 to factionalism among the leaders of the various labor organizations.
                    The sudden increases in membership intensified conflicts that preoccupied the organizations just
                    when they needed to serve as vehicles for discussion, co-operation, and mobilization. The new
                    recruits faded away and the movement dissolved. The craft unions survived; but the Knights, the
                    group most representative of the city's workers, did not, and neither did the subculture of
                    opposition.</p>
            <p>Oestreicher's analysis of the rise and fall of the Knights in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> challenges the conventional view that the order represented middle-class reformism
                    whereas the AFL's business union-ism more accurately expressed the perspective of the
                    working class. Both organizations, Oestreicher shows, had internal divisions as serious as those
                    between them; both suffered the consequences in terms of collective bargaining and membership. By
                    rooting the history of the labor movement in the experience of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s working people, Oestreicher also suggests the greater power of the Knights
                    to mobilize class-conscious activism. The book is most successful as a careful, well-researched, and
                    thoughtful study of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> labor <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-083-3-084"/> movement in the last decades of the
                    nineteenth century. Al-though Oestreicher is careful to qualify his claims, he tends either to
                    accept uncritically the observations of contemporary labor activists or offers scant evidence for
                    his own assertions about the attitudes and behavior of the mass of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s workers and their families. These problems, however, do not diminish the
                    importance of the questions asked or the significance of the arguments advanced in this major
                    contribution to late nineteenth century labor history.</p>

            <p>"The Hill," an Italian neighborhood on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s southwest side, has been well served by Gary Ross Mormino, who is part of
                    the movement in Italian-American immigrant research that believes another understanding of
                    immigration results from studying the newcomers in settings away from the major centers of
                    settlement. The numbers of immigrants and the kind of employment they find affect their response to
                    the dominant group, the longevity of their ethnic consciousness, and their attitudes toward
                    education and social mobility.</p>
            <p>As described by Mormino, the Hill differs from Indiana's Italian communities and others
                    already studied. Ninety percent of its residents today are descendants of the original immigrants.
                    Al-though density has declined and the average age has risen, the vitality of community and
                    religious organizations guarantees the continued existence of the Hill as a cultural enclave.
                    Mormino believes that this stability results from unique historical and geographical factors.
                    Conscious of the push-pull theory of immigration, he visited the Lombard towns from which most of
                    the Hill's immigrants originated. Since many had the same motive (economic improvement) and
                    came from the same district, he concludes that the first reason for the Hill's stability is
                    that its immigrant residents were not uprooted, but transplanted. They then settled in a
                    self-contained area delineated by rivers and factories insulated from downtown <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. All had the goal of home ownership, made possible with savings from hard work in the
                    clay mines and factories supplemented by illegal earnings during Prohibition. Emphasis on sports
                    (Yogi Berra and Joe Garagiola are Hill products) also contributed to community solidarity by
                    reducing tension with the Sicilian minority and making juvenile delinquency unlikely. The
                    neighborhood's close family ties, competent political bosses, and generous parish priests
                    softened the blows of the GY'eat Depression <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-083-3-085"/> and World
                    War II and created an atmosphere that induced descendants of immigrants to remain there.</p>
            <p>Mormino faultlessly summarizes other historians' conclusions, contrasts them with his own in
                    a masterly fashion, and writes in a delightfully clear style. Some minor distractions, however,
                    could have been eliminated if he had had a Catholic reader. For instance, St. Ambrose was not first
                    bishop of Milan (p. 153), and John Cody was never cardinal archbishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. 233).</p>
            <p>In his epilogue the author concludes that "Italian-American history is ultimately local
                    history, the story of how specific individuals from specific old-world villages settled in specific
                    new-world settings" (p. 254). This study is a welcome, major contribution in that
                    direction.</p>

            <p>To the casual historian John J. "Black Jack" Pershing is a name that conjures up
                    the image of an all-powerful, intelligent, strong-willed, humorless, colorless, and perhaps
                    insensitive man who had his brief moment of glory and influence during American involvement in World
                    War I. Perhaps the reader knows a little about Pershing's involvement in <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> before the war, but probably he will not know much else. Donald Smythe has attempted to
                    bring Pershing the man to life in this second volume of a two-volume biography. In this effort the
                    author has done as well as any biographer could.</p>
            <p>Smythe's first and easiest task was to take Pershing out of his World War I vacuum and
                    describe his long life. (He was born in 1860 and lived to see the conclusion of World War II.) In
                    volume I Smythe covers his subject's career through the Punitive Expedition in 1916. The
                    majority of the second volume deals with Pershing's World War I experiences.
                    Pershing's initial popularity among the French people and the war-weary Allied armies faded
                    as it became obvious that he was not going to allow American troops to be used as fillers in British
                    and French units but insisted that an American army, commanded by Americans, be established. Indeed,
                    Smythe shows that Pershing spent more time arguing this point with his allies that he did fighting
                    the Germans. Only in the last few months of the war did the Americans become a significant force. Of
                    course, it can be argued, as both Pershing and Smythe do, that when the Americans finally got into
                    the fighting, the tide quickly turned.</p>
            <p>Smythe deals with the remaining thirty years of Pershing's life in only seventy pages. The
                    general's abortive semi-attempt at the presidency in 1920, his tenure as chief of staff,
                    his Pulitzer-Prize-winning <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-083-3-086"/> memoirs, and his years in retirement
                    receive short shrift. Perhaps this is appropriate. Pershing's hour was
                    1917–1918.</p>
            <p>In a second and more difficult task—that of fleshing out the man—Smythe is less
                    successful. The character that is revealed in his book is remarkably close to the stiff, inflexible,
                    humorless character with whom readers are already familiar. In a word, Smythe's Pershing
                    seems to have little depth. In his least successful chapter, "Portrait of
                    Pershing," Smythe claims a sense of humor for the general but is not convincing. By
                    choosing examples that are racist and sexist (pp. 241-42), he has muddied Pershing without
                    explaining him. It is difficult to know whether these stories reflect Pershing's own
                    inclinations or merely show the author's insensitivity to these is-sues. Still, a
                    biographer cannot create a subject, and it may well be that what Pershing revealed to the world was
                    all that there was.</p>
            <p>The author has done an enormous amount of research, which explains why there is a thirteen-year
                    hiatus between the two volumes of the biography. The bibliography runs thirty-three pages and is
                    exhaustive and helpful. The notes, however, are decidedly unmanageable. Not only are they not at the
                    bottom of the page—this reviewer gave up that fight long ago—they are not even
                    in one place. To utilize the notes one must go to the notes in the back, find a code, and from there
                    go to the bibliography and match the code to the appropriate entry. This is a maddening system, and
                    one which no publisher should allow.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the book is, on the whole, a good one. It gives a great deal of information about
                    American involvement in World War I and explains well the pressures that Pershing and other American
                    commanders were under from the Allies as well as the military establishment back home. Gracefully
                    written, it flows easily, with excitement and suspense woven in. It will be invaluable to students
                    of American military history, yet can be enjoyed by more casual readers—as long as they
                    are not interested in the citations.</p>

            <p>I am writing this review during a Fulbright year in Taipei where I often pass a factory that builds
                    and displays two-story statues of liberty. Michael Kammen's history of liberty in American
                    culture from 1640 to the present, a volume growing out of the Merle Curti Lectures of
                    1985–1986, helps me invest this scene with meaning. <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-083-3-087"/>
                    However, Kammen's variety of intellectual history also leaves me seeking alternative
                    approaches.</p>
            <p>Kammen divides the history of liberty in America into three periods. Leading American colonists, like
                    British writers and politicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, most frequently
                    contemplated liberty's tension with authority or conceptually bound liberty with property.
                    After the Revolution both notions of liberty lived on, but Americans in addition considered
                    liberty's relationship to social order. Then, with the promise of "liberty and
                    justice for all" from the 1892 Pledge of Allegiance heralding the future, twentieth-century
                    Americans began to characterize liberty as the broad participation of all citizens in public
                    affairs. Earlier understandings again survived, but jurists and others were increasingly likely to
                    link liberty and social justice. Today's conservatives might frown, taking liberty to be
                    primarily a negative notion restricting governmental power. Nevertheless, Kammen not only forcefully
                    demonstrates the conceptual linkage of liberty and positive governmental enhancement of rights in
                    midcentury America but also ransacks earlier writings and speeches for similar thinking.</p>
            <p>Beyond its designated subject matter, <hi rend="i">Spheres of Liberty</hi> is a self-conscious
                    exercise in concept-based intellectual history. Kam-men is a traditionalist. He appreciates the
                    fundamental connections of thought and language, but his work resembles more the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>

                    Foucault's flourishes. The author includes paintings and artifacts featuring eagles or Lady
                    Liberty herself and appends brief notes on American iconography; but, really, he lacks enthusiasm
                    for material, folk, or popular culture. A concept such as liberty in his opinion cannot be neatly
                    packaged, and Kammen prefers contemplating sustained and sophisticated treatments of the concept
                    instead of popular slogans, cliches, or rhetoric. His preference is, for the most part, apt. The
                    concept has an amazing diachronic reach, and its synchronic variations are fascinating. In different
                    eras the concept of liberty merges and contrasts with many other concepts.</p>
            <p>Yet, as I stand before a giant statue on a Taipei street, I would like additional ways to critique
                    liberty in American culture. Undeniably, students and scholars can learn much about a
                    people's values and priorities by considering articulate treatments of a key concept over
                    time. But affecting and altering the nation's directions also requires confronting the
                    common expressions, raw ideology, and plaster behemoths that tower over us.</p>

            <p>This book contains articles by six different authors—Pierce F. Lewis, Dell Upton, Kenneth
                    L. Ames, Carroll W. Pursell, Jr., Simon J. Bronner, and Thomas J. Schlereth—on subjects
                    ranging from architecture to technology. The editor notes that the "book's chief
                    concern is to assess the major material cultural scholarship of the past two decades" (p.
                    197). In so doing this volume recognizes the "interrelation between the study of material
                    culture and American studies" (p. x).</p>
            <p>The essays are wide ranging. Lewis, in discussing writings on the "American
                    Landscape," raises interesting and valid questions such as why "Americans [are]
                    embarrassingly deprived in their geographic education" (p. 49). In fact, this embarrassment
                    seems to be a continuing problem of serious dimensions in education. Ames writes about "The
                    Stuff of Everyday Life" and offers an excellent overview of the studies in decorative arts
                    and furniture. He notes, "Students of objects still do not really understand collecting,
                    the behavior that is the eternal parent of this field" (p. 103). This lack of understanding
                    is, in fact, a problem that pervades the entire field of material culture study; especially in
                    academia. Academics by and large do not understand how to use museum objects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Material Culture fulfills</hi> its basic purpose by providing useful bibliographies both
                    in general and specifically with each article. Having done this, it is perhaps unfair to expect any
                    new ideas in the book. There are very few.</p>
            <p>The problems with the volume are several. There is a distinct impression conveyed that the study of
                    material culture has been invented in the academic field. In fact, the best museums have been doing
                    this kind of study for years, a fact that gets short shrift. It is not surprising, then, that only
                    one of the writers, Ames, is even associated with a museum. None of the rest of the contributors are
                    museum professionals or seem to have any museum experience. This does not prevent Schlereth from
                    raising museum questions but not following through on them. He writes, for example, "Museum
                    collections of the past have been criticized as being unrepresentative" (p. xi). Where is
                    this supposed to lead? What point is he making? Schlereth also refers to studies extending
                    "from a traditional art-history approach to social history perspective" (p. x).
                    Such a statement implies to this reviewer that traditional history museums have little or no roll in
                    these studies. Schlereth should be familiar with Ordinary People and Everyday Life, edited by James
                    B. Gardener and George Rollie Adams (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1983), but the work is not cited. Readers interested in the subject of material
                    culture would do well to begin with that volume and reserve this one for additional bibliographic
                    needs.</p>

                    used government records that provide a base for searching genealogical data. The book is divided
                    into seven parts: Naturalizations Filed 1832–1903; Naturalizations Filed
                    1904–1906; Delinquent Tax Returns for 1842; Probate Court Re-cord A 1822–1832;
                    Hack Licenses 1865–1871. The entire book is a useful compendium. The first section in
                    particular is fascinating. A sample entry (p. 8a) reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
