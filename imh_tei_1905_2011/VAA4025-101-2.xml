                <p>Although Will H. Hays's name remains synonymous with movie censorship, he should be remembered as one
                    of his generation's successful practitioners of public relations, the man who ushered motion
                    pictures into respectability in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Hays was an apostle of progress, an optimistic advocate of new media, and a skilled
                    user of publicity. He believed in the "absolutely limitless" power of movies to influence national
                    life, public taste and conduct, and the dreams of the young-indeed, no more potent means existed "to
                    influence the thought of the nation towards common ideals." The medium, he predicted, would change
                    the future.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                <p>The philosopher Mortimer Adler once described Hays as "a fascinating mixture of political astuteness
                    and naivete about the arts, the sciences, and philosophy." It is one of the paradoxes of Hays's
                    career that he came to symbolize the traditional values of small-town America while promoting a
                    modern means of communication that not only eroded those values, but seemed <list type="footnotes">

                    balance tradition and modernity in his work, Hays confronted a dilemma not unlike that faced by
                    other Hoosier political and cultural leaders during the early twentieth century. Residents of
                    Indiana (and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>) were rapidly adopting modern ways of living, while many tried to cling to traditional
                    social and political values. In ushering the movies into this mainstream culture, Hays benefited
                    from his image as a parochial prude, and may have encouraged this perception. But in his enthusiasm
                    for cinema, and by his linking entertainment technologies to capitalism, Hays became modernity's
                        champion.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In the wake of a sensational sex scandal, Hollywood studio heads created the Motion Picture Producers
                    and Distributors of America (MPPDA) and asked Hays to become its first president in 1921. They
                    charged him with running Hollywood's business affairs and official communications, and convincing a
                    skeptical public that the industry could regulate itself. The MPPDA soon became known simply as the
                    Hays Office, and Hays remained its president until 1945. Under Hays's leadership, the MPPDA adopted
                    a twofold strategy. Hays is most remembered, of course, for the Production Code, the legendary rules
                    of censorship that tried to bind movies to the Ten Commandments by limiting any treatment of sexual,
                    social, or political issues; eliminating scenes of violence and crime; and forbidding offensive
                    language. Hollywood adopted the Code in 1930, more than eight years after Hays took the reins of the
                    MPPDA, and only after circumstances converged to force the hand of Hays and the studio heads.
                    Furthermore, enforcement of the Code did not come until 1934, after the Hays Office created the
                    Production Code Administration (PCA) and after Roman Catholics formed the Legion of Decency.</p>
                <p>Less known, but no less significant for American culture, the Hays Office mounted a long-term public
                    relations offensive. Rapidly becoming an "unseen power" in American society, many considered public
                    relations the "newly grown bastard of journalism," the invention of newspapermen and press agents.
                    Public relations, according to one of its architects, involved the "engineering of consent" to
                    present the best cases possible for clients and to mold-if need be even manipulate-public opinion.
                    Often the most effective public relations went unobserved behind the scenes, thereby blurring <list

                    established a public relations network that linked numerous American communities and exploited
                    virtually all mass media. Works that have treated Hays, the MPPDA, and public relations have
                    generally discussed the movie industry's cultivation of various parent, civic, and religious
                        organizations.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> They have not noted Hays's advocacy of new media, his effort
                    to create a public relations network that used local businesses, community leaders, and
                    institutions, nor his attempts to discredit the Payne Fund Studies, the first large-scale effort by
                    social scientists to examine the impact that movies had on the young.</p>
                <p>Film studios and the press had conspired long before Hays appeared on the scene, but after World War
                    I, events spun out of control as one scandal after another plagued Hollywood. The immediate problem
                    arose in the 1921 scandal involving Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, a rotund comedian whose popularity at
                    the time was perhaps second only to Charlie Chaplin. Even before the Labor Day scandal that
                    destroyed his career, Arbuckle had been the focus of rumors. In July 1921, newspaper reports
                    appeared describing a dinner that movie moguls had given the comedian more than four years earlier
                    in which prostitutes had been present and alleging that Hollywood magnates had raised $100,000 to
                    keep the matter quiet. All this paled in comparison to events in early September 1921. Arbuckle and
                    some of his Hollywood friends rented rooms at the St. Francis Hotel in <placeName>

                    commonly, Hollywood divorces. When "America's Sweetheart," Mary Pickford, divorced Owen Moore,
                    Nevada's attorney general started proceedings against her. The state's supreme court upheld the
                    divorce in 1922, by which time her marriage to Douglas Fairbanks was more than two years old. Gloria
                    Swanson reportedly planned to divorce her husband just a few months after giving birth to their
                    child. Other stories had Chaplin, also a divorce, cavorting nude with a young actress on Catalina
                    Island. As if these accounts were not enough, a trade journal published an expose on graft in the
                    movie business.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                <p>One other factor, not usually noted, probably helped persuade the studio heads to act. The Bolshevik
                    takeover in Russia created fear that cinema might be used to foment revolution. Before the rise of
                    Hollywood and consolidation of film making during the war, hundreds of films each year had dealt
                    with labor issues and the problems of working people. For some Americans, such topics acquired a

                <p>By the time he came to Hollywood's attention, Hays had risen from being a small-town lawyer to head
                    of the national Republican Party. His fascination with politics had begun in 1896, when he traveled
                    to <placeName>

                    Naturally associating national progress with the Republican Party, he favored prohibition, woman
                    suffrage, and giving citizens ability to take direct action in public affairs. Hays liked Theodore
                    Roosevelt and considered himself "a liaison…between the standpat end of the party and the
                    progressives." It was his ability in 1916, as head of Indiana's Republican Party, to bring together
                    the warring factions of Bull Moose supporters and William Howard Taft conservatives that helped him
                    land his appointment in early 1918 as chairman of the national party. After <placeName>

                    appointing him Postmaster General.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hays innovatively used new media to build consensus and had recognized early the political
                    possibilities of motion pictures and newsreels. As chairman of the Indiana party, he hired a
                    cameraman during the 1916 election to record events and then prevailed upon theater owners around
                    the state to show the films in an effort to increase voter turnout. In May 1917, Governor James P.
                    Goodrich appointed him to head Indiana's State Council of Defense, an agency that worked closely
                    with America's first large-scale government propaganda agency, the Committee on Public Information,
                    to exploit the full range of communication from oratory to newspapers to posters. Recognizing that
                    many Americans were troubled by the unprecedented nature of the Great War, Hays approved films that
                    dealt with such topics as submarine warfare and the Red Cross. He witnessed firsthand how mass media
                    and propaganda could serve national power.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    with Hollywood executives to map strategy, and it was probably at this meeting that producers became
                    aware of Hays's talents.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In his work for the Postal Service, Hays attempted to modernize the nation's communication network.
                    He advanced what were then controversial policies, such as expanding the use of trucks and other
                    motor vehicles to deliver the mail. He tried to consolidate telegraph, telephone, and radio
                    communications into one department, an action that riled bureaucrats. He started a national postal
                    radio system that included fifteen stations to support the country's fledgling air-mail system. He
                    advocated air mail, and more generally air travel, even though he realized the hazards and expenses
                    of flying during the early 1920s. Through it all, he worked to draw the public to his side. It "all
                    added up to public relations," Hays said, and his year in office proved to be a whirlwind of
                    promotional conventions, meetings, and conferences with civic groups, chambers of commerce, women's
                    clubs, and any other groups that might exert influence.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hays's well-cultivated public profile made him a natural candidate to head the new MPPDA. The
                    Hollywood executives, who initially considered Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, concluded that
                    Hays's extensive Republican connections and staunchly pro-business stance gave him the best chance
                    of defeating pending censorship legislation. The predominantly Jewish moguls also calculated that
                    Hays's identification with the Presbyterian Church might also make the movie industry more
                    acceptable to Protestant America. Hollywood power brokers therefore hired their own czar, taking out
                    a $2,000,000 life insurance policy on Hays and paying him over $100,000 annually-eight times his
                    salary as a cabinet member and more than that of the President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. This financial arrangement is noteworthy, and one should never lose sight of the fact
                    that Hays's primary allegiance rested with his employers.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

                <p>In Hollywood Hays advocated new technology in all its forms. He enlisted the movie industry to
                    promote the advantages of air travel. At President Harding's death in August 1923, Hays encouraged

                    Hays thought that both aviation and motion pictures confronted similar problems: they needed to put
                    their own affairs in order, inspire the public imagination, and forge themselves into essential
                    industries by producing what the government and national economy needed.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hays also linked cinema to the growing electrical industry. The spread of electricity, he told Martin

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was his "daily preoccupation." Both the movies and the electrical companies promoted
                    progress and transmitted "the newest in ideas, inventions and art" to cities and villages alike.
                    "Wherever the screen opens the gates of the world to all mankind," Hays said, electrical power would
                    be the "ally, the indispensable friend, of motion pictures."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                <p>Such technological concerns were simply means toward Hays's central mission, which was to convince
                    the public that motion pictures could be a positive force. They possessed educational, moral, and
                    inspirational possibilities, he argued. They could carry the best in music, literature, science, and
                    medicine to nearly everyone, no matter how isolated. If this medium could be harnessed, he reasoned,
                    civilization would rise to new heights. The movies, he told a radio audience early in 1930, would
                    improve living standards everywhere and promote world peace.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                <p>Seeing an important connection between communication and national power, Hays encouraged producers to
                    make films with patriotic themes that extolled Americanism. During World War I, the Warner brothers
                    and other producers had discovered that patriotic films were profitable and that flying the flag
                    brought respectability. Hays found such patriotism to be one of the best ways to transcend criticism
                    of the industry, especially during the late 1930s and early 1940s as international events lurched
                    from one crisis to another. Hays considered his field of operation to consist of more than just the
                    home front: "We are going to sell America to the world," he said, "with American motion
                        pictures."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hays enthusiastically fostered the movies’ potential for advancing business. The film industry itself
                    had seemingly infinite commercial promise, he believed, generating more income in 1922 than all the
                    public utilities <list type="footnotes">

                    salesman"; films were "animated catalogs" that advertised American goods to other countries. For
                    Hays, there was "no more fascinating story in the history of the world than the account of how our
                    American industries have grown, pliably, adaptably, to meet changing conditions." Indeed, the
                    "significance and romance of inventive and industrial progress" translated into "the pure gold of
                    drama." During the Great Depression, Hays, like many American corporate leaders, emphasized the
                    cause of saving capitalism. The belief that cinema could and should promote capitalism proved one of
                    the strongest common denominators uniting Hays with his successors, Eric A.Johnston and Jack
                        Valenti.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                <p>Hays's public relations work in Hollywood must be seen in the context of American business during the
                    1920s and 1930s. In this heyday of public relations, such corporations as AT&amp;T, General
                    Motors, Ford, and General Electric turned to advertising agencies or to publicity experts, such as
                    Bruce Barton, to create an image. Yet Hays held more publicity power at his disposal than any of
                    these corporate giants.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Through his Committee (later Department) on Public
                    Relations, established in 1925, he responded to attacks on the industry, tried to engage citizens in
                    making movies more acceptable, and attempted to make "customers out of critics." Hays assumed that
                    modern media possessed the power to change the way people thought, to implant-at least
                    indirectly-"standards of taste and morals and arts in the public mind." Public taste was malleable,
                    "to a certain degree, plastic," as he told the Rotarians in 1934; it could "be molded into new and
                    better forms." Public relations could convince skeptics that moviemakers were good citizens,
                    well-intentioned, and capable of self-regulation. Hays believed that such a campaign offered the
                    best and perhaps the only realistic way to prevent government intervention.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    groups, civic associations, and citizens who wished to comment on films. When dealing with critics,
                    he followed his father's advice to get "so close to the mule he can't kick you.<hi rend="sup"
                    >22</hi>
                </p>
                <p>One way to approach the mule came through the press. Hays regularly kept tabs on news stories and
                    editorials about Hollywood, assuming that they reflected public sentiment and could also modify
                    opinion. He cultivated reporters and editorial writers, and considered their support essential. "My
                    contacts with newspapermen have been so many and so close that it would be impossible for me to
                    overrate their influence," he wrote. "How often have I seen editorials arouse, shape, and
                    consolidate public opinion."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> In exchange for favorable press coverage, the
                    MPPDA pressured studios to produce films that portrayed journalists and advertisers favorably. This
                    policy eventually extended to other professions and institutions of authority as well-judges, law
                    enforcement officers, businessmen, religious leaders, and the like.</p>
                <p>If Hays listened to critics and sometimes made concessions to them, he also found that flooding the
                    media with favorable publicity proved one of the most effective ways to overwhelm them. The public
                    relations department churned out news releases, pamphlets, and magazine articles, and published a
                    monthly magazine about the industry's accomplishments. A speakers’ bureau recruited people to talk
                    about the movies, and by 1929, more than 1,000 addresses had been given, most over the radio. The
                    public relations department gained impressive momentum during its first decade. In the course of a
                    year it routinely gave 15,000 interviews and turned out several times as many letters.<hi rend="sup"

                </p>
                <p>This flood of publicity through the press told only part of the story: the Hays Office attempted to
                    extend its influence into every community with a movie theater. During his first three years in
                    Hollywood, Hays established relations with more than fifty religious, civic, educational, and
                    professional organizations-among them the General Federation of Women's Clubs, Daughters of the
                    American Revolution, International Federation of Catholic Alumnae, Boy Scouts, American Library
                    Association, and Young Men's Christian Association. He supplied their conventions with free films

                    helped Hays to expand his cooperative efforts to include hundreds of national and regional
                        associations.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hays's plan also involved turning local committees of movie-goers into "genuine motion picture
                    councils." The committees, composed of local leaders, would offer advice and promote what they
                    considered to be good films. By 1934, the PR department estimated support from 100,000 volunteers,
                    and that number was growing rapidly. In the previous year alone, the department claimed that it had
                    enlisted an additional 10,000 community leaders: 6,000 school teachers, newspaper editors, and club
                    leaders; 1,200 librarians; 2,000 managers of theaters; and 800 clergymen and YMCA secretaries. By
                    word-of-mouth and other means, they promoted movies and countered criticism from people who did not
                    attend films. Hays found the latter objective particularly important because he believed that
                    "nearly all the public relations irritation and legislative trouble" resulted from "the activities
                    of critical non-customers.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In several respects, the Hays Office's strategy replicated a technique used by American propagandists
                    during World War I. George Creel's Committee on Public Information had enlisted 75,000 local
                    speakers to give short talks supporting the war. These "Four Minute Men" acted as surrogates for
                    President Woodrow Wilson in an era before regular radio broadcasting Creel's short-lived but
                    sensational efforts paled in comparison with the accomplishments of the MPPDA: Hays estimated that
                    before his retirement in 1945, his office had 600,000 men and women "doing something on an organized
                        basis."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Like a propaganda machine, the Hays Office exploited all forms of media, leaving no outlet untapped.
                    Hays claimed in 1930 that his industry daily produced 15,000 pieces of movie advertising at an
                    annual cost of $100,000,000. In early 1934 the PR department claimed that more than 500 newspapers,
                    including influential metropolitan dailies, were publishing lists of recommended films and otherwise
                    cooperating. At least 100 radio stations regularly broadcast publicity material. Volunteer telephone
                    committees tried to spread the good word about cinema, in keeping with the MPPDA's conviction that
                    word-of-mouth promotion seemed more spontaneous and sincere than commercial advertising. Concerned
                    to gain the confidence of teachers and parents, Hays asked libraries and schools to <list

                    Teacher Association stood at odds with Hollywood, Hays knew that many of the local PTAs remained
                    fiercely independent, and he worked to separate them from the national organization. In early 1934,
                    the PR department noted that nine state organizations, including <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, had repudiated the national leadership's stand on the movies.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
                    Looking back later in his life, Hays revealed more than he realized when he wrote that he doubted
                    "whether any other industry has ever made such a record of organizing active good will in its
                    support on so large a scale."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Some of this record can be traced to a strategy of what might be called "defensive publicity." The
                    strategy included a practice of infiltrating meetings of critical groups, such as the PTA, with
                    people who represented the Hays Office. When these representatives took the floor, their recorded
                    remarks were then circulated by Hays's publicity managers to create the perception of a group
                    divided. Another tactic involved publicizing scholarly research that countered attacks on the
                        industry.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hays possessed a genius for absorbing criticism. In fact, some groups found that the MPPDA's open
                    door became a "trap door." Hays's pitch to parents, teachers, and the general public emphasized that
                    Hollywood had taken steps to require the studios to strive for the highest "artistic" and "moral"
                    standards. To make his point, he held up two sets of guidelines embraced by the industry: "The
                    Formula," adopted in 1924, requested that studios present questionable scripts to Hays's office.
                    Three years later, PR department head Colonel Jason Joy drew up a list of "Don'ts and Be Carefuls."
                    Joy had visited several state censorship boards in 1927 to see firsthand what the censors disliked.
                    He presented a list of eleven "don'ts" and twenty-six "be carefuls." The "don'ts" forbade the
                    showing of illegal drug traffic, nudity, sexual perversion (homosexuality fell under this heading),
                    white slavery, miscegenation, sex hygiene and venereal diseases, childbirth, and the sex organs of
                    children. They also prohibited profanity, ridiculing of clergy, and offensive depictions of any
                    nation, race, or creed. Topics to be treated with care included arson, sedition, criminal
                    techniques, <list type="footnotes">

                <p>Hays knew that "The Formula" and the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" were little more than window dressing
                    because he had few means of enforcing them. During the 1920s, these public relations gambits worked
                    well enough, and he could count several successes, most importantly the fact that none of the
                    thirty-two censorship bills introduced in state legislatures in 1922 had passed. The greatest
                    victory came in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where Hays enlisted the support of more than 90 percent of the state's newspapers, and
                    volunteers canvassed the state to persuade voters to reject a censorship referendum-a feat
                    accomplished by a vote of better than two-to-one. At the national level, Hays's organization helped
                    stave off legislation that proposed creation of a federal motion picture commission.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>For all his success at avoiding intervention and advocating the use of new technologies, Hays
                    learned, at the end of the decade, that innovation could also create problems. The advent of sound
                    technology during the late 1920s created a new crisis and escalated demand for regulation. This
                    "magical transformation," as one of the studio chiefs called it, made the movies more lifelike and
                    greatly expanded the range of entertainment. Movies became more appealing as actors could be both
                    more forthright and more subtle. A sly emphasis upon an appropriate or inappropriate word, or a
                    double entendre, could alter the meaning of a scene if not an entire film. By making it easier for
                    filmmakers to circumvent the spirit if not the letter of any code, sound technology increased the
                    worries of those who wanted to regulate movies. "Silent smut had been bad," wrote the Rev. Daniel
                    Lord, S.J., a noted critic of "modern" thought. "Vocal smut cried to the censors for vengeance.<hi

                <p>Almost overnight, sound rendered the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls" and Hays's political skill insufficient
                    to silence calls for government intervention. Efforts for government control took at least two
                    forms: attempts to enact legislation to regulate film content, and legal efforts to abolish the
                    monopolistic practices by which studios controlled not only the production but also the distribution
                    and exhibition of moving pictures. In 1929, Charles C. Pettijohn, the MPPDA's general counsel,
                    informed Hays that most of the forty-three state legislatures meeting in 1930 would consider film
                    censorship. At the national level the Brookhart Bill, proposed by Senator Smith Brookhart of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> in 1928, threatened to outlaw block booking the policy of forcing theater owners to buy
                    all of a studio's films in order to be assured of getting movies with the most popular stars.
                    Although the bill never passed, President Hoover and the Justice Department, alarmed by the growing
                    power of the large studios, contemplated antitrust action. In the face of such threats, Hollywood
                    executives became more willing to make concessions on content.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In spite of Hays's careful cultivation of mainstream community groups, pressure for controls came not
                    only from the government but from such civic and women's associations as the National Congress of
                    Parents and Teachers, the International Federation of Catholic Alumnae, the National Society of the
                    Daughters of the American Revolution, and the General Federation of Women's Clubs. By 1930, the
                    latter organization supported film preview committees in almost every state. Even Hays's personal
                    life came under attack. His divorce in 1929, after a twenty-seven-year marriage, and rumors that he
                    was engaged to an attractive divorcee, did nothing to strengthen his standing among people convinced
                    that movies were undermining the family. Unimpressed by Hays, his associates, and the MPPDA, critics
                    characterized them as little more than "moral masks" disguising Hollywood's depravity.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>Among the most outspoken critics remained Protestant and Catholic groups whose misgivings about
                    cinema's impact on Christian civilization predated the industry's conversion to sound and reflected
                    a deep uneasiness about modern life in general. Their denunciations took on an anti-Semitic tone as
                    they pointed to the Jewish origins and control of the motion picture industry. The Methodist
                    publication Churchman attacked the MPPDA for being a "smoke screen" hiding the "meretricious
                    methods" of "shrewd Hebrews who make the big money by selling crime and shame." Even more formidable
                    than Protestant critics were Roman Catholics. Because of the Church's hierarchical structure,
                    Catholic leaders more effectively organized their followers to boycott offending movies, a practice
                    formalized in 1934 with the creation of the Legion of Decency.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
                </p>
                <p>If the furor created by the talkies edged the industry into a corner, the Great Depression pushed its
                    leaders squarely against the wall. Hays now tried another, more serious attempt at
                    self-regulation-the Production Code of 1930. The Code attempted to bind movie entertainment to a
                    standard of morality independent of public taste. It incorporated almost all of the "Don'ts and Be
                    Carefuls," endorsed broadly Judeo-Christian values, and sought to protect the authority of the state
                    and the sanctity of the family.</p>
                <p>The Protestant Hays tapped Catholic leaders to help draft the Code. Martin Quigley, the Catholic
                    publisher of the <hi rend="i">Exhibitors Herald-World,</hi> served as a mediator between the
                    Church's hierarchy and film executives in negotiations during 1929 and early 1930 that led to the
                    Code's adoption. George Cardinal Mundelein of the Archdiocese of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, who found himself in an influential position with investment bankers who came to
                    leverage studios during the depression, threw the Church's authority behind the new document.</p>
                <p>Perhaps fearing the strong anti-Catholic sentiments embedded in American culture, Hays denied that
                    the Code was narrowly Catholic and downplayed the contributions of his Catholic collaborators.
                    Nevertheless, Catholic theology played an important part in defining this politically and socially
                    conservative document. Father Lord seized his opportunity as primary author to "put solid
                    theological and moral bones" on the code, and more than any single person influenced the tone and
                    substance of the new <list type="footnotes">

                    preferred anonymity at the time, Lord recognized the opportunity "to tie the Ten Commandments in
                    with the newest and most widespread form of entertainment." Here was a chance, he wrote, "to read
                    morality and decency into mass recreation." But the Code also needed to appeal to a broad public, to
                    "stand up before the immoralist, the amoralist, the skilled dramatist, the producer who had risen
                    from the slums, the auditor, the audience, the films of the day and of fifty years from now," so
                    that "the follower of any religion, or any man of decent feeling and conviction, would read it and

                <p>Unfortunately, from the perspective of the Code's supporters, the battle to commit cinema to
                    Judeo-Christian ethics faltered in the absence of effective provisions for its enforcement. One year
                    later, Lord himself pronounced the plan a failure. In response, the MPPDA in 1934 established the
                    Production Code Administration under the resolute leadership of Joseph I. Breen, a militant Catholic
                    layman. The Code exerted its most powerful influence during the late 1930s, and although its
                    authority began to wane after World War II, it touched nearly all pictures made between 1934 and
                    1968, when a new rating system was adopted.</p>

                    prepared by a group of social scientists, began to appear in 1933, and opened a new front of attack
                    on the movies and gave ammunition to the MPPDA's many existing critics.</p>
                <p>The PFS had originated in 1928, when the executive director of the Motion Picture Research Council,
                    William H. Short, invited several university researchers to examine the effects of movies on

                    mostly of foreign birth" whose "vicious and obscene" films presented "false standards of life."
                    Audiences of innocent children and youth under twenty-one witnessed "pictures depicting vice, crime,
                    sex entanglements, and all conceivable forms of human wickedness and folly." Such movies certainly
                    made children sexually permissive delinquents and prevented their becoming good citizens, thereby
                    weakening adult morality and injuring America abroad.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Unlike many censors,

                <p>The social scientists collected by Short employed scientific methods to study society's problems.
                    Financed by the Payne Fund (a private philanthropic foundation established in 1929 by Francis Payne
                    Bolton to support education and the arts), the scientists conducted their investigations between
                    1929 and 1932. The resultant pioneering attempt to evaluate the place of movies in America and their
                    effect on the young, although much maligned in subsequent years, remains the most extensive survey
                    on the subject. A recent reexamination of these volumes found that they continue to be "informative"
                    and "innovative," and are an example of "excellent early mass communication research." Another
                    analyst concluded that the PFS "undoubtedly presented a reasonably valid picture of the influences
                    of the movies of the 1920s on the youth of that period. The films were an influence on attitudes;
                    they provided models for behavior; they shaped interpretations of life."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    boring pictures on the public. That criticism obscured the fact that Dale had several worthy
                        objectives.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> First and foremost, he believed that the industry's economic
                    structure smothered artistic integrity. He argued for a national policy protective of free
                    expression in order that real artists could get the chance to put their visions on screen. As with
                    the work of great writers or painters, it did not matter that the moviemaker's vision might be
                    "incorrect," or that it might conflict with society's conventions. In fact, Dale acknowledged that
                    his plan might lead to pictures which were "flatly opposed to prevailing notions about things."<hi
                        rend="sup">42</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Dale also advocated media literacy. Comparable to drama, literature, painting, and music, cinema as
                    an art form was "too fine an instrument to be used only for passing entertainment or to kill time."
                    An educated public could discriminate between good and bad films-just as they might discern the
                    difference between great literature and pulp fiction-in order that they might <hi rend="i">"enjoy
                        with understanding."</hi> To that end, his first contribution to the PFS came in the form of a
                    manual, <hi rend="i">How To Appreciate Motion Pictures</hi> (1933), directed to high school
                    students. Addressing the gamut of filmmaking techniques-from cameras, to acting, directing, and
                    settings-the volume ended with controversial recommendations: to abolish the star system and its
                    accompanying celebrity culture; to produce different movies for adults and children; to create a
                    "new point of view regarding the place of motion pictures in our scheme of living" so that cinema
                    could better speak to such problems as abolishing war, crime and punishment, and "the more
                    satisfactory distribution of wealth;" and to promote the understanding of democratic government.<hi

                </p>
                <p>Dale believed that film's untruthful depictions of life harmed some viewers-especially children. He
                    made assumptions about cinema's influence for which he later was justifiably criticized, but he
                    demonstrated an awareness of the difficulties of trying to measure cause and effect. Modern modes of
                    transportation "greatly increased the possibilities of direct contact with a wide variety of
                    experience," while the movies, radio, and the press expanded "almost infinitely the possibilities of
                    indirect contacts." Still, Dale felt compelled to render some account of the harmful possibilities.

                    <hi rend="i">Content of Motion Pictures</hi> (1935), he analyzed the topics presented in
                    approximately 1,500 movies produced between 1920 and 1930, and discovered that sex, love, and crime
                    dominated, with half of the movies that treated love also emphasizing sex. The consideration of
                    problems confronting single adults over thirty or of the difficulties encountered in marriage were
                    so unsatisfactory that Dale doubted whether young people gained any insight into what they might
                    later encounter. Rarely did films explain why people turned to crime. Criminals sprang
                    "Minerva-like…from the head of Jupiter" in the movies, and were not always shown to be punished. In
                    an age of prohibition, 75 percent of the films studied by Dale featured alcohol, with tobacco used
                    in almost 90 percent of the pictures. Conversely, movies that dealt with history, travel, or
                    children's themes accounted for only a minuscule percentage of the pictures that Dale examined.<hi

                </p>
                <p>In <hi rend="i">Children's Attendance at Motion Pictures</hi> (1935), Dale argued that a far greater
                    number of children attended the movies than the industry acknowledged. He called on parents to be
                    more active, preferably attending films with their children or, failing that, at least helping them
                    to interpret what they had seen.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
                </p>
                <p>One final interesting, but often overlooked, feature of Dale's study was his attempt to analyze
                    newsreels and encourage people to think more thoughtfully about news. Shown in conjunction with
                    motion pictures, newsreels had become an important way for people to receive information about the
                    world. The potential for distorting news when it was coupled with entertainment concerned not only
                    Dale but also thoughtful students of journalism during this period. Analyzing the output of two
                    major news-reel production companies during 1931 and 1932, Dale characterized the news as formulaic,
                    unimaginative, and disjointed; news items were usually unrelated to one another; and conversations
                    by the people shown, especially celebrities, often bore little or no relation to the content of the
                    story <list type="footnotes">

                            and less frequently over time. Because children lacked adult experience, they were unable to
                            make mature judgments about what they watched and could "only acquiesce" in what they had
                            seen. Dale, <hi rend="i">Children's Attendance at Motion Pictures,</hi> 27.</item>

                <p>The studies by Dale and his colleagues were more complex and qualified than this brief summary
                    indicates, and surely most nuances were lost when the journalist-magazine editor Henry James Forman
                    popularized them in a best-selling one-volume work, Our <hi rend="i">Movie Made Children</hi>
                    (1933). Forman warned: <quote rend="blockquote">

                <p>Hays, on the other hand, liked to speak reassuringly about children and movies. "We must have toward

                    must have toward that the same sense of responsibility, that same care about the impression made
                    upon it, that the best teacher or the best clergyman, the most inspired teacher of youth, would
                    have," he had said in 1922. He promoted <list type="footnotes">

                            American foreign policy appeared isolationist and focused on disarmament, newsreel items
                            relating to war, the army, or the navy were twelve times more prevalent than stories about
                            peace. In the aftermath of prohibition's repeal, the newsreels were four times more likely
                            to carry hostile accounts. He found the coverage of health-related issues inadequate and
                            almost no stories relating to "psychological and vocational guidance," and recommended
                            increasing newsreel coverage of such issues. Dale, <hi rend="i">Content of Motion

                    worried parents. Hays and his staff dubbed this research the "Payneful" Studies, and they marshaled
                    their considerable resources to discredit them.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
                </p>
                <p>By the time of the PFS's publication, Hays had already dealt with accusations that the movies caused
                    juvenile delinquency and crime. In the past he had argued, quite reasonably, for multiple causality:
                    racial tension, too much (or little) money, immigration, slums, automobiles, sensationalism in the
                    press, lack of parental supervision, lax law enforcement, weapons possession. Often he expanded his
                    case with the contention that movies combated crime by presenting the capture and punishment of
                    criminals. The Hays Office applied this reasoning to answer a report that appeared in 1929 by the
                    nationally known statistician, Roger Babson, who argued that movies were "the basic cause of the
                    crime waves of today"<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
                </p>
                <p>By 1931, though, public relations advisers were telling Hays that he was too passive and that the
                    MPPDA was being routed in the publicity war. "We simply have no…coherent, sustained, energetically
                    pursued publicity policy," complained one adviser. "This astonishing doctrine of defeatism and
                    donothingism is the strangest and most fallacious platform on which I have ever known any publicity
                    department to operate."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hays and his staff soon became much more adept at covering Hollywood's trail. When James Cagney's The
                        <hi rend="i">Public Enemy</hi> (1931) and other crime pictures came under attack for glamorizing
                    the life of gangsters, Hays hired a former policeman, August Vollmer, to watch these films and offer
                    an evaluation. Vollmer thought none of the pictures encouraged crime, and <list type="footnotes">

                    charismatic Cagney projected.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
                </p>
                <p>When the Payne Fund Studies appeared in 1933, Hays sought to assemble as much expert opinion as
                    possible to contradict, or at least cast doubt on, the volumes. As might be expected in any
                    gathering of minds, the researchers did not always agree, and they sometimes qualified their
                    conclusions, so Hays's agents attempted to turn opinion against the studies by exploiting these
                    weaknesses. They portrayed the studies as special-interest pleading which was methodologically
                    flawed, even hysterical, and utterly superficial in assigning blame for crime to the movies. The
                    best work in psychology and criminology, the Hays Office proclaimed, showed that the causes of crime
                    were far more complex than the PFS had suggested.</p>
                <p>The Hays Office launched an assault on one of the PFS's most vulnerable flanks, Forman's <hi rend="i"
                        >Our Movie Made Children,</hi> branding it "pseudo-scientific," and "definitely dishonest." The
                    charge was easily made because Forman, who was not a social scientist, had oversimplified the PFS.
                    Another weak point, Hays believed, was Short, the driving force behind the studies. The MPPDA
                    painted him as a "fanatic, reformer type," who had gathered around him other malcontents, or
                    researchers who were well-meaning but naive about the ends to which their research would be used.<hi

                </p>
                <p>While Hays and his staff crafted a carefully calculated plan to publicize the biased nature of the
                    PFS, they realized they too could be open to the charge of special pleading, especially if they
                    appeared unwilling to accept scientific evaluations. They therefore published more than three dozen
                    excerpts from American newspapers and magazines, and statements from about half as many educators
                    and social scientists, that cast doubt on the PFS's conclusions. "Only a disinterested approach to
                    the social problems of the screen can result in disinterested conclusions as to the possible
                    relationship of juvenile delinquency to motion picture entertainment," the MPPDA maintained, as if
                    Hays and his associates harbored genuine interest only in <list type="footnotes">

                            origins of crime and suggested that "the gangster problem cannot be solved entirely until
                            the factors that produced the gangster are eliminated." Vollmer, memo to Hays, April 20,

                <p>As Hays's staff tracked editorials and stories about Hollywood during 1933 and 1934, they compiled
                    many pieces critical of the Payne Fund Studies. How many newspaper and magazine stories or radio
                    addresses had been planted, or written from releases supplied by the MPPDA, is impossible to
                    ascertain. Hays, who considered it an important part of his job "to see that editors were kept
                    informed," found them "quick to pass on interesting facts to the public." Certainly with the public
                    relations network that he had constructed, he was in a position to flood the media. While the Payne
                    Fund Studies did possess their shortcomings, that they fell into disrepute so quickly surely owed
                    much to the Hays Office's skillful publicity campaign.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Still, Hays longed for someone not merely to discredit his critics but also to give movies a
                    philosophical rationale-not unlike the way in which Lord had given the Production Code its moral
                    underpinning. He found his man at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the person of Mortimer Adler. When casting about for refutations of the PFS, Hays
                    discovered Adler's book (coauthored with Jerome Michael), <hi rend="i">Crime, Law, and Social
                        Science</hi> (1933). No friend of the social sciences, Adler doubted whether science could be
                    used to study humanity's most perplexing questions, including the causes of crime. "An empirical
                    science of criminology is not at present possible because no empirical sciences of psychology and
                    sociology now exist." Adler seemed just the person who could pin the "pseudo-science" label on the
                    Payne Fund Studies and make it stick.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                            them. Gregory Black writes that the PFS "rendered Hays speechless …. Hays remained silent.
                            In so doing he missed an opportunity to thwart the forces of censorship that were gathering

                    little was actually known about crime. Shortly thereafter, Adler met with Hays, and there followed
                    other conferences with members of the MPPDA. Hays eventually asked the philosopher "to write an
                    analysis of the Payne Fund studies and all similar sociological and psychological researches on the
                    influence of the movies on human conduct, … in a manner similar to the review of criminological

                    <hi rend="i">Art and Prudence</hi> was at once a critique of the behavioral sciences and the Payne
                    Fund Studies, and a commentary on the relation between cinema, art, and morality. Issues involving
                    cinema's place in society, Adler believed, "were exactly the same problems that faced Aristotle and
                    Plato as moral and political philosophers in relation to Greek drama." Adler took particular pride
                    in the book's last section, "Cinematics," in which he tried to adapt to cinema the principles found
                    in Aristotle's <hi rend="i">Poetics.</hi>
                    <hi rend="sup">57</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Philosophizing aside, Adler savaged the Payne Fund Studies. He attacked the methodology used by PFS
                    authors and argued for the absence of any scientific evidence proving that motion pictures caused
                    crime. Of Dale, Adler was scathing. "Dale's own opinion about the way in which the movies influence
                    behavior," he said, was "in no sense based upon his data." Obviously Dale did not know "the
                    difference between art and propaganda." Adler denounced "the superficial and unfounded character of
                    Dale's consideration of aesthetic, moral, and political questions. His lack of hesitation in
                    expressing his opinions is equal to his lack of careful analysis, his lack of relevant

                    though, Hays was so pleased with Adler's ability to put Hays's thoughts into words "that made him
                    feel comfortable" that he hired the philosopher as a consultant and ghostwriter, and paid him more

                    under the self-regulating structure" of the MPPDA, but the professor's 650-plus pages were so
                    long-winded and obtuse as to be virtually inaccessible to the general public. Hays therefore turned
                    to Raymond Moley to write a short, popular account of Adler's work entitled <hi rend="i">Are We
                        Movie Made?</hi> (1938). As the title suggests, Moley was Hays's answer to Henry James Forman. A <placeName>

                    finding the causes of crime. He abridged Adler and remained faithful to the philosopher's text, down
                    to reproducing its mistakes. Moley believed that the audience should decide what was shown and
                    ridiculed Dale's ideas about topics that might be made into movies (agricultural problems, the
                    decline of frontier psychology). Perhaps most damning was his insinuation that Dale's proposals were
                    boring, for nothing so doomed pictures in the eyes of exhibitors or the public as to suggest that
                    they might be "educational."<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

                <p>Within a little more than a decade Hays made tremendous progress in strengthening cinema's place in
                    society. He had navigated treacherous legislative waters, successfully avoiding further government
                    regulation. He had gained the upper hand with critics.</p>
                <p>Hays had waged a massive public relations campaign to change the way Americans thought about the
                    movies. The scope of this undertaking was surely not known at the time, nor has it since been
                    appreciated. Part of this endeavor involved persuading people that Hollywood was setting its house
                    in order, was capable of regulating itself, and that scandals were "no longer accepted symbols of
                    the business." To those who would argue that <list type="footnotes">

                    entertainment in Judeo-Christian morality. To those who contended that motion pictures were harmful
                    to children, caused juvenile delinquency, or otherwise encouraged asocial behavior, Hays could offer
                    plausible counters as to why such criticism was unreasonable. Moreover, he discovered how to muddy
                    the waters of public debate. Negative academic research could be blunted, if not discredited, by
                    enlisting testimony from other university authorities who had few qualms about accepting
                    compensation. To those who worried that film imported un-American values, Hays made a case that
                    movies were essential to the national economy, and he encouraged Hollywood to make patriotic
                    pictures. Motion pictures under Hays's leadership became an instrument promoting nationalism. Hays
                    attempted to convince Americans that this new medium was no less significant than the newspaper or
                    magazine press and hence deserved comparable <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-101-2-036"/> legal guarantees.
                    Adler, he hoped, would justify giving cinema greater freedom and at the same time enhance its status
                    as an art form.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hays capitalized on the media revolution of his time. The movies emerged as one of the most powerful
                    forms of communication, but they hardly existed in isolation. When Hays and his associates enlisted
                    the latest techniques in mass advertising and public relations to exploit such developments as
                    radio, sound recording, photography, modern newspapers and magazines, comics, pulp fiction,
                    billboards, and the latest innovations in ground and air transportation, they created an
                    entertainment complex of unprecedented power and influence. By establishing a network of
                    volunteers-600,000 strong, if we take Hays at his word-the industry assured itself of access to
                    communication that reached into every level of society.</p>
                <p>Small wonder that entertainment and celebrity culture grew at such an astounding pace during the
                    1920s and 1930s. For those who opposed these developments, Hays's behind-the-scenes manipulation
                    brought cynicism about modern media. No matter how shiny the veneer Hays constructed for
                    moviemakers, to some they remained "false leaders" who were being swept into the public arena on
                    unrelenting waves of publicity. To the dismay of these early critics of cinema, celebrities
                    nonetheless became opinion makers and trendsetters, even as cultural critics who once held positions
                    of influence were finding themselves marginalized.</p>
                <p>It was much more than simply "an ironic accident of history," as it has been argued, that during the
                    same era when the motion picture industry became "a major social influence in American life, the
                    traditional power of the Protestant majority…declined." Despite his conservatism, Hays was
                    modernism's envoy. It may have been that such developments were inevitable, especially given the
                    explosive growth of mass media, but without Hays's direction, Hollywood's road to respectability
                    would have been more difficult. His remarks about the influential nature of cinema aside, it is
                    doubtful that this ambassador of the new media grasped just how dramatically society could be
                    changed, or foresaw what direction change might take. Nevertheless, he seemed relieved, if not
                    pleased, by the middle of 1934, as he sensed that the storm of criticism engulfing Hollywood was
                    beginning to subside. The "skies were clearing," he said; the "industry's buffeted ship" had
                    "reached open water" and was at last "free to go full steam ahead."<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

                <p>On a brisk spring day in March 1965, an estimated 300 Indiana University students assembled in Dunn
                    Meadow, the green oasis beside the Indiana Memorial Union where students often relaxed between
                    classes or met to play games. This day was different, however, as these students gathered not to
                    enjoy the atmosphere, but to speak their minds about the war in <placeName>

                <p>Obviously, this focus reveals only part of the story. An investigation of the campus activism of the
                    1960s and 1970s should consider the full range of student expression evoked by the complexity of
                    those times. Far from exhibiting what Richard Hofstadter deemed the "paranoid style" of many
                    conservative American movements (complete with persecution complex and void of relevant ideas), the
                    campus Right at IU and elsewhere provided a number of students with an alternative and highly
                    attractive worldview, one that both defended and critiqued the status quo.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The
                    New Right's conservative ideology, like that of the radical Left, stood at odds with the consensus
                    "me-too-ism" of the 1950s, which joined Democratic and Republican elites in agreement on certain
                    foreign and domestic policy essentials. This study draws on contemporary IU sources and on more
                    recent interviews with several of the era's participants to locate conservative activists in a
                    variety of organizations that interacted with each other and with their liberal rivals to challenge
                    and change campus, national, and international issues.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Though often viewed as
                    an enigma by consensus liberals and neglected by commentators, the Right's ideas prompted a
                    generation of activists who would, like their more widely recognized counterparts on the Left,
                    recall their campus experiences as the cornerstone of an effective effort to reshape American
                    politics and culture in the decades ahead.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                <p>The tone of such events fit well into an academic environment still governed by rules that modern
                    college students would find hard to imagine. As David Steigerwald has pointed out, universities of
                    the time "exercised the right of in loco parentis and regulated the lives of their students,
                    separating the sexes and imposing curfews." The culture of proscription carried over to the students
                    themselves. The student paper, for example, published tips about the "social etiquette" of proper
                    campus attire. Though these rules provoked some chafing, they prompted little change as the vast
                    majority of students did not care enough to organize against them-students attended IU to graduate,
                    not agitate.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In a growing campus population throughout the 1960s, the IDS
                    estimated that the radical Left had never boasted more than one hundred members. IU was "not a
                    Berkeley" in the heart of the conservative Midwest. The "greenbaggers" were the fringe, and they
                    knew it. As the Young People's Socialist League readily admitted in 1965, they were "well aware that
                    we represent a minority point of view on the IU campus. We often find it depressingly difficult to
                    find a sympathetic audience here in Indiana."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                </p>
                <p>More than any other, the issue of anti-communism brought an end to this complacency. For the group
                    that would come to be known as the New Right, the U.S. needed to stand firmly against the Red menace
                    at home and abroad. Those who organized the New Left, on the other hand, worried about domestic
                    witch-hunts and an activist foreign policy that seemed blind to social justice. What both groups
                    feared-perhaps even more than each other-was a continuation of what they saw as complacency in the
                    face of real problems. The extension of these political antagonisms to the nation's growing

                <p>The leading organization on the campus Right was the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). Established
                    in September 1960 by a group of conservative thinkers gathered at the home of William F Buckley,
                    Jr., author of <hi rend="i">God and Man at Yale</hi> (1951), YAF was staunchly anti-communist and
                    supportive of the domino theory. The IU chapter of YAF grew under the leadership of Thomas Charles
                    Huston, a native of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Recognized by historians of the Left and Right as a top-notch conservative thinker,
                    Huston made anti-communism the center of his campus activism, believing that those who protested the

                    </placeName> only boosted the morale of the nation's chief enemy. Like his YAF colleagues throughout

                </p>
                <p>In this crusade against international communism and its campus defenders, Huston found an ideological
                    ally in Robert Turner. Like many young conservatives, Turner, who was the son of a military officer,
                    first became involved in politics by working for Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. A
                    member of the campus Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC), Turner took a special interest in <placeName>

                    chapter president of the Society's Conservative League, which, under the direction of history
                    graduate student Phil Crane, had blossomed into the second largest chapter in the nation (behind

                    college students through the distribution of literature and by holding intellectual debates on
                    current issues. In addition, Turner helped form the League's activist arm, Students for an Orderly
                    Society. Both groups worked with YAF to advance a conservative agenda, sharing ideas and members.<hi

                    state legislature, investigate the matter. The <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> editorial board acknowledged
                    the possiblity that the Birchers were correct about the club, but asked that people not be so
                    "close[d] minded" about new campus groups before they could even get under way. This stance brought
                    forth a flurry of student letters throughout the month: Judy Lowery blasted the <hi rend="i"

                <p>The decision of the IU chapter of the DuBois Club to sponsor communist speakers-including national
                    Communist Party head Herbert Aptheker-forced IU administrators to decide if the group should be
                    banned. Surprisingly, student activists from the Right and Left did not think so. Turner announced
                    publicly in the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> that, while he believed the DuBois Club to be a communist
                    organization, he also felt that IU students would not join. Firmly committed to the value of student
                    protest, Turner argued that the government lacked the right to halt the formation of a group, no
                    matter what its ideas were, because ideas could be safely debated. When the university at last
                    suspended the DuBois Club in September 1966, an estimated five hundred students protested at a rally

                    </placeName> had shifted the focus of many conservatives’ fears from domestic to international

                    </placeName>. Increasingly, conservatives both spoke and demonstrated in support of the war effort
                    (including, as we have seen, in Dunn Meadow). On campus, Bob Turner helped lead the 450-member
                    Student Committee for Victory in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which promoted North Vietnamese liberation from the communists. YAF leader Tom Huston
                    took a special interest in anti-communism in Asia, in part because Red Chinese troops had killed his
                    missionary uncle prior to World War II. With his appointment to the post of national YAF chairman in
                    1965, Huston brought his zeal to a national arena, arguing that South <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> needed to be given the opportunity to function as a free and democratic country. As the
                    war went on, YAF eventually took a public stance against the draft (advocating the creation of an
                    all-volunteer army), but conservatives never abandoned the idea of total victory in <placeName>

                    could bring peace. At IU, these sentiments found expression in the picketing of on-campus job
                    recruiters representing such defense-related companies as Dow Chemical and General Electric, as well
                    as the Central Intelligence Agency. As Huston later recalled in response to such actions, "the

                <p>During the 1965-1966 school year, campus protests about <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> became increasingly common and contentious. When General Maxwell Taylor, the U.S.

                    Hartke" rally, advanced Indiana Senator Vance Hartke's "extricate don't escalate" strategy towards
                    the war. The other, led by YAF and Students for an Orderly Society, aimed to demonstrate to the
                    general that the "vast majority" of IU students supported him in the war effort. A similar encounter
                    accompanied the campus visit of former Vice President Richard Nixon in October 1965. The following
                    May, when the director of the Selective Service spoke at IU, some 2,000 protestors, both pro and
                    con, clashed in Dunn Meadow, where, separated by the <placeName>

                </p>
                <p>Divisions among students over the war found other manifestations as well. In October 1965 the Young
                    Democrats and Young Republicans jointly proposed a campus referendum on American policies in <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>. SDS called the war blatant "imperialism" and contended that the <placeName>

                    </placeName> was responsible for more atrocities than the communists. Senior class president Jim
                    Kittle pushed for the student senate to authorize a "Bleed-In" blood drive on campus to show support
                    for the war effort by benefiting American forces in <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>. After what the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> called "the vehement protests of Guy Loftman," a
                    fellow senator and head of the campus SDS chapter, the senate voted a compromise that allowed donors
                    to indicate whether they wanted their blood sent to <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> or not. When the drive was over it was clear where the participants stood: of the 1,276

                    Right-wing emulation with a farcical twist. "Dr. Rudolph Montag," purportedly a <placeName>

                    threw a pie at the visiting "academic." The IU administration discovered the joke only after it

                <p>Public antics and debate occasionally gave way to more serious threats. In 1968, for example, an
                    anti-war protester let off a stink bomb in the vicinity of military recruiters visiting the Indiana
                    Memorial Union. Later, a fire broke out in the military section of the library, an act of vandalism
                    for which no one was ever punished. John Von Kannon and John Baden, conservative graduate students
                    at the time, recall receiving death threats when they refused to take part in the various campus
                    boycotts. Looking back, conservative activists recall feeling frustrated by the university
                    administration's mindset at times, but do not recall feeling persecuted. Theirs was simply an uphill
                        battle.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

                <p>Student activists of the 1960s also found a battleground in campus politics. One thing that is often
                    missing in the discussion of the student movement is the "student" part of the equation. Most
                    members of the student body were students first and activists second, if they were activists at all.
                    Students from all points along the political spectrum could agree on, and work together to promote,
                    a number of causes. Indeed, in students’ eyes, campus issues nearly always ranked above the debate

                    supported the Bleed-In, for example, supported ending prescribed visiting hours for women. An even

                <p>By the mid-1960s the situation on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus was beginning to change. Actual campus political parties were emerging-parties
                    intended to last for longer than a single academic year. Each spring students elected a student body
                    president, vice president, and senators to represent them on campus during the following school year
                    and serve as liaison to the university board of trustees and administrators. The dominant parties at
                    IU were Action, whose support lay in the campus Greek system, and Tryus, which garnered its support
                    mostly in the dormitories. Action won the 1964 election, then swept to another victory the following
                    year after Tryus was hit by academic problems. In 1966 Tryus won the presidency, while Action held
                    the senate. And yet, as important as these elections were to participants, they only prompted about
                    one-third of the student body to vote.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Low voter turnout could be an advantage, however. Left-leaning activists believed that if they could
                    mobilize and extend their base, they could take control of student government. In the spring of
                    1966, campus SDS chairman Guy Loftman organized the Progressive Reform Party (PRP), which drafted a
                    platform calling for more student control of the university. Together with Robin Hunter, a graduate
                    student from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and cofounder of IU's SDS chapter, Loftman was ready to craft a new style of campus
                        politics.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Campus conservatives did not take the Loftman challenge very seriously at first. Action and Tryus,
                    they reasoned, had similar students'-rights platforms. Turner, who doubted if Loftman could hold his
                    own in the campaign, believed that Loftman was really a proxy candidate for Hunter, whom the
                    conservative found to be both "bright and articulate." When Loftman claimed to have Turner's
                    support, the conservative fired off a letter to the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> noting that, while he and

                    of the <hi rend="i">IDS,</hi> which argued that student government was losing "good members" and was

                    personal, but not political, support is indicated by the fact that while PRP candidates contested a
                    majority of the thirty-three senate seats they succeeded in capturing only five. Further, with just
                    over 40 percent of students voting in the election, and with fewer than half of all votes cast going

                    and those who continued to debate ideological issues of socialism and anarchy. The group's

                    numerous letter-writers to the <hi rend="i">IDS.</hi> And while Loftman argued that he was ready to
                    work with the senate, the SDS asserted that it controlled the PRP's legislative agenda.<hi

                    <hi rend="i">The Alternative</hi> quickly seized on the PRP's ties to more radical groups like SDS.
                    The paper charged Loftman with acting on the belief that "student government should DO something for
                    the students-whether the students like it or not." "Who," asked Tyrrell and his colleagues, "came to
                    be governed? Did not some come to gain education?" Loftman's opponents grew increasingly harsh in
                    the year to come. <hi rend="i">The Alternative</hi> called him "the pink eyed man of destiny," and
                    once remarked that "we did not make guy loftman the butt of ridicule, God did, and as we are but the
                    humble servants of the Lord we must remark on him and the pile of animated garbage festering around
                    him." John Gait accused Loftman of suffering from a "multiple personality disorder," maintaining
                    that the student body president assumed the mantle of leadership only when it served his purposes,
                    that he utilized his title to garner attention while pretending not to, and that he claimed to be a
                    man of the people while constantly seeking more power for himself.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Loftman tried to steer a middle-Left course amidst this partisanship. He made a point of establishing
                    his disapproval of the campus drug culture and stressed his focus on giving students more control
                    "over the decisions which affect their lives," such as rules governing women's hours. Loftman, <list

                    his program, quickly found himself facing a roadblock in the person of Rock Winchell. Winchell, a

                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>

                    summer session. His opposition forced a campus referendum, which he won, much to the dismay of
                    Loftman. (Demonstrating that student apathy hardly took the summer off, less than one out of every
                    twelve students on campus bothered to vote in the summer of 1967).<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Loftman also spent the summer trying to gain a greater understanding of the university's finances.
                    Based on his study, he decided to take aim at one particular proposed expenditure: the construction
                    of a new basketball arena, to be named Assembly Hall. Despite support from the IU administration,
                    the Student Athletic Board, and the <hi rend="i">IDS,</hi> Loftman questioned the wisdom of asking
                    students to pay for a facility that many would never use. In a series of open forums across campus,
                    Winchell and YAF member James Bopp, Jr., began debating Loftman, arguing that a "well rounded
                    atmosphere" was essential to the university experience and that an institution like IU would always
                    have facilities or departments that not every student would use. Mark Watson (the president of IU
                    YAF) and other Loftman opponents also bombarded the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> with letters in support of
                    the project. Today, Bopp recalls the university's decision to proceed with the project as a serious
                    blow to Loftman's presidency.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Campus conservatives worked to make sure that SDS would not be able to repeat its success with PRP in
                    the 1968 elections. Supported by other members of student government, including Jim Durkott and Gary
                    Kovener, Winchell merged the two older parties into a new one, Impact. The leaders of the new party
                    appointed floor and dorm captains and instituted a membership fee, ensuring the party plenty of
                    money to use on campus.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Hunter and Loftman minced few words in their critique
                    of the new party. The student body president, perhaps smarting from his Assembly Hall defeat,
                    claimed that Impact had no basis for being and-unlike the PRP-no goals of its own. In the same

                    student body in general for not supporting his policies. Loftman, who tried to interest students in
                    campus governance, had discovered the very real lesson that winning an election did not guarantee
                    the success of a party's agenda once in power.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In the meantime, 600 delegates waged a "chaotic" battle over nominations at Impact's first
                    convention, ultimately settling on two Greek candidates-Alpha Tau Omega's Ted Najam and Phi Kappa
                    Psi's Paul Helmke-as the party's ticket for student body president and vice president, respectively.
                    Neither Najam nor Helmke belonged to YAF or to Tyrrell's circle. Najam in particular was no
                    conservative, and Tyrrell and other members of the Right watched as he drifted further and further
                    left in the months to come, while the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> later commented that he seemed "to have
                    taken on in some part the ideology of PRP." But this was campus politics, and the Right's goal was
                    to beat SDS, not to run an ideologue of its own.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In the campaign that followed, PRP was outmatched at every step. Impact's coffers were so full that
                    it could afford to take out one advertisement after another in the <hi rend="i">IDS.</hi> The
                    Right's proxy party focused on the lifestyle differences between their candidates and the "hippies"
                    of PRP. Impact officials said they planned to spend about $800 on the campaign, while PRP had barely
                    a quarter of that sum at its disposal. On election night, Impact garnered 4,666 votes to PRP's
                    3,703. The <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> credited Impact "image" versus PRP's, as well as a strong town

                </p>
                <p>The victory would not last long. Over the next year the more conservative Bopp challenged Najam and
                    Helmke for being too liberal. Helmke invited Bopp to run with him in 1969, but the YAF member chose
                    instead to run against him. Helmke then opted to leave the party and run as an independent, taking
                    with him a good chunk of Impact's base. Helmke told the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> that he had grown
                    tired of the dealmaking and compromising of party politics, and that he believed that the majority
                    of the student body preferred a more centrist candidate. It was up to Bopp to try to hold Impact

                    over rising student fees, he organized public meetings and even urged students to boycott classes so
                    they could go home and tell their parents about the problem. In Helmke's own subsequent assessment,
                    such "coat and tie" activism proved largely successful. Others agreed. The <hi rend="i">IDS</hi>
                    credited Najam's success, as well as Helmke's, to Loftman's radicalism. As mainstream student
                    leaders, they had proven able to exact reforms from an IU administration apprehensive about the
                    prospect of more Loftmans in its future. Later, looking back on his time in office, Najam would
                    credit his and Helmke's victories to the idealism and "activism" of the period-characteristics that,
                    as the 1970s dawned, would diminish considerably.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
                </p>
                <p>And yet two years of centrist campus government did little to halt the renewed divisiveness reflected
                    in the 1970 victory of Keith Parker. A field lieutenant of the Black Panthers, Parker told the <hi
                        rend="i">IDS</hi> that he believed the world to be divided between "reactionary Pigs" and
                    "progressive People," with only a small minority unaffiliated in the center. When asked specifically
                    about right-wing activists, Parker said that he hoped to sponsor an education weekend that would
                    "expose all their fascist tactics." Despite such rhetoric, only 20 percent of students voted,
                    suggesting that student apathy remained strong.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                    Though the student senate was unable or unwilling to condemn the trip, the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi>
                    editorial board called Parker "selfish" for putting his own interests above those of the university.
                    State Senator (and future governor) Robert Orr not only condemned the trip but also asked 1U
                    students how they could have elected Parker president in the first place. Several members of the
                    Indiana General Assembly spoke of raising IU tuition as a measure both to punish, and to reexert
                    control over, the <placeName>

                    cohort of Indiana politicians who already tended to group any call for students’ rights together
                    with antiwar protest into evidence of an "ominous Left" that threatened America's very existence.<hi

                    the trip, asking why Parker spent so much time working on a non-binding peace treaty between

                    </placeName>. Parker responded that the war did affect students; to argue that his trip was the sole
                    cause of the legislature's threatened tuition increase was, he contended, to ignore the economic
                    troubles in which the state was already enmired.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The trip controversy proved a boon to the campus Right. Von Kannon exposed the money trail that had
                    funded Parker's trip, tracing it to the national Black Panther Party and surmising that Parker had
                    actually acted as the Party's representative to Hanoi, not simply as a concerned American college
                    student. The funding for the trip had come, more specifically, from <placeName>

                    the tax, but in his <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> column, he also pointed out that the trustees’ decision to
                    revoke the fee had taken Parker off the hook for his <placeName>

                </p>
                <p>When Parker's term came to an end, the editors of the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> found little benefit in
                    his time in office. While crediting him with establishing a student legal service, the paper
                    believed that Parker's polarizing presidency had done more harm than good to IU. To his claim to
                    having given future presidents an "alternative" path to follow in office, the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi>
                    reported that Parker had only reduced the power of student government by antagonizing state
                    lawmakers, IU administrators, and a good number of students.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
                </p>
                <p>To Von Kannon, Parker's departure signaled the end of fun in campus politics. The frontrunners in the
                    1971 student elections were, as he pointed out, individuals with a long interest in politics, not
                    the amorphous "people" whom Parker had claimed as his power base. All told, there were fourteen
                    presidential tickets; and with only 25 percent of the campus voting, the election required a run-off
                    election that was itself a mess of legal maneuvering, including the elimination and reinstatement of
                    several tickets. The eventual winner was Mary Scifres, the first woman to be elected to the position
                    in the university's history, who promised to make student government more open to the student
                        body.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Scifres maintained a liberal platform but managed to do so in a manner that seemed, to conservatives
                    like Von Kannon, less confrontational than Parker's. The student body president would advocate
                    student support of such causes as Ralph Nader's Public Interest Research Group, the (now voluntary)
                    student government fee, activist Angela Davis's legal defense fund, and abortion rights. Scifres
                    presented her viewpoint in an <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> column that was more informational than
                    directive in tone. Von Kannon, the most public conservative on campus, sometimes used his own <hi
                        rend="i">IDS</hi> column to debate Scifres's stance on abortion, the war, and other issues. As
                    the journalistic sparring between the two suggests, sharp divisions remained between Right and Left,
                    but both sides had come to realize how little student government could, in fact, accomplish in one
                    year. By the mid-1970s, the <hi rend="i">IDS</hi> found "little evidence of IU's recent turmoil,"
                    and campus elections drew less of the attention they had attracted in earlier years.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>If campus politics was a game, it was still a game that could prepare a person for serious work.
                    Richard Nixon's election in 1968 provided conservative campus activists with an opportunity to take
                    their cause from the campus to the halls of power. One of the first to make the transition from
                    student activist to political operative was Tom Huston. After graduating from IU's law school
                    (1966), he served first as an Army officer attached to the Defense Intelligence Agency (1967-1969)
                    and then as an associate counsel to President Nixon during a period that saw escalating violence at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> State, Jackson State, and other college campuses. Nixon responded to the threat by
                    asking Congress for 1,000 additional FBI agents to provide "instant action" in the case of campus
                    turmoil. Huston, from his background as a local, state, and national YAF leader, agreed that "the
                    campus is the battleground of the revolutionary movement." Believing further that groups such as the
                    Black Panthers and the Weathermen (the anarchist spinoff group of SDS), working on-campus and off,
                    were plotting to overthrow the federal government, the president called upon Huston to draft a
                    scheme for domestic intelligence gathering.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The former student activist urged Nixon to utilize YAF to confront campus radicals, but the president
                    was reluctant to do so, perhaps because of his own misgivings about the conservative movement.<hi
                        rend="sup">51</hi> Ultimately, Huston's proposal-now known as the Huston Plan-called on the
                    White House to centralize all domestic intelligence gathering into a new agency and to authorize the
                    use of wiretaps and other forms of surveillance of suspected subversive groups. To those who
                    contended that the plan infringed on civil liberties, Huston argued that bugging a group to prevent
                    a terrorist act was hardly the same thing as beating a confession out of an innocent person. Nor was
                    he alone in his zeal. In a syndicated column that appeared in the <hi rend="i">IDS,</hi> Barry
                    Goldwater had likewise argued that enforcing law and order should not be construed as a repression
                    of civil liberties. Nevertheless, it was fierce opposition from FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (who
                    opposed centralization), rather than from civil rights advocates within the Nixon White House, that
                    eventually defeated the proposal.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

                    affairs. Phil Crane, organizer of IU's Conservative League, also contributed to the Republican
                    ascendancy. Originally elected to fill the congressional seat vacated by Donald Rumsfeld when

                    the terms of political debate" in the 1980s. Jim Kittle became a successful businessman and now

                <p>Alan D. Gaff wrote this book to give complete coverage to Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s conduct of the Indian War in the Old Northwest from 1792 to 1795. Having previously
                    written on the Iron Brigade and co-edited John Gibbon's chronicle of his experiences as a soldier
                    and scout on the Western frontier in the 1870s, Gaff is qualified to undertake this study. He
                    correctly notes that despite the many biographies of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> and surveys of the war that have been published, no complete history of this part of
                    America's military past has been written. In his exhaustive treatment, he analyzes the role of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> and his Legion army in bringing the Old Northwest more thoroughly under the control of

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by defeating an impressive Indian confederacy and thwarting British intentions in that
                    part of the world.</p>
                <p>Gaff's scholarship is impressive. Incorporating the viewpoints of practically everyone who left
                    official or personal records of participation, he quotes his sources accurately, appropriately, and
                    without distortion. He has done an astounding amount of research and seems to have included all
                    relevant primary, and most secondary, works. Gaff writes well, relating colorful but appropriate
                    accounts, particularly in his introduction and conclusion, and providing many interesting anecdotes
                    and personal vignettes. At the same time, he is careful not to sacrifice accuracy and organization
                    for style. His work is satisfying both as scholarship and as a rousing good story that will appeal
                    to the scholar and to the general reader. <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-101-2-064"/> Indiana readers will
                    particularly appreciate Gaff's account because so much of the book's action took place just to the
                    east in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and profoundly affected their history. Particularly germane is the story of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s establishment of Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName> in what is now northeastern Indiana.</p>
                <p>For all its strengths, Gaff's book could have been improved by a few minor additions. He should have
                    mentioned the impact of the Jay Treaty negotiations of 1794 and included the inflammatory remarks of
                    Canadian Governor Sir Guy Carleton, Baron Dorchester, made in 1794, that America and Britain would
                    be at war before the end of the year. He might have begun his narrative with the defeat of Colonel
                    Josiah Harmar's army by the Northwest Indians in 1790, rather than with Major General Arthur St.
                    Clair's expedition a year later. Finally, Gaff could have examined John Sugden's biography of
                    Bluejacket and Harvey Lewis Carter's life-and-times study of Little Turtle. Despite these quibbles,
                    this book will deservedly remain the standard work on the subject because of its many virtues.</p>

                <p>Although Carole Lombard died at age thirty-three in 1942, her personal and professional impact on
                    Hollywood certainly warrants a new biography (most date from the 1970s). Drawing on a wide variety
                    of sources-interviews, articles, prior biographies, movie reviews, and the films themselves-Wes D.
                    Gehring's book not only positions Lombard in relation to the screwball comedy genre she helped
                    define, but also shows the scope of her career, which began in the early 1920s and ranged from
                    silent slapstick comedies to classical Hollywood dramas.</p>
                <p>As the book's subtitle suggests, Gehring's study pays considerable attention to Lombard's early
                    childhood in Indiana and her subsequent connections to the state. In addition to using prominent
                    newspaper sources, Gehring fleshes out his study by digging into Indiana newspaper articles on the
                    "Hoosier Tornado." He begins with Lombard's death in the <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-101-2-065"/> plane
                    crash that followed her extremely successful war bond rally in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, rendering this familiar incident in moving rather than maudlin terms, and successfully
                    setting the stage for a consideration of Lombard's film career, personal life, and engaging
                    personality.</p>
                <p>Lombard's brief life was full of fascinating incidents. Fortunately, Gehring resists the urge to use
                    these events for mere titillation, providing instead a nuanced biography. Although he sometimes
                    indulges in excessive "what if" scenarios (e.g., what if Chaplin had hired Lombard when she
                    auditioned for <hi rend="i">The Gold Rush?),</hi> Gehring generally sticks to informed comments. He
                    convincingly argues that her silent comedy work for Mack Sennett, who emphasized spontaneity and
                    improvisation, provided an important foundation for her later work in screwball comedy. Gehring
                    suggests that after a car wreck left Lombard with a potentially career-ending scar on her cheek, she
                    renewed her dedication to her career and learned a great deal about lighting and cinematography in
                    order to disguise the blemish.</p>
                <p>Several love affairs-including one with George Raft, and Lombard's brief marriage to William
                    Powell-are examined, with an emphasis on her tendency to adapt to the interests of her lovers, as
                    when she developed an affinity for literature in Powell's company. Gehring appropriately connects
                    these relationships to her career, explaining, for example, that well after their amicable divorce
                    Powell insisted Lombard be cast opposite him in her most well-known screwball comedy, <hi rend="i"
                        >My Man Godfrey</hi> (La Cava, 1936). Her career came first until her relationship with Clark
                    Gable, when she attempted to take projects that would coincide with his schedule and also took up
                    his hobbies, hunting and fishing.</p>
                <p>Although such comments about Lombard's adaptability might suggest a submissive person, it is clear
                    that she was opinionated, outspoken, and determined. Gehring foregrounds her lively, free-spirited
                    personality, relating it to her screwball comedy persona without conflating the two. Hardly the
                    familiar story of a Hollywood beauty unknowingly exploited, Gehring demonstrates Lombard's
                    take-charge attitude about her own movie career and credits her mother, an Indiana native with a
                    strong interest in women's rights (as well as numerology, spiritualism, and the Baha'i faith), with
                    instilling an independent spirit in Carole. Going against societal norms, Carole requested that her
                    older brothers teach her to swear so she could fend off unwanted male admirers. Rough language
                    spilled over into her everyday speech (as the outtakes on the wonderfully restored Criterion edition
                    of <hi rend="i">My Man Godfrey</hi> attest), earning her another nickname: "the profane angel."
                    Lombard was wellknown as a wise-cracking wit in real life, and Gehring's book provides numerous
                    colorful quotes, most of which are (in the parlance of the times) too blue to be reprinted here.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Purdue University Press, 2003. Pp. xviii, 433. Illustrations, notes, index. $29.95.)</head>
                <p>The history of American aviation is laced with famous names and numerous firsts. But it is unlikely
                    that the typical student of airflight history is familiar with the names James Turpin (an early
                    airshow flyer for the Wright brothers), Trudy Johnson (one of the first women to fly a Wright-built
                    aircraft), Fredrick Martin (commander of the first around-the-world crew), or Charles McAllister
                    (the first man to mid-air crash into Charles Lindbergh). What do these early aviation pioneers have
                    in common? Each one either studied at, worked for, or married a graduate of Purdue University.</p>
                <p>While this may seem too narrow a theme for a book-most of the names are obscure until we reach the
                    space age with Purdue graduates such as Virgil "Gus" Grissom, Neil Armstrong, and Eugene Cernan-the
                    book, in fact, serves a dual role for the average reader. First, it tells the story of the people
                    involved in the nuts-and-bolts of aviation, the almost-famous flyers, those who built the
                    infrastructure of modern aviation, selected by their almost random association with Purdue. While
                    the author emphasizes Purdue's recognized strength in the field of aeronautical engineering
                    (clearly, one of the book's goals is to serve as a recruiting document), the idiosyncratic nature of
                    the cast of Purdue aviators provides a revealing look at the "ordinary" side of American aviation.
                    For example, Turpin might have claimed many aviation firsts but quit flying after an air show crash.
                    Trudy Johnson, the wife of early test pilot Jimmie Johnson, might have been the first Amelia Earhart
                    figure, but quit flying for fear of her children losing their mother. Martin was selected to command
                    a team of four planes to attempt to be the first to fly around the world, but he crashed his plane
                    on the first leg over Alaska and the team completed the textbook journey without him.</p>
                <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-101-2-067"/>
                <p>This book also tells the story of the twentieth-century contributions of land-grant colleges to the
                    research and economic development of aviation. Caltech and MIT claim a high percentage of Nobel
                    Prize winners, but public schools, such as Purdue, have been responsible for educating and training
                    a significant fraction of the people who would go on to assemble and maintain the technological
                    steamroller of aviation in this country. Purdue was the first university to construct its own
                    airfield, to hire a female professor of aeronautical engineering (Amelia Earhart), and to equip her
                    with the finest research aircraft of the time (which, unfortunately, she piloted to her death in the
                    South Pacific). Purdue was also one of the first colleges to own an airline-one of its four jets was
                    the infamous Playboy plane of the 1960s (apparently Earhart's feminist message did not sink in).</p>
                <p>There are several deficiencies in the book's presentation. For example, early in the book the author
                    notes that "every breakthrough in aviation and space would be captured on film" (p. 8), however, the
                    book displays only a few pages of images to accompany its rich descriptive text. The experienced
                    reader is probably aware of the look of early aircraft, but the novice reader (at whom the book
                    appears to aim) would benefit from some visual images of the early days of aviation. Overall,
                    however, the book is an excellent read and wellresearched. While the accolades to Purdue wear thin
                    after a few chapters, the reader does sense the "can-do" attitude that infected many of these
                    Midwestern aviation pioneers.</p>

                <p>Because Daniel K. Richter's <hi rend="i">Ordeal of the Longhouse</hi> (1991) remains a standard in
                    the field, scholars in frontier and American Indian history greatly anticipated this follow-up
                    monograph. To be sure, Richter does many things equally well in this newer book, bringing in
                    environmental, cultural, medical, religious, economic, and agricultural history as well as
                    linguistics, anthropology, and archaeology. Focusing on cis-<placeName>

                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1836. Richter considers how the Indians viewed their lives, cultures, religions, and
                    societies prior to European contact. He establishes the Indian understanding of the world and then
                    gradually brings in the European (and sometimes African) cultures, ethnicities, religions, and
                    personalities.</p>
                <p>By alternating between a native voice and an objective voice, the author demonstrates how one culture
                    and people encountered and shaped another. Richter writes well-even hauntingly-from the Indian
                    perspective. He expertly interweaves the impersonal and personal, the metaand the micro-histories.
                    Indeed, Richter is a very good storyteller and whether he writes of Pocahontas ("mischievous girl"),
                    the Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha ("The Lily of the Mohawks"), or William Apess, each figure becomes not
                    only a well-realized person but also a key figure in North American history.</p>
                <p>My only criticism of the book comes from Richter's seeming inability to give serious credence to
                    European cultures, religions, and ideas when he writes in a more objective voice. At his weakest
                    moments-and, admittedly, they are very few and far between-Richter focuses so much on the Indian
                    point of view that the book reads as a simple morality tale: Indians happy and noble, Europeans dour
                    and exploitative. This is true in his discussions of both the Roman Catholic theology of sainthood
                    and traditions, and of the results of American republican thought in the founding period.</p>
                <p>Richter is, of course, writing mainly about American Indians, with issues such as republican theory
                    on the periphery. But what is said at the fringes can be revealing. For example, in dealing with
                    Apess's history of America, Richter writes: "Apess remained silent on the racial beliefs and
                    practices of the slaveowning <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (p. 248). To dismiss Apess for this silence is to discount <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s importance in the eventual destruction of the institution of slavery. Such dismissals
                    do Richter's otherwise fine scholarship a disservice.</p>
                <p>Regardless of this criticism, Richter's is a brilliant work of American, Indian, and frontier
                    history, dovetailing nicely with the pathbreaking Indian history works of Bernard Sheehan, David
                    Edmunds, Susan Sleeper-Smith, and Richard White. While perhaps not as profound as <hi rend="i"
                        >Ordeal of the Longhouse,</hi> it has much to offer and will remain a significant work for some
                    time to come.</p>

                    </placeName>'s agreement, Cunningham argues, temporarily caused an estrangement between them, and

                    </placeName> often turned to Jefferson for advice, especially on foreign policy. Cunningham
                    emphasizes the reciprocal nature of the <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-101-2-070"/> friendship, as
                    Jefferson in turn sought <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s help in founding the University of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, convincing the sitting president to become a member of the board of visitors. In

                    </placeName> to sell his Albemarle home. Fittingly, concludes Cunningham, these two friends, who

                    4-Jefferson in 1826, <placeName>

                <p>Intended for a general audience, this nicely written, carefully researched, generously illustrated

                <p>Sometimes a period of time seems to focus events, trends, and meanings in such a way that it defines
                    an era, casts a deep shadow, or fixes the terms of collective experience for a generation. In living
                    memory, December 7,1941, the year 1968, and September 11, 2001, stand out as examples of such
                    focusing. Historians of the early American republic have recently been drawn to similar red-letter

                    1846, a sprawling epic, the print equivalent of a four-hour cinematic extravaganza, that brought
                    into brilliant perspective a number of easily overlooked events converging on the Polk
                    administration (itself easily overlooked) that truly redefined America.</p>
                <p>Now comes C. Edward Skeen with 1816: <hi rend="i">America Rising.</hi> Never one to indulge his own
                    ego, Skeen wisely acknowledges the probability (proved out by this reviewer) of being compared to
                    other one-year studies, protests (correctly) that his work began long before the two most recent
                    examples of the genre, and takes steps (also correctly) to disabuse the reader who might think that
                    he wants to claim for 1816 anything like the panoramic impact of De Voto's Wagnerian drama. But
                    1816: <hi rend="i">America Rising</hi> nevertheless brings together in one convenient account a
                    remarkable convergence of events, trends, and surprises that amply reward the attention given them
                    by the author (and readers) of this nifty volume.</p>
                <p>Specialists know that 1816 found a place in living memories (at least above the 35th parallel) as the
                    "year without a summer." Skeen reviews reports of hard frost in June as far south as Steubenville, <placeName>

                <p>Add to this freakish weather volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, sun spots, and eclipses of the sun and
                    the moon, and some people cast their minds on Biblical end times. This year seemed to people at the
                    time to mark a turning point-perhaps the turning point-in American history, and even human history.</p>
                <p>Following this dramatic setup, Skeen reviews in clear, readable prose the American situation at the
                    close of the War of 1812 with special attention to political issues that exercised "men of
                    affairs"-and have exercised most historians since. The twists and turns of the Fourteenth Congress
                    are lovingly displayed in four chapters that highlight the tariff and bank controversies, the
                    horrible Compensation Act, and the ever-puzzling dilemma of internal improvements. Stepping away
                    from congressional debates, Skeen examines July 4th celebrations as national ritual that was taking
                    on recognizable liturgical form. One chapter focuses on national defense and the much-needed reform
                    of militias and the national army, another on state-level problems that forced Supreme Court
                    decisions with national implications. Finally, the birth of sentimental and humanitarian movements
                    receives a nice overview in two chapters that track, among other things, the founding of new
                    prisons, Bible societies, peace movements, and a national society dedicated to the emancipation and
                    removal of African American slaves which resulted in the creation of <placeName>

                    rendering of at least some of what worried the American people at the dawn of the nation's second
                    generation. Adequate notes and a bibliographic essay will guide interested readers further into the

                <p>Born out of a series of epic confrontations with some of the nation's largest corporations, and
                    occupying a highly visible place as one of America's largest and most visionary unions, the United
                    Auto Workers (UAW) fascinated observers during its glory days and has since received considerable
                    attention from labor historians. Recent scholarship has tended to be critical of the UAW,
                    questioning both the collective bargaining and social achievements of the union and its most
                    prominent leader, Walter Reuther. In this sweeping history of the first four decades of the UAW,
                    John Barnard flatly rejects this view and describes the UAW as an "American vanguard" at the
                    forefront of efforts to humanize the workplace and fashion a social contract more favorable to
                    working-class Americans.</p>
                <p>Barnard vividly recounts and astutely analyzes the shop-floor, intraunion, and political dynamics
                    surrounding the UAW's formation. Throughout the union's history, disputes over such crucial issues
                    as the pace of work, supervisory treatment, job security, and adequate compensation inspired auto
                    worker activism. Shop-floor militants-mostly socialists and communists-successfully united a diverse
                    labor force and capitalized on a rare historical convergence of impaired credibility of top
                    corporate leadership, state and public tolerance of militant labor action, and self-portrayal of
                    union actions as upholding important American principles. Yet, as Barnard soberly notes, even after
                    electrifying triumphs at General Motors in 1937 and Ford in 1941, the UAW leadership's broader
                    ambitions were thwarted by GM's <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-101-2-073"/> insistence on the preservation
                    of management rights and a conservative backlash that defeated UAW efforts to gain political power
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
                <p>After a bruising decade-long factional struggle for control of the union, Reuther became UAW
                    president in 1946 and the most eloquent post-World War II advocate of a broader social role for
                    labor. In contrast to scholars who have charged that Reuther too readily ceded managerial authority
                    to the auto makers in return for wage and benefit improvements, Barnard insists that the union
                    continued to sanction resistance to heavy-handed management on the shop floor. For Barnard, "the
                    conservative postwar political climate effectively precluded any other course" (p. 288), and under
                    the circumstances, Reuther and the UAW fashioned an impressive workplace compact that markedly
                    improved the lives of auto workers and their families.</p>
                <p>Barnard acknowledges that Reuther and the UAW were often frustrated in the political arena. Reuther
                    repeatedly tried but failed to establish a tripartite business, government, and labor administration
                    of economic affairs; and although the union reshaped <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> politics along social democratic lines, its hopes for an ideological realignment of the
                    national Democratic Party failed to materialize. Barnard notes that in spite of Reuther's
                    impassioned rhetoric on behalf of African Americans, farm workers, the poor, and the economically
                    displaced, his refusal to offend Lyndon B. Johnson by openly opposing the president's <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> policy undermined his ability to lead a revitalized progressive movement. Nevertheless,
                    Barnard does not fully account for Reuther's inability to activate broader labor support for his
                    political agenda.</p>
                <p>Exhaustively researched and crisply written, Barnard's book provides a thoughtful and often
                    persuasive counterpoint to those scholars who have criticized the UAW but not fully appreciated the
                    social and political constraints limiting its options. Yet at times, Barnard's critical judgment is
                    dulled by his reliance on sources close to Reuther and the UAW leadership-a close circle of
                    one-party rule embodying the form of democracy but not the spirit. Barnard's evidence suggests that
                    while the UAW never quite fulfilled its hopes of becoming an "American vanguard," it did succeed in
                    bringing dignity to thousands of workers and consistently sought to link labor's progress to the
                    advancement of the public good. <hi rend="i">American Vanguard</hi> performs a valuable service in
                    spotlighting these achievements and reclaiming the UAW's important social legacy.</p>

                    </placeName> Press, 2004. Pp. x, 339. Tables, notes, index. $29.95.)</head>
                <p>In <hi rend="i">The Anxieties of Affluence</hi> Daniel Horowitz provides an in-depth intellectual
                    history overview of the critics of America's culture of abundance. In so doing, he admirably
                    complements his <hi rend="i">The Morality of Spending</hi> (1985), which examined the topic during
                    the period from 1875 to 1940. For Horowitz, the distinctiveness of latetwentieth century critiques
                    of consumer society lies in a new puritanism or ethic of self-restraint found alongside the
                    democratic discourse of achieving satisfaction through commercial goods and services. He begins with
                    the Second World War, when Lewis Mumford and others in the Office of Price Administration sought to
                    mobilize the war effort into a promotion of "chastened consumption" by encouraging citizens to
                    reject materialism, embrace the good life, and fight for the principles of democracy and community.
                    In an excellent study of two emigres, Ernest Dichter and George Katona, Horowitz sets out the early
                    Cold War context in which American democracy was equated with mass consumption as consumers were
                    encouraged to spend their way toward prosperity and away from the social and economic instabilities
                    that had ravaged Europe. Nevertheless, anxieties remained, and Horowitz steers his way through ideas
                    on the morality of the market by focusing on a number of key figures: J. K. Galbraith, Vance
                    Packard, Betty Friedan, Paul Goodman, Oscar Lewis, Martin Luther King, Jr., Rachel Carson, David
                    Potter, Michael Harrington, Ralph Nader, and Paul Ehrlich. His narrative ends with a study of Daniel
                    Bell, Christopher Lasch, and Robert Bellah, three figures who symbolized the change in the critique
                    of affluence in the 1970s, as the energy crisis made abundance no longer a moral problem for the
                    rich but a problem for all. Significantly, President Jimmy Carter drew on the jeremiads of all three
                    in his infamous 1979 "malaise" speech in which he suggested that the problems of American society
                    lay not in the policies of his government but in the people who increasingly turned inwards towards
                    self-gratification.</p>
                <p>Throughout, Horowitz emphasizes the persistence of modern moralism in an age of affluence but also
                    stresses important changes. Critics in the 1950s targeted the psychological problems of
                    comparatively wealthy suburbanites, although by the 1960s the focus shifted towards critiques which
                    would inspire alternative visions and social movements-King's civil rights, Nader's consumer
                    protectionism, and Ehrlich's environmentalism. Horowitz stresses the hegemony of the Cold War
                    consensus in the 1950s which equated democracy and mass consumption. A good intellectual historian,
                        <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-101-2-075"/> he highlights the power of books both to inspire movements
                    and to reset the terms of public discussion.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the only criticism of Horowitz's narrative is that it implicitly celebrates those
                    alternatives to consumerism that the author finds personally inspirational. A brief epilogue
                    highlights the promotion of excess that immediately followed Carter's dour warnings and then passes
                    over the next two decades to examine the recent popular "post-moralist celebrations of affluence"
                    (p. 254): that no post-9/11 critiques of consumerism exist (save those of Islamic fundamentalists),
                    and that Americans are once again being encouraged to spend their way out of trouble. Such selection
                    both reflects the political proclivities of a generation of historians and denies the popularity of
                    continuing critiques of consumer society. One might see Horowitz's narrative of market anxieties as
                    the legacy of modern moralism, so often reflected in historical treatments of consumer society that
                    end on a pessimistic note (usually around in 1980). On the other hand, the approach ignores the
                    significance of texts such as Naomi Klein's <hi rend="i">No Logo</hi> (2001), interesting not so
                    much for her actual arguments but because a whole new generation of social activists, concerned with
                    the global excesses of consumer society, have embraced her aims. As Horowitz's earlier book
                    demonstrates, there has been a long-standing critique of the market-suggesting that it is unlikely
                    that criticism will come to an end now. However, in his focus on the period 1940-1980, his analysis
                    of the continuities between the likes of Mumford, Galbraith, Nader, and Lasch is unlikely to be

                <p>For many people, especially those who travel, daily life bears sharp reminders that things have not
                    been the same since September 11th. In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, too, there has been a dramatic increase in airport security. We seem to have lost our
                    innocence. However, the scholars who contribute to this valuable collection of essays placing the
                    events of September 11th <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-101-2-076"/> in historical perspective argue that
                    there was no Western innocence to be lost suddenly in the devastation caused by the deliberate
                    crashing of four American jets. There is never a complete severance, according to editor Joanne
                    Meyerowitz, between the before and after of a great historical rupture. Instead, we may discern
                    intricate connections, however unpalatable, between the terrorist attacks and U.S. foreign policy,
                    reaching back at the very least to the aftermath of the Second World War, and perhaps to the
                    imperialist intervention of western countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.</p>
                <p>This collection of essays serves as an antidote to the amnesia fostered by a passive media and
                    political administrations to provide us with a complex multiperspectival understanding of our world
                    and an imperative to see our local and national milieu in a broader global context. Those of us who
                    teach American Studies outside the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> have long been critical of the parochialism that we have perceived among Americans in
                    understanding international relations. In the aftermath of September 11th we noted two predominant
                    reactions from Americans: one, an intense nationalism and insistence upon a patriotic consensus that
                    divided the world into an "us" and a "them"; the other, an intensely unpopular and publicly
                    disparaged view that demanded a major revision of foreign policy to recognize American culpability
                    and seek a greater understanding of non-American peoples and cultures. These essays lay out the case
                    for the latter reaction by showing the consequences of U.S. self-interest on those regions of the
                    world that have possessed strategic political and economic importance to the nation. The work of
                    scholars applying a transnational view of political and cultural relations, this collection also
                    helps to explain the interdependency of nations and the complexities of balancing national
                    self-interest against world peace.</p>
                <p>One essay stands out in the collection because of its domestic focus and study of the immediate
                    impact of the attack on ordinary citizens. Contrary to the images of an aggressive nationalism and a
                    presidential rhetoric that promised retribution, Mary Marshal Clark's preliminary report of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> University Oral History Narrative and Memory Project reveals a depth of humanitarianism
                    as well as a yawning gap between America's political leaders and its citizens. This
                    thought-provoking piece contrasts individual experience with official and mediatized narratives to
                    reveal both the different and shared meanings of the event for people from a wide range of social
                    and ethnic backgrounds.</p>
                <p>The collection is well organized, with a useful overview by Meyerowitz, abstracts at the beginning of
                    each essay, and an appendix of key primary source documents to which the contributors refer in their
                    presentations. The essays address U.S. <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-101-2-077"/> intervention in the
                    Middle East, antiAmericanism in Muslim countries, religious fundamentalism, foreign policy, and
                    American nationalism, and should allow students and general readers to appreciate and debate the
                    ramifications of national policies and the responsibilities of world citizenship.</p>

                <p>The Society of Friends, or Quakers, has long attracted the attention of scholars and activists,
                    particularly at times of social stress or crisis when their Friendly determination to stand against
                    the dominant society has made their witness relevant to contemporary concerns. Since the end of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> era, issues such as conscientious objection have become less urgent, and the Quakers,
                    together with the Amish and Mennonites, have fallen into sectarian obscurity. Their philosophy is
                    viewed as possessing little pertinence to the major social issues of the day, despite the ongoing
                    toll which violence takes in our turbulent world.</p>

                    community in the early twenty-first century. Hamm begins with participant-observer accounts of four <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> worship sessions, each illustrative of the major divisions <pb n="194"

                    distinctive <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> beliefs and practices and the evangelical and liberal strains in the larger cultures of
                    American Protestant Christianity. The resultant impression is that the amiable gentleman on the box
                    of oatmeal is about as representative of American Quakers as the old image of Aunt Jemima was
                    reflective of African American realities.</p>

                    assesses in terms of the congruence between current strategies and Friendly tradition. Hamm also

                    </placeName> communities which the author limned in his opening survey. Although the issues raised
                    here have often been presented in terms of classic Weberian sociology, Hamm avoids any overt
                    methodological constructs and approaches his material from a humanistic perspective. In this he is

                <p>With every book, it seems, Michael Kammen has edged closer to identifying himself with the
                    art-historical subset of the historical profession. With this lavishly illustrated volume, he has
                    taken the final step in that direction. Although he does examine the work of essayists and thinkers
                    caught up in American nature imagery (such as Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, Hal Borland, and
                    Donald Grant <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a. k. a. "Ik Marvel"), the book is most appealing on the basis of Kammen's assemblage
                    of actual pictures showing the iconography of seasonal change. These run the gamut from Fanny
                    Palmer's several series of popular nineteenth-century prints for Currier &amp; Ives, including
                        <hi rend="i">The Four Seasons of Life,</hi> to high art painting, to relatively obscure modern
                    works by James McGarrell <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-101-2-079"/> and Lisa Zwerling. The styles vary,
                    too, from the homely naturalism of Currier &amp; Ives, who see the seasons as the creeping
                    infirmities of mankind, to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>
                    </placeName> Johns, for whom Summer (1986-1987) is a witty collage of images from sources ranging
                    from the <hi rend="i">Mono Lisa</hi> to the American flag.</p>
                <p>The tradition of art and decoration based on the theme of the seasons is, of course, older than
                    Virgil or Ovid. The seasons tie the natural cycle of the year to that of the individual. When
                    Persephone vanishes into the underworld, the flowers go with her, at least until spring comes again.
                    In the work of the Hudson River painter Thomas Cole, empires rise and fall according to the rhythms
                    of the day and the seasons. The progress of the school year is neatly traced by a calendar of
                    holiday seasons, beginning with Halloween and ending some time after Easter in the brave flutter of
                    Memorial Day flags. The illustrated calendar, as <placeName>

                    </placeName> Rockwell's still-popular designs demonstrate, articulates the passage of time through
                    changes in the seasons-whether natural or manufactured by the greeting card industry and the U.S.
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>Americans relationship to the natural environment, from the very beginning, was surely influenced by
                    the fact that the nation lacked a lengthy history. We had no castles on the Rhine, no time-blackened
                    cathedrals, no ancient texts, but we did have a physical place of astonishing variety, beauty, and
                    expanse. This place-ever changing over time, yet always dominant and present in the imagination-is
                    our link to antiquity. It is the warrant on which we act, the standard by which all things are
                    measured. The planting, the cultivating, the harvesting, and the waiting are the cyclical signs that
                    unite us with the land, each season with its singular beauties. Spring always comes again, with its
                    promise of an America that is, without the impediments of castles and cathedrals, forever young.</p>
                <p>Kammen's <hi rend="i">A Time to Every Purpose</hi> is a book for a wide range of purposes. It is a
                    meditation on time, faith, nostalgia, anti-urbanism, and the astonishing diversity with which a
                    single notion can be expressed in a variety of media. This is history at its very best, open to
                    every possible morsel of evidence, each one treated with deep respect for its intrinsic character
                    and meaning.</p>

                <p>Arcadia Publishing has become known for its photographic histories of U. S. cities and counties. Its
                        <hi rend="i">Making of America</hi> series, in contrast, offers a traditional narrative history
                    with pictures as accompaniment. Tenuth's book is recommendable to anyone seeking a short and
                    substantial history of Indiana's capitol, as he argues that the city's placement in the middle of
                    the state-far away from river transportation-produced a metropolis sufficiently flexible to prosper
                    throughout its history. Although Tenuth keeps his focus on business and transportation history, he
                    also covers the city's politics and makes an occasional foray into cultural history. The
                    illustrations are wide-ranging and well-chosen, and the bibliography will be useful to many readers,

                <p>Eberhard Reichmann, professor emeritus of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, introduces the
                    reproduction of a short 1936 biography of Rudolph Schwarz, one of the sculptors of the Indiana
                    Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument. Published for the monument's 2002 centennial, the volume highlights
                    the impact of German American heritage on Indiana art and architecture: Stempfel, Schwarz, Schwarz's
                    friend Karl Bitter, monument architect Bruno Schmitz, and the rest of the design and building team
                    were all German immigrants. The volume also contains images of these men and of examples of their

                                    could identify some of them by shoes they wore and pant legs of trousers.</p>
                                <p>Also, I was an elected sheriff of <placeName>

                                    was denied, and he was returned by me to serve the balance of his life sentence. The
                                    article was real interesting to me as I saw it in action.</p>
                                <p>Also in the 1960s they [the Klan] had what I think was their last meeting held at

                                    approval for the meeting, and the only restrictions I gave to them were No Cross
                                    Burnings and No Disorderly Conduct. They had the meeting and I never heard from them
