                    planners because of the high rate of farm tenancy, the large average size of farms, the declining
                    population of the rural areas, the poor tenant homes that do not harmonize with the richness of the
                    surrounding soil, and a type of farming which for two generations has been depleting the soil and

                    </placeName>, has had an agricultural history sharply different from that of southern Indiana. In
                    three prairie counties, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>, Newton, and White, more than half of the farms are operated by tenants and in three

                  <region type="county">Jasper</region>, <region type="county">Warren</region>
               </placeName> and Tip-pecanoe, over 40% are tenant operated. On the <placeName>

                    </placeName> side of the Grand <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> the rate of tenancy is even higher. Contrast this with the sixteen counties in southern
                    Indiana which have less than 20% of their farms operated by tenants The largest farms in
                    Indiana are also to be found in the prairie counties. Two farms totaling over 17,000 acres are
                    reported from Newton County, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>
                    </placeName> and Newton each contain eleven other farms over 1,000 acres in size. In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> and Newton Counties, the average size of farms is well over 200 acres, and, in White, <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName>, it is over 160 acres. In few southern counties does the average size of farms exceed

                    while in the rest of the state it is in the other direction. Counties having the highest land values
                    per acre have the largest farm units and counties with low land values have on the average small
                    farms. One may not be surprised, therefore, to note that the rural population of the richest
                    counties in Indiana has declined in recent years more, in some cases, than the rural population of
                    less wealthy counties.</p>
            <p>Another striking fact concerns <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                    </placeName>, the richest of the agricultural counties in proportion to its size. Despite its great
                    agricultural wealth, the farmers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                    </placeName> do not seem to be as well housed as are the farmers of eleven other Indiana counties
                    which report higher valuations of farm dwellings. One reason for the disparity is that these other
                    counties have lower tenancy ratings than <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>, and the value of dwellings on owner-operated farms is generally higher than on tenant
                    farms. Perhaps the residents of few areas of Indiana today feel satisfied that their past farming
                    policies have been based on proper soil conservation practices but it is in the prairie counties
                    that the greatest concern should be felt. Here the soil has been depleted to an alarming degree,
                    particularly on tenant operated farms, here the land has been tilled more consistently to grain
                    production, and here, in the twentieth century, livestock has been somewhat neglected.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A study of the early settlement of the prairie counties reveals that responsibility for the high
                    degree of tenancy, the large farms, the declining population, the poor tenant homes, and the soil
                    depletion is to be attributed in part to the operation of the land system in the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Solon Robinson, writing in February, 1835, from his home in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, expressed the view that if the public lands of northwestern Indiana were not
                    offered for public sale until 1836 and if preemption rights were granted by Congress, the area would
                    be well taken up by settlers who would be able to acquire ownership of their claims. This, said
                    Robinson, "will prevent non-residents from obtaining large bodies of land; a circumstance
                    which always injures the rapid growth of a country.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>" Robinson was

                    of the state in 1836, but he was correct in calling attention to that feature of the national land
                    policy to which many of the later land and agricultural problems owe their existence—the
                    cash sale system.</p>
            <p>The Land Ordinance of 1785 and subsequent laws had placed no restrictions upon the amount of public
                    land that individuals or groups could acquire at the government offices, and it was not until after
                    1862 that any serious attempts were made to restrict land entries. The policy of unlimited sales and
                    unrestricted transfer of titles made possible land monopolization by speculators, who acquired most
                    of the choice lands in certain areas, notably in the Military Tract of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> This resulted in the early disappearance of cheap or free land
                    and the emergence of tenancy. In Indiana the dead hand of the speculator created many problems which
                    were to stunt the growth and waste the resources of some sections of the state. It is interesting to
                    note that Robinson criticized non-resident owners, but did not raise his voice against resident
                    speculators, with one of the largest of whom in Northern Indiana he had close business relations.</p>

                    1835 to 1837 and again in 1847 to 1857 whole townships were swept into the control of absentee
                    proprietors and holdings of 5,000 and 10,000 acres were widely established while holdings of 50,000
                    to 100,000 acres were not unknown. The fertile state of Indiana naturally attracted the attention of

                    either of settling upon or improving them.</p>
            <p>It was in southern Indiana that the lands were first opened to entry and here they were generally
                    taken up before the speculative boom of the middle eighteen-thirties got under way. This section was
                    early overrun by squatters who settled promiscuously over the land before it was offered for sale,
                    made improvements, and organized claim associations to provide a quasi-legal land and title
                    registration system in the absence of government action. The claim association was also a mutual
                    protective organization to assist its members against claim-jumpers or speculators who might try to
                    seize or buy their homes.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Having settled, the squatters petitioned Congress to
                    grant them preemption rights, and Congress, responsive to appeals from pioneer farmers, granted the
                    coveted preemption privilege in a series of special acts. When squatters' appeals did not
                    bring congressional action, the pioneers had another means of safeguarding their homes against
                    outsiders who might attend the auction sale to buy the choice claims. This was to appear <hi rend="i">en masse</hi> at the sale and by intimidation or force prevent competitive bidding. Of
                    course, the squatters had to purchase their lands at the minimum price of $1.25 per acre
                    and when they lacked the cash they had, perforce, to borrow from "loan sharks" at
                    extortionate rates of interest—thirty-two and forty-eight percent—but they
                    preserved their equity, at least temporarily. Thus squaters got title to their lands in southern
                    Indiana, even though they took the law into their own hands to protect their
                    "rights," and they made the land system more democratic in its operation than its
                    framers intended.</p>

            <p>In central Indiana there was even less large-scale speculative purchasing than in the south. Here
                    most of the land passed directly from the government to actual settlers.</p>
            <p>The land system worked the least satisfactorily in northern Indiana, especially in the prairie
                    counties. Here the speculators, both absentee and resident, acquired enormous tracts of land before
                    the actual settlers appeared and when the immigrants began to come into the country they found that
                    the lands had long since passed into private hands and could only be acquired at high prices. An
                    area which, from the outset had labored under numerous handicaps to its settlement had now added to
                    them the retarding effect of large speculators' holdings.</p>
            <p>From the first appearance of the white men in Indiana the prairies were regarded with disfavor and
                    they were slow to attract settlers. Their streams were sluggish, meandering and difficult of
                    navigation; their soil was suspected of being infertile; their lack of forest cover gave them no
                    protection against the wintry blasts and greatly increased the costs of building, fencing and fuel;
                    their low relief and poor drainage made parts of them difficult to cultivate until they were
                    drained, and the constant existence of surface water that was used for drinking purposes, produced
                    fevers, chills and other bodily disturbances which were attributed to the unhealthy nature of the
                    prairies. The unfavorable character given to this section by some early writers likewise proved a
                    handicap to the settlement of the region. As Richard Power has well shown,<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                    immigrants preferred to go farther west in their search for land rather than settle in an area in

                    therefore, to find him selecting the treeless prairie section of Indiana for a field of investment
                    and permanent location. It is probable that on one of his trips to or from the Indian country,
                    Ellsworth first viewed the <placeName>

            <p>In 1835 Ellsworth became Commissioner of Patents to which position he was strongly attracted as it
                    enabled him to witness all the important mechanical progress that was being made in the country. He
                    was especially interested in farm machinery such as ditching machines, steam plows, and fencing
                    devices. But more than anything else he wished to make this bureau an agency which would aid the
                    farmers as well as industry. He felt, perhaps, rightly, that "For commerce and

                    advocate of prairie farming. The prestige of his official position as Commissioner of Patents and

                    drawn by three or four yoke of oxen. Only a few pioneer farmers could afford to buy or hire such
                    equipment, but on a large farm the cost per acre of breaking the sod was of course considerably
                    reduced and Ellsworth found his cost of prairie breaking much less than he had anticipated. When the
                    steam plow was introduced in the fifties he was as delighted as a child with a new toy and he was a
                    firm believer in its future importance. Large scale operations and the use of machinery for seeding,
                    cultivating, and harvesting further reduced Ellsworth's costs of production and convinced
                    him for a time that the prairie could be inexpensively cultivated and at large profits but far
                    better in large farm units than in small ones.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>Ellsworth wavered in his judgment as to the relative advantages of prairie cultivation and cattle
                    raising. In 1837 he advised absentee proprietors to cultivate their lands through tenants and hired
                    labor and held out to them hopes of high returns on their investments.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Four
                    years later, he discovered that prairie cultivation required too large an investment of capital for
                    fencing, plowing, and labor and he urged the non-resident owners to graze cattle on their holdings.
                    They could get $1 to $2 per acre for pasturing cattle and, at this rate, he
                    estimated their land would be worth from $16 to $50 per acre.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> In 1846, Ellsworth's faith in grain raising in the <placeName>

                    however, after a bad grain season, he wrote: "I am satisfied that stock raising at the west
                    is much more profitable than growing small grain…. The profits of wheat appear well in
                    expectation on papers, but this prospect is blasted by a severe winter, appearance of insects, a
                    want of harvesting, bad weather in harvesting, in threshing … and lastly, a fluctuation
                    of the market itself." That Ellsworth had a foreboding of evils to come is seen by the

                    the soil qualities of the prairie section might have been less seriously depleted in recent years.</p>
            <p>The Panic of 1837 forced the contraction of Ellsworth's plans for a time but by the middle
                    forties, when business conditions were improving, he began to plunge more deeply into the purchase
                    of land. At the <placeName>

                    warrants which he could buy from sixty-five to $1.10 per acre.</p>
            <p>Ellsworth wished to attract both capital and settlers to the prairies. He reasoned that each
                    additional investment whether by absentee proprietors or settlers would make the prairies better
                    known and further their development. To call attention to the prairie country he prepared a booklet
                    with the title, <hi rend="i">Valley of the Upper <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                    published in 1838. Restrained in tone in comparison with some of the current guide books, the work
                    cannot be considered too optimistic in its description of the prairies. True, the cost of fencing is
                    seriously understated and the probable profits from prairie farming are equally overestimated. Also
                    too much space is devoted to discussions of the cultivation of flax, sugar beets, tobacco and hemp
                    and not enough to problems of pioneer life on the prairies. Nor is the description of the <placeName>

                    were classified as "swamp" but were merely prairie lands which were wet for part

                    speculator ownership than in the prairie counties of Indiana and in few other sections did the dead

            <p>By 1855 all the public land in Indiana had been disposed of and yet vast stretches of the state were
                    totally unimproved. Absentee proprietorship and high land prices were to a large extent responsible

            <p>Many of the absentee proprietors bought their tracts as simple speculations. It was their intention
                    to hold the land until rising prices, which they could reasonably expect within a generation, should
                    enable them to sell at a profit. They had no intention of improving their land or in any other way
                    aiding in their development of the prairies. When taxes were assessed against their property for
                    local improvements many of them delayed payment as long as possible. The Ellsworth lands and those
                    of other easterners were delinquent in tax payments in <placeName>

                    for schools and roads they were forced to tax their own property more heavily to compensate for the
                    unimproved lands of the nonresidents who paid little or nothing into the treasury.</p>
            <p>Farm tenancy early appeared in the prairie counties of Indiana and developed rapidly there in
                    contrast to the southern counties where its growth was slow. From the outset Ellsworth had planned
                    to improve his possessions by plating tenants upon them who would after the initial start, continue
                    to break up and cultivate new land, construct fences and buildings and otherwise increase the value
                    of the property. Meantime, they would be paying rent amounting to one-third of the crops they
                    raised. Ellsworth's <hi rend="i">Valley of the Upper <placeName>

               </hi> described his plan of placing tenants upon the land and it was set forth as an
                    inducement to attract capitalists to prairie investments.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> It is remarkable
                    that Ellsworth was criticized neither by the press of Indiana, including the farm journals, nor by
                    politicians for proposing to introduce into pioneer Indiana an institution which all agreed was
                    un-American. Indeed, until well after 1860 one finds politicians praising the American land system
                    because it was, according to them, building up a nation of farm owners, and was not permitting such
                    an alien institution as tenancy to develop. Yet here was Ellsworth publicly inviting capitalists to
                    invest funds through him in Indiana where tenants could be attracted to the lands.</p>

            <p>Nor were Ellsworth and the "Yale Crowd" the only nonresident capitalists who

                    easterners bought tracts of land as permanent investments to be developed by tenants. When such
                    easterners appeared in a community where the land office was located, they were welcomed by the
                    local press, feted by the "prominent citizens," and encouraged to invest in the
                    area provided they did not attempt to encroach upon the rights of squatters who had claims on public

                    Few sections could be drained satisfactorily without securing the cooperation of owners of adjacent
                    lands but where the owner was a non-resident, or Ellsworth himself, the chances of assistance were
                    slight. Immigrants were unwilling to put themselves to much expense of time or labor to ditch lands,
                    the benefit of which would largely go to the landlord in increased land values. The alternative to
                    farming was the cattle industry, but capital was necessary for this and the ordinary immigrant
                    lacked it. The prairie possessions of absentee proprietors, therefore, had little to offer
                    impoverished immigrants who were seeking cheap land.</p>
            <p>The more substantial immigrants who brought with them to the West considerable sums of money were
                    likewise not attracted to the prairie counties. Ellsworth, Sturges, and other proprietors were
                    holding their lands for five and ten dollars an acre which, added to the cost of bringing the
                    prairie under cultivation, made them high in price, even taking into consideration their great
                    fertility. From 1840 to 1860, there yet remained equally fertile public land in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> which could be bought for $1.25 an acre. Later, lands in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>

                    </placeName> were thrown open to entry. After 1862 land could be acquired free under the Homestead
                    Act. Some of this land was as close to railroads as was the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                    </placeName> land which until the late sixties, remained quite distant from transportation lines.
                    Immigrants with capital, unless they were attracted to a particular area because of the earlier
                    settlement there of friends or other members of their own nationality, frequently, preferred to move
                    to undeveloped areas where the land was still open to entry or where they could acquire it cheaply.
                    By so doing they could profit from the rising value which subsequent settlement would give to their
                    claims and they, like the absentee speculators, generally bought more than they could carry.</p>
            <p>It may be argued that it was not the speculators but the wet lands which deterred immigrants from
                    settling in the prairie counties. It is true that the extremely wet lands could not be cultivated
                    until they were drained and that their drainage would call for heavy financial expenditures.
                    Unfortunately, the absentee proprietors were either unable or unwilling to invest more capital in
                    lands which still brought <pb n="22" id="VAA4025-035-1-028"/> them no revenue, and the tenants, as
                    has been seen, could scarcely afford to invest their money or very much of their labor in
                    improvements of which they might be dispossessed at any time. Had the lands been democratically
                    owned by farmers operating quarter-section tracts cooperative ditching systems might have been
                    arranged, the reduced costs would not have been insurmountable, and the wet lands would doubtless
                    have been brought under cultivation much sooner.</p>
            <p>Absentee ownership not only kept both the impoverished immigrants and those supplied with capital
                    away from the prairie counties but it also delayed the construction of railroads. Many Indiana
                    counties aided materially in their own developments by liberally subsidizing the construction of
                    railroads through grants or loans. But absentee proprietors were loath to make contributions for
                    this purpose, even though they might be benefitted greatly by the transportation lines. Furthermore,
                    the virtually non-taxable lands of the absentee proprietors so reduced the tax base of the area that
                    the counties could not sell bonds to finance railroad subsidies. Railroad lines which did not need
                    to depend upon local aid for their construction, such as the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, the Monon, and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Peoria, were built through the prairie country in the fifties<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
                    but there yet remained vast stretches of land so far from railroads that transportation costs were
                    prohibitive. Other railroad schemes were proposed but they had to wait until the 'seventies
                    and 'eighties when prairie development had progressed sufficiently to make possible their
                    financing. Before 1870 <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton County</region>
                    </placeName> could not boast a single mile of railroad. Settlers who would have worked hard to
                    secure them by voting county subsidies and by exchanging mortgages on their own lands for bonds of
                    the railroads were not encouraged to settle in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> or other prairie counties, despite the publication of the colorful advertisements of
                    Ellsworth and Sturges.</p>
            <p>In the late fifties most of the prairie land still owned by the original speculators was sold to
                    another group of capitalists who took their places as great landlords.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
                    Ellsworth's eastern associates had grown tired of waiting for their promised $10

                    characteristically speculative in its nature but was more constructive. The new owners were
                    generally Hoosiers who lived in the prairie counties where they had already built up considerable
                    fortunes from the cattle trade, railroad construction, banking and the sale of town lots. They were
                    a part of the community, had grown up with it, and were now showing their confidence in it by
                    investing their surplus at home. They were an aggressive group of men who had the capital and the

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                    </placeName> perhaps the largest landholder was James Goodwin who built up an estate of 10,000
                    acres. In White County John Kious owned an estate of 4,000 acres and Miller Kenton one of 5,000

            <p>These men did not make the mistake of sinking all their money in land but had funds left with which
                    to develop their holdings. Under them began the real improvements upon tracts which had been in
                    private ownership for a generation. They grazed great herds of cattle upon their lands and gradually
                    fenced their tracts. But grain feeding was necessary for part of the year and these prairie kings,
                    so picturesquely described by George Ade, turned to raising corn.</p>
            <p>Increasing land values and taxes made necessary more intensive use of the land than the great
                    proprietors were able to introduce. Cattle and hog raising with grain production as a side line had
                    to be reversed and grain raising became the principal method of farming the prairies. The large
                    estates were gradually broken up into small tenant farms and a system of crop sharing was
                    introduced. The tenants were frequently drawn from the laborers previously employed by the
                    proprietors.</p>
            <p>When the estates were divided into tenant farms, the owner-manager was no longer needed. Thereafter,

                    the income to be derived from it than with such problems as erosion, soil exhaustion, and declining
                    fertility. They wanted immediate returns, and forgot that land is not inexhaustible. Grain was the
                    principal and safest cash crop from the point of view of the absentee proprietors and tenants, in
                    some cases, were actually discouraged from keeping cattle. A local historian wrote as early as 1883, "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper County</region>
                    </placeName> is still too new, its soil too little exhausted, to encourage or feel the necessity of
                    a regular system of agriculture,"<hi rend="sup">72</hi> but conditions became progressively
                    worse as time passed. The soil was gradually depleted and of course production per acre declined.</p>
            <p>The land system which had worked fairly satisfactorily from the settlers' point of view in
                    southern Indiana in the early part of the nineteenth century failed in its objectives in northern
                    Indiana where great landlords first acquired titles to the land and democratic ownership was
                    subsequently impossible. The preemption law of 1841 was a gesture to actual settlers (squatters) but
                    it did not check speculation, and the homestead act of 1862 came too late. By then all the public
                    lands in Indiana had passed into private hands. There yet remained a large acreage of undeveloped
                    land which, however, was withheld from impoverished immigrants by its high price. Indiana could no
                    longer be a refuge for the poorer class of immigrants who were seeking free or cheap land.</p>
            <p>The first generation of speculators contributed nothing to the development of the prairie country.
                    Even Ellsworth, less a speculator than a promoter, did more harm than good by helping to bring about
                    a speculators' monopoly in the prairie country. When these speculators sold their land it
                    went to a second, more dynamic group of promoters who could partially develop their holdings but who
                    still prevented democratic ownership. When the second series of owners divided their estates into
                    tenant holdings, it was too late for <list type="footnotes">

                    The second, however, contains a serious error. The chapel was not built in 1827, nor did the Rev.

            <p>Before proceeding with the story, it may be mentioned that both of the monuments resulted from the

                    had first encountered as the child of a pioneering family. His are still the fullest available

            <p>Menominee himself, however, appears to have been an unusual personage. The only detailed and
                    firsthand account we have of him was written by the first missionary to come to Twin Lakes after the
                    departure of the French. The Rev. Isaac McCoy, a Baptist minister living at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, refers to Menominee in 1821 as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I had been informed by an Indian trader that on the <geogName>Illinois River</geogName> [He
                            meant <geogName>Yellow River</geogName>], some hundred miles from <placeName>

                            </placeName>, there was a company of religious Putawatomies, at the head of whom was one who
                            was a kind of preacher, whose name was Menominee. As this man exhorted his followers to
                            abstain from ardent spirits and many other vices, and to practice good morals, and as a part
                            of their religious services consisted in praying, we were induced to hope that their minds
                            were somewhat prepared to receive religious instruction…. About the 10th of
                            April, the party of Indians from Twin Lakes came to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                            </placeName>, to see me; and during several days that they remained in that neighborhood, we
                            had much interesting conversation on the subject of religion. The leader [Menominee]
                            professed to have been called, some few years previously, by the Great Spirit, to preach to
                            the Indians that they should forsake their evil practices, among which he enumerated the
                            vices of drunkenness, theft, murder, and many other wicked practices. He had a few
                            followers, the number of whom was increasing. They generally kept close together, and all
                            united in morning and evening worship, at which times they heard a lecture from their
                            leader, and all kneeled and engaged in prayer, all vocally reciting the same words at the
                            same time. While they taught good morals, they appeared wholly ignorant of the leading
                            doctrines of the Bible, which teach that salvation is by Christ. Menominee, however,
                            appeared to be more meek and ready to receive instruction than could have been expected from
                            a wild man who had arrogated to himself claims to be a leader, not only in temporal, but
                            also in spiritual things.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    the federal policy of gradually forcing the Indians away by buying up their lands and transporting
                    them to reserves west of the Missississippi.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The Indiana legislature had
                    concurred in this purpose the previous year.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> By the terms of the treaty
                    Menominee and numerous other chiefs received twenty-two sections of land (14,080 acres) between <placeName>

            <p>On August 27, 1834, another momentous event occurred when the Rev. Louis Deseille, visiting Twin
                    Lakes for the first time, baptized Menominee and several others of the tribe in the area of the
                    lakes "under the branches of an old, shady oak, after some days of

            <p>McDonald believed that the chapel at Twin Lakes was built by Badin in 1827, apparently because of an

                        <p>As early as the day after your departure two new chiefs, whom I had never seen
                                    before, came with all their tribe to ask to be instructed and admitted to prayer.
                                    All the Indians, one after the other, renounced liquor and their superstitious
                                    practices. I could say only a few words to exhort them to imitate Christians in
                                    order to be instructed and learn their prayers. They promised me they would do so as
                                    soon as their maize was planted.</p>
                        <p>I had to do likewise with all the others, who did not stop coming from morning to
                                    evening during the whole week. The number of those who came to prepare themselves
                                    for baptism was also so great that they did not think at all of bringing provisions,
                                    and already hunger was beginning to make itself felt in the camp of the Christians
                                    and catechumens. Therefore it was necessary, before the end of the week, to send
                                    back all of those who lived on the <geogName>Yellow River</geogName>, promising them
                                    that I would see them $he following week.</p>

                                    had already been baptized the summer before took their first communion.</p>
                        <p>Thence I left for the <geogName>Yellow River</geogName>. The number of new arrivals
                                    obliged me to stay six days at this place likewise, and I baptized thirty-seven
                                    savages there. They had erected a little chapel close to the cross I had set up last
                                    autumn, on the same plan as that at <placeName>

                        <p>The chiefs of this reserve, which comprises twenty-two sections, came to offer me a
                                    demi-section [320 acres] upon which to build a church, and another demi-section for
                                    an educational establishment for their children so that they could learn to read and
                                    study.</p>

            <p>McDonald quotes from one of Bishop Bruté's letters a passage which he calls a

                    be the meager recollection of a pioneer settler, John Low-ery: "The building was made of

                    him against subversive activities among the Indians.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> In the light of
                    subsequent events, it appears obvious that Pepper suspected that the missionary was encouraging the
                    Pottawatomi to keep their property in Indiana, when it was the government's policy to
                    deprive them of it. Deseille replied on October 10 following that his only interest was in the
                    spiritual affairs of the Indians, and Pepper assured him on October 20 that, if the law were upheld,
                    all would be well.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the authorities were far from placated. On November 3 John Gibson, Commissary General of
                    Subsistence at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, charged Deseille with supporting the illegal treaty of 1834 and with agitating against
                    the prospective removal by exhorting the Indians to build a church. The Catholic priest countered on
                    December 28 with a strong reiteration of his disinterestedness and with denials of having had
                    anything to do with the treaty or the building of the chapel—except that he approved the
                        latter.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On January 22, 1836, Gibson assured Deseille that the Indians could stay on the reserve "as
                    long as they wished to remain there" and that he could proceed with his ministrations, for
                    on March 21 following, we find the missionary applying to Pepper for an appropriation from the
                    Indian Instruction Funds.</p>
            <p>Apparently the Commissary General had not been informed of what the Indian agent was accomplishing,
                    or the former would not have written thus to Deseille. In the spring of 1836, Pepper was remarkably
                    successful in buying up the Pottawatomi lands, negotiating treaties at Turkey Creek <placeName>

                    which had signed treaties the previous year, Sands found prospects of emigration good everywhere
                    save at Twin Lakes. Here the Indians would hardly listen to him, and Deseille was frank in
                    denouncing the treaty: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Sands recommended that Deseille be silenced and that the Indians receive the money due them
                    ("if any") after the payment of their debts only when they had moved west. Instead
                    of refuting the priest, Col. Pepper ordered him on May 16 either to leave Twin Lakes or to suffer
                    arrest as an undesirable alien. On May 20 Sands explained this to Deseille, accusing him of
                    defending the Pottawatomi only because they had deeded property to the Catholic Church. The
                    missionary departed, declaring that Bishop Reze of <placeName>

                    council at the village, read the treaty to an assemblage of white residents and Indian chiefs, and
                    pointed out that the land now belonged to the government. The reaction, along with
                    Menominee's eloquent speech, is recorded by McDonald:</p>

                    <p>It was plain to those present who were familiar with the Indian character that there was great
                        dissatisfaction among them and a spirit of rebellion which, if not suppressed, would probably
                        lead to serious results. The leader and principal spokesman for the Indians was
                        Me-no-mi-nee…. When Col. Pepper had made his final appeal and all had had their say,
                        Menominee rose to his feet and, drawing his costly blanket around him, is reported by one who
                        was present to have said in substance:</p>
                    <p>"Members of the Council: The President does not know the truth. He, like me, has been
                        imposed upon. He does not know that you made my young chiefs drunk and got their consent and
                        pretended to get mine. He does not know that I have refused to sell my lands, and still refuse.
                        He would not drive me from my home and the graves of my tribe, and my children, who have gone to
                        the Great Spirit, nor allow you to tell me your braves will take me, tied like a dog, if he knew
                        the truth. My brother, the President is just, but he listens to the word of young chiefs who
                        have lied; and when he knows the truth, he will leave me to my own. I have not sold my lands. I
                        will not sell them. I have not signed any treaty, and will not sign any. I am not going to leave
                        my lands, and I do not want to hear anything more about it."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

                    lull of a few weeks followed. Tension became acute between the Indians and the white settlers who
                    wished to occupy the reserve. Some of the latter petitioned the Governor of Indiana, David Wallace,

            <p>This, of course, was not an extraordinarily great proportion of fatalities when it is considered that

                    and the season extremely unhealthful.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Stuart implies that 150 died,<hi rend="sup">65</hi> but this is an exaggeration probably arrived at from Petit's

                            Rev. B. Petit, from Indiana. This Father had been among them six months, and he remained
                            with me two months (propter infirmitatem), to recover his health and strength [he was
                            mortally ill], and then departed from this place on January 2, 1839.</p>
                        <p>By the advice of their pastor, these Indians immediately constructed a church 40 feet long
                            and 22 feet wide; and by means of wood and bark and canvas they raised shanties for a
                            temporary shelter, until they could select a fixed abode. For this purpose, we determined to
                            explore the country, soon after the late addition to our members, and setting out we
                            discovered the land which we now occupy on Sugar Creek…. We remained, however, on
                            the old ground at Pottawatomie Creek, until March, 1839….</p>

                    amazing medical book—a heterogeneous conglomeration of scientific terms, personal
                    philosophy, and recipes for herb medicines. The author, a self-styled physician, was Richard Carter;
                    and the printer —who executed the volume surprisingly well for the year 1825 in the
                    wilderness—was John H. Wilkins of the Commonwealth Office. The title of the book reads in
                    part: "A Valuable, Vegetable, Medical Prescription, with a Table of Detergent and
                    Corroborant Medicines to Suit the Treatment of the Different Certificates"—these
                    certificates being affidavits in favor of Doctor Carter's remarkable and versatile
                        healing.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Viewed as a whole, the contents of this exhausting book are somewhat reminiscent of Burton's

                    it is blasphemous to mention Burton's classic and Doctor Carter's "yarb
                    book" within the same paragraph.</p>
            <p>The latter begins with a long harangue on the inevitability of death—obviously Doctor
                    Carter is preparing his patients for the worst if it should come—and then, as though
                    foreseeing that some day a special article would be written about him, he obligingly set forth an
                    autobiographical sketch.</p>

            <p>Of his childhood Richard Carter regrets only that he did not receive harder and more frequent

                    to Doctor Carter.</p>
            <p>Indeed, during adolescence, his own character suffered from his too often "kissing
                    black-betty"—a subtle way of admitting that he drank too much liquor. However,
                    he finally pulled himself together and set out to see the world.</p>

                    </placeName>, he returned home, entered school once more, and began to take learning seriously. When
                    he had exhausted the local teachers—probably not a very difficult task—he went
                    to visit an uncle living near Marietta, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. There he studied botany and "herbology" under an Indian doctoress
                    "reputed uncommonly skillful." Next he studied under an Indian man, an authority
                    on pulsation, the healing of wounds, and the cure of "cronick complaints" ! Lastly
                    he topped off his education by reading his father's medical books—so diligently
                    that he almost lost his eyesight. No doubt this study accounts for his partly scientific or at least
                    pseudo-scientific vocabulary.</p>

                    </placeName>, no transition is attempted. The book jumps immediately to a series of affidavits that
                    are always long in praise of Doctor Carter and often scathing in comment on his medical colleagues.
                    Strangely enough, these numerous affidavits are usually signed and attested by the same two dozen
                    people. Here is a sample: <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </p>
                        <p>I do certify that in the year of our Lord 1810 I was taken with the dropsy and became very
                            low. I sent for a doctor and mended a little, but never left me but still grew worse for two
                            years. I then applied to Doctor R. Carter, who gave me medicine from which I recruited very
                            much, so that I thought I was well, but it returned again and swelled all over my system. It
                            appears that there wm no chance for my recovery; even my eyes were swelled like bladders of
                            water, and my feet and legs swelled to that degree that they burst and ran a great deal.
                            Then Doctor Carter began to administer medicine to me again … and he continued to
                            give me medicine until I became sound and well, and have not taken any of his medicine for
                            about thirteen months, during which time I have been perfectly well. When I commenced taking
                            medicine of Doctor Carter I was about fifty years of age, and since that I have had a fine
                            daughter. … I have visited Eliza Lasure, whom Doctor Carter attended on, and who
                            was given out to die by all of the family with whom she lived, so that I sent for <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-035-1-050"/> her parents to come and see her die; but Doctor Carter came and
                            attended on her, by which she got immediate relief and soon got well. Likewise another young
                            woman at the same house, by the name of Sarah Silvy, was in a deplorable condition, so that
                            she would die away with fits, and for a long time there would be no appearance of life.
                            Doctor Carter attended on her also, and she soon got well. Given under my hand this 6th day
                            of March 1817.</p>

            <p>Now let us quote Doctor Carter himself in respect to that same case of Sarah Lasure. As is frequently
                    his habit, he presents his report in verse:</p>

                        <p>The dropsy had, as it appears; Who was laid low and almost gone, Until her legs did burst and

                            God's blessing and my skill She was restored, sound and well. Observe the means

            </p>
            <p>But dropsy was not the only disease that Doctor Carter could put to rout. He was equally successful
                    in treating tuberculosis and cancer—if we may believe his affidavits and his case
                    reports: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>This woman was brought low and weak, Consumpted so she scarce could speak; But by my simple

                            she knew not what to do; But by the means which I prepare She nothing has now but the

            <p>Doctor Carter's prescriptions for two such serious maladies as consumption and cancer may
                    well be included here. For consumption, the patient was to "get unslaked lime and put it in
                    water until the water becomes slippery; into a gallon of which you must deposit a little bag
                    containing dried groundivy leaves, horehound roots pulverized, sweet annes seed beat <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-035-1-051"/> fine, and a tablespoonful of English rosin. Take three table-spoonfuls
                    a day in a little new milk and keep to a light cooling diet." The doctor also reports that
                    the lye of hickory saplings "has done wonders" for weak lungs and phthisic.
                    Furthermore, "the patient will do well to take a new-laid egg every morning on a fasting
                    stomach, well mixed with a gill of new milk and half as much fresh spring water, a little loaf
                    sugar, and a little wine."</p>
            <p>For cancer, Doctor Carter suggests a salve to be made from pennyroyal, camomile flowers, mullein, and
                    one-half gallon of apple vinegar. After this mixture has been boiled twenty-four hours, we must add
                    salt and a gill of honey; then we are to simmer the mixture down to a salve—which is to
                    be applied to the cancer with a feather. The salve is to be supplemented by Tereton's drops
                    and later by a wash containing "lapiscalaminaris, salmoniac, corrosive sublimate, and
                    lunarcostic, in a pint of strong wine." To the pioneer <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> physician, it would seem, cancer presented almost no problem, at all!</p>
            <p>Concerning yaws—"which negroes like to have in order to escape
                    labor"—Doctor Carter observes: "The ailment never spreads by miasma
                    floating in the air but by physical contact." His prescription is blue stone or blue
                    vitrol.</p>
            <p>He also has a treatment for diabetes—a curable disease, he believed, in its first stages.
                    He recommends alum—as much alum as can be held on the point of a, case knife in a gill of
                    new milk three times a day. Other medicines for diabetes are elixer of vitrol, jesuits'
                    bark, and good wine.</p>
            <p>His discussion of cataracts is likewise memorable. First of all, Doctor Carter defines, a cataract as
                    being "a membrane in the posterior chamber of the aqueous humor or inspissated pus floating
                    in the aqueous humor." Such cataracts proceed from diseases of the stomach, but treatment
                    should begin by repeated burning of the shins with caustic! Meanwhile eye-water of white vitrol and
                    sugar of lead will be helpful. A related disorder, <hi rend="i">gutta serena</hi>, or palsy of the
                    optic nerve, is treated thus: "Give pukes and cup temples."</p>
            <p>All the preceding remedies, however, are pale in comparison with this one: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>For Gout, Rheumatism, Cramps, and Weak Nerves</p>
                        <p>Kill the fattest young dog that you can get, in the month of March or April; clean him as you
                            would a pig; gut him; and stuff his belly <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-035-1-052"/> with a pint of
                            red fishing worms, a pint of red pepper, a considerable portion of the bark of the root of
                            sassafras, and water frogs; then sew up the incesion, roast the dog well, and save the oil
                            to annoint sores, gouts, weak nerves, etc.—guarding against getting wet and
                            exposure of every kind.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Then he blithely follows with another, of which the title is most amusing: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="center">For Old Running Sore Legs</p>
                        <p>Press the juice out of ripe elderberries and boil it down to the consistency of molasses;
                            then take a tablespoonful of the same, night and morning inwardly, and apply salve (quick
                            silver, aquefortis, tar, and lard) to the sore, abstaining from the use of bacon, cider,
                            spirits, etc. This treatment has cured distressed sore legs and even the consumption when it
                            was entered in the second stage. It is good to keep the bowels open and to cool inward
                            fevers.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Probably the climax of all Doctor Carter's prescriptions is reached in the apparently
                    popular and frequently referred to remedy "for billious, nervous, and putrid fevers, and
                    the pleurisy." Here is the unbelievable remedy: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="center">Receipt the 57th</p>
                        <p>Get a double handful of the bark of the roots of dogwood, a handful of ground ivy, a handful
                            of mullein roots, and a handful of the bark of the roots of sassafras; boil them all well
                            together in water, strain the sirup and put it in a vessel to itself, and then get a quart
                            of good clean cow dung and put it in a tight little linen bag and boil it well in water;
                            then strain it with the other sirup, boil it down to a quart, bottle it, and add a
                            teaspoonful of refined nitre.</p>
                    </quote>And this concotion was recommended to purify the system and to increase the appetite!</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing preoccupation with physical ailments, Doctor Carter also treated mental
                    abnormalities. He discussed hysteria at some length—pointing out that women are subject
                    to hysteria and men to "hypos" or attacks of hypochondria. Both disorders amount
                    to the same thing and require the same treatment: letting blood flow freely from the foot, having
                    agreeable company, bathing feet before going to bed, and taking three grains each of calomel and
                    alloes followed by castor oil. Gold filings taken night and morning in honey or bear's gall
                    with rum were also recommended as helpful.</p>
            <p>If the cause of a woman's hysteria happened to be jealousy, Doctor Carter gave her this
                    advice: "Make as good a trade of a bad bargain as you can, and give your husbapd <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-035-1-053"/> good words. See how honey will gather flies and vinegar drive them
                    away."</p>
            <p>Another type of hysteria is described in the case of an old dame who complained of a cold head.
                    "AS a remedy she wore a cap, three handkerchiefs, and a bolster of feathers on it; and yet
                    she complained it was cold." For once, Doctor Carter admits that he did not have any great
                    success in treating her.</p>
            <p>Similarly, as a typical example of a hypo, there is a description of a man who thought his stomach
                    contained a shoemaker and a complete set of shoemaker's tools. In this case a satisfactory
                    cure resulted from some clever chicanery on the part of the physician. First the patient was
                    blindfolded and "given a thorough puke." Next, timed with each exertion of the
                    patient's vomitting, a tool was dropped on the floor. Finally a naked boy was likewise
                    dropped on the floor. Then the patient, after being permitted to see the remarkable dis-gorgement,
                    felt perfectly normal and happy once more.</p>
            <p>Strangely enough, Doctor Carter considered lockjaw, epilepsy, cramps,, St. Vitus' dance, and
                    nervous "cholic" all as phases of that same hypochondriasis. Nervous
                    "cholic," for instance, or "wind in the blood," is caused by
                    sudden heats and cold, coffee, hard drinking, or sitting up too late!</p>
            <p>Other amusing observations of the frontier physician are too numerous for more than random and
                    deleted quotation: "If worms and teething both meet in one child, it causes a more stinking
                    breath;" "Whatever is contrary to nature in the patient ought to be
                    removed;" "If any application is likely to do more hurt than good, it should be
                    abandoned;" "In gardening ne'er this rule forget—to sow when
                    dry but set when wet;" "The calls of nature should never be postponed. Delicacy is
                    a virtue, but that which induces persons to risk their health or hazard their lives cannot be deemed
                    a genuine virtue."</p>
            <p>The volume, just two pages short of five hundred, draws to a close with an Indian lexicon, a glossary
                    of scientific terms, some models for aspiring young letter writers, a list of Doctor
                    Carter's eight students—one of whom, Issac Westerfield, was extremely promising
                    after four months of study—and a series of essays on God, Man, and the Devil.</p>
            <p>A single excerpt from the essay on Adam is—despite the vague pronouns—too good
                    to be passed over: "When God called on Adam, he laid it [the blame for sinning] on the <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-035-1-054"/> woman, the woman on the serpent, and he—a sly,
                    cunning old dog—pretended to be speechless: he had no one else to cast the blame
                    on."</p>
            <p>Of course, in looking back over the old medical book, we laugh and label Doctor Carter as something
                    little short of Quack; yet for his time and opportunities he no doubt did as well as we can have any
                    right to expect. There is even something heroic about his precept that "in mortal diseases
                    it is better to employ uncertain remedies than to abandon the patient to certain death." He
                    probably saved the lives of a few patients and killed several others, but to many he must have
                    brought at least some mental comfort.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, he was not superstitious—he would have nothing to do with charms, and he
                    specifically mentions the folly of believing in witches and spells. For that enlightened attitude,
                    he surely deserves credit.</p>
            <p>There is a pleasing touch of modesty in the last line of one of his self-advertising doggerels, which
                    will serve as a closing quotation in this portrayal of Doctor Carter's book: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Behold this female in distress, Whose pains and fever I can't express; Observe, she
                            in her bed appears, While friends around her shed their tears: But when my medicine she
                            took, With speed her sad disease was broke: So she was by my physic blessed, As also were

            <p>Noted women of Indiana have been very generally neglected by writers of biographical sketches. The
                    state has had, however, many women who distinguished themselves in widely different fields.
                    Outstanding among them was <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Claypool Meredith, who for a full century held a conspicuous place in the
                    state's activities.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Mrs. Meredith came of illustrious lineage. Her
                    ancestry, she could trace back to Richard the Lion-Heart; yet she set little store by that, holding
                    that such things serve to minister only to one's vanity. She regarded it of more
                    significance than her immediate forebears were men and women of sterling worth who did their part in
                    the building up of a great state. Her grandfather, Newton Claypool, was a pioneer, coming from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> when central Indiana was almost an unbroken wilderness. To a rude cabin he brought his
                    young bride from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. They rode two hundred miles on horseback in winter time, resting over-night at the
                    pioneer taverns along the trails and roads which had been but little more than marked for colonists
                    in quest of new homes. In this cabin, her father, Austin B. Claypool, was born, and grew up amidst
                    the hardships and privations of a pioneer settlement. No doubt these untoward surroundings and the
                    hard labor which was the necessary accompaniment of frontier life helped to develop the sturdy
                    character that made him the ideal citizen which he became on growing to manhood.</p>
            <p>The oldest of eight children, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Claypool was named after the native state of her grandfather. Growing up in a home of
                    culture and refinement, she began at an early age to manifest those admirable traits for which she
                    was noted throughout her long life. In this home, it was the good fortune of the writer, along with
                    Prof. Troop of Purdue University, to spend a night more than thirty years ago. We were the state
                    speakers at a farmers' institute in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At the close of the first afternoon session, Mr. Claypool came to us, not with an
                    invitation, but with a command to spend the night at his home. We were comfortably quartered at a
                    fine hotel but so insistent was he that we could not decline. It is needless to say that the evening
                    could not have been made more enjoyable for us. Mr. Claypool was not only a well educated <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-035-1-056"/> man for his day but he was rich in the experiences with intimate
                    contacts with men of important affairs throughout a long and busy life had brought him.</p>
            <p>When <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> was twelve years old the Civil War broke out. Those stirring times made a deep and
                    lasting impression on her. The Claypool family was intensely patriotic and the members active
                    participants in all that was going on in their community. These things were talked over in the home,
                    the father wishing his children to know all about the ordeal through which the country was passing.
                    The alert daughter entered into those affairs with all the zest of youth and cheerfully did anything
                    that could be done by one, of her years. When Morgan made his raid into Indiana she loaned her
                    saddle horse to a young man who joined the volunteer cavalry that went out to drive back the
                    invader. She said that was her part in the preservation of the Union.</p>
            <p>Of her college life she said in later years: "I went to Glendale College near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Father's chief demand was that we should be public spirited. He insisted that
                    I should read the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> and other daily papers. So I spent my time in the college reading room,
                    devouring the editorials and dispatches of three or four papers a day. In this way I formed a taste
                    for keeping up with current news which has stayed with me." Graduating at the age of
                    nineteen, she spent the next two years at home. In view of her career as we knew her, it requires no
                    stretch of imagination to picture her as an interested learner of the art of home making. When she
                    was twenty-one she was united in marriage with Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> Meredith, son of General Solomon Meredith, one of the most conspicuous figures in
                    eastern Indiana. The Meredith homestead of four hundred acres was famous throughout the greater part
                    of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Its splendid herds of Shorthorn cattle and Southdown sheep attracted visitors from all
                    over the land. The spacious home, noted far and wide for its hospitality, was open at all times to
                    all comers. From the first, the young bride assumed a large part in the entertainment of the guests.
                    At the death of the senior Mrs. Meredith two years later, the entire burden fell upon her. In
                    addition to the individuals whose visits were frequent, public sales of stock were held from time to
                    time. Those were notable events in livestock circles and attracted crowds of buyers and spectators.
                    It became the <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-035-1-057"/> duty of the young wife to act as hostess on these
                    occasions and she never failed to measure up to what was expected of her.</p>
            <p>After twelve years of this active and busy life, she was left a widow. General Meredith had died
                    several years before. The situation which confronted her would have appalled one less courageous and
                    less resourceful, but she decided to do the almost unheard of thing—to carry on. She had
                    learned to know the requirements of the cattle and sheep and she employed an experienced herdsman to
                    care for them under her vigilant supervision. The breeds were kept up as before. Buyers who came to
                    visit the farm found the same high quality in the animals as in former years. Not only did she
                    succeed in satisfying the buyers who came as they had been doing for years, but she also continued
                    the public sales for which Oakland Farm had long been famous.</p>
            <p>As early as 1883, because of her knowledge of the science of breeding and caring for pure-bred live
                    stock, she began to receive invitations to address breeders conventions and also the State Board of
                    Agriculture. Toi those who had not made her acquaintance her knowledge of her subjects and her gift
                    as a speaker were a revelation. As the years passd, the invitations came more frequently and she
                    acquired more than a local reputation as a public speaker. Her pleasing personality and her musical
                    voice, together with her earnestness and sincerity, eventually made her one of the most popular
                    speakers in the state. As a result when the farmers' institutes were established in 1889,
                    she was one of the first to be invited by the superintendent of institutes to becomq a member of his
                    staff of state speakers. With the exception of the six years that she was preceptress of the
                    girls' school at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, she continued in the institute work for almost twenty-five years. She was in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Elkhart County</region>
                    </placeName> six times, and the last time her addresses were received with as much favor as the
                    first. She would no doubt have been invited back again had she not retired from that work soon after
                    her last appearance.</p>
            <p>Her splendid services in Indiana extended her reputation beyond its borders and she was frequently
                    invited to other states, where her work was accorded the full meed of praise. In the early
                    eighteen-nineties she was called to deliver several addresses in the historic city of Vicksburg, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-035-1-058"/> This was not long before the death of the lamented
                    Henry W. Grady, who had become the idol of the South. In one of her talks she took occasion ta pay
                    him an eloquent and well deserved tribute. It captivated the audience and the cheers that followed
                    were deafening. From that time on, her appearance on the platform was awaited with eager interest by
                    her hearers. The last session brought her a surprise that completely overwhelmed her. At the close
                    of her final address, the president of the institute presented her a gold medal upon which were
                    inscribed these words: "The Citizens of Vicksburg, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, to the Queen of American Agriculture." The appropriateness of the title was
                    recognized where-ever she was known. Almost forty years later, to be exact, in 1930, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> gave her the reward for eminent service, an honor never accorded to any other woman
                    outside the state. The award read: "To <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Claypool Meredith who, working alone, won success in farming and later, working with
                    others, pioneered effectively in the science of home making." This tribute tells in a few
                    words the story of her life and her achievements.</p>
            <p>While she spoke occasionally on one or another phase of live-stock husbandry, the greater number of
                    her addresses were on home making. She was the first to dignify home making by speaking of it as a
                    profession and declaring it to be in every way as important and honorable as the so-called learned
                    professions, law, medicine and the ministry. One of her most popular addresses was on
                    "Privileges and Possibilities of Farm Life," which she was asked to deliver in
                    many counties throughout Indiana and which always made a most favorable impression on her audiences.
                    In this address, she called the attention of farmers' sons and daughters to the
                    opportunities which the farm offers to bright young men and women and urged them to remain where
                    they could be useful and honorable citizens, instead of being fascinated by the illusive attractions
                    of the city with all of its snares and pitfalls. There is no doubt that this talk helped to keep on
                    the farm many a bright boy and girl who otherwise would have been enticed to the city, where
                    hundreds have gone with hopes of winning fortunes, only to eke out a bare existence as clerks or
                    factory workers. It is no exaggeration to say that her earnest and eloquent pleas to the young
                    people in her audiences helped to prepare the way for the splendid work <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-035-1-059"/> which the 4H clubs are doing today. However, Mrs. Meredith's
                    greatest work throughout those years was in behalf of the home and the home maker. At first but
                    little heed was given to her advice because of the almost universal opinion that a girl could learn
                    in her mother's kitchen all that was needed to qualify her for this most important calling.
                    This would have been true had all mothers been what Mrs. Meredith's mother was, but she
                    knew how sadly lacking a great many mothers were in the qualifications necessary for them to
                    properly train their daughters. In spite of the indifference of many parents, she kept on in the
                    work she had begun, believing that in due time the seed she was sowing would bear fruit.</p>
            <p>It was her dream to see at Purdue University a department for the girls which would be what the
                    agricultural department was for the boys—a place where they could be fitted for their
                    life work. For a long time her pleading with the authorities there fell on deaf ears. It needed an
                    actual demonstration to convince the trustees and faculty of that institution that such a department
                    was both desirable and feasible and that demonstration she herself was able to furnish. From far off <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> came a call to her to take charge of the girls' school which was being
                    established at the Agricultural College of that state. At first she declined, fearing that she could
                    not measure up to the responsibility, but repeated urg-ings finally induced her to accept. Her
                    position was that of Preceptress in the School of Agriculture, which was in session for six months
                    each year. This School was connected with the College of Agriculture at the University. There she
                    found an opportunity to put into practice the things she had been advocating so many years. Six
                    years she taught the girls who went there in quest of the training which would fit them to become
                    home makers. When she resigned her position to return to Indiana, she left behind her a school which
                    was and still is the pride of the people of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. During those six years she spent the summer months at her Indiana home.</p>
            <p>Her absence from home during six months of the year did not interfere with the operation of her farm.
                    Her trusted herdsman gave the stock the same care that he did when she was there and her herds and
                    flocks lost none of their popularity. On May 17, 1900, the news was flashed over the entire state
                    that Oakland Farm, made famous by the Meredith <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-035-1-060"/> family, in whose
                    possession it had been for three-quarters of a century, had been sold and every paper of any
                    consequence carried the story to its readers. Though Mrs. Meredith had become greatly attached to
                    it, an offer came, so tempting that she could not refuse to sell. She bought another farm south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge City</settlement>
                    </placeName> which she christened Narborough Farm. This continued to be her home until 1916, when
                    she disposed of it and moved to West <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It is necessary in this connection to tell of another side of Mrs. Meredith's life. Several
                    years after the death of her husband, a very dear friend died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge City</settlement>
                    </placeName> leaving a small daughter and son, Mary and Meredith Matthews. This friend's
                    dying request was that Mrs. Meredith should take those children and rear them in her own home. This
                    request was complied with and throughout the years that followed she was a real mother to them
                    bestowing upon them all the affection that any mother could and giving them both a liberal
                    education. When Mrs. Meredith went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, the foster daughter was just at the right age to enter the new school for girls and
                    she received the thorough training which its curriculum provided. In the course of time the
                    authorities at Purdue University awakened to the necessity of providing a department for the girls
                    of Indiana. Mrs. Meredith's work in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> had been watched from Purdue and no doubt had much to do with this awakening. Over this
                    department, Miss Mary Matthews was placed and she is still there as its Dean. This accounts for the
                    sale of Narborough Farm and the removal to the University city.</p>
            <p>At the World's Columbian exposition in 1893, Mrs. Meredith was the lady manager for Indiana
                    and also was chairman of the committee on awards. This necessitated a stay of several years in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but she came home every two weeks during all that time to look after her farm and to
                    give directions concerning its management. Throughout those years, she was one of the busiest women
                    in the Middle West.</p>
            <p>Along with her many other activities she found time to interest herself in club work. She was a
                    member of the Helen Hunt Club of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge City</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the time of its organization, and when she was at home was a regular sattendant at
                    its meetings. During the existence of the Indiana Union of Literary clubs, she was a conspicuous
                    figure at its sessions and a helpful counselor on all matters relating to its welfare. <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-035-1-061"/> After it was merged with the Federation, she was active for many years
                    in that body and was twice chosen as its president, the only one to be accorded that honor. In 1918,
                    she was made honorary president, and every year her appearance was greeted by every member rising.
                    This custom was kept up until the infirmities of age made her attendance impossible.</p>
            <p>In the conventions of this and other literary bodies, she came in contact with many of the most
                    brilliant women of the state and nation and she proved to be the peer of any of them. Many of the
                    most gifted literary women of the country visited her in her home, and she felt herself as much at
                    ease in entertaining them as she did when farmers and livstock breeders were her guests. Her home
                    was one of the most hospitable in the state of Indiana, and people of high and low degree alike were
                    welcomed there. On two differnt occasions, the writer had the rare privilege of being entertained
                    there and can speak as one who knows.</p>
            <p>In 1921, Mrs. Meredith was appointed a member of the board of trustees of Purdue University, the
                    first woman who ever held that office. She proved herself both capable and resourceful in that
                    position, and she exercised as much influence as any of the men in that group. She was a regular
                    attendant at the board's sessions, even after she found it necessary to give up attendance
                    at all other public meetings. Not until ill health made it impossible for her to leave her home did
                    her attendance cease.</p>
            <p>When the Indiana Home Economics Association was organized in 1913, she was elected as its first
                    president and was twice re-elected. No other president has been accorded that honor, the term of
                    service now being limited to a single year. She continued her interest in that organization as long
                    as she lived, even though for a number of years she was unable to attend its meetings.</p>
            <p>For several years she conducted the home department in the <hi rend="i">Breeder's
                    Gazette</hi>, a live-stock journal to whose columns she had been an occasional contributor for many
                    years. On her page appeared from her pen many articles which were eagerly awaited from week to week
                    by the readers of the publication.</p>
            <p>Her address on "Privileges and Possibilities of Farm Life" has been published in
                    every English speaking country <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-035-1-062"/> throughout the world. Its
                    concluding paragraph will give the reader some idea of the sentiments it expresses: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Let us dignify our calling; let us exalt our home on the farm by making it the abode of
                            intelligence, refinement and comfort—the abode of peace. Let us make much of our
                            farm and our farm life, let US cherish its privileges, let us realize its possibilities. The
                            farmer alone, of all men, has a home. When we read descriptions of the ideal Southern home,
                            is it not the home on the plantation? When we read of the typical New <placeName>
                                <country reg="enk">England</country>
                            </placeName> home, is it not the farm home? When we read of the hospitality and good cheer
                            of the western home, is it not the country home? The family, that great institution ordained
                            by the Father, should find nowhere else such congenial conditions for its development. Dr.
                            Hough, in his report on forestry, tells us that the oak grown in free air weighs twice as
                            much as that grown in dense shade. May not the boy grown in free air develop more manliness
                            than one dwarfed by the close crowding of other natures? It was the wife of a Jewish rabbi,
                            who, laying her hand upon the head of her black-eyed boy exclaimed: "this is
                            immortality". That mother was willing to rest her claims to immortality upon what
                            she made of her child. And must not he who achieves immortality by pen or picture give
                            precedence to the mother that guides a child into true and noble living?</p>

            <p>Mrs. Meredith died on December 10, 1936, at the age of eighty-eight years. It can be truthfully said
                    that no more useful life was ever lived in the state of Indiana. She lived to serve others and in
                    that service she found greater satisfaction than in her own marvelous achievements. Her death called
                    forth tributes, hearty and sincere from those who knew her best. The <placeName>

                            Mrs. Meredith was ever a valued contributor to the public good. She had very definite ideas
                            as to the aims and functions of Purdue University as a sound factor in the education of
                            young womanhood for home making.</p>

                            Trustees, as an official Board, but also from them as individuals.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Meredith was a woman of rare qualities, of great intellectual strength, of highest
                            ideals, of gracious personality. She was meticulous in the discharge of all her duties as a
                            trustee, and while her special interest was in the women of the university—for
                            whom many of her dreams and aspirations were realized—the problems of the
                            university as a whole engaged her mind to an extent and with a completeness that was indeed
                            remarkable.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Meredith was not only a brilliant woman, of wide interests, with a comprehensive grasp
                            of many difficulties that beset the Board, but she was also a loyal and understanding
                            friend, wise in her counsels, keen but kindly in her criticisms. She was ever alive to world
                            conditions and world problems, yet vitally interested in the home and its influence. She was
                            a delightful hostess in a home which one entered with joy and left with a consciousness of
                            uplift and of blessing.</p>

            <p>A study of birthplaces and various other geographic facts relative to the governors and lieutenant
                    governors of Indiana has revealed several little known facts of interest. Since 1816, when Indiana
                    came into the Union, thirty-five men have been governors of the State.'</p>
            <p>Under the Constitution of 1916, the governor's term was three years, but since the second
                    constitution went into effect in 1851, the term is four years. Before 1851 a governor could be
                    reelected, but since then a governor is not eligible for a second consecutive term. Before 1851,
                    three governors served single terms of three years each. Two were reelected and served six years
                    each, while two others who were reelected did not fill out the second term. Joseph A. Wright was
                    elected for a three year term in 1849. While he was governor, the second constitution was framed and
                    ratified, and he was made eligible for the four year term, which was to begin in January, 1853. In
                    the period of three-year terms, governors were inaugurated early in December, but since 1852, their
                    terms begin in January. Governor Wright, therefore, served a little more than seven years (Dec.,
                    1849 to Jan., 1857).</p>
            <p>Including Governor Wright, and not counting the present incumbent, fourteen governors have served
                    full four-year terms. Sime 1857, four governors elected for four years did not serve out their
                    terms. Before 1849, there were two governors who served less than one year each, Ratlif <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> (1822 )and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> C. Dunning (1849). Since 1857, there have been two governors, each of whom served more
                    than four consecutive years, Oliver P. Morton and Conrad Baker. Each was first elected to the office
                    of lieutenant-governor, and becoming governor was eligible to election for four years. Each served
                    about six years—Morton from January, 1861 to February, 1867, and Baker from
                    Morton's resignation to January, 1873. Governors since 1857, who served less than four
                    years, include elected governors who either died or resigned and lieutenant governors who became

                    election, served partial terms as governor, one of whom was later elected for a four-year term.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Twenty-nine governors have been elected directly by the people. Indiana has
                    had thirty-three lieutenant governors, eight of whom resigned to become governor and did not fill
                    out their terms. Five of these eight "promoted" governors were born outside of
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>During the earlier years of statehood, governors and lieutenant governors of Indiana were natives of
                    older states, partly because most of the people in the state came from older areas and partly
                    because men who came to Indiana from other states had enjoyed the advantages of educational training
                    and administrative experience which commended them to our citizens. Indeed, not before 1860, did
                    Indiana contain many native-born men old enough in years and political experience to reach the
                    governor's chair. In 1820, Indiana's population was 147,178; in 1830, 343,031. In
                    1840, it was 685,866, and by 1850, the number had reached almost a million people; by 1880, almost
                    two million.</p>
            <p>Before 1881, when Albert G. Porter, a native of Law-renceburg (<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>
                    </placeName>), was elected governor, only one nativa Hoosier had been governor. This earlier
                    native-born governor was Oliver P. Morton (1861–67), of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>. Between 1881, when the second native Hoosier became governor, and 1917, when Samuel M.
                    Ralston, the last governor who was not a native Hoosier, retired, just half of the ten governors
                    were born in Indiana. In the period since 1917, all the governors of the state have been Hoosiers.

            <p>Since 1896, ten natives of Indiana have served as governor and eight as lieutenant-governor. Two of
                    the governors also served first as lieutenant governors. The distribution of the birthplaces of
                    these eighteen men is radically different from that of the earlier group just discussed. Only six of
                    the fifteen were born in the southern half of the state and four of these six were born within about
                    thirty miles of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> but elected from Anderson. The other hailing from southern Indiana was Lieutenant
                    Governor Bush of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The northern half of the State yielded none of the governors who served from 1816–1896,
                    but it yielded nine of the twenty-three governors and lieutenant governors of the period
                    1897–1939. Of these twenty-three more recent executives, only one was born in the
                    unglaciated part of the state, and only two in the most recently and intensively glaciated section
                    known as northern Indiana. Eleven of the fifteen came from the broad level stretch of fine fami land
                    known as central Indiana.</p>
            <p>A considerable majority of the governors and lieutenant governors, apparently, were born on farms. Of
                    Indiana's thirty-five governors, fourteen appear to have been born in towns and twenty in
                    the country; of the thirty-eight lieutenant governors, probably seventeen were born in towns and
                    twenty-one on farms. Most of these future administrative leaders soon left the farm, however. Only
                    seven of the thirty-five governors and five of the thirty-one lieutenant governors resided on farms
                    in the years immediately preceding their electiqn to office.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Indiana has been a great agricultural state throughout its history and as the farm population
                    included a major proportion of the population until after 1900, it is somewhat surprising that so
                    few farmers have been governors or lieutenant governors. Perhaps it is an illustration of the fact
                    that, as a group, farmers are not politically ambitious. It may also be an illustration of the
                    well-known fact that it is <list type="footnotes">

                    and hard to consolidate behind a particular movement. Hence they often let others do the leading.</p>
            <p>Most of Indiana's governors were lawyers—twenty-four out of thirty-five. Several
                    combined law with some other profession such as teaching, banking, or writing. All of the early
                    governors were lawyers or professional politicians. The governors who were not lawyers, or not fully
                    devoted to the law, included four farmers, three public officials (usually lesser state officials),
                    three teachers, two bankers, and two editors.</p>
            <p>Even though most of Indiana's governors were lawyers, only twenty of the thirty-five
                    governors attended college. Four of the governors describe themselves as self-educated and ten
                    mention only common or public schools Of the twenty who attended college, two graduated from Indiana

                    a tentative constitution. The spring meeting of the junior historical societies and high school

            <p>A number of new history clubs have been organized and they have taken up various lines of activity.
                    The latest of which notice has been sent to the Indiana Historical Society was organized at the

            <p>The forthcoming number of the Hisborical Society's <hi rend="i">Prehistory Research
                    Series</hi> is "Hidatsa Texts Collected by Robert H. Lowie with Grammatical Notes and
                    Phonograph Transcriptions by Zellig Harris and C. F. Voeglin." This is Number 6 of Volume
                    I. It contains the story of the "Water Buster" and four other stories as recorded
                    by Dr. Lowie from narrations by Hidatsa Indians in the Dakotas. Each story is followed by an English
                    translation. The texts are annotated with grarnattical notes by Dr. Voegelin and Dr. Harris. A
                    significant innovation is the addition to this issue of the <hi rend="i">Prehistory Research
                    Series</hi> of a phonograph record on which the story of the "Water Buster" is
                    recorded in the actual speech of an Hidatsa Indian. The distribution of the record is necessarily
                    limited to students of the languages of the American Indians. The printed texts will be mailed to
                    libraries that can make use of them, as well as to the interested linguists, philologists, and
                    researchers in phonetics. It is hoped that this number of the <hi rend="i">Prehistory Research
                        Series</hi>
                    <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-035-1-073"/> will be a distinct contribution to the attempt being made by
                    these scholars to ascertain so far as can be determined by linguistic studies what cultural groups
                    existed among the Indians and what relationships there were among cultural groups.</p>

            <p>The archaelogical section of the Society during the past few months has undertaken the most important
                    task of its active career. The group of prehistoric earthworks known as the Angel Mounds, three
                    miles east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, was purchased in the name of the Society to
                    safeguard it and to preserve it for scientific investigation. Purchase of approximately four hundred
                    acres was necessary in order to secure the group of earthworks. The group is described briefly, with
                    illustrations, in Eli Lilly's <hi rend="i">Prehistoric Antiquities of Indiana</hi>,
                    41–48. The central mound is by far the largest in the state of Indiana. The group is
                    generally considered by archaeologists to be the most important in this part of the country, and it
                    is thought that its scientific exploration will yield information of great significance in the study
                    of cultural developments and relationships. <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-035-1-074"/> It should be
                    emphasized here that this information, rather than rare or valuable relics, is the prime object of
                    excavation. The funds necessary for the purchase of the mounds were secured by contributions and by
                    borrowing, with the consent of the donors, from the museum fund of the Society. It is the hope of
                    the Society that the amount borrowed from the museum fund may be restored by the taking over of the
                    mounds by the state of Indiana (A bill to this effect was introduced in the recent session of the
                    General Assembly, but owing to the financial condition of the state treasury was not pressed) or by
                    the local units of government within the boundaries of which the qounds lie. Ultimately, the mounds
                    should be restored as nearly as possible to the condition in which they were when white people came,
                    and maintained as a prehistoric monument.</p>
            <p>A Works Progress Administration project for archaeological work in Indiana has been approved by the
                    President and there is every reason to believe that the necessary funds will be allocated for the
                    proper excavation of the Angel Mounds. Actual excavation cannot be begun until late spring or early
                    summer, as careful surveys must be made after the funds are allocated and before any excavation is
                    undertaken.</p>

            <p>It is a great pleasure to be with this group again today; with so many of you who have such deep
                    concern for the order and peace of this disturbed and nervous world. From our association throughout
                    the years, I can bear witness that social science teachers have ceased to be conscious of a special
                    responsibility for contributing in a definite way to that social understanding which would beget
                    order and harmony and security. I doubt if, a decade ago, any one of us dreamed that we would come
                    to see such days as these —days when we would hear on every hand phrases such as:
                    "the gravest hour in the world's history," "dictatorship in the
                    saddle," "parliamentary government at the crossroads." These phrases, so
                    laden with anxious forebodings, startle us, but they force us to recognize realities. We know that
                    we face grave issues—that now the whole idea of government by popular will is at stake.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to speak on such a subject as I have chosen, without using many phrases which are
                    trite. In speaking on "The Critical Issue in Social Teaching," one can do no more
                    than set forth our common thoughts about the gravity of our responsibility, so with the
                    understanding that what I say on the subject is not in a spirit of telling but of asking, I venture
                    to speak my concern as to the critical issue which social teaching must face.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with a quotation from Howard Mumford Jones in his article
                    "Patriotism—But How?" He says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>While discussion clubs incline a serious ear to speeches on "Can Democracy
                            Survive?" and our better correspondents smuggle dispatches out of Europe showing
                            that the dictator countries are committing economic suicide, few people seem to inquire why,
                            if the fascist and communist nations are economically insane, they constitute so serious a
                            menace to political democracy.</p>
                    </quote>The Jones thesis as to why these nations constitute a serious menace to political democracy
                    is that they have developed a zeal for their political doctrines which we in democratic America seem
                    to have lost for our doctrines. If this <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-035-1-076"/> be so, teachers of the social studies are confronted with these
                    questions: Can we teach so as to build a faith and zeal for democracy which can prevail against the
                    fanatical, impassioned zeal which other nations build for their seductive social doctrines? And, Can
                    we do this with methods which are consistent with democratic philosophy and processes?</p>
            <p>Perhaps, first, we should decide definitely whether we shall consider it to be our objective to build
                    faith in and zeal for democracy. Now there are those who will still say, "No, it is not the
                    teacher's task to do this." These believe in stopping short of this objective.
                    They believe we should confine ourselves to the more trepid objective which is usually termed social
                    understanding, and on this they would rely for the security of our institutions. But when doctrines
                    supported only by lukewarm social understanding encounter doctrines carried forward by the momentum
                    of faith and fanatic zeal, they stand to lose. This is the menacing situation which democratic
                    philosophy faces today. Perhaps in the days less disturbed than these, social understanding was
                    enough support for the doctrines of democracy. But now democracy needs more—it needs
                    renewed allegiance—a zeal for it, an abiding faith in it. Other nations are building
                    allegiance to their political philosophies by the use of all the tricks which crowd psychology
                    knows, and the results amaze us. We observe entire populations falling under the spell of political
                    seducers, who with the tricks of banners, and marching bands, and simply worded slogans, build a
                    fanatical devotion which is beyond our usual concept of what patriotism is and ever should be. The
                    penetrating, driving power of this mass emotion which is being set abroad in the world, arising from
                    these methods, is a terrifying thing to all who wish liberty and freedom to survive.</p>
            <p>Are teachers going to do anything about it? For my own part, I believe teachers have a definite
                    responsibility for teaching democratic philosophy—not merely as one of the social
                    philosophies, but rather as our philosophy—the philosophy upon which our institutions are
                    founded—the political doctrine to which we owe every liberty we possess. We are not in a
                    day to debate about democracy, but to proclaim it. And we need faith in it, a zeal for it which will
                    withstand the impact of all the forces which would destroy it.</p>
            <p>How can we get such faith? Shall we stoop to undemocratic <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-035-1-077"/>
                    techniques to meet this menace? In the stress of the emergency which we face, we are tempted to
                    fight fire with fire. But we dare not do this, for if democracy stoops to the use of the same
                    political tricks which dictatorships use, then democracy ceases to be democracy. We cannot use those
                    methods and keep faith with democratic ideals, for at the heart of democracy is faith in the
                    dignity, and the worth, and the good sense of each individual. Such faith does not permit of playing
                    with individual emotion to such a degree that political reasoning is befogged and beclouded.</p>
            <p>Thus circumscribed in method and procedure, we must trust that a faith and zeal for democracy builded
                    upon reason, founded upon understanding, resulting in a people of calm assurance of the right, will
                    prevail against fanatical devotion for other doctrines builded from psychological trickery. We have
                    every cause to put our trust in such principles. There is sound reason to believe that faith so
                    built will live through many a test which zeal built upon the play of mass emotions cannot and will
                    not endure.</p>
            <p>If we are to try this course, there are considerations which must be faced squarely. The ficst
                    imperative is to build faith in democracy, not to create doubt about it, to build conviction and not
                    cynicism. To be specific, we have lived through a period when any glib youth with a
                    teacher's license or a college position, who has never himself assumed a single
                    responsibility for an administrative decision, in the name of academic freedcm, could, with
                    insinuating general-ties, cause his pupils to believe that public life is all corrupt. The logical
                    conclusion which youth draws from that kind of teaching and based upon such insinuation, is that the
                    American system itself is a failure. Now sensible people who know all of the truth, know that such a
                    generalization is not fair. There is of course, far too much that is corrupt. But those who know all
                    the truth, know that for every official that is going wrong, there are many, many others who are
                    honestly and conscientiously trying to do their duty—many of them under pressures which
                    are breaking their bodies and their spirits. We need a body of teachers in the classrooms who will
                    teach the whole truth, and if they do, they will teach that we have honesty in public office in
                    abundance. And on this we can build faith, not cynicism. There is much in our nation's life
                    in which we can have faith, much of which we <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-035-1-078"/> can be proud. There
                    is so much tradition of liberty and freedom that our history astounds us with the marvel of the
                    quality of our heritage. We do not lack at all for that which will build a faith and devotion to
                    American ideals which will endure and prevail, if we but teach the whole truth. In saying this, we
                    do not wish for any unhistorical history, any doctoring of the true story of American development.
                    All we ask is that the American story be told in its true and correct perspective. There is so much
                    of good that the American story needs no doctoring. What we need, especially, is to teach the good
                    and the bad in their proper and correct proportion; if we do this, we can well trugt to the result.</p>
            <p>I know you are thinking all this means propaganda and indoctrination. You say: "You are
                    asking for propaganda which is in no wise different from that which dictatorships adopt in their
                    educational systems. Because this question always arises, it is necessary that we think clearly as
                    to the distinction between true education and propaganda. Carl Joachim Friedrich recently drew a
                    distinction between propaganda and education which we all need to remember. He says:
                    "Propaganda always aims at getting people either to do or not to do some very particular
                    thing. Education, on the other hand, is fundamentally concerned with moulding and developing a human
                    being in terms of an ideal, as far as his nature allows it." The difference, therefore,
                    hinges on these two objectives. The objective of propaganda is to get people to do or not to do a
                    particular thing. The objective of education is to mold and develop an individual in terms of an
                    ideal. In propaganda, we use the individual for a purpose; in education, we are making him in terms
                    of an ideal. In propaganda, we are interested in what people will do; in education, our concern is
                    what they are.</p>
            <p>Now if our concern is with true education, if this concern is with the developing of human beings in
                    terms of an ideal, we must first adopt the ideal. We must decide what kind of human beings we wish
                    these children of ours to be. In the field of the social studies, I believe that we can decide upon
                    molding our children according to ideals about which we will have no disagreesment. Our ideal would
                    be to develop people who love liberty; who love justice and fair play more than they love gain; who
                    believe in law; who believe in harmony; who love peace; who believe in living according <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-035-1-079"/> to the law of kindness rather than the law of cruelty; the law of love
                    rather than the law of hate. In setting forth to mold individuals according to these ideals, we need
                    to realize that such procedure is not propaganda, but education in its truest and finest form.
                    Education, without an ideal, has no point, and no value.</p>
            <p>It is of the utmost importance that the teachers of the social studies see this distinction between
                    propaganda and education clearly. Social studies have been in danger for some years. Our situation
                    has been serious, because much of our social teaching has lacked any philosophy upon which we could
                    base the choice of anything for a teaching purpose. Sometimes it has looked as though the social
                    studies have been nothing more than intellectual ruminating, dawdling here and there over a
                    hodgepodge of facts, with no evidence that there is a central philosophy which ties the facts
                    together. What we teach needs to be taught according to whether it will help us to mold our pupils
                    according to ideals of liberty, justice, fair play, law—and consideration for the dignity
                    and worth of human personality.</p>
            <p>Now this task of molding individuals according to these ideals at once forces us to recognize that
                    the first imperative is to awaken and arouse a new appreciation of the spiritual values which inhere
                    in a democratic philosophy. Development of appreciation is always a difficult educational task, but
                    development of appreciation of anything inherently spiritual is the ultimate in educational
                    difficulty. We must strive to get at the heart of what democracy implies. Its significance does not
                    lie in form of government. It is deeper than that. The true significance of great concern to us lies
                    in the quality of the spirit which runs through all human relationships. It is the unique spirit
                    which democracy brings which we must appreciate. These things which are the unique qualities of
                    democracy are after all things of the spirit. And sometimds they do not immediately result in more
                    food or better clothing; but without these things of the spirit, more food and better clothing are
                    of no use. We must know that whenever democracy begins to sacrifice its unique spiritual values in
                    the interest of material progress, then we are in imminent danger. Whenever our eyes are so focused
                    on rising standards of living that it blinds us to consideration of human rights, we face the menace
                    of traveling the same <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-035-1-080"/> road as the other nations of the world. It
                    is sacrifice of human values which characterizes dictatorship.</p>
            <p>Thomas Mann says, in his <hi rend="i">Coming Victory of Democracy</hi>: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Democracy as a whole is still far from acquiring a clear conception … of the
                            fanaticism and absolutism of the totalitarian state. It willingly sacrifices all culture and
                            humanity for the sake of power and victory, and secures for itself in this unfair way
                            advantages and advances in the battle of life such as have never been seen before, whose
                            effect upon civilization is wholly bewildering. And yet, in order to be able to survive,
                            democracy must understand this new thing in all of its thoroughly vicious novelty.
                            Democracy's danger is the humane illusion, the virtuous belief that compromise with
                            this new creature is possible, that it can be won over to the idea of peace and collective
                            reconstruction by forbearance, friendliness, or amicable concessions.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Now what is it of which Thomas Mann warns us? That we must understand this "new
                    thing." And what is the "new thing"? A thing which sacrifices culture and
                    humanity for the sake of power and victory. We must recognize it for whatever it is, and in the
                    classroom strive definitely and specifically to mold individuals to abhor and resent, and reject and
                    oppose that trend toward sacrificing culture and humanity for the sake of power and victory, whether
                    it be at home or abroad. Culture and humanity can be sacrificed too easily for the sake of power and
                    victory. We may not be discerning enough to see it, but the unique things for which democracy
                    stands—liberty, freedom, humanity, culture —can be offered up as sacrifices
                    for material prosperity. Nations can be brought step by step to the insidious belief that they
                    should give up humanity and culture, and liberty, and freedom, in order to have clothing, and better
                    automobiles. This is the insidious temptation which our nation faces. It is the temptation to which
                    other nations have yielded, we fear, to their sorrow.</p>
            <p>In the last analysis, can we so teach that we may cause our pupils to cherish as they should those
                    higher values which inhere in democracy? This is after all the critical issue which we face. Can we
                    cause our pupils really to understand how precious are the rights and privileges of an American

                    appreciation of the fact that we still <hi rend="i">may</hi> vote. It is important that we teach the
                    processes of our government, but infinitely more <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-035-1-081"/> important that
                    we develop individuals with deep-rooted appreciation of the philosophy of our government. Whatever
                    we teach about processes—about elections, organization of our governmental units, tariff,
                    monopoly of public utilities, the courts, taxes, our wars, our national crises—all these
                    need be interpreted according to their bearing upon the growth or limitation of freedom, liberty,
                    humanity, and culture. This is the emphasis which the social studies will need to make if we
                    contribute our part to the preservation of the American system.</p>

                        <p>We know that we are destined, in our land, in our generation, to live in a period of
                            emergency of which none can see the end. If throughout that testing time, however long or
                            short it be, we hold fast to our faith, cradle it in stone, and set steel to defend it, we
                            can yet hand on our inheritance of freedom, intact to the generations that are to come.</p>

            <p>It is obvious that the place where the faith of the American people in democracy will be cradled in
                    stone and where we shall set steel to defend it, as Mr. Eden puts it, will be in the classrooms of
                    our schools. May we trust that we can find the way to do it?</p>

            <head>Documents: "PROCK'S" LAST LETTERS TO THE VINCENNES WESTERN SUN</head>
            <p>In each of four earlier issues of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, a series of
                    Civil War letters written by Lieutenant William D. F. Landon were published. The pen name of
                    Lieutenant Landon was "Prock." He was a soldier in Company G of the Fourteenth
                    Indiana Regiment. Company G, which became known as the "Invincibles," was
                    recruited at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as was Company B, known as the "Old Post Guards." The first lseries
                    of letters covered the period from July 17 to October 16, 1861; the second, from December 9, 1861,
                    to July 8, 1862; the third, from July 8, 1862, to May 6, 1863; the fourth, from October 24, 1863, to
                    July 1, 1864. "Prock" was wounded at Chancellorsville in 1863, and again on May
                    10, 1864, in the Wilderness. He spent the summers of 1863 and 1864 in a hospital. After the close of
                    the War, he served with a force of volunteer veterans known as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Corps. In September, 1865, he was assigned to duty with the Third Regulars
                    and served in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> for several weeks. He then severed his connection with the army for a while, and acted
                    as clerk for the Continental Hotel in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In April, 1866, he was given a commission as Second Lieutenant in the regular army.
                    His remaining service was with the Eighteenth Regulars. While stationed at Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the summer of 1866, Lieutenant Landon disappeared and was never seen again. He was
                    believed to have drowned while bathing in the <geogName>Missouri River</geogName> on July 8, 1866.
                    From July 1 to November 1, 1865, "Prock" wrote nine letters which were published
                    in the <hi rend="i">Western Sun.</hi> Some of these after-the-war letters appear in full below, with
                    parts of others, and summaries of still others. Those that describe the conditions on certain <placeName>

                    the summer of 1865 are unique. The letter of July 11, 1865, describing the execution of Mrs. Mary E.
                    Surratt and three men, convicted of complicity in the assassination of Lincoln, is even more
                    unusual.</p>

                                    offered up their lives in defense of their country's honor and her flag in
                                    those terrible conflicts, are now, at last, reposing in peace beneath the
                                    "sacred soil" of the Old Dominion.</p>
                        <p>I will begin my chapter of accidents and incidents at Gold Mine Camp, on the extreme
                                    right of our line during the fight at the Wilderness. The Sixth Army Corps fought
                                    here, and part of the old First. The "circle" and the
                                    "plain cross" marked the spot where each warrior lay—a
                                    very few had been buried.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Deployed as skirmishers<hi rend="sup">3</hi> (without arms, of course, these being left in the bivouac under guard),
                                    every fourth man carrying a sack, we commenced the search for skeletons through
                                    woods, thickets, fields and swamps—now by the right flank and changing
                                    directions—now forward again.</p>
                        <p>Three days of this work and we succeeded in gathering a huge pile of grinning,
                                    ghastly skull—the frames of three hundred and fifty Union soldiers. Many
                                    had to be buried where they lay in the swamps and marshes, their remains being too
                                    offensive to handle under the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>A few rebels unburied were found—these were covered with the
                                    "sacred soil" where they lay. Having collected all that a thorough
                                    search could discover, graves were dug near the pike leading to <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Orange</region>
                                    </placeName> Court House—ten skulls were placed in each coffin, which was
                                    then filled with bones—the lid screwed on, and the
                                    "Corporal's Squad" lowered into their last resting place,
                                    unknown, but <hi rend="i">not</hi> un-honored nor unsung.</p>

                        <p>We gathered here six hundred and fifty of the bleaching bones of our gallant dead.
                                    Many, as before, we were compelled to bury as they lay. Nearly all the
                                    "Greybacks" were buried—what few

                                    view. The cemetery here was similar to the one near "Gold Mine
                                    Camp." The only exceptions were that No. 2 was necessarily larger, being
                                    ninety feet square, containing sixty-five graves, ten soldiers in each. Then there
                                    are forty-five small oaks inside the enclosure. There is considerable taste

                                    Angel," from the number of dead Johnnies in the trenches after the fight.</p>
                        <p>Sergeant Major Meyer and myself immediately began a search for the grave of the
                                    lamented Col. Coons, and found it after a long and tedious deploy of about three
                                    hours. We procured a coffin and headboard—took our brave old commanding
                                    officer up and placed him in new quarters. He looked natural as he lay in the rude
                                    box that comrades and friends had placed him to rest in over one year

                        <p>The first day we "deployed." The squad to which I was attached
                                    discovered a picket post of our men that had been taken by surprise and were shot or
                                    bayonetted to a man in a thick copse of cedars—they lay where none but an
                                    out-post could have been posted.</p>
                        <p>A little further on, near a gold mine and quartz mill, nineteen rebels were found
                                    buried, killed by the bayonet alone, as the rude head-board indicated; and now our
                                    task commenced in earnest. Bodies of our soldiers were thickly strewn through woods
                                    and fields in all directions. There was no difficulty in ascertaining where those
                                    lay who fell in the open field, as the rank growth of weeds marked each spot on
                                    which a soldier lay. Heavy works were in front and the line that charged here
                                    suffered terribly. Everything of value, including weapons, accoutrements and
                                    blankets had been taken.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                                    working them had barely paid expenses.</p>
                        <p>The main line of the rebel works commences at Moreton's Ford, on the

                                    </placeName>, and formidable ones they are, too.</p>
                        <p>Our camp was daily besieged with a crowd of half-starved women and children and a few
                                    "Johnnies" in uniform. All the rations we could spare were freely
                                    given them. They had nothing to offer in exchange but a few onions, lettuce,
                                    cucumbers and other garden vegetables, the demand far exceeding the supply.</p>
                        <p>In the Wilderness, at Brock's Roads, I picked up a block of wood with the
                                    name of, "J. Ackley" on it, on the very ground our regiment
                                    charged over in May, '64. Presuming it formerly belonged to that bully
                                    soldier Jap Ackley, of Company "B," old 14th' I shall
                                    retain it till I see him again.</p>
                        <p>I spent one rainy day in huckleberry hunting in the swamps in front of our old works
                                    at Brock's Roads. The bushes grew as high as a man's head and were
                                    loaded with the luscious fruit. I found here in the midst of the swamps the skeleton
                                    of a tall rebel who had evidently crawled into the thickets, and mounting on a stump
                                    of a large tree watching his chance for a shot at some "Yank," had
                                    been himself picked off. The shot must have been fired from a knoll some five
                                    hundred yards off, the only high ground in the immediate vicinity. The ball had
                                    struck him in the forehead and with just force enough to break through, as I found
                                    it rattling in the skull but slightly battered; his rifle and equipments lay near
                                    him, his body lying across the stump; from a large button on his jacket marked in
                                    the centre with an "R," I inferred he belonged to some rebel rifle
                                    regiment and was "sharp shooting" on his own hook. Two of his
                                    front teeth were filled with gold—I fobbed 'em and the button
                                    also, the rifle and a ball-screw, cone-wrench and pocket comb in his carriage box. I
                                    "chucked" his bones in a sink-hole and scraped the dirt over them
                                    as well as I could with a stick; mounting the skull on the end of the same, I stuck
                                    it in the stump to mark the spot; for any comrade of the "Johnny"
                                    that might hereafter be searching for him. If I had been provided with a spade I
                                    would have done the soldier justice and buried him in the swamp, but I was more than
                                    a mile from camp and probably could not have found the spot again after once leaving
                                    it.</p>
                        <p>The grape and cannister from Arnold's Napoleons had been very destructive to
                                    the charging column of Longstreet's corps on the 6th of May, '64.
                                    They were piled in heaps in front of our works. Had our search been made early in
                                    the spring before vegetation was so far advanced, many more remains would have been
                                    discovered.</p>
                        <p>On the farm of one Akers in the rear of our lines is the place where our corps
                                    hospital was established, and here the brave fellows of our old brigade and others
                                    are thickly planted. There are four burial places on the farm—most of the
                                    graves marked with cracker-box head <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-035-1-088"/> boards. This
                                    man Akers owns, or rather there are on his plantation about twenty negroes, mostly
                                    wenches and brats, with perhaps three rheumatic "uncles." He has a
                                    son at home who was a lieutenant in the rebel army. Six acres in wheat and six in
                                    corn is all the crop they have to depend on for winter food—two worn-out
                                    horses and two cows compose their "stock."</p>
                        <p>I visited the iron furnace on the <geogName>Nye river</geogName>, four miles from
                                    this place. It has been rebuilt and will soon be in running order again. Well do I
                                    remember the day I first saw this furnace- A large two-story brick dwelling house
                                    hidden in shrubbery, formerly the residence of the owner of the iron works, is now
                                    in ruins and looks the very picture of desolation itself. Owls, bats and snakes are
                                    now the sole occupants.</p>
                        <p>At Todd's tavern, heavy breastworks had been thrown up by our rear guard. A
                                    severe cavalry fight took place here, but we did not halt to look for the remains of
                                    the fallen horsemen.</p>
                        <p>We passed the place where had been the hospital of the Fifth corps, after their
                                    bloody charge of the 8th of May [1864]. I well remembered the rows of wounded
                                    soldiers I had seen stretched out here as we bivouackea on the same spot but little
                                    over one year ago, and listening all the night long to the deep groans of the
                                    wounded and dying heroes and shrieks and curses of those undergoing the torture of
                                    the probe or keen blade of the amputating knife. Many a poor fellow's bones
                                    rest here under the shade of oak and pine, and few with boards to mark the spot.</p>
                        <p>Two fine springs gush from the rocks a short distance to the left of the road. We
                                    halted only to, quench our thirst. There was no time to do honor to those sleepers,
                                    as but a few hours march ahead of us hundreds lay who had been scarce covered with
                                    their mother earth.</p>

                                    having already marched five miles in a broiling July sun and through dense clouds of
                                    stiffling dust, fancied our troubles but begun, and that we were to escort the
                                    wretches to some of the high and barren hilltops surrounding the city, we were all
                                    most agreeably disappointed and stood at ease, leaning on our well burnished arms
                                    and gazing with <hi rend="i">mere curiosity</hi> at the workmen putting the
                                    finishing touches to the "assassins' derrick." Guards
                                    being posted everywhere, we stacked arms and broke ranks. Some of the carpenters in
                                    the regiment lent a hand in adjusting beams and traces, occasionally tossing the
                                    boys a block that was sawn off, or a strip of scantling for a walking stick. A grand
                                    rush was always made for these by the "relic hunters of the
                                    Wilderness," occasioning much amusement amongst the soldiery. In removing
                                    some caission boxes, &amp;c., from one part of the yard, a fatigue party
                                    captured a huge rat. He was immediately court-martialed, sentenced and a (miniature
                                    gallows being erected and a piece of fish line procured) hung—his carcase
                                    chucked into one of the pits near the coffins.</p>
                        <p>The prison wall is at least eighteen feet high and shut out not only the view from
                                    the Potomac, but the "ten knot" breeze that was filling more than
                                    one white sail on the broad stream. Occasionally a circling puff whirling over the
                                    enclosure would stir up everything that was laying around loose, dust included, and
                                    cause the "human hawsers" [suspended ropes] to writhe as I have
                                    seen wounded snakes before now.</p>
                        <p>Some hundred citizens were admitted—not twenty-five of them but what were
                                    attached to either the "press gang" or detective's force
                                    of <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. All these "roosters" carried umbrellas, and soon had
                                    them spread skyward. The sentinels took revenge by quietly punching their sharp
                                    glittering bayonets through the "silk Sibleys," so, had it rained,
                                    many a chap would have wondered why his "roundhouse" leaked so
                                    badly.</p>
                        <p>Finally, everything was in readiness and "Time!" called. The
                                    soldiers stood to their arms and the four culprits appeared on the scene. The usual
                                    formula was gone through with, lasting perhaps twenty minutes, when the ropes were
                                    adjusted the white caps pulled over their heads, and they were literally <hi rend="i">jerked</hi> into Eternity. I have an idea, that from the time a fellow
                                    feels the rope coiling round his neck till he is "hood-winked" and
                                    actually "rubbed out" of existence, ye past presents the
                                    finest—aye, perhaps the most terrible—panorama he ever
                                    witnessed. I have no desire to see it (when my turn comes for "going
                                    under") <hi rend="i">"roped</hi> in," with a frame of
                                    bayonets and bronzed, unsympathising faces.</p>
                        <p>Life having been pronounced extinct by the U.S. surgeons present, the yard was
                                    cleared of all but members of our regiment or division by order of Major Gen. <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>
                                    </placeName>; a "detail" was then made to take down <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-035-1-090"/> the bodies and bury them. The soldiers performing this
                                    task whacked off as much rope from each dangling quirl as they could reach, and,
                                    cutting it into small pieces, threw it among their comrades below. The scramble for
                                    the twine far exceeded that for the blocks and scraps of wood an hour or two before.</p>
                        <p>Two men scuffling good humoredly for a "rope-relic," rolled into
                                    one of the freshly dug graves, and before they could extricate themselves half a
                                    dozen shovel fulls of earth had been thrown upon them by laughing comrades.</p>
                        <p>The bodies were placed in the "wooden overcoats" just as they fell,
                                    with the exception that the fatal nooses were taken off—the white
                                    "deathhoods" were <hi rend="i">not</hi> removed. I noticed the
                                    rope in every instance had <hi rend="i">cut to the bone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mrs. Surrat died without a struggle, merely a clenching of the left hand Payne or
                                    Powell was on the "drop" next in order He took great pains to
                                    place his toes <hi rend="i">right on the edge</hi>—stood straight as an
                                    arrow—said nothing to the lookers-on—gave a slight shrug of
                                    the shoulders when the coil fell about his bare neck, but not a tremor of a nerve or
                                    winking of an eye could be noticed. He died, to use the slang term, "game
                                    to the last." Harrold [Herold] and Atzerott [At-zerodt] were both half dead
                                    with terror and the consciousness of their awful situation. Their knees knocked
                                    together as they bade each other "good boye."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> There was but a single disturbance that I saw during the day. One of the
                                    6th regiment, U.S. Veteran Volunteers, <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>
                                    </placeName>'s corps, attempting to pass the guard at the outer gate with
                                    an empty canteen for water, was halted, and some words passed, when the sergeant of
                                    the guard coming up drew his sabre and stabbed the unarmed soldier in the face,
                                    putting out his right eye and giving him a dangerous if not fatal wound. The
                                    sergeant and the guard on at this post are from the "Veteran Reserve or
                                    Invalid corps" and no troops "in the field" are on good
                                    terms with these d—d overbearing "Invalids and hospital
                                    bummers"—that's what's the matter. Well my
                                    item is not finished yet: a brother of the wounded man, hearing of the uncalled for
                                    and cowardly act, came up and put an ounce and a half of cold lead into the
                                    brain-pan of the "reserve sergeant," killing him instantly, and
                                    then walked cooly on to see after his brother's wounds. That's the
                                    right kind of vengeance, for you!—he had heard that his brother was
                                    mortally wounded and was determined on revenge <hi rend="i">first</hi>—that is as it should be!</p>

                                    through rents in the torn storm clouds, a million sand-flies, horse-flies,
                                    gad-flies, green-flies, gnats, and gallinippers made a charge upon our encampment. A

                                    blood-thirsty musquitoes and other winged torments reinforced our enemies of the day

                                    "Narrows," or "Hell Gate." A sailing vessel,
                                    under full press of canvass, passed between us and Fort Johnstone or some other
                                    Bastile. She was a most beautiful sight, skimming like a sea bird, almost
                                    noiselessly, over the white capped waves, the bright copper sheathing flashing in
                                    the sunlight as her sharp bows rose gracefully upon each swell, parting the ever
                                    restless waters and sending them whirling and circling in bubling eddies far astern.

                        <p>Having been ordered on duty by the ranking military officer on board (a Major of
                                    Artillery), I was necessarily compelled to go below for a short time, for the
                                    purpose of obtaining the number of soldiers on board; amount and quality of their
                                    rations; to divide them into squads, placing a non-com. in charge of each, and make
                                    arrangements with the ship's steward for supplying the men with hot coffee
                                    twice a day. Having accomplished this task, I reported progress,
                                    "smiled" with ye Major, took a <placeName>
                                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                                    </placeName> (not 6) at his expense, and again sought the deck. We were beginnhg to
                                    meet the long rolls of Old Ocean. I had heard the "long rolls"
                                    before, but never experienced the same sensations…. We were twenty-five
                                    miles from land, ye skipper said, and with steam and sail were bowling along
                                    merrily, nothing visible but curling foam-crested waves, and Heaven's
                                    "ethereal blue" above. Right gallantly the old bark bore us on,
                                    and Prock enjoyed it hugely. Sunset was gorgeous almost belond description, but here
                                    goes! The instant before the great sullen sea was rolling and heaving with its
                                    leaden blue surface, slightly traced here and there with foam, but no sooner had the
                                    sun touched the horizon than a flood of purple glory spread over the whole ocean, so
                                    that it became like a sea of molten gold and amber…. Nuff!</p>
                        <p>The "spot" on old Sol's shining countenance was distinctly
                                    visible to the naked eye as he shot up like a rocket (almost) from his watery bed
                                    next A. M.</p>
                        <p>This day was not so fine. Clouds began to obscure the "azure
                                    vault," the "gentle zephyrs" (?) that had hitherto sighed
                                    (?) through the rigging gave place to old Boreas, who came howling and shreaking
                                    from the southeast. Ye sea ran high, and ye craft ran higher.</p>

                        <p>Not I tho'! This day I observed numerous "monsters of the
                                    deep," dolphins, flying fish, blue fish, porpoises, and ye voracious shark.
                                    Some disciples of Sir Isaac Walton rigged a "trolling line" some
                                    two hundred fathoms (1200 feet) long, and successfully "trolled"
                                    for blue fish in the ship's wake. They "triced up" a fine
                                    dolphin and some four hundred and sixty pounds of the scaly meat beside.
                                    'Twas rare sport. I now had an opportunity of witnessing the
                                    "dying dolphin" of which I had read so much in the Primmer by Sir
                                    Peter Parley, Esq., when life was young. The "changeable hues"
                                    were beautiful….</p>
                        <p>Wind veered round during the night, and the next day the sails were again unfurled to
                                    speed the bark to port. At 4 o'clock, hoxvever, Boreas "changed
                                    direction" suddenly, and blew strong, and "dead <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-035-1-095"/> ahead." The ship's shirt tails were
                                    close reefed, and steam alone resorted to. Old craft rolled and pitched in a manner
                                    not at all agreeable to pleasure seekers and romantic young ladies, of whom there
                                    were a squad aboard. Ye "Eagle," [Lieutenant Landon], however,
                                    kept the deck till midnight, enjoyiag the change. How grand it was! On comes a huge
                                    dark mass of water, foaming and seething, seemingly resistless in its headlong
                                    course. How it thunders against the ship's bows, dashing clouds of
                                    drenching spray from fore-castle to quarter-deck, and then, its fury spent, surging
                                    and hissing as it whirls madly astern! See it! Can't, eh? Well, neither can
                                    I <hi rend="i">now!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Eleven P. M. Off Hatteras, blowing "great guns." Now we are
                                    heavenwards, ye wheels of ye steamer revolving in air; now deeply burried in a
                                    monstrous wave, the timbers groaning and creaking as it thunders past! Perched on a
                                    coil of hawser rope, and holding on by the "rattlines," I watched
                                    the "revolving of light" of Hatteras, now some fifteen miles off.
                                    Mate said 'twas visible for ten leagues (thirty miles) at sea.</p>
                        <p>Many vessels have "tacked" in vain off this dread cape, the
                                    "tumbling star" (beacon light) warning them of the certain doom
                                    that awaited all on board, as the wild waves drifted them resistlessly nearer and
                                    nearer the fearful breakers.</p>
                        <p>Daylight found us some miles south of 'ye cape. The storm clouds had been
                                    rent asunder. As the sun rose clear and beautiful, a land bird of the hawk species
                                    was observed perched on the foreyard. Venturing too far from shore, his hawkship
                                    sought this as a resting place. During this day I observed <hi rend="i">butterflies</hi> around the ship, and though we were twenty miles from shore, and
                                    the wind blowing from the southwest, these tiny "birds" kept pace
                                    with us, and with apparent ease too! <hi rend="i">Seeing</hi> is believing with some
                                    people, but with Prock <hi rend="i">feeling</hi> is the naked truth. I
                                    "cotch" one. 'Twas a genuine brown butterfly.</p>
                        <p>Majority of the fair sex on board were Yankee skule marms from way down East, gwine

                        <p>Well, on the 13th we sighted the "buoys" off Port Royal Harbor, S.
                                    C. As we passed the first one, a "school" of flying fish flew up
                                    beneath the bows, and went skipping away at a great rate….</p>
                        <p>Most of the passengers hurried ashore as soon as the ship touched the wharf, but a
                                    few of us remained on board all night, and had a "high old time"
                                    with her officers. Good fellows, all.</p>

                                    a small park. One of these squares is piled full of shot, shell, grape and

                                    pointing down stream, and shod with iron. Portions of these inventions of the

                        <p>Having steamed over one hundred and sixty miles on dry land, I am now quartered in
                                    the capital of the State of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                                    </placeName>. The first train brought me to Lake City, the half way place. The road
                                    is a good one to this point, but the engine and cars hardly hold
                                    together—time about 12 miles an hour. The portion of country through
                                    which it runs is sparsely settled, the land very poor along the line, a great deal
                                    of marsh, and the remainder for the most part covered with heavy pine timber. I
                                    counted fifteen steam saw-mills, all new ones, too, along the route to the city (?)
                                    above mentioned.</p>
                        <p>There were a few cotton bales at several of the stations, and any quantity of
                                    darkies. Young frizzle heads came through the car (there was only one passenger
                                    coach, the remainder being freight and box cars,) at every stopping place with
                                    sugar-cane, peanuts, gingerbread, oranges, and figs for sale. All of them possessed
                                    a portion of Uncle Sam's uniform (either cap, blouse, pants, or a leather
                                    belt with the U. S.). They are fat, black, "shiny," indolent,
                                    ignorant, careless, good-natured, contented, and 'appy, apparently. If not,
                                    whose fault is it? I am not an agent for the "Freedmens Bureau,"
                                    and consequently expected to ameliorate their condition. No, sir-ee, let Gen. O. O.
                                    Howard and his staff attend to Cuffee. They are well paid for it no doubt.</p>
                        <p>From Lake City to Tallashasee the old rattle-box of a train ran like the very devil
                                    over as rough a track as there is in the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                    </placeName>, not excepting the Brunswick railroad in Jersey, that State by the way
                                    being just outside the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                    </placeName>. The country is, more rolling as you approach the interior, and we
                                    whirled through several deep cuts. The depot at Tallahassee is half or
                                    three-quarters of a mile from the town, and in a dilapidated condition.</p>
                        <p>The town itself is very pleasantly situated on a high ridge. The streets are broad,
                                    irregular, and most of them poorly shaded; houses scattering, the majority built of
                                    wood; only one business street, and, as in Hilton Head, S. C., the stores,
                                    &amp;c., are all on one side of the street, and the opposite side almost all
                                    vacant lots.</p>

                        <p>The State House looks as though it might have been built by Americus Vespucius with
                                    the wrecks of some of his Spanish galleons, or of "drift wood"
                                    from the coast. At all events 'tis an odd-looking piece of architecture,
                                    and must have been thrown together to a hurry.</p>
                        <p>I observed a score of captured cannon on one vacant lot, with caissons, limbers,
                                    &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>One street, I forgot the name, has a very few quite respectable residences on it, but
                                    all sadly in need of paint and plaster. For the most part the fences are gone from
                                    around the dwellings, probably used for fire-wood by the C. S. cavalry or other
                                    rebel troops.</p>
                        <p>The country around is very thickly settled, the land fertile. Provisions are cheap,
                                    quite as much so as in Indiana. There is an abundance of oats, corn, hay, fodder,
                                    &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Wagon loads of cotton are constantly passing through the streets, but the stores are
                                    poorly stocked, and trade dull enough. Everything is in such an unsettled state at
                                    present that business of all kinds is at a stand still.</p>
                        <p>I am going down to St. Marks to-morrow on the railroad. I want to see the Gulf
                                    o' Mexico. Perhaps I shall go to Tampa, away down the coast.</p>
                        <p>My hair curls tight to-day and I am not in a good humor, therefore I must cease
                                    scribbling and try a gallop on a pony into the country for a change. The A. Q. M.
                                    has lots of horseflesh here, and 'tis a "free ride." Once

               <hi rend="i">The Potawatomi Indians.</hi> By Otho Winger. The Elgin Press, Elgin, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, 1939. Pp. 159, illustrated.</head>
            <p>In the preface, the author indicates that his book "is one of the results of years of
                    interest in and study of the American Indian." It is written to record and preserve the
                    history and traditions of the Pottawatomi. Many of the readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine
                        of History</hi> are acquainted with President Winger of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> College and his previous volumes, <hi rend="i">The Lost Sister Among the Miamis</hi>
                    and <hi rend="i">The Last of the Miamis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first chapter briefly sketches the history of the Pottawatomi prior to the War of 1812. These
                    Indians fought first with the French and then with Pontiac, against the English. During the American
                    Revolution, they aided the English against the Americans. They also fought against whites at The
                    Fallen Timbers (1794) and at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> (1811.) Such were the usual alliances of the Indians of this area. The
                    author's description of the massacre at Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName>, during the War of 1812, enables the reader to understand why pioneers hated the
                    Indian. The discussions of land cessions and the removal of the tribe present an entirely different
                    atmosphere. The Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> Massacre and "The Trail of Death" illustrate the extremes in the
                    relations between whites and Indians.</p>
            <p>Pottawatomi trails and traditions are also discussed. Considerable biographical data are given of
                    various tribal leaders. Some of the better known Indian traders are presented. The author's
                    appraisal of the work of the missionaries includes favorable mention of those of the Catholic faith
                    as well as the Baptist missionary, Isaac McCoy. Ample illustrations and maps add to the value of the
                    book. The one-page bibliography consists largely of secondary sources, and only a few footnotes are
                    used.</p>
            <p>Those interested in the Indian history of Indiana will enjoy reading this account of the Pottawatomi.
                    The reviewer can testify that the author has succeedd in conveying his evident interest in and
                    enthusiasm for his subject to the pages of this little volume.</p>

                    the reach of too many who deserve the chance to read. She fears that young people of today read less

            <p>There have been long periods, some of them lasting for centuries, in which the essential, everyday
                    features of life changed very little. Mehods of growing crops, harvesting crops, and preparing them
                    for use were not greatly modified among settled, civilized peoples from the time of Pericles to that
                    of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was much the same with the making of clothing and the processes back of this
                    important human activity, as it was indeed with most of the things that made up the round of life.
                    Better hand tools, household utensils, carts and wagons, ships, buildings, and other individual
                    commodities were slowly devised, but, for extensive alterations in the ways of life and ways of
                    making a living, the world had to wait for the machine age. When one reflects on the extremely slow
                    evolution of society, government and education through many centuries of simple economic conditions,
                    it is not so difficult to understand the bewilderment that prevails in regard to finance, industrial
                    output, employment of laborers, transportation and international relationships that mark the present
                    complex set-up.</p>
            <p>Should the world come to another static period of several centuries, or one century, or even a half
                    century, one wonders whether the leaders of men would be better able to understand and solve the
                    economic problems confronting them—whether the lack of rapid changes would be a handicap
                    or a helpful feature of the situation. When our nation was born the leaders faced not only intricate
                    international problems and profound political problems at home, but they lived in a world
                    transformed by the commercial revolution and in a period of expansion in commercial banking such as
                    the world had not seen before. They also lived in a period when Europe had been tremendously
                    influenced by the colonization and exploitation of the New World. A new period of unrest was to
                    follow when the interior of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was to be colonized with astonishing rapidity, with an economic crisis coming at the
                    end of Jackson's presidency and another on the eve of the Civil War.</p>
            <p>It is in the period since the Civil War that changes have come to our country with such startling
                    speed. The spread of <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-035-1-105"/> the industrial revolution and the invention
                    of new machines and processes in rapid succession have transformed America and furnished undreamed
                    of problems in regard to production, transportation, finance, labor, social welfare, education,
                    morality and government.</p>
            <p>A vast number of living American men and women can remember conditions as they were sixty years ago.
                    It was long after that before I carried on my first telephone conversation. I saw the first electric
                    street-car on September 3, 1888, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Railroads had reached a high stage of development by the opening of the Civil
                    War, but the vast interurban system of Indiana was constructed after 1890. In fact most of the lines
                    were built between 1900 and 1915. Strange to say, in this field of transportation, the lines and
                    rolling stock have disappeared as rapidly as they came in. The high period of the interurban lasted
                    less than a quarter of a century.</p>
            <p>It was in the spring of 1898 that I first saw an automobile, or horseless buggy. By 1908, there were
                    quite a few in every city. Three years later, they were numerous enough to furnish all urban areas
                    with a real traffic problem, but with no parking problem as yet. In the summer of 1916, I bought a
                    Model T Ford car, and have owned some kind of an automobile for almost twenty-three years.</p>
            <p>I remember the day when the farm wagon was the means of transportation for my father and his family.
                    This was followed by a period when two-seated spring-wagons were used. The family was growing in
                    this epoch. "Growing" being interpreted, means that the number of children
                    increased from four to seven during the spring-wagon age, while, at the same time, the older
                    children increased considerably in stature and weight. The truth is that the two-seated carry-all
                    worked pretty well as long as there were not over five children. The parents, a baby, and one small
                    child could occupy the front seat. The three older children could sit comfortable in the rear seat.
                    More was accomplished at times but it was with difficulty. There were emergencies, I believe, when
                    the two seats held all nine of us, which meant five in the rear, with two youngsters, who at
                    frequent intervals stood up to rest all concerned, seated on the knees of older children. As the
                    rising generation grew older, one, two, and sometimes three single buggies were maintained.</p>
            <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-035-1-106"/>
            <p>There were country families who maintained carriages, but these were expensive luxuries for both
                    rural and town families. In the ante-automobile age, country families held a distinct advantage over
                    city people in the matter of transportation. There were always horses and wagons on farms, and, when
                    a farmer purchased a carriage or spring-wagon, he simply supplied himself with a light set of double
                    harness and transformed a farm team into a pair of drivers at will. Two blacks, greys, bays, roans
                    or sorrels equipped with shiny harness and hitched to a Sunday vehicle always attracted attention.
                    The city family that could afford a carrige must also be able to own horses and assume the burden of
                    upkeep. This caused the phaeton, an equipage that required but one horse, to be popular with
                    dwellers in towns. The real situation was this, however, that business and professional men and
                    their families walked while many country families, who could not otherwise compete with them, rode
                    in spring-wagons, carriages, or buggies. In the larger cities, street-cars faced little competition
                    in the horse and buggy days. Just as gunpowder made all men equal in height a few centuries ago, so
                    motor cars have placed urban residents on a par with their country cousins in the matter of local
                    transportation.</p>
            <p>The sickle, of similar design to the familiar grass-hook of today, was the simple grain-harvesting
                    tool for a long age. The cradle, which superseded the sickle, was a boon to harvesters, but it was
                    largely superseded by the reaper in a comparatively short time. Born on a retarded frontier, where
                    there were numerous stumps in most of the fields, I saw much grain (wheat, oats, rye, flax)
                    harvested with the cradle. The reaper was in successful use twenty years before my day, but many
                    farmerrs in frontier areas of the Old Northwest were twenty-five years late in reaching the stage
                    where they could use it to advantage or afford to purchase it.</p>
            <p>For a few years after I was old enough to gather sheaves or help shock wheat, I saw harvesting done
                    by the reaper. One man drove the machine, and unless the crop was light, there were four binders and
                    two shockers. This meant a Torce of seven men, with two or three boys, to gather sheaves and carry
                    water. In a good field of grain, a farmer with a brisk team could keep the entire gang on the jump.
                    The regular harvest wage was $2.00 per day. To avoid a heavy outlay on labor and to ease
                    the high cost of machinery, two <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-035-1-107"/> farmers often joined in the
                    purchase of a reaper. It was not uncommon for the owner, or owners, to harvest the crop of some
                    neighbor and let him pay by his labor. When the cutting of a field of wheat started, four stations
                    were agreed upon. These separated the distance around the field into fmr approximately equal
                    sections. Each of the four binders must finish one section during every round of the reaper, advance
                    to the next section and so on till the field was finished. Whenever the driver was able to catch a
                    harvest-hand before his last bundle was tied and thrown out of the way, the men in the field were
                    apt to let out some lusty yells. In fact, as I remember it, the annual harvest season was a time of
                    much hilarity, though, as a rule, nothing but cold water was served to the men.</p>
            <p>From time immemorial, each sheaf was bound with a handfull of grain stalks. Just as the harvester was
                    ready to tie up a bundle, he would deftly size a proper amount of straw, divide it into equal parts,
                    and skilfully turn one part about the other at the heads so that when drawn about the sheaf the
                    "double-band" would hold together. Grasping the band at the union he would stoop
                    quickly, pick up the grain for his bundle, place the band around it, move his hands back towards the
                    butts of the two parts of the band, draw it up tightly, connect the ends with a hurried twist and
                    force them under a part of the band. An expert binder could do all this with real speed and
                    efficiency, but sheaves tied up by a poor workman would often fall apart before they could be placed
                    in the shock. I have never forgotten the moment when I succeeded in binding my first sheaf of wheat.</p>
            <p>Many farmers continued to use the reaper for a time alter the appearance of the self-binder. It was
                    in the early eighteen-eighties that I saw the first mechanical binder in action. It was but a few
                    years until binders were a part of the equipment of all grain farmers. I need not mention the more
                    modern combiners that are now used on many farms.</p>
            <p>The steam thresher, succeeding the threshing machine operated by horse-power, was in general use
                    before I was born. I remember very well separators that were not equipped with stackers, blowers or
                    self-feeders. The grain was carried to the bin or hauled to market in bags. Grain sacks were made to
                    hold two bushels. When filled with wheat, the weight was one hundred twenty pounds. A country boy
                    was <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-035-1-108"/> respected by his elders and companions when he could stand
                    flat-footed, place his hands and forearms about a two-bushel bag of wheat and lay it on his
                    shoulder. I never won renown for physical strength or prowess, but I recall that I first shouldered
                    a sack of wheat when I was seventeen years of age.</p>
            <p>The development of moving pictures, the evolution of the radio, the rapid perfection and extensive
                    use of air craft —each of which has greatly changed the world in which we
                    live—I feel no call to write about. These are phases of the shifting twentieth century
                    scene for men and women of a younger generation to handle. Like others of my age, I can, of course,
                    appreciate the difference between the new period and that which preceded the advent of the cinema,
                    the transmission of sound over the ether waves, and the navigation of the air. It is difficult, I am
                    sure, for all who have reached maturity since 1910 to correctly envision the conditions of the day
                    when there were no movies, no radio to turn on, and no airplanes, but humanity actually did somehow
                    struggle through long ages without them.</p>
            <p>I have written about tangible things, the changes connected with which it has been easy for anyone to
                    observe. In the wake of industrialism and the building of the accompanying financial structure,
                    there have come new conditions more baffling to the understanding. The simple civilization of
                    yesterday has gone forever. Millions of people are riding the surging waves produced by evolving
                    economic and social forces without rudder or compass. The leaders in the fields of industry and
                    finance seem to be as completely lost as the masses. Using his creative ingenuity, man has invented
                    numerous labor-saving machines, discovered marvelous processes, and developed intricate financial
                    methods. He has also perfected effective means of destruction for use in war. The result is that
                    civilized peoples are seemingly overwhelmed by the forces that have been turned loose in the world.
                    Men are at the mercy of these forces, it appears, and they must now employ their creative energies
                    to get in control of the powerful factors they have permitted to get the best of them or perish.</p>

            <p>Samuel Abbott of English ancestry was born on February 2, 1819, and died on December 1, 1903. He was
                    one of a family of sixteen children. The family migrated from some eastern state arriving by
                    flatboat in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana. On the journey, family tradition says that the father, mother, and
                    four children died of an epidemic, and that the rest of the family arrived in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County about 1821 or 1822. Probably the eldest child of this family was Elizabeth (b.
                    1793 or 1794; m.—Kingsley; d. February, 1881).</p>
            <p>Others of the family—Hiram, Mary, Samuel, Edward, Isaiah —went to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The other children died in infancy. Samuel Abbott lived in various homes in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County until 1834, when he went with his guardian, August Peabody. to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He was married on August 30, 1840, to Eliza Ann Lester. She was born on March
                    5, 1821. The Lester family was also from <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County. Other members of the family were: Parmelia (who married Augustus Peabody),
                    Sarah (who married Eli Schooner), Eliza Ann, Mary, John, and David. Their mother is thought to have
                    been an Appleby. The mother of Samuel Abbott was a Currier. Names of parents and earlier ancestry of
                    Samuel Abbott and his wife, Eliza Ann Lester, are wanted.—G. D. G.</p>
