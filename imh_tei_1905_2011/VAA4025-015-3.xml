            <p>First I wish to give a brief account of my father, Josiah Records, as an
                    introduction to my own. Josiah Records, son of John Records and Ann Calaway, his
                    wife, was born May 1, O.S. 1741, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sussex county</region>

            <p>He served seven years in the Revolutionary war with <placeName>

                    </placeName>, driving a wagon most of the time. In 1765, my father with his
                    family, mother, sister and two brothes-in-law, Joseph Inatmas Finch, and others,
                    embarked on board a sloop in the <geogName>Nantucket river</geogName>, descended
                    to its mouth in the Chesapeake bay, thence to the mouth of the <geogName>Potomac
                        river</geogName> and then ascended the river to <placeName>

            <p>In the spring of 1766, my father in company with two brothers-in-law crossed the
                    Alleghany mountains and took up land near <geogName>Fort Laurel hill</geogName>,
                    Dunbar creek, so called in honor of Dunbar who camped on said creek in the rear
                    of Bradock's army, was mortally wounded and taken to camp, where he
                    died and was buried. This country was known at that time as the Red Stone
                    country, on account of the Red Stone creek <list type="footnotes">

                        <geogName>Monongahala river</geogName>, twelve miles northwest of where
                    Uniontown now stands, near Bainsville. They followed the trail of
                    Braddock's memorable march across to <geogName>Fort Laurel
                    hill</geogName>, <placeName>

            <p>After clearing ground and planting it in corn and tending it, they returned and
                    in the fall moved their families over the mountains. My father hired Peter
                    Meebut with his cart and three horses to move him, taking with him my uncle
                    Johna-than's blacksmith tools with the exception of the anvil which was
                    too heavy to carry. They traveled over Braddock's old road. At that
                    time there were only about ten or twelve in the settlement, a few along the road
                    and the <geogName>Youghogania river</geogName>,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> some about
                    Red Stone Old Fort and a few near Fort Pitt. The emigration was lively and
                    settlements were made at a considerable distance apart in different directions.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it might not be out of place to speak of the life of the early settlers
                    of the Red Stone settlement. Transportation across the mountains was altogether
                    on horse-back. They could carry little more than their clothing, beds and
                    cooking utensils. Deer, bear and turkeys were abundant so they were well
                    supplied with meat. The bread meal was made by pounding corn in a hollow made in
                    the end of a block of wood, called a hominy block. This block was set upright,
                    corn put in the depression, and pounded with an iron until it was converted into
                    meal. They had no flour. There were no stores west of the <geogName>Laurel
                    hills</geogName> and such things as were needed had to be brought over on the
                    pack horse from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> which was about one hundred and thirty miles away. Some
                    enterprising people made a business of collecting the skins of wild animals,
                    bear, deer and other fur-bearing animals, and also collecting ginseng. They
                    carried them to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> to barter for goods. My father was an expert hunter and killed many
                    deer and bear so made a trip every winter after the hunting season was over and
                    brought back such articles as we were in need of. It appears to me that the
                    people lived happier and had more real enjoyment then, than they do at the
                    present time, (1842) with their luxuries, <list type="footnotes">

                    That is the way I see it now at the advanced age of eighty years.</p>
            <p>About the year 1768 Philip Short erected a tub-wheel grist-mill on Dunbar creek.
                    My father did the mill-wright work and my uncle Inatmas the blacksmith work. It
                    was built on a small scale and very imperfect on account of the lack of tools
                    and iron. An ax was driven into a stump and the poll used for the anvil. The
                    mill when complete had a capacity of fifteen bushels of corn per day, which was
                    amply sufficient to make meal for the entire neighborhood and was considered
                    quite an improvement, being the first mill west of the Laurel hills.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, one Henry Beason built a mill on Red Stone creek and laid out a
                    town calling it Redstone, now Uniontown, capital of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette county</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The year 1772 marked the end of six years of happy life. Father sold his
                    plantation and purchased land about fourteen miles from Fort Pitt on the north
                    bank of Red Stone Run. In 1774 the Indians broke out but on this occasion the
                    whites were the aggressors. This outbreak was caused chiefly by the murder of
                    Bald Eagle, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> chief, by some villain on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. The
                    Indian was in his canoe when shot. Logan Mingo, a celebrated chief, was also
                    murdered with the rest of his family by Michael Cresap.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    When the hostilities began we were compelled to fortify ourselves. Governor
                    Dunmore of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> marched an army into the Indian country and as the Indians had not
                    done much mischief the army soon returned after patching up a kind of a peace
                    treaty which was of short duration.</p>
            <p>During the interval of peace in 1776 my father built a mill on Raccoon creek on
                    land he had previously purchased, ten miles northwest from home. He hired Isaac
                    Felta to keep the mill until the spring of 1777 when he moved there himself. The
                    Indians renewed hostilities in the spring. There were a few families fortified
                    at the mill. The Indians fired on John Stallian shooting him in the arm and
                    killing his mare. The mare ran to Dalous fort, about a mile, and then <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">3</hi> Logan was not killed, though his family was, nor
                            did Cresap commit the murders, though it was commonly believed on the
                            frontier that he did.—E<hi rend="sc">D</hi>.</item>

                    <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-015-3-004"/> fell dead. This was all the mischief done
                    near us but in other places the people fared worse.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1777 my father returned home and as the Indians lived some little
                    distance away and the winter was severly cold they did not trouble us much
                    during that season and we all stayed at home in safety. But in the spring of
                    1778 we were at McDonnal fort and father had obtained a guard of men to be
                    stationed at his mill. The men went in companies to get their grinding done.
                    When winter set in the guard left the mill but the miller stayed until March
                    first.</p>
            <p>In the year 1778, General McIntosh took an army into the Indian country, and
                    built a fort just below the mouth of the Big Bear creek, twenty miles below
                    Pitt's fort, and called it Fort Mclntosh where now stands the town of
                    Beaver. The same winter father received public money with which to purchase
                    grain to be ground in his mill for the use of the army.</p>
            <p>A great many cattle were taken over the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> and left
                    to shift for themselves, get a living if they could. The snow lay on the ground
                    all winter and they perished, were skinned and their hides were taken to the
                    mill in the spring.</p>
            <p>The army disbanded in the spring without pushing any farther into the Indian
                    country. There was a blockhouse half way between Pitt's fort and Fort
                    Mclntosh where men were stationed in time of war.</p>
            <p>As I have mentioned forts and forting I will give a brief description of a fort
                    together with a draft of one. First the timber and brush were cleared off until
                    a space sufficiently large was made and then a trench three feet deep was dug
                    all around an oblong square. The fort log was cut about twelve or fifteen inches
                    in diameter and fifteen feet long. These logs were split into halves the top end
                    sharpened and the large end set in the ditch, flat side in. The cracks were
                    stopped up with pieces set in. The dirt was then filled and well packed. Port
                    holes were cut high enough up so that balls fired from outside would pass over
                    the head. The cabins were built leaving plenty of room between them and the
                    stockade to load and shoot. Two stations were built at opposite corners with
                    port holes about eighteen inches from the ground. In case the Indians came near
                    the fort the inmates could rake the sides, that is, shoot them. One station
                    guarded one side and <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-015-3-005"/> one end. Two gates
                    about four by five feet which were very strong and barred so that they could not
                    possibly be forced open, were placed at opposite sides. Some forts, called
                    station houses, were built by raising two cabins adjoining each other about
                    eight feet high then a roof of split logs put on, the roof log extending two
                    feet over. Then logs are built up sufficiently high to allow plenty of room to
                    load and fire. Port holes were left to shoot out as well as down. The use of the
                    projection was to prevent the Indians from climbing up and getting or shooting
                    the inmates. Such a one was Bryant's Station.</p>
            <p>Sometime after Braddock's defeat the Indians were committing their cruel
                    depredations on the frontier settlements of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Two sisters by the name of Bancott aged six and eleven years
                    respectively were captured and carried away by them. The older one soon became
                    reconciled to live with the Indians and some time after married one of them. The
                    younger one although only six years old never became reconciled and never forgot
                    her white relations, her name, nor the name of the place where she was captured
                    and thought that if an opportunity was offered she would try to make her escape
                    to Fort Pitt, now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the Indians resorted to trade. She had no good opportunity
                    since they never took her near there and remained until one morning it was
                    impressed upon her to leave them and she saw that she might slip off unobserved.</p>
            <p>Putting her blanket over her head she started away in the direction she had seen
                    the Indians go when they started to Pitt's Fort. She traveled all day
                    and at night she looked for a small tree that had a fork and limbs so that she
                    could arrange a seat for herself and in case she fell asleep she would not fall
                    to the ground, being afraid of the wolves. She did not find a place to suit her
                    purpose until it began to get dark then she saw a light ahead of her and on
                    approaching near, found an old Indian and his squaw that were on their way to
                    Fort Pitt. They received her kindly and conducted her to Fort Pitt, supplying
                    her with the necessary provisions. She was then near her own people. The people
                    of the fort dressed her like her own people, as she had been dressed in Indian
                    attire; blanket, breech clout, leggins, moccasins; and <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-015-3-006"/> conducted her to her own home. Soon after her
                    arrival she gave a Christian experience and was received and baptised, soon
                    after marrying Thomas Simmons and lived a near neighbor to my father, about
                    fourteen miles from Fort Pitt.</p>
            <p>In the year 1774 General Dunmore of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> marched an army into the Indian country and held a treaty with
                    them. They promised to bring in all the prisoners they had and deliver them at
                    Fort Pitt. Among them they brought Susan Simmon's sister, the older of
                    the two sisters who were captured. Her sister went to see her and took her home
                    with her. She stayed only a few days, not being satisfied. She could not become
                    reconciled to civilization so they took her back to Fort Pitt and she went off
                    with the Indians.</p>
            <p>This remark will probably not be received by many but I will make it, be the
                    result what it may.</p>
            <p>Although the Lord permitted the younger one who came back and gave a Christian
                    experience and was baptized, to be captured, it was not his will that she should
                    become reconciled to stay with them. But the older sister who could not endure
                    civilization must have been of the Non Elect.</p>
            <p>In 1779 my father was elected captain of a company of soldiers and received his
                    commission from the governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> who claimed jurisdiction over all of <placeName>

                    </placeName> west of <geogName>Laurel hills</geogName>, which claim he held
                    until the spring of 1782.</p>
            <p>In March 1779, the Indians fell upon a company of sugar makers, killing five
                    young men and taking five others together with a boy, prisoners. This took place
                    on Raccoon creek, two miles below father's mill. My cousin Joshua Finch

                    We had been sent there on an errand and were delayed on account of the rise of
                    the creek. The Indians had discovered the camp and hid in the ambush over night
                    and fell upon them at day break with their tomahawks. This was known since they
                    were found all around in the camp except the body of one boy who had tried to
                    escape and was struck by a tomahawk when about fifty feet away from the camp.
                    They were all scalped. Two were named Devers, two were Turners, one a Fuller.
                    One boy lay in the camp with his shoes on slip shod, he was stabbed in the left
                    side and was lying on the other side with his fingers in or near the wound.</p>
            <p>The water fell and we started home the morning of the massacre. A man came from a
                    camp about a mile below to borrow a gimlet and found the men killed and the
                    women and boy gone. He gave the alarm to their friends at the settlement ten
                    miles away. The next day we went and buried the dead. Ephram Ralph,
                    father's cousin, who was a lieutenant in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> service, Captain Lowrey's company, was at home on a
                    furlough at the time and went with us. A grave was dug but the men were backward
                    about putting the bodies into it. Lowrey told them not to be backward for they
                    did not know how soon they might be in the same situation themselves, so setting
                    the example they were soon all laid in one grave and we returned home. These
                    were the first persons that I had seen massacred by the Indians and it was a
                    horrible sight to me, being worse because some of them had been my school mates
                    recently and the grief and lamentations of poor old William Turner who lost his
                    two boys, George and William. That day they captured his beautiful daughter
                    Betsey, not knowing what she might have to suffer at their hands. This grief
                    cannot be described by the pen.</p>
            <p>In 1782 as Captain Lowrey was decending the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> in a
                    boat with his company in order to join General Clark, he landed at the mouth of
                    a creek below the mouth of the Big Miami and was attacked and defeated by the
                    Indians. Lowrey and Ralph were both killed.</p>
            <p>In the spring of this year, some forted and others lived four or five families
                    together. Four families lived with father. About the first of August, Alexander
                    McCandles, who lived <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-015-3-008"/> about a mile and a
                    half from father, had occasion to go for Mrs. Meek, who was about fifty years
                    old, to attend his sick wife. After she stayed the required length of time they
                    set out for her home, six miles distant. When they were about one mile from her
                    home they were fired upon by the Indians in the ambush. Five or six of them lay
                    behind a log about twenty yards from the path. The shots pierced both their
                    horses. McCandles turned around and took the path for home and was soon out of
                    danger. They sprang toward the old lady, one of them throwing his tomahawk and
                    stuck it in a tree near her head. She stuck to her saddle and the horse soon
                    carried her home.</p>
            <p>A few days later Alexander McNealey and brother, both bachelors who had forted at
                    Robert Lowrey's, started home by themselves. Their dog began to bark,
                    alarming them and they returned to the settlement and secured six men to
                    accompany them leaving James who was about sixty years old, there. The Indians
                    seeing the men go away followed them and waylaid them on their return. They
                    killed McNealey and four others. One made his escape by running and was not
                    killed but in trying to jump over a muddy stream was captured on account of
                    falling. Shortly after that two men who lived at father's started out
                    in the evening to hunt, taking a path that led to a deserted plantation. They
                    had not proceeded more than a mile when they were fired upon by the Indians and
                    both killed. Father hearing both guns fired, became alarmed and in company with
                    others started on the run to look for them and found them both shot and scalped.
                    Their names were Collins and Reardon. The settlers all forted or abandoned their
                    homes. Father moved eight miles away. When winter set in they returned home.
                    After the death of McNealey, his brother James who was his only heir went on his
                    plantation and lived alone. One cold morning when the snow was very deep, one of
                    the neighbors went to his house to borrow a bag. He knocked and called at the
                    door but received no answer, pushed open the door and went in and found the old
                    man lying dead with his feet in the fire, badly burned. How long he had been
                    there no one could tell.</p>
            <p>In those days it came to pass that the devil entered into one Colonel Williamson
                    who lived about fifteen miles west of us <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-015-3-009"/>
                    and stirred him up to raise a company of men to go against a town of friendly
                    Indians, chiefly of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> tribe and professing the Moravian religion. They had taken no part
                    with the hostile Indians. They lived on one of the tributaries of the
                        <geogName>Muskingum river</geogName>. Williamson having raised his army,
                    crossed the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> and reached the town and as the
                    Indians were friendly they anticipated no danger and did not take up arms
                    against him. He told them he had come to take them across the river since he was
                    apprehensive that hostile Indians were staying there. The Indians agreed to this
                    and that night the women were busily engaged in preparing meat and bread
                    sufficient for their young. In the morning Williamson, having them under his
                    control, ordered them all into two houses; the men in one and the women and
                    children in the other. He then ordered his men to go on to them with their
                    tomahawks. To this some objected and called on God to witness that they were
                    innocent people. However he found enough ready and willing to accomplish his
                    designs and they went in upon them with their tomahawks. Then the butchery
                    began, two young men sat down and began to sing a hymn and continued to sing
                    while they were all being murdered. They were all murdered without distinction
                    of sex or age. Such a piece of butchery the Indians were never guilty of. It was
                    disgraceful to any people professing the Christian religion. I do not remember
                    the number slain. He then returned home in triumph. I never heard any one
                    mention this circumstance without expressing his abhorence of the affair, except
                    one poor old Scotchman, James Greenlee. He said they did right but he did not
                    receive any sanction of his approval from his neighbors.</p>
            <p>(1779) Although my father's mill was deserted and the nearest fort was
                    five miles away, the Indians did not burn it down. The people went there in
                    companies to get their grinding done. Father did the grinding and
                    notwithstanding the fact that the people went into fort or moved away, they all
                    raised a sufficient amount of corn for their subsistence. They collected in
                    companies and went from farm to farm and while a part of them did the ploughing
                    and hoeing, the others stood guard and prevented a surprise from the Indians.</p>
            <p>(1780) In the spring of 1780, father moved fifteen miles <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-015-3-010"/> away and it was during the following summer that
                    Colonel Crawford's unfortunate expedition took place. In this
                    expedition, one of my uncles that married father's sister Susannah, who
                    was a lieutenant in Capt. David Andre's company, was slain together
                    with his captain and many others of my acquaintance.</p>
            <p>(1781) In the spring of 1781 my father moved ten miles away. The Indians were
                    quiet that summer in our neighborhood. Soon after this father sold his mill
                    stones, irons and bolting cloths to Joseph Gemmel who was erecting a mill on
                    Ghaston creek. He sold his land on Raccoon creek to James Crawford Tucker after
                    forting and moving for five years.</p>
            <p>1782) In 1782, father moved 20 miles away and bought a plantation of W. Fry on
                    Peter's creek and took final leave of his plantation on Raccoon creek.
                    All forted or moved away except one man named Clark who lived one mile east of
                    father. One day during the summer I was sent back home on an errand in company
                    with John Woods. We had to pass Clark's house on the way. As we came
                    near to the house we saw blood in the yard and, seeing no one, we opened the
                    door and went inside. We were horrified at the sight of seeing him and three of
                    his little children (ages 3, 5, and 7) lying there dead, tomahawked and scalped.
                    One of them was not quite dead yet and lay there groaning. The woman with a
                    young child and a boy eleven years old were taken. One little girl about nine
                    years old was at the spring and saw them and hid in the weeds until she thought
                    they were gone, then she ran to Turner's fort about three miles away
                    and gave the alarm. The men at the fort pursued the savages. After following
                    them about five miles, they found the little babe, wrapped in its
                    mother's apron, dead, having been tomahawked and scalped. Its mother
                    was not able to carry it and keep up with the Indians. Perhaps she though the
                    apron would frighten the wolves and prevent their devouring the child and that
                    the people at the fort would pursue the Indians and on finding the child, carry
                    it to the fort and bury it. Such was the case.</p>
            <p>They pursued the Indians until they lost all hope of overtaking them and rescuing
                    the prisoners, so they returned home. The mother afterward escaped and came home
                    through the wilderness. At this outbreak there were 17 killed and <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-015-3-011"/> nine taken prisoners from our neighborhood. During
                    the War of the Revolution, the British had taken the Indians for their allies,
                    paying them for scalps of men, woven and children. That was the cause of the
                    murder of more children than would have been committed otherwise. The incidents
                    that I relate are those that were committed in our own neighborhood only, but
                    the settlement west of us and east of the Monongahala suffered severly. I cannot
                    give an account of these at present.</p>
            <p>In 1783, father bought land of John Kiser, which lay in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Kiser was to leave in the fall. Father and uncle Finch built a
                    boat for my two cousins and myself to descend the river to the land purchased,
                    to carry the horses and cattle and raise a crop, as they contemplated moving the
                    following fall.</p>

            <p>We had on board four horses and some cattle. We found no settlement and searched
                    for a road and failed to find one. There was a buffalo road, however, that
                    crossed Limestone creek a few miles above and passed my lick on to the Louis
                    Blaine lick and then on to <geogName>Licking river</geogName>, then on to
                    Bryant's station, but we knew nothing of it at that time, so we
                    descended the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> to the mouth of the Licking,
                    landing November 29, 1783. We set off up the <geogName>Licking river</geogName>
                    after having to get out and push and pull our boat over the shoals. After
                    working hard for four days and making little headway we landed our boat and hid
                    our property in the woods. The property consisted of whiskey and farming
                    implements. We then descended the <geogName>Licking river</geogName> to the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> which by this time had taken a rapid rise,
                    and had backed the water up the Licking so that we took Kisers' boat as
                    far as we had taken our property and unloaded it. We left on the bank of the
                        <geogName>Licking river</geogName> a new wagon, perhaps the first one in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Leaving our property in care of Kiser, we then packed up and set
                    off up the <geogName>Licking river</geogName>, but made poor <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-015-3-012"/> headway after several days' travel. Snow
                    began to fall and as there was no cane in this part of the country for our
                    cattle and horses to subsist upon, we set out in search of some. Kiser sent us
                    in care of Hugh Fry who had come down the river with cattle for his father.</p>
            <p>When we came to the fork of the Licking we found a wagon road leading up the
                    south fork, cut out by Cale Bird, a British officer, who had ascended the
                        <geogName>Licking river</geogName> in his boats with Canadians and Indians.
                    They were several days cutting the road which led to Ridle's Fort which
                    stood on the east bank of the <geogName>Licking river</geogName> three miles
                    below the junction of the Hensons and Stone fork.</p>
            <p>The people at the fort were not aware that the British were approaching until
                    they were upon them and they were ordered to surrender. This they refused to do
                    and they were attacked and were unable to cope with the British and were
                    compelled to surrender their stoctkade. They then proceeded six miles further up
                    the river to Martin's fort on <geogName>Stone river</geogName> and
                    succeeded in capturing them.</p>
            <p>We followed the road in the snow, it was by this time half knee deep. Early in
                    the morning, when about three miles from Riddle's fort we came upon
                    three families who were camping. They had landed at Limestone but finding no
                    road, they had wandered through woods until they came to the road which they
                    followed. The night before we came to them Mrs. Downey was brought to bed. They
                    were poor and had not so much as a spare blanket to spread over her, but set
                    forks in the ground, poles on the forks and bushes over for a kind of shelter.
                    She had no necessities of any kind, not even bread, only venison and turkey.
                    They went to the same station we did. She had several children, one a young
                    lady. She said she had never done better at such a time in her life. So we see
                    that the Lord is good and merciful and worthy of praise from all beings, by
                    fitting the back to suit the burden. I have mentioned this circumstance for the
                    encouragement of others. We should at all times of trial or difficulty put our
                    trust in the Lord who is alone able to save all that trust in Him. The names of
                    these people were Reves, Demit and Downey.</p>
            <p>We went to the fort, where we found plenty of company. The next morning, John
                    Finch and I started out to find <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-015-3-013"/> and left the horses in the care of Josiah
                    Finch and Henry Fry, with orders that if the snow went off or rain fell, to take
                    them over the river. As there was no road to follow, we took up Mill creek and
                    near the head of it, we met some hunters who had been on the south side of the
                        <geogName>Kentucky river</geogName>. They gave us direction to find a
                    hunting trace that led to Bryant's station and gave each of us a wheat
                    cake. The flour had been ground on a hand mill and sifted, and I was not well
                    and had not seen bread for three months, I thought it was the best bread I had
                    ever tasted.</p>
            <p>We went to Bryant's station and the next day we went to
                    McConnel's station. One mile north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> where there was a mill, we got the meal we had promised Kiser and
                    the next morning we set off and it rained almost all day. About sunset, we came
                    to the river which was very high. We expected to find the boys on our side of
                    the river but they had not crossed it yet, according to our strict orders. We
                    knew of no better way to retaliate on them than to bake a Johny cake, walk to
                    the river and hold it up for them to see. We did so, they saw it but did not
                    taste it. By this time the rain was over but we were cold and wet and as it got
                    colder, we made a fire and camped there that night.</p>
            <p>Early the next morning we set off down the river and camped that night on the
                    bank of <geogName>Licking river</geogName>. It was very cold and we suffered
                    severely. The next evening at dark, we arrived at Kiser's camp. The
                    next evening we set off on our return. When we reached Ridle's Station
                    the river had fallen so much that we could easily ford it. We then started for
                    McConnel's station and arrived there the last of December.</p>
            <p>Some time in January four of us set out to hunt for buffalo on the river. The
                    buffalo had all gone off and we were obliged to pursue them twenty miles before
                    overtaking them. The second night it snowed and turned very cold. In the morning
                    the snow was so deep we could not trace our horses. We hunted for them, but did
                    not succeed in finding them. So we hung up our saddles and started for home on
                    foot, supposing that our horses had gone in that direction. It snowed all day
                    and at night we came to Elk Horn creek. The snow was about knee deep. We waded
                    the creek which was about the same depth and soon found ourselves in a large
                    cane brake <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-015-3-014"/> where we could get no wood to
                    make a fire. The cane was all bending with the snow and no broken wood was to be
                    found. At last we found one old dry hickory stump about fifteen feet high. We
                    pushed it down. It was dry and rotten. We put fire to it and soon had a good
                    fire. This was all the fire we had that night. We scraped the snow away and lay
                    by it, but we could not dry our leggins by it. The next morning we went on four
                    miles farther to Bryant's Station and when we arrived our leggins and
                    moccasins were frozen and our feet also were frozen. Shortly after we arrived,
                    our horses were found by hunters and were brought in. This snow was not all off
                    until the 10th of March, 1784, and then went off with a rain. This was a severe
                    winter, my horses except one and all my cattle strayed off so I could not find
                    them. John Finch and I started to look after our property on the Licking and
                    found all safe. Had some trouble on account of high water and was gone ten days.</p>
            <p>In the course of the spring, people began to settle in the neighborhood of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Colonel Gerrad settled a station on the same river. He was a
                    cousin of the lamented and much loved Gen. William Henry Harrison. Benjamin
                    Harrison settled near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> this spring. Mr. McCleland settled a station at Kinkson and Stone
                    Fork. Simon Kenton settled a station one mile north of where the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands, the capitol of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Mason county</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. A block and warehouse were built at Limestone which caused the
                    emigration down the river that spring. Father's land lay remote from
                    any settlement. Times being hard we did not sell it but took a lease of Mr.
                    McConnel and put up a cabin and two of us lived together. Henry Fry, two cousins
                    and myself lived near each other. We had to depend on hunting for meat and the
                    buffalo had retreated so far away that we could get only deer and turkey to
                    supply us.</p>
            <p>In the spring we were attacked with fever; was quite sick but got better, when I
                    heard of my horses at Harrison's station. I went after them and on my
                    return was in the rain almost all day which caused a relapse which was worse
                    than the former attack. This put me back with my work so that I only got four
                    acres planted in corn that spring. Range was good and cane plenty and I raised
                    sufficient corn for my own <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-015-3-015"/> use and to
                    supply my father until he could raise corn of his own. This spring Uncle Finch
                    came down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and went in the cabin with us. I heard of my mare about 15 miles
                    west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> near a great buffalo road that came south from the northwest out of
                    the knobs and led to the Blue Lick, crossing north Elk Horn at a point called
                    the great crossing, which name it still bears. My two-year-old colt was found
                    near the Big Bear and brought in so I had all my horses. In the course of the
                    season I made two trips to Lime Stone packing rum and iron for a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> merchant, Thomas James. I also built a good cabin for father and in
                    the fall gathered my corn, also a small works was constructed to make salt at
                    the Blue Lick on the west side of the river, (a salt spring.) This was most
                    convenient to Lime Stone although the main spring was on the other side of the
                    river. Some time this summer a family landed at Lime Stone that had the Small
                    Pox, and went on to Blue Lick but were not permitted to enter the fort but
                    camped on the opposite side of the river. The Indians fell on them in the night
                    and murdered the whole lot of them.</p>
            <p>I started in search of my cattle accompanied by Alexander McConnel. We took a
                    N.E. course to the ford of <geogName>Licking river</geogName>. We then went
                    north and hunted some days; then returned and went into camp not far from the
                    main <geogName>Licking river</geogName>, thinking that we would go to the north
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> early the next morning. Before we came to the Licking, we killed a
                    large buck elk. We skinned him and hung up the skin. We took some of the meat.
                    We went on to the river and crossed it and soon found the fresh track of an
                    Indian which we followed for several miles. That evening a heavy rain wet our
                    guns and rendered them useless to us. About sunset we came to Kiser's
                    camp and camped for the night. The Indians had cut his wagon some and destroyed
                    one of the kettles. As our guns were wet and out of order we let them remain so,
                    and I now believe it was providential. If we had put them in order that night,
                    which could have been done by picking powder into the touch hole and firing them
                    off (flint locks), the Indians would have heard us and would have come in search
                    of us and found us by our fire. The next morning they were camped not more than
                    a mile distant, but we knew nothing of them nor they of us. At another time we
                    traveled <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-015-3-016"/> all day in the rain and about
                    sunset, we were going along the banks of a small stream, when we saw a number of
                    Indians on the opposite side of the stream. Our powder was wet and no doubt
                    theirs was not dry, consequently, neither party was prepared to open fire, so we
                    passed quietly up and the Indians down the stream. Presently an Indian broke the
                    silence, saying, "Say, white man, have you been to steal a
                    hoss?" We made no reply and were soon out of sight and no doubt both
                    were glad of it. When morning came, we thought we would get our horses and put
                    our guns in order.</p>
            <p>Soon after we separated, we heard the report of twelve or fifteen guns. When we
                    met, neither of us had found our horses. "Did you hear the
                    guns?" I said, "Yes, I did. Its Indians." "I
                    knew it," he answered. "They have probably found our camp and
                    are waiting for our return." I thought that as the woods was open, if
                    they were on this side of the river we could see them. I suggested that we had
                    better run to the river bank. Should they be there and not shoot us, we could
                    then try to get to our camp. We went to the river bank but did not see them so
                    returned to our camp and took our saddles, blankets and guns and carried them
                    out of sight of the camp and soon found our horses, saddled and mounted them.
                    McConnel asked if I could find the way without keeping in the road and I
                    answered in the affirmative. He said, "Then go ahead and make the best
                    of your way for if the Indians find our camp they will follow us faster than we
                    can ride, and as our guns are out of order we can't defend ourselves
                    and might be killed."</p>
            <p>At this time the ground was covered with a thick growth of weeds and pea vines
                    which made it much to our disadvantage and would be also to their disadvantage
                    if pursuing us. Leaving this place, we struck no road for miles. We came to a
                    creek that we could not ford, being much swollen on account of last
                    night's rain. However, by riding up the stream a short distance we came
                    to where two forks met. We started up the left hand fork and forded and soon
                    after crossing we came upon the trail of a large herd of buffalo that had been
                    feeding. We followed this trail some distance so that if the Indians were
                    following us, we would leave the <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-015-3-017"/> impression
                    with them that we were hunting, and try to break them off of our trail.</p>
            <p>About sunset we came to the place where we had killed the elk. McConnel said that
                    if I would make a fire, he would go back a half mile or so and watch our trail
                    to see that no Indian was following after us. He did so and came back after dark
                    and reported that no Indian was to be seen. We then took our horses to where the
                    grass was good and shackled them and lay down to rest. Soon a heavy shower of
                    rain fell and we were obliged to seek shelter under the elk hide. After the rain
                    we rekindled the fire which was almost rained out. We gathered brush and sticks
                    to lie upon until morning came. We then put our guns in order and felt secure as
                    the Indians could not follow us on account of the heavy rain fall. About ten
                    A.M. we started for home and arrived there in the evening of the tenth day,
                    after we left it.</p>
            <p>The last of this month, four of us started to hunt a small stream called Dry run,
                    about 16 miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When there we killed the largest buffalo I ever saw. He was fat
                    and good beef. This was at the time of the year called bellowing time, when the
                    buffalo were wandering around and bellowing and were more easily found and
                    killed. The calves are all dropped in the spring time and when young resemble
                    our common red calf and might easily be mistaken for one. We skinned the bull;
                    cut the meat into thin wide strips and laid it on the hide and salted it. After
                    it took salt, we set forks in the ground beside our fire, then laid poles on the
                    forks, sticks across the poles, and then laid the meat on these sticks and over
                    the fire and allowed it to remain until about half done and then turned it over
                    and allowed it to remain until morning when it was about half cooked and half
                    dried, then we put it in bags and sent it home for the use of the families.</p>
            <p>When we lay down to sleep, we took our saddles, blankets and guns and lay down in
                    the darkest place we could find, not near the fire, for fear the Indians would
                    come to us. At one time we were suspicious that the Indians were following us. A
                    scout had been detailed to look for them and had seen them in camp. When we lay
                    down, we each wrapped a blanket around a chunk or small log and placed them
                    around the <pb n="218" id="VAA4025-015-3-018"/> fire, so that they looked just
                    like a lot of men lying with their feet to the fire. After all was ready, we
                    retired a little way off, awaiting the attack, feeling sure they would come, and
                    they did come. Stepping up in gun shot distance, they all fired at the same time
                    at the objects around the fire, supposing them to be men. They then rushed up
                    with their knives and tomahawks intending to kill all that were not shot. The
                    whites opened fire on them and but one or two made their escape. This was a
                    decoy not often played on the Indians.</p>
            <p>I will relate a dream. Some may think it superstitious but I believe it was the
                    means of saving our lives. March 10, 1790, brother Laban and I started to hunt.
                    We hunted all day, and at night we went into camp near the head of a small run.
                    After supper, we lay down with our clothes on, except our moccasins. We had our
                    guns and shot pouches at our sides. My dog lay at my head; our horses were about
                    two hundred yards away and shackled so that if we were to be surprised by the
                    Indians and not killed, we could get them. We lay down and slept. During the
                    latter part of the night I dreamed that brother Laban and I had gone hunting,
                    (just as we had really done) had gone into camp, and that the dog at my head
                    looked down the stream and growled. I awoke and thought it only a dream. I went
                    to sleep again and dreamed the same thing; when I awoke, my dog looked down the
                    stream and growled. I became alarmed and woke brother Laban and told him that I
                    suspected that the Indians were near and told him to lie still until I put on my
                    moccasins. Then I lay down and he raised up and did the same. We thought that if
                    we both got up at once, that if the Indians were in sight, they might rush upon
                    us and kill us. Both being now ready, we sprang up at once and taking our
                    blankets and saddles we retired near where our horses were and awaited day
                    break, which was the Indians favorite time to make attacks. We saddled our
                    horses and were off quietly as possible. We hunted that day and went home that
                    night. I believed then and still believe that the Indians were creeping upon us.</p>
            <p>March 10, 1790. Indians were on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> near the north of the Scioto with two persons. John May was
                    ascending the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> with three men in a boat. One was Flinn, but I have <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-015-3-019"/> forgotten the other man's name. As they
                    came opposite the Indians, they compelled the persons to go to the bank and
                    raise a lamentable cry, begging these men to take them on board, saying they had
                    been taken prisoners but had escaped. John May and his companions were fearful
                    it was a deception and made no attempt to land. The men on the bank still
                    continued to follow after them, and finally they were over persuaded and landed
                    and as soon as the boat touched the land, the Indians fired on them and killed
                    John May and one of the women in his party. The rest were taken prisoners before
                    they had left the boat.</p>
            <p>Thomas Marshall of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and some other gentlemen were descending the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> with their boats, poorly manned, and loaded with horses and store
                    goods. The Indians sprang into the boat already captured and compelled the
                    prisoners to help them. The other being poorly manned, the Indians soon came up
                    to them and opened a heavy fire on them. Marshall soon saw that he was not able
                    to cope with the Indians by fighting or running. Finally they all boarded one
                    boat and abandoned the other two. The one now being well manned, shot past the
                    Indians and was out of danger. The Indians soon gave up the chase. Before the
                    Indians could land the boats captured, they were below the mouth of the Scioto.</p>
            <p>The alarm was soon given out that the Indians had captured two boats and
                    $2,000 worth of store goods and 28 head of horses. Whereupon I
                    received orders to raise all the men I could and if the men could not be raised
                    to draft one third of my company and report at Lime Stone that evening with six
                    days' rations. I raised all I could without drafting and marched to
                    Lime Stone that evening and met about one hundred more. We crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> that same evening and went into camp and the next morning were
                    paraded by a brave fellow, whose name I shall withhold. We were placed in two
                    ranks, Indian file, with orders to march about twenty yards apart. With Captain
                    Kenton at the head of one line, and myself at the head of the other, while he,
                    the commanding officer, rode about on a fine charger with Dr. Johnson as
                    sergeant in case he was needed, and brother Laban Records as pilot, knowing him
                    to be a number one woodsman. A pilot <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-015-3-020"/> was
                    useless as we were to march up the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> but he had
                    use for one.</p>
            <p>We marched on in good order for some time until we came upon fresh signs of
                    Indians, when our commander became alarmed and told his pilot to let us quit the
                    river and take to the hills. He accordingly steered a northeast course into the
                    hills and knobs. At length we came to a creek and there saw more plainly than
                    before fresh signs of Indians. Upon seeing these fresh signs, he became most
                    powerfully alarmed and said to his pilot, "For God's sake,
                    Records, make for the river." So he steered south to a creek and
                    followed it to the Scioto river. We found the two boats that had been abandoned
                    by Marshall, and all the property except a still which had been taken by the
                    Indians. A good many cakes of chocolate and a lot of papers of pins had been
                    spoiled by the recent shower. We took charge of the boats and landed them safely
                    at Lime Stone and congratulated ourselves on being commanded by such a brave,
                    courageous and warlike officer. Had this expedition been properly"
                    conducted, we could have recovered the goods and probably captured or slain the
                    Indians. Hard indeed is the heart that cannot feel for cowards when in distress,
                    who will not drop a tear of sympathy for them and pray they may find rest.</p>
            <p rend="center">MARRIED LIFE</p>
            <p>April 15, 1791, I was married to Elizabeth Elrod, daughter of John and Mary Elrod
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. I settled upon my own land six miles west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where I had previously built a log cabin 16′
                    × 10′ and had cleared some ground. At that time it was the
                    frontier cabin on the west of the settlement and was described as follows after
                    being raised the proper height for the story. A large log was put across the
                    center and split logs were laid all over the top for a loft. Two of the split
                    pieces were shorter, to make a hole to pass up through. The house was then built
                    higher to make room above. The door was made of strong puncheons and pinned
                    together with 2" pins and barred with a strong bar, so it could not
                    possibly be forced from the outside.</p>
            <p>Abraham Gardner took a lease of me and lived in the same cabin with me as they
                    had no time to build a cabin. They were <pb n="221" id="VAA4025-015-3-021"/>
                    both Dutchmen and not familiar with the use of firearms. I could not depend upon
                    them in case of an attack from the Indians, only for a show and to shoot from
                    the inside. This season brother Laban and my brother-in-law Harley were employed
                    as scouts or spies on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. In searching they
                    found the bed on Scioto creek where twenty-two Indians had lain, waiting for
                    deer and buffalo to come to the Lick to get salt that the spring was noted for.</p>
            <p>Often the salt water oozed out of the ground and the deer licked the ground for
                    the sake of the salt there. These places were called licks. They notified
                    Colonel Ransome by a carrier.</p>
            <p>Ransome notified me to draft ten men out of my company and report next morning at
                    Falk's house, also for Captain John Kenton to raise fifteen men from
                    his company. I reported the next morning with my ten men and found that only six
                    men of Kenton's company had reported as yet. When we marched we had 19
                    men in line. We proceeded to the creek and discovered that a number of persons
                    had gone down the creek. They had come up the south fork and had stolen 20 head
                    of horses. We pursued them rapidly to the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. They
                    had all crossed except four. At that place the creek was about twenty yards from
                    the river. The space between the creek and the river for about 50 yards had
                    grown up thick with tall grass. The water came to the bank. A thicket with
                    willows grew along the bank. An Indian was standing sentinel near the bank. He
                    saw us at the same time that we saw him. Some jumped down the bank after them,
                    some ran up the bank, one jumped into the water. One jumped into the river and
                    was fast getting away by swimming and diving. There were many shots fired at him
                    but as he was most of the time under the water, to hit him was quite difficult.
                    I took brother Laban's gun, picked the flint, primed it, and aimed at
                    the edge of the water as he arose for breath. He quit coming to the surface and
                    was soon out of sight and we do not know whether he was killed or whether he
                    took a cramp in the water. Brother Laban saw one squatted in the grass and
                    killed him. One of our company was walking along the bank and saw an Indian
                    concealed and sprang upon him. The struggle was lively for a few seconds.
                    Neither one was able to draw his knife out of its scabbard. One of our party saw
                        <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-015-3-022"/> our comrade struggling with the Indian
                    and ran to the spot with his knife in his hand and struck the Indian in the head
                    with his knife and he fell over and soon expired. The man Fenton said the knife
                    sank into the Indian's skull just the same as sticking it into a
                    pumpkin. Two Indians ran into the willows and we were not able to find them, and
                    they escaped. The Indian on the opposite side of the river hallooed and fired at
                    us but to no purpose, being too far away; only one bullet reached the shore
                    after striking the water and skipping a time or two. We scalped the ones killed
                    and took the four head of horses that had not been taken over the river and
                    returned home.</p>
            <p>March, 1791. The Indians stole horses near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. Just before daybreak, the horses were missed
                    and the alarm raised. The Indians were pursued. Snow soon began to fall and
                    covered the ground. We followed so closely after them, they were obliged to
                    leave the horses and run on foot to make their escape. John Gardner started out
                    to hunt from my home and saw the track of one of them that had come near my
                    place. On seeing my place he had turned to the left and kept out of sight. It is
                    well for him that I did not see him for I would have gone out to meet him and
                    give him a warm reception.</p>
            <p>Some time in March, 1791, Captain Habble (William Hubbell) was descending the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, below the mouth of the Scioto. He was attacked by a large party of
                    Indians who came in their canoes and fired on his boat, wounding four or five
                    men, and killing two by the name of Kirkpatrick and Tucker. The Indians soon
                    left Tucker and turned their attention to Great-house's boat which was
                    in sight and as soon as the boat came near attacked it. It was poorly manned.
                    They captured this boat without much resistance. The Indians took the boat to
                    the shore, killed Greathouse and a man named Clark and took the balance
                    prisoners; I do not remember just how many. I went to help bury the slain. On
                    our way, we met a boy about 15 years old that had been captured and had escaped.
                    He turned back and went with us. When we came to the boat, Black was in it
                    tomahawked and scalped. The boy said, "There lies my poor old
                    father." Greathouse lay upon the bank tomahawked and scalped. There was
                    a large sack of <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-015-3-023"/> flour, some hogs and some
                    other property in the boat not taken. After burying the dead, we took the boat
                    down to Lime Stone station.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1792 brother Laban and I were engaged to view a road from
                    opposite <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>,
                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, and cut
                    out a bridle path, for a sum of money which the citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> had made up. We agreed to do it. Forty miles of the distance was in
                    unbroken forest and as it was in dangerous times, we took with us two armed men.
                    While two worked, the other two carried the four guns and kept a sharp lookout
                    all the while. We accomplished the job to their entire satisfaction, and
                    received our pay for same. The road was afterwards cut out for a wagon road and
                    was a very public road.</p>
            <p>Sometime in the summer of 1792, the Indians were hunting opposite the mouth of
                    Lost creek and their camp was about four miles from the <geogName>Ohio
                    river</geogName>. After killing a number of deer, they needed horses to pack
                    their skins away, and, no doubt, believed if they came into our neighborhood and
                    stole horses they would be pursued and captured, as it was only twenty miles to
                    the mouth of the Locust on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>.</p>
            <p>About four miles south of us, the hills set in and it was a rough and unsettled
                    part of the country to the mouth of the Locust, also up the road leading from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Blue Lick. Now the Indians way laid this road to capture a team,
                    hoping to hurry off and get across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> before news could be carried to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and men raised to pursue them, and the men pursuing would have no
                    way of crossing the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. They were about fourteen
                    miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They took the owner of the team prisoner and started for the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> and crossed it after traveling about 25
                    miles over very rough country. The prisoner had a bottle of whiskey in his
                    pocket. The Indians drank freely of it and became somewhat intoxicated. Owing to
                    the roughness of the country and the dark night, the Indians did not make as
                    good time as they hoped to. Being somewhat retarded in their trip to the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> was of great advantage to their pursuers.
                    Soon after he was taken prisoner a traveler came along on his way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and saw the wagon in the road. He hurried <pb n="224" id="VAA4025-015-3-024"/> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and carried the news to Colonel Rankin who lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He sent an express to me to raise men and pursue them if I could
                    possibly do so. Why did he not send orders to Captain Kenton who lived about two
                    miles west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> or Captain Lee who lived about the same distance east of the city?
                    Perhaps he thought they would be slow in raising men but knew I would attend to
                    it promptly and raise men more readily on the frontier than in town, but the
                    express did not arrive until after night. At day break, I ran to brother
                    Laban's and John Hay and sent them after men, with orders to meet at
                    father's as soon as possible. I went after other men. We soon met, ten
                    of us, on the station of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> about eight miles distant, where we knew an empty flat boat lay. We
                    ran on double quick, boarded the boat; shoved off and double manned the oars and
                    one took the steering oar. We pulled out into the middle of the river, pushed on
                    with all our force and made good headway and kept to the middle of the river as
                    long as we could and be sure not to pass the place where the Indians crossed. We
                    then pulled to the northwest shore and watched the bank to see where they had
                    landed the horses. We soon found it, tied our boat, took the trail and pursued
                    on rapidly for about four miles, when we came to their camp but they were gone.
                    They had separated into three companies. This made us uncertain as to which
                    trail to follow. We wanted to follow the one that had the prisoner as we were
                    more anxious to release him than to kill them. After deliberating we chose the
                    middle trail and pursued them hastily for about two miles, when they divided
                    into two companies again. We were again at a loss to determine which one to
                    follow. We chose the right hand trail this time. The trail by this time had
                    become small but we pursued on as long as we could see and went into camp. At
                    the break of day we started on and soon heard them hallooing as is their custom
                    when they leave their camp. This was a kind of song they sang on going to sleep
                    and on leaving camp. We then felt certain of overtaking them and soon came to
                    their camp which they had left, going a north course. We followed them about two
                    miles in that direction, when we came to fallen timber. They turned short to the
                    right to avoid it or to find a crossing through it. The woods for some distance
                        <pb n="225" id="VAA4025-015-3-025"/> had been bushy which had kept us from
                    seeing them, but near the fallen timber the woods were open. When we came to the
                    turn they had made, we discovered them. There were four of them with a horse
                    loaded with skins. An Indian was riding, two walking behind him, the prisoner
                    behind them, and an Indian brought up the rear. They had taken the
                    prisoner's shirt off of him and gave him a calico shirt instead. He was
                    bare-headed and had his own big coat wrapped up small and was carrying it on his
                    back with his bottle in it; although the Indians had drunk all the whiskey, he
                    was careful of his bottle. The instant they saw us, they became alarmed and
                    started on the run. The one behind the prisoner jumped before him and ran toward
                    the fallen timber. The prisoner followed them. John Hay fired at the Indian on
                    the horse. He fell or jumped off and ran into the fallen timber and made his
                    escape in the timber that was covered with a thick heavy coat of grass and pea
                    vines. He left a first rate rifle gun, by which we knew that he was badly
                    wounded, for an Indian will not part with his gun if able to carry it off. We
                    supposed the prisoner was an Indian because he followed the Indians and also
                    because he had on a calico shirt. Brother Laban fired at him but his gun made
                    slow fire, which caused the ball to be deposited in the prisoner's big
                    coat that he had turned under his arm. The ball cut sixteen holes in it and
                    broke the bottle. Some one called out, "Shoot him", but
                    another said, "Don't shoot him, let's take him a
                    prisoner." On hearing this he knew we were Whites and turned toward us
                    and said, "Oh! my wagon", which he supposed was the best
                    countersign he knew of, as his life was in danger. So he was rescued from
                    captivity. We asked him why he ran after the Indians and he said he thought that
                    it was not possible that white men could get there so soon after the alarm was
                    raised, the time being so short and that he supposed we were a party of Indians
                    who were at war with the party who had captured him and thought best to stay
                    with those he was with. We took the horse together with the pack of skins, and
                    the gun, returned to the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, and recrossed in our
                    boat. That night we camped on the knobs of Locust creek and the next day we
                    arrived home. We gave the horse to his owner and <pb n="226" id="VAA4025-015-3-026"/> he went on his way rejoicing. The skins were our
                    pay for the campaign, together with the rifle gun.</p>
            <p>If when that young man was taken prisoner, the news had not been carried to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> immediately, if I had not hurriedly raised men; if we had not
                    marched rapidly; if we had not found the boat; if we had not taken the right
                    trail each time, if my brother's gun had not made slow fire; and if
                    there had not been a dispute in regard to shooting him or taking him prisoner or
                    killing him; if we had all fired on him, he would surely have been killed. Some
                    may think it was all accidental but I consider that with the Lord there is
                    nothing accidental, for although the savages were permitted to take him
                    prisoner, they were not permitted to kill him. So it was not possible that there
                    were any "ifs" in this case.</p>
            <p>The first of June, 1792, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> became a state. First governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> was Isaac Shelby. All commissions from the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> became null and void. In November I was elected captain of a
                    company and received my commission from the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> January 9, 1793. I accepted my office and was sworn in by John
                    Wilson acting as justice of the peace.</p>
            <p>Sometime in the summer, brother Laban and I were solicited to view and locate a
                    road from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Germantown</settlement>
                    </placeName> on <geogName>Licking river</geogName> to the north of Bear creek to
                    intercept a road from that place to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. We measured it and marked the mile trees and
                    found it 19 1/2 miles through an unbroken forest. We established it. It was cut
                    out and ever since has been a public thoroughfare.</p>
            <p>About this time, William McGinnis, living a half mile from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was shot dead by an Indian while standing in his yard between
                    sunset and dark, but they did not return to scalp him. Sometime this fall Tobias
                    and Henry Woods, Absalom Craig and others started on a hunting expedition on
                    Locust creek. On their return they came to a fine spring that came out from
                    under a bluff that was about 10 feet high. They camped and started out for an
                    evening hunt. When they came in at night, one of the men said that Laban Records
                    was in the woods, that he heard him laugh, but none of them knew of his being
                    out. Tobias became alarmed, fearing that they were Indians. About two hours
                    before day, he said he <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-015-3-027"/> would set out to
                    hunt his horse. At daylight he found his horse and was in the act of mounting
                    him. Henry went to the spring at this time, and an Indian fired on them.</p>
            <p>The Indians had found their tracks and had followed them to their camp and lay
                    behind a log in gun shot of the camp on the bluff in ambush. They killed Henry
                    at the spring, and wounded Gary in the hip. Furgason made his escape and ran
                    home. I raised five or six men and went with Furgason to the place. Woods lay at
                    the spring shot and scalped. Craig likewise lay at the camp tomahawked and
                    scalped. As Furgason saw him running about 50 yards from the camp, but being
                    shot in the hip thought it was impossible for him to make his escape. We were
                    sure that he had been overtaken and brought back to camp and slain. We saw where
                    the Indians had lain behind the log and had left a deer skin. We cut a blue ash
                    sapling, and split a cut of it and made shovels of it. We dug up the ground with
                    our tomahawks, threw the earth out with these shovels, and in this way made
                    graves. We placed the bodies of the slain in them, and placed a blanket over
                    them and covered them up. These were the last persons slain by the Indians in
                    our part of the country.</p>
            <p>In 1795 peace was made with the Indians. I resigned my commission in August and
                    started for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> in company with brother Laban, William Blackmore and Daniel Finch.
                    At the mouth of the Great Kanawa, we left our canoes and traveled on land to
                    Bellville. The <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> is very crooked, making it 60
                    miles by water. We started through the woods directed by Mr. Lewis and arrived
                    at Bellville that night, shortening the trip twenty or thirty miles. The next
                    morning we started on the road for Clarksburg on the west fork of the
                        <geogName>Monongahala river</geogName>. Clarksburg is the county seat of <placeName>

                    </placeName>,] eight miles below Morgantown on the east side where
                        <geogName>Cheat river</geogName> empties into the <geogName>Monongahala
                        river</geogName>. This river has its source in the Green Brier mountains and
                    runs through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Pocahontas counties. We descended the river to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brownsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. We returned home down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in a boat in August.</p>
            <p>I started for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> again in company with Robert Elrod. We kept the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> by land and had some difficulty in <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-015-3-028"/> crossing creeks, having to go up the creeks to
                    avoid the back water. I came near being drowned at the mouth of the Big Sandy. I
                    tried to ford it at its mouth. The water was about three feet deep, but the
                    depth of the quick sand we could not tell as we found no bottom. We could not
                    get across and had much difficulty in getting back to the side from which we
                    started. We went up the river about two miles and found a good ford with a rock
                    bottom and we crossed in safety.</p>
            <p>We arrived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> the last of the month. In October, Mr. Jones had a contract from
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government to cut out a bridle path from Wheeling, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They were at work on it. We started on the path and came up with
                    them. We were accompanied by two other men and we came upon the choppers about
                    ten miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>
                    </placeName>. We then started through the woods to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then went home after an absence of sixty days. We were the first
                    persons that traveled that road.</p>
            <p>On June 24th I sold my plantation in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and my wife and I went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. We traveled by land and on horse-back and arrived there September
                    1, 1800. Soon after our arrival, we both took sick with fever and ague. Both
                    shook daily. Not being able to ride on horseback, we took passage home on a boat
                    laden with apples and cider. The river was so low, we were sixty days on it, and
                    each day we had a hard shake. When we landed, we were hardly able to ride home
                    and had the ague about all winter. Had more than one hundred hard shakes before
                    we missed one, and quite a good many after then and then some.</p>
            <p>I moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Ross county</region>
                    </placeName> on the Sun Fish creek where I had previously bought and built a
                    grist and saw mill, in 1803. I was, with two other men, appointed to view a road
                    from New Market to the south Salt Works. Forty miles of this was through an
                    unbroken forest and as the other two were not woodsmen, it became my duty to
                    take the lead. We found a good way for a road which was afterwards cut out and
                    became a public highway. In 1804, I was selected to be candidate for captain, to
                    which I objected, and did not attend the election, but I was run and elected and
                    received my commission from the governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, which I returned to General Manson as I did not wish to serve. I
                    bought land in <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-015-3-029"/> Adams county on Brush creek
                    and in April settled on it and built a grist mill.</p>
            <p>In 1821, I sold my possessions in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and settled in Indiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName>, six miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. We suffered much with sickness and lost four of our
                    children. January 1833 was the last year I was able to farm my land and I rented
                    it for three years. The rent was sufficient to keep us but neither of us was
                    able to do the work required to be done. All of our children were married and
                    had left us. They all with one accord advised us to break up housekeeping and
                    live with some of them, the propriety of which I was inclined to doubt. The idea
                    of disposing of one's home and making a home with others, oftentimes is
                    not a real home but simply a stopping place. However in November, 1836, we broke
                    up. We went to live with our son-in-law Tunis Quick and our daughter Susannah,
                    with whom we still reside. We had twelve children, eight living at this time,
                    and eighty-seven grand children. We continued to live with our son-in-law until
                    1848 when we went to Milton Nelson's home.</p>
            <p>In April 1848, we went to live with Rachel and Milton Nelson. They had sold their
                    farm at Mt. Auburn, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby county</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. His wife being so distressed at the thought of leaving all of her
                    friends and relatives, parents included, began to pine away and friends
                    expressed serious doubts whether she would be able to stand the trip which had
                    to be made in a wagon. At that time the trip was generally made in about three
                    weeks so owing to the urgent request of many friends they abandoned the trip to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> and bought a farm of Alexander Breeding about one and three-fourths
                    miles southwest of Mt. Auburn in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Mr. Breeding moved to <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>We in course of time had sold our farm and were depending upon the interest of
                    the money to support us. The price we received for the land was one thousand
                    dollars, this we turned over to M. J. Nelson and we went to make our home with
                    him. They arranged a room for us with a fire place where we could sit and smoke
                    our pipes to ourselves if we chose. They had a large family, mostly boys who
                    used to often resort to our room and hear us tell of our adventures of early
                    times.</p>

            <p>My father departed this life on the first of June, 1809, and was buried in his

                    trials partially lost his hearing and was bent the last twenty years of his
                    life. He died at the age of 88 without illness. He rode on horseback 14 miles on
                    a cold February day the day before to see his daughter Susanna Quick to arrange
                    about returning to make their home with them. He became so chilled he died from
                    the effects of the exposure. His wife survived him for four years, dying October
                    13th, 1854. He carried a hickory cane with a buck horn hand piece. He was a
                    member of the Whig party from its earliest existence. He and his wife were
                    members of the Regular Baptist and never failed to attend the regular monthly
                    meetings if it was possible. His parents were Methodists but he never attached
                    himself to that body. He always wore shoes made on a straight last and changed
                    them every morning and maintained that it was only pride that caused people to
                    have them right and left. He said that people's feet used to be
                    straight but they were getting to be sprung crooked. He often told about the
                    early settlers and told about how they lived. He gave an accurate description of
                    the pack saddle.</p>
            <p>In early times flax was raised, pulled up, spread on the ground and rotted, the
                    fibre broke on a break made for that purpose then the shives were beat out by
                    being held on a round top perpendicular board called a singling board. A wooden
                    knife was used to beat with, which was made of oak or hickory, and called a
                    singling knife. It was about eighteen or twenty inches long, sharp on both edges
                    and thicker in the center. After the flax was broken a hackle was used to pull
                    out the top which was full of small branches and the lint that was unfit for
                    use. It was singled until the fibre was all beat out and the lint beat fine then
                    a finer hackle was used and <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-015-3-031"/> the part that
                    the hackle pulled out was called tow and was spun into coarse thread and woven
                    into coarse cloth for pants and coarse towels. The flax was spun into thread for
                    sewing and to be woven into finer goods such as shirts, tablecloths, napkins,
                    sheets and the like. Often dresses were made of linen and were usually worn for
                    several years. Linsey was made by weaving wool into cotton or linen chain and
                    was used by women principally for fall and winter wear. All of this was home
                    spun.</p>
            <p>The hide of the beef was tanned at home or with some of the neighbors and made
                    into shoes. Often the leather was not blackened. Any one was considered
                    fortunate to possess a pair of shoes. They wore moccasins made of deer skin. The
                    deer skin was also home tanned. The tanning was often done with oak bark; it was
                    dried, pounded with an ax, the skin was wet and kept covered with this oak bark
                    for about one year for upper leather and two years for sole leather. <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    of adventure, can faintly conceive the feeling with which I met

                                    streamlet—shall I ever again hear its familiar
                                    murmurs? Here on the right and left are little thickets where I
                                    have often lingered mornings and evenings listening to the music
                                    of the robin, the thrush and the cuckoo while warbling their
                                    morning anthem, or chanting their mellow vespers at eventide,
                                    succeeded later by the witching melody of the whip-poor-will. We
                                    hurried to overtake the vessel at Bucksport where it was to stop
                                    for its papers. Arriving at my sisters, I found that the passing
                                    of the vessel in which she knew I was to embark, had warned her
                                    of my approach; conversing one moment upon ordinary topics and
                                    taking a fond adieu, we hurried onward, and as we wound along
                                    the summit of the last hill over which the road passes in sight
                                    of my sisters abode, I gazed on this last object of endearment
                                    and breathed a last farewell to all I was leaving and in a
                                    moment it disappeared as we descended the hill. We arrived at
                                    Bucksport at the moment the vessel was spreading the canvas to
                                    the northern breeze. I hastened on board, and was borne away as
                                    on the wings of the wind, straining my sight which clung to the
                                    last to whatever I had seen before—till at length all
                                    things hallowed to childhood, all things to the memory of home,
                                    in a moment vanished. Feeling that in my present situation to
                                    brood over tender recollections seemed but to disarm me of that
                                    resolution which the occasion demanded, I mechanically set my
                                    face to the west, nerving my heart, mentally pronounced my motto
                                    "Onward".</p>
                        <p>Passed Owlshead at four and Whitehead at five o'clock,
                                    Monhegan at eight o'clock. Soon we were borne away
                                    where to mortal ken naught but the waste of ocean was around us.
                                    When twilight shed a pensive gloom around our little bark, I
                                    committed myself to that God in whose Hands was my Destiny.</p>
                        <p>June 20th 9 A.M. made Cape Cod,—becalmed. The white
                                    sand banks of Cape Cod even appeared familiar so often had I
                                    heard its legendary tales. "Captain", said I,
                                    "is this the place where the girls roll down for
                                    pastime"? "The very spot", he
                                    replied. Our captain was a descendant of a Cape Codman and my
                                    inquiry seemed to open an inexhausable store-house of anecdote
                                    which offered us a change from that monotony which had only been
                                    disturbed by an occasional sail, or some monster of the deep
                                    booming along in his native element.</p>

                        <p>June 22 saw the sun rise at sea. I had heard much said of the
                                    beauty of the rising of the sun at sea, I hastened on deck in
                                    the morning and turned to the glowing east, and soon in
                                    matchless splendor, as if emerging from his liquid bed, the king
                                    of day appeared, robed in light effulgent, and shed his radiance
                                    on the waste of ocean.</p>

                                    and busy city. I found all impressed with a "fearful
                                    looking for" of a visitation by "that dreadful

                                            1832, the whole country was greatly alarmed and excited
                                            by the appearance of that terrible scourge, the Asiatic
                                            Cholera. About the close of June it began its ravages;

                                    magic over the tumbling waters beneath. This evening, we floated
                                    down along the streets of the city of Utica, which though once
                                    an inland city, is now by the energies of science added to the

                                    of 125 feet took his last leap into the foaming basin at the
                                    foot of the falls and quenched forever his singular thirst for

                                    has frequently been the case before on entering any place of

                                    the accustomed festivities of the day. We took passage in the

                        <p>July 6th, we put in, in a heavy squall, to Fairport where for the

                                    seas. All was business and bustle, shipping off the
                                    superabundant produce of this fruitful region, and receiving in
                                    return foreign luxuries and necessaries for its rapidly
                                    increasing population. At this time the grand exciting theme of
                                    conversation was the Cholera and Black Hawk's War, to
                                    meet whom in battle the American troops had just previous to our

                                    flourishing village. I visited the states prison and blushed for
                                    my countrymen who by their folly and vice 180 of them had made
                                    themselves the disgraced inmates of a place which only becomes
                                    the dominion of a tyrant the liberty of whose subjects is
                                    dependent upon his own despotic and capricious will.</p>
                        <p>July 15, we reached <placeName>

                                    place. Captain Denis, a fellow passenger from <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                                    country. On following the Scioto, at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                                    </placeName>'s Ford in <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, I felt my curiosity considerably excited at
                                    fording a river of the celebrity and magnitude of the Scioto,
                                    the idea of fording a river being to me an entire novelty. I
                                    soon found however that he who would travel the western country
                                    and cross western streams must ford them. We reached Portsmouth
                                    about eleven o'clock that night. I shall never forget
                                    the feelings with which, in the clear light of the full-orbed
                                    moon, I came in sight of the far-famed <geogName>Ohio

                        <p>July 16, in the fore part of the day, we took steamboat passage

                                    </placeName>, in its growth, the acquirements of wealth,
                                    eminence, and fame—political, commercial and
                                    literary, may doubtless, for an inland city, defy the world for
                                    a parallel. Its situation is handsome and salubrious; the
                                    surrounding country almost unsurpassed for fertility. From its
                                    canals and its turnpikes are poured treasures in upon her. The
                                    roads are thronged with teams from the interior of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> and Indiana. Her canal boats are laden with goods
                                    and produce, to and from the same regions, and the majestic <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName> swarms with steam-boats bringing the tributes from
                                    every region to this emporium of the west. But why should I
                                    speak of the majestic <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>, or the more majestic stream of which it is a
                                    tributary; uselessly, nay in the very mockery of the swarming
                                    millions, peopling the vast regions of the finest portion of the
                                    globe, would their waters have sparkled and dashed along in
                                    their march to the ocean had not the inventive genius of man set
                                    tide and distance at defiance by the application to nautical
                                    purposes of the energy of steam. Though navagable for 3 or 4000
                                    miles, these noble rivers but for this invention must have
                                    remained unnavigated but for an all-directing <placeName>

                                    its aid. And to speak justly of the swarms of emigrants, which
                                    chiefly by its instrumentality are pouring into this fair land
                                    would be looked upon as mild exaggeration, for aside from the

                                    as if there was formed an alliance of all the nations to
                                    overwhelm the land as the Northern Hive did the Roman Empire,
                                    for I traveled in company with representatives of eight
                                    different nations, English, Scotch, Irish, Welch, French, Dutch,
                                    Swiss, Germans and finally from Portsmouth to <placeName>

                                    or not is problematical, for unless they prove a greater

                                    very well dispense with their Christian charities. Be this as it

                        <p>July 23, with my little bundle of necessaries, I took my staff
                                    and left the city in the character of a pedestrian. I journeyed
                                    onward and put up at <placeName>

                                    foot—alone—a thousand miles from,
                                    home—quite out of money—pushing
                                    onward—the Lord only knew where or for what. I
                                    crossed the line from <placeName>

                                    (by the way genuine Hoosiers) was a welcome solace to me,
                                    wearied, my feet badly blistered, and lame as I was from
                                    traveling. At the table I was a little amused at having a saucer
                                    of molasses set for me to eat either with my bread or pork, the
                                    old man by his inquiries having ascertained that I was a Yankee.</p>
                        <p>July 25, I reached <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, the county seat of <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, and put up with Mr. Adams. Learning that Mr.
                                    Cambell and his family from my native town lived not far
                                    distant, the next day after a walk of a few miles, I reached his
                                    house. The old gentleman and lady who had been sixteen years
                                    from Bangor, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                                    </placeName>, and as many of his children and grandchildren as
                                    had any recollection of the land of their nativity, had as many
                                    questions to ask me as I could answer in a week. I therefore
                                    made it my home with them about that length of time, getting
                                    notes and somewhat naturalized. I then took a little excursion
                                    around the vicinity, which I found to be a very pleasant
                                    country. Finding myself at this time absolutely <pb n="241" id="VAA4025-015-3-041"/> penniless I engaged a small country
                                        school.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> At the close of which I engaged
                                    for a second quarter. Among other provincialisms and
                                    peculiarities of this people, the which would fill a volume: a
                                    custom prevails among the scholars either to make the master
                                    treat on Christmas day or else to turn him out of doors and duck
                                    him in the first horse pond they can get him to. Particularly in
                                    the school I engaged the custom had prevailed "a time
                                    whereof the memory runneth not to the contrary", and as
                                    the signal day approached I perceived indications that they had
                                    no intentions of losing their frolic. I designed cutting me a
                                    cudgel for the occasion, but on going to the house, on the
                                    afternoon of the day previous, I found they had anticipated my
                                    resolution, and fixing on that time as commencement of
                                    hostilities had taken possession of the castle and fastened the
                                    gates (doors and window shutters). A messenger stood at the door
                                    with proposals and conditions. He <hi rend="i">axed me if I
                                        allowed to treat</hi>—I told him I should be my
                                    own counsellor as to the matter. He <hi rend="i">recokoned I a

                                        didn't.</hi> Though I had neither cudgel or other
                                    weapon I concluded this was neither the time to parley or back
                                    out, so I told the sentinel that I should take the liberty to
                                    enter the camp without giving the countersign. After knocking at
                                    the door three times and receiving no answer I severed the
                                    shutter and tore it open about which time a window on the back
                                    side opened through which making a precipitate flight there was
                                    no small scatterment among the small fry. I instantly raised the
                                    window and doubtless presented to the inmates an appearance much
                                    like a wolf looking through the bars. I ordered the ringleader
                                    to open the door, which with a very sheeplike aspect and spirit
                                    he instantly obeyed. Making my appearance among them I took the
                                    pedagogues corner and ordered them to their seats, which every

                                    an end to their fun for that Christmas. In the evening I
                                    appointed a spelling school at which I invited all the parents
                                    to attend, and to whom and the scholars, particularly those who

                        <p>August 10th witnessed a consummation of a purpose to which every

                                    years—admittance to the practice of law. On this day
                                    after so long a time I passed a successful examination and
                                    obtained my license. At the fall term of court which commenced

                                    jury in my newly acquired character of attorney at law. The bar
                                    of this state is respected for talent and legal requirements;
                                    there are however those of its members, who in both these
                                    respects, fall much below the standard, and whose blunders
                                    (being quite illiterate) are an inexhaustable theme of the most
                                    unrestrained amusement to those whose superiority seems to give

                                    expense. I think however the practice of admitting lawyers on
                                    examination is much preferable to that of requiring them to
                                    devote a certain length of time to legal acquirement as a
                                    requisite to admission, without regard to their legal

                                    in company with two young families who were moving out, and I
                                    took my chance to ride in the heavily laden wagon, ride on
                                    horseback occasionally, or wend my way on foot. Thus we started
                                    and soon found that recent heavy rains had rendered the roads
                                    which were in a state of ill repair, almost impassible.</p>
                        <p>October 10th, we traveled twenty miles, and put up with a family
                                    by the name of Clifford a native of <placeName>
                                        <country>New England</country>
                                    </placeName> who I found had some years previous enlisted in the
                                    van of western pioneers, the old man had been a preacher of the
                                    gospel but we soon ascertained that he had become a reckless,
                                    jolly toper, often crooking his elbows at the shrine of Bacchus.
                                    The family having disposed of their supper, the women in our
                                    company commenced preparation for ours by bringing in from the
                                    wagons the requisite provisions and cooking utensils with which
                                    they were supplied. Our supper over, after an hour's
                                    chat, the preparation for lodging was the order of the day. This
                                    brought into exercise the skill of the women to make
                                    arrangements as best they could for the accommodation of three
                                    young wives, three young husbands, the driver a married man of
                                    forty, and two passengers one who was a young man of thirty in
                                    the enjoyment of single blessedness—and one an infant
                                    child, for the accommodation of whom but one bed could be
                                    procured, excepting such as were made on the floor from bedding
                                    our company had with them. The arrangements were soon made for
                                    one couple bespoke the only spare bed—without
                                    stopping at considerations of those who had never taken a lesson
                                    of experience in moving into a new country—the women
                                    soon had our bed in order—I say bed for in fact there
                                    was but one for the whole—all the materials of the
                                    kind having for that purpose been spread on the floor in such a
                                    manner as best enabled the whole company to lay side by side.
                                    Being the first time I had ever been through the oepration of
                                    bundling in this style, I must say I felt a little embarressment
                                    in undressing and getting into the same bed with husbands and
                                    wives and this in the same room also with the females of the
                                    family—there being but one room in the house. But
                                    nevertheless so it was, that in a manner almost promiscously we
                                    all stretched ourselves out before the fire, husbands and wives,
                                    and old bachelors; and after a night's <pb n="244" id="VAA4025-015-3-044"/> sleep as sound and refreshing as if
                                    in separate apartments on beds of down, we turned out in the
                                    morning and after break-fasting in the same manner as we had
                                    supped we harnessed our team and again packed away our
                                    provisions and furniture, pushed on upon our second
                                    day's journey. This arrangement for lodging with
                                    occasionally a little more or less inconvenience was our uniform
                                    arrangement during our ten days on the road. Our dinners were
                                    generally cooked and ate along the roadside at some convenient
                                    place for watering and feeding our horses.</p>
                        <p>October 11, we took our journey north for the National road,
                                    following a mere track through the woods. Having come near to
                                    the road we came to a fense across the way and a boy of 14 or 15
                                    standing by it. We asked him if the road went that way, he said
                                    "yes" but he would not let us pass through the
                                    fense without a "fip", that is 4 1/2 cents,
                                    "case this is dad's tater patch and we would
                                    mash a heap of taters". The fact was he had stopped up
                                    the proper road and pretended that we could pass no other way
                                    than through the "tater patch". Our teamster
                                    told him to go to hell for his "fip", and we
                                    would make a road for ourselves. I took the ax and went ahead
                                    but the young chap told us that was dad's land and he
                                    would prosecute us if we went that way and very resolutely threw
                                    back the brush into the road I had thrown out. I finally took by
                                    the but end a fallen sappling to which he had fastened for the
                                    purpose of throwing it before the horses, and the way I slung
                                    both sapling and boy out of the way was a caution to all
                                    "tater patch" toll gatherers, and the last we
                                    saw of him was when he put home for death ruin and his
                                    valedictory when he left us was "—my soul
                                    into—if dad dont make you pay smart money for
                                    this". We now came onto the famous National or Wheeling
                                    road about 20 miles east of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. This road though a very superb structure was in
                                    many places almost entirely impassable for mud, occasioned by
                                    the recent heavy rains and the roads recently having been
                                    worked. Over the numerous creeks and rivers we passed, Uncle Sam
                                    has thrown stone arched bridges with covered frames above. In a
                                    tremendous rainstorm and in utter darkness we at length arrived
                                    at a tavern kept by one Hagar. His house was not only full to
                                        <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-015-3-045"/> overflowing but stables
                                    were also full, and we almost despaired of finding shelter
                                    either for ourselves or the horses, but finally after spending
                                    an hour and a half in making arrangement for our horses, groping
                                    around in the dark and drenched in rain the while, we at length
                                    went to the house to make such shift as best we might for our
                                    own carcasses, hungry, weary and wet having this day traveled 25
                                    miles. After our usual arrangments as to lodging and so forth,
                                    we the next day, October 12th, passed through <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, a village of no great importance other than as the
                                    seat of government of the state, quite pleasantly situated on
                                    the banks of the <geogName>White river</geogName> a stream not
                                    navigable for steamboats. Here is the governor's house
                                    situated on a pleasant eminence near the center of the village,
                                    on the one hand and on the same street in the extreme part of
                                    the village is the court house, a very similar building, and on
                                    the other hand and the same street, the capital near a huge pile
                                    of brush, was just being built. Here it is that has been let off
                                    in a manner to afford many amusing anecdotes, that purely
                                    Hoosier eloquence of which the following is a specimen (on a
                                    bill for improving a certain river): "Mr.
                                    Speaker—it <hi rend="i">are</hi> a fact that our
                                    rivers <hi rend="i">is</hi> rapid, and our resources for salt
                                        <hi rend="i">am</hi> slim". Here we left the
                                    National road again and took a northerly
                                    direction—the road almost intolerable [by the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                                    </placeName> road]. Having traveled 19 miles we came to another
                                    Hoosiers nest and put up.</p>
                        <p>October 13th, we again put ahead through mud and over stumps and
                                    soon drove into a mudhole, and the axle-tree of one of the
                                    wagons striking a stump fetched up all standing and broke both
                                    of our single trees, or in Yankee phrase—whipple
                                    trees. Our next business was to haul up and repair, being a
                                    carpenter myself I was soon in the mud to my knees and elbows.
                                    When the necessary repairs being soon accomplished we were again
                                    under way. Night, and the distance of 16 miles brought us to the
                                    "nest" of Nevill a Kentuckian: one of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                                    </placeName>'s real hunters. He came in from the woods
                                    with his rifle soon after we got there. A young man possessed of
                                    that frankness and hospitality which is truly characteristic of
                                    the Kentucks. His three charming children gathered about his
                                    knee to whom he related all the particulars of the
                                    day's hunt, and divided among them the pocketsful of
                                    haslenuts which <pb n="246" id="VAA4025-015-3-046"/> he had
                                    promised to fetch them. Here for the first time in my life I
                                    heard the wolves howl,—and such another concert as
                                    they set up in the evening—I began to think that I
                                    had got some ways from home. About 2 miles traveling the next
                                    morning brought us to a small prairie.</p>
                        <p>October 14, this being the first I had ever seen, I stopped a
                                    moment to gaze. So this is a prairie—not a
                                    rock—not a tree or shrub, save where ‘tis
                                    bounded by the dense, distant forest. Eighteen miles traveled
                                    this day brought us to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Michigantown</settlement>
                                    </placeName>—a city of four log houses. Proceeding
                                    onward the next day.</p>
                        <p>October 15th we found ourselves when evening and in fact almost
                                    total darkness came on, just entering an extensive marsh, the
                                    road across which being utterly impassable we found and took a
                                    track which apparently led around it. As we advanced into the
                                    woods on this track we soon found ourselves so completely
                                    enveloped in darkness that the driver could not see even the
                                    track. I therefore proposed going on before the team and leading
                                    a white horse we had in the company for a guide for the driver,
                                    and having succeeded in keeping the track we eventually regained
                                    the road, along which we groped our way till we came in view of
                                    the welcome light of another Hoosiers nest. Here at Proseners we
                                    made a halt. Nineteen miles this day. Though we here found our
                                    usual conveniences for cooking and lodging, yet he had nothing
                                    for our horses, but being told of a farm which law through the
                                    woods to the west, I volunteered for one to go in quest of corn.
                                    Myself and another were soon mounted and off. Taking a lantern
                                    and being directed to the path, we bent our course toward the
                                        <geogName>Pacific ocean</geogName>, and verily thought I
                                    could hear the surf lashing its rocky shores, before the
                                    saluation of the day apprised us that we were drawing nigh the
                                    object of our nocturnal visit. We "hailed the house and
                                    then alighted". The old man first called off the dogs
                                    and then went with us to the cornfield. While we were gathering
                                    the corn the hour was rife with anecdotes, in the relation of
                                    which the old man enjoyed himself much, especially that of the
                                    Dutchman and Yankee. He said that <placeName>

                                    Yankee nation said: "If von tam Jankee comes pon my

                                    man wanted us to buy some honey and took us to his store house
                                    (a log hovel built over a spring) which was rich indeed with the
                                    spoils of the forest. Venison of all kinds fresh and smoked
                                    "in plenty hung" and every vessel he could

                                    great abundance in the forests in this state. Late at night we
                                    got back with our corn.</p>

                                    they hastened onward to the father of rivers. An incident
                                    occurred at <geogName>White river</geogName> near <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> a short time since characteristic of that wanton
                                    recklessness of human life, and the consequences of crime, which
                                    I am happy to say is but seldom occurrence in the better ordered
                                    society of my native state. A very worthy young man who had but
                                    a short time resided in the place by some means became obnoxious
                                    to the ferryman, naturally a brutal man, came one day to cross
                                    the river. The ferryman in the wantonness of cruelty told him to
                                    get into the boat, but that he would be damned if he would not
                                    drown him before he got over. He however got in in company with
                                    another, telling the ferryman that he guessed he did not mean to
                                    drown him. The ferryman still swearing he pushed from the shore
                                    and when in the deepest of the river purposely overset the boat
                                    and himself and the passenger swam to the shore. The young man
                                    succeeded in getting hold of the boat and told the ferryman that
                                    he would pay for that if he ever got on shore. At this the
                                    ferryman with the bitterest imprecations plunged into the river,
                                    swam to him, seized him by the throat, pulled him under the
                                    water and they both sank together. The brute having finished his
                                    hellish design came up and swam to shore but the young man never
                                    rose, until he was subsequently found and taken from the river
                                    with evidence of the violence upon his throat and other parts of
                                    the body. This infernal deed was done in view of several who
                                    stood upon the shore and still the murderer was only sentenced
                                    to two or three years imprisonment in the penitentiary. And even
                                    while there his son committed a similar outrage upon a woman
                                    with an infant in <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-015-3-048"/> her arms,
                                    who however was rescued by her husband who had previously

                                    </placeName>. A steamboat was lying there which had ascended
                                    thus far and the water being rather low did not dare venture
                                    back over the ripple. The treaty with the Miami Indians not far
                                    from this place being at this time attempted to be made, most of
                                    the speculators and gamblers and horseracers and loungers of the
                                    place were absent and I was informed that the appropriate
                                    business of the treaty (which proved a total failure) gave place
                                    to one continual scene of the accustomed vocations of such like
                                    gentlemen. Passing through town we forded the <geogName>Eel
                                        river</geogName> and reached the Barrens about 4
                                    o'clock p.m. Having heard much of this description of
                                    country I felt quite a curiosity to reach the Barrens. Emerging
                                    from the thick woods I found the Barrens to consist of a
                                    scattering growth of various kinds of scrubby oaks. The soil is
                                    sandy though black and rich and the roads through them excellent
                                    naturally, always being dry even in the wettest seasons. The
                                    leaves that fall, and the luxuriant growth of grass, herbs and
                                    flowers becoming dry in the fall produce a mass of combustible
                                    matter, which every year causes a sweeping fire to run through
                                    them which is probably why the timber is of such an inferior
                                    quality. However, the soil is of so loose a nature that it
                                    cannot sustain a heavy growth, it being blown down by violent
                                    winds. We drove 16 miles this day and put up with
                                    Miller—who was trying the experiment of a farm in the
                                    barrens, which produced well, he said, and improved by length of
                                    cultivation. The soil being so impregnated with lime that when
                                    exposed to the sun, air and rain even from the bottom of cellars
                                    and wells, soon turns black and produces abundantly.</p>

                                    hydraulic purposes, and is situated on navigable waters, which
                                    will enable it eventually to outstrip Pigeon in wealth and

                                    fertile prairie is an extensive and beautiful grove, or in the
                                    phrase of the country an island, of thick timber. This upon a
                                    praririe is a natural advantage which is quite sure to cause a
                                    village to spring up under its lee, which is here the eastern
                                    side, there being in this region almost a constant prevalence of
                                    a western wind.</p>

                                    day through a heavy growth of thick timber I reached Little
                                    Prairie Round about 18 miles where I put up. This prairie is
                                    entirely surrounded just in the skirt of the woods with some 30
                                    or 40 families who from different regions have emigrated there
                                    within the last year or two. Here again I saw immense flocks of

                        <p>November 8th traveled through barrens and across Pokagon, an
                                    extensive and highly cultivated prairie I reached Niles, a

                                    were movers and merchants and travellers and peddlers of all

                                    construction for that purpose it was laid aside. Traveling

                        <p>November 17th I crossed an arm of the Portage prairie, but I had
                                    not the full pleasure of facing a violent snowstorm driven full
                                    in my teeth by a prairie wind till I entered on the Terre Coupee

                                    fair play. I however buffeted it across this and the no less
                                    spacious Rolling prairie, till at length entering upon the Door
                                    prairie I finally arrived at LaPorte, the county seat of LaPorte
                                    county. This is a pleasant village situated near a beautiful

                                    in fish, with neither inlet or outlet. The prairie the county
                                    and the town have all taken their name from an opening between

                                    to a door between two apartments received from the French the

                                    in extent, is for the beauty of prospect, its lakes and groves,
                                    the fertility of its soil, etc., considered the most desirable

                                    however, is new, and society though rapidly improving is
                                    unorganized and therefore unpleasant. There is nearly as great

                                    there is in the more southern regions, and each quite tenacious

                                    <p>It had afforded me much pleasure to learn
                                                  frequently that you have enjoyed good health, in
                                                  common with the rest of our family and friends.
                                                  For myself I certainly in my life have never
                                                  enjoyed such uninterrupted good health as I have
                                                  during the eight months that I have sojourned
                                                  here in the land of the <placeName>
                                                  <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                                                  </placeName>. This in a great degree must be
                                                  attributed to a naturally vigorous constitution
                                                  for there are several diseases peculiar to the
                                                  country which are very prevalent here. Among
                                                  which the fever and ague has prevailed very much
                                                  in all parts of the country. I have visited many
                                                  people in this place who are victims of this
                                                  disease, alternately and almost continually
                                                  burning with a raging fever one day, and the
                                                  next shaking with the ague like "Harry
                                                  Gill". I think this is more naturally
                                                  pleasant than is the country in the south—<placeName>
                                                  <region type="county">Fayette
                                                  county</region>
                                                  </placeName>, where I spent the last season.
                                                  Though a very level region yet there is a
                                                  greater variety here in the scenery than there.
                                                  Portions of the country are coverd with a noble
                                                  growth of timber of all kinds peculiar to the
                                                  west, and for most part so clear of underbrush
                                                  that a team may drive through without much
                                                  difficulty in almost any direction. The thick
                                                  woods are well stocked with game such as deer,
                                                  turkeys, foxes, rabbits or pheasants as they are
                                                  called here, raccoon, &amp;c, &amp;c,
                                                  with a variety of squirrels—striped,
                                                  red, grey, and black. It is delightful to go
                                                  into the thick woods this season of the year, as
                                                  in addition to the trees being covered with the
                                                  richest variety of foliage, the whole surface of
                                                  the ground as far as the eye can extend is but a
                                                  living picture of green herbage and a rich
                                                  variety of flowers. Next come the barrens as
                                                  they are called. They are a very scattering
                                                  growth of scrubby oak. The leaves which fall
                                                  from them and the grass which grows among them
                                                  becoming dry, the whole face of creation as it
                                                  seems here, is burnt over every fall or spring
                                                  (perhaps by the Indians leaving fire where they
                                                  camp) and this gives the barrens the most dismal
                                                  appearance, the very picture of desolation and
                                                  it is very late in the season before the trees
                                                  leave out or the grass grows again. But as the
                                                  leaves and grass burn very quick and the fire is
                                                  very rapid it is seldom that the trees are
                                                  killed by it and in fact it even causes the
                                                  grass to spring up with <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-015-3-056"/> richer luxuriance.
                                                  At this season of the year (June 1st) and for
                                                  some weeks past the barrens exhibit a most
                                                  delightful appearance. There is no tree where
                                                  the foliage is of a richer green than the oak
                                                  and they are just enough scattered to be no
                                                  obstruction to the prospect, which is a most
                                                  beautiful carpet of green enlivened with flowers
                                                  of every hue. Here it is that the birds sing
                                                  their songs—endless in variety and
                                                  duration. The black birds here are all kinds of
                                                  colors, many to be sure are black but I have
                                                  seen them nearly as red as a robin and others
                                                  black with bright red or yellow spots on their
                                                  wings. There are many birds new to me and some I
                                                  have seen at home I have never seen
                                                  here—among which is the thrush, which
                                                  I used to lay in the twilight of the evening and
                                                  listen to with so much pleasure, while he
                                                  whistled his soft tranquil farewell to the
                                                  departing day. There is a species of grey wolf
                                                  that frequent the barrens very much, and the
                                                  people often run them down on horseback and
                                                  shoot them or kill them with clubs. Bears are
                                                  very seldom seen here.</p>
                                    <p>From the barrens let us visit the
                                                  prairies—the glory of the west. They
                                                  are of different sizes from two to twenty or
                                                  fifty or even a hundred miles in extent. Some
                                                  are almost a perfect level; others are rolling
                                                  (in the phrase of the country) that is a
                                                  succession of gentle swells. On these in many
                                                  places the grass is often twenty feet high, but
                                                  generally there is a much richer variety of
                                                  herbage and flowers upon them than there is in
                                                  the barrens or thick woods. Where they are
                                                  uncultivated, and uncrossed by cattle grows in
                                                  wild luxuriance,—they are annually
                                                  burnt over with a tremendous rushing fire. On
                                                  these occasions "save himself who
                                                  can" is the principle of action with
                                                  bird, beast and reptile.</p>
                                    <p>The prairie often borders upon the thick woods
                                                  and it is a matter of much curiosity and
                                                  speculation why, upon the same kind of soil, and
                                                  the richest in the world, there should be a bold
                                                  line of the heaviest timber immediately joining
                                                  a prairie on which there grows neither tree nor
                                                  shrub. It is more general however that the
                                                  prairie borders on the barrens.</p>
                                    <p>The prairies have also their own peculiar kinds
                                                  of animals and birds. Among which is the prairie
                                                  wolf, the badger &amp;c, of the former, and
                                                  of the latter, the prairie hen is the most
                                                  peculiar. They are larger than the patrige
                                                  somewhat similar <pb n="257" id="VAA4025-015-3-057"/> in color and form
                                                  except they have a larger neck and shorter tail.
                                                  At this season of the year they strut round like
                                                  a turkey, and at the same time make a
                                                  noise—a kind of a boo-boo-b-o-o b-o-o
                                                  which three sounds are made on different notes
                                                  or tones rising from the first to the third. It
                                                  is amusing to hear them in the morning at a
                                                  distance, twenty or thirty of them visiting with
                                                  each other in the interesting confusing with

                                                  clamorous noise. Among the smaller tenants are
                                                  the quail, the lark and the plover.</p>
                                    <p>Among the peculiar features of the country are
                                                  the numerous little lakes with which it is
                                                  interspersed many of which though their water is
                                                  perfectly pure have neither inlet or outlet,
                                                  notwithstanding which they abound in a great
                                                  variety of excellent fish. We will now take a

                                                  drifting down again we will spear a mess of
                                                  fish; perhaps we will catch a sturgeon five or
                                                  six feet long; perhaps we will catch a pike
                                                  weighing 30 or 40 pounds. The pike is probably
                                                  the same as the pickerel, only the larger ones
                                                  here are called pike or muskalonge. There is
                                                  also a greater veriety of smaller fish which
                                                  come up from <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>.
                                                  The sturgeon is somewhat different from those in
                                                  the Penobscot and are ranked among the finest
                                                  fish here.</p>
                                    <p>The most unusual mode of fishing here is to go
                                                  out in the night with pirogue, gig and torches
                                                  when those who are skillful spear great
                                                  quantities. I was out the other day with old man
                                                  Compton and he speared a monstrous big turtle
                                                  and let Beebe,<hi rend="sup">11</hi> one of our

                                                  invited me to dine with him on turtle soup which
                                                  I assure you to be a most delicious dish.</p>

                                                  the place. When the dullness and monotony of a

                                                  by Mr. Faley to pay him a visit, I spent two or
                                                  three days in his house about the last of June.
                                                  The old man being a genuine son of Old Kentuck
                                                  friendly and hospitable, whenever he takes a
                                                  notion, the hour was rife of
                                                  anecdotes,—of barbecues, horseraces
                                                  and elections. He dwelt particularly upon a
                                                  barbecue which the people of the Fork gave the
                                                  company of Captain Yantes when he marched for

                                                  the confluence of the Dick's and
                                                  <geogName>Kentucky rivers</geogName>. Among
                                                  the excellent troops sent out by that chivalrous
                                                  state during the last war (1812) it seems that
                                                  the Fork, and its vicinity sent its full share.
                                                  On the departure of these brave fellows, the
                                                  whole community <hi rend="i">en masse</hi>,
                                                  turned out to give them a barbecue, which seems
                                                  to be a sort of a free will offering on the
                                                  altar of patriotism. For this purpose a trench
                                                  about 15 inches deep and perhaps as wide, is dug
                                                  a sufficient length, for the purpose of cooking
                                                  as many pigs and chickens and lambs, mutton and
                                                  veal, beef and venison as the occasion requires.
                                                  This being filled with suitable wood, it is set
                                                  fire to and burned, till sufficient heat and
                                                  coals are produced. By the side of this trench
                                                  are laid poles near its edge, large enough to
                                                  raise the articles to be cooked sufficiently
                                                  high from the fire.</p>

                        <p>In the fall of 1835, I came out a candidate, for the legislature,
                                    and made my debut on the stump, and after a well contested
                                    campaign succeeded by a large majority. The stump speech system
                                    of electioneering, which is prevalent in the west as in the
                                    south has, when compared with the convention system of the
                                    eastern and middle states, its peculiar advantages <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-015-3-059"/> over that system, as well as its
                                    demerits, which in some respects give the other the preference.</p>
                        <p>On the first Monday in December 1835 I entered upon the untried
                                    duties of the legislature. This was one of the most important
                                    sessions ever held in the state, as during its sitting, many new
                                    and important measures were adopted, and many others discussed.</p>

            <p>For a long time the impression has prevailed in the State that Indiana's
                    Mexican War record was not entirely to her credit, and that the period from 1846
                    to 1848 constituted a chapter in her history best passed hurriedly over. The
                    facts of the case by no means uphold this view. Indiana, a northern State, and
                    not directly influenced by economic motives, as were the southern States,

                    were not those of the rank and file, but of the officers, or directly the result
                    of political interference in the officering of the regiments.</p>
            <p>Though Indiana played a prominent part in the military events of the war, this
                    role was of minor importance compared to the political effects resulting from
                    the war. Not only did the war and Indiana's part in it furnish new
                    issues, new men, and new fields for State politics, but on at least one occasion
                    seriously concerned national politics.</p>
            <p>In 1843 and 1844 the Democratic party made sweeping successes in Indiana. This
                    was largely due to the fact that it broke away from the old issues of the past
                    and struck out along new lines.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In 1843 the Democrats
                    elected their first governor of the State, James Whitcomb. Eight out of ten

            <p>At the outbreak of the Mexican War the martial spirit of the people of Indiana
                    was at low ebb. Previous to its admission as a State, the militia of Indiana had
                    been kept in excellent condition, but with the passing of the War of 1812 and of
                    Indian troubles, interest in military affairs waned. Few <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-015-3-063"/> of the generation then living had ever been stirred
                    by the trampling of the war horse or seen the bloody field of battle. During the
                    long years of quiet all had turned to the pursuits of peace. Without war it was
                    hard to induce the people to return to a military organization. Notwithstanding
                    the gradual paralysis of the general system, the martial spirit was not entirely
                    extinguished. This much was evident from the existence of a number of companies
                    of independent militia and a few regiments of district militia. But in these it
                    had become almost impossible to revive military discipline unless some exigency
                    demanded active service.</p>
            <p>By an act of 1843 the citizens liable to military duty could form volunteer
                    companies whenever they saw fit. Each company was to consist of not less than
                    thirty-two rank and file, and every member enrolled was liable for duty for six
                    years if he remained a citizen of the county in which he enrolled.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Although this law still remained on the statute books, by 1846 its
                    existence was practically unknown. The State had no organized militia, and no
                    military equipment worthy of notice. The "cornstalk"<hi rend="sup">8</hi> militia had become a joke. The adjutant-general was a mere
                    title holder, who drew one hundred dollars per annum and provided his own fuel
                    and stationery. He was usually ignorant of the requirements of his office. The
                    militia officers had become purely nominal, without duties.</p>
            <p>The adjutant-general realized the sad condition of affairs and, in 1845, candidly
                    stated that his report would be brief, for it was impossible for the few general
                    officers who held commissions to furnish him with any other data for a report
                    save now and then the return of an election.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A commission had been appointed by the General Assembly in 1843 to investigate
                    the condition of military affairs. By an act of congress 1808 a sum was
                    appropriated, to be distributed among the States according to the numerical
                    military strength of each. Indiana was still drawing on the basis of 1832,
                    because the adjutant-general had not been able to report Indiana's

                    quota of arms in 1845 was 430 muskets, costing about thirteen or fourteen
                    dollars each. Since the population had more than doubled, under a correct return
                    the State should have received 930 muskets, or about $13,020 worth.
                    The loss in value of arms to the State in ten years totaled approximately
                        $70,000.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> A law of 1842 required bonds for

                    necessity, could accomplish things. David Reynolds was a pleasant-appearing man,
                    "stout, rubicund and affable." He had never yet appeared in

                    intelligent and willing to learn, possessed courage, some executive ability,

                    and many anxious young men called upon General Reynolds for information, they
                    found him in a flustered condition, much like an old hen unexpectedly visited by

                    heightened the confusion of the staff officers. Indiana was called upon to raise
                    three regiments. The business was entirely new; there were no forms or
                    precedents to be followed.</p>
            <p>In this work Governor Whitcomb gave what assistance he could, but raising a
                    volunteer army was entirely out of his line of work. James Whitcomb was a lover
                    of books, and always kept a useful library about him. When not busy he delighted
                    in driving away care with the music of the violin, on which he was no mean
                    performer. The Governor was also a smoker, and blowing smoke rings did not seem
                    to interfere with his thinking. His greatest hobby was smoking a cigar to its
                    smallest dimensions. To accomplish this he often thrust a knife blade into the
                    stump, and was even known to use a pin for this purpose. Although a statesman of
                    ability, James Whitcomb was not a soldier. But he rose to the demands of the
                    occasion to the best of his ability.</p>

            <p>It was at once evident that the real problem would not consist in securing the
                    men required for Indiana's quota, but in organizing and equipping the
                    volunteers. The war spirit took hold and spread throughout the State in a
                    remarkably short time. Stirring mass meetings were held in the towns and cities.

                    Governor's proclamation and the acts of congress on the war were read.
                    Resolutions were drawn up to the effect that, in any conflict involving the
                    national honor, the people of the West, without regard to political distinction,
                    would be found united as one man, zealously supporting the government of their
                    country and rallying around the national flag. In the crisis they were in favor
                    of prompt and energetic action, and heartily approved of the recommendation of
                    the President that a large and overpowering force be immediately sent to the
                    seat of war as the best means of bringing the conflict with <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> to a speedy termination. Any appeal to patriotism would be met with
                    promptness and cheerfulness. They expected congress to make ample provisions for
                    carrying the war into the enemy's country, and hoped to see
                    "the star-spangled banner" planted in the City <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-015-3-066"/> of <placeName>

                    their company for the Sixteenth Infantry, under the command of Colonel J. W.

            <p>When the assignment of three regiments of volunteeers came to Indiana, recruiting
                    began in earnest. Many of the independent militia companies enrolled just as
                    they were. Scores of young men took it upon themselves to raise companies,
                    hoping to be rewarded for their trouble with the captaincy. One of these young
                    men who raised a company was Lew Wallace, later a major-general in the Civil
                    War. When the rumor came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> that the government had issued a call for troops, he determined to

                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. There was much talk of volunteering around the capitol. Wallace
                    interviewed members of the "Greys" and
                    "Arabs," arguing that the term, one year, was short. Some
                    replied earnestly, as though experienced, that there was plenty of time in which
                    to die. So he resolved to open a recruiting office himself. Taking a room on <placeName>

                    fell in on the first round. The company was soon filled. James P. Drake was made
                    captain, John McDougal, first lieutenant, and Wallace, second lieutenant. So it
                    was all over the State. The main cause for anxiety on the part of those raising
                    companies was not whether they would get enough men to fill them, but whether
                    they would get them reported to the adjutant-general before the thirty companies
                    required were already selected.</p>
            <p>Nor was the war spirit confined to the men of the State. The women were deeply
                    agitated and, besides helping outfit the volunteers and provide for their
                    material wants, they added much to the glamour and romance of going to war. More
                    than one would-be hero found it easier to go to war because it was expected of
                    him, and he more or less correctly surmised that a military reputation would
                    weigh heavily in his favor. The Ladies' Aid societies and other
                    organizations all competed with each other and those of other towns in making
                    for their relatives and friends fine-looking and serviceable uniforms, beautiful
                    banners, and supplying them with many little comforts that would be useful in a
                    campaign far from home. It took the ladies of <placeName>

                    </placeName> only from Wednesday, June 3, till Saturday to supply William
                    Ford's company with uniforms. But the present into which the women put
                    their best efforts and all their talent was always the company banner. The stars
                    and stripes, hand sewn in silk, were presented with impressive ceremony to all
                    the companies, and they vowed to carry them to victory and glory.</p>
            <p>June 10, just nineteen days after the call for volunteers was issued, the
                    thirtieth and last company of volunteers was accepted and commissioned. One week
                    later twenty extra companies had reports at the adjutant-general's

                    </placeName> north only to Edinburg. The volunteers from all over the central
                    and northern parts of the State converged toward this point. As a rule they had
                    no trouble getting patriotic farmers to take them in their wagons. With the
                    frolic and picnic-like gaiety of the departure from their home towns was mixed
                    enough uncertainty and realization of hardships to come, to impart a serious
                    vein to the farewells. At most of the towns it seemed that the whole country
                    turned out to see "the boys" leave. Thousands shook hands as

            <p>The organization of the regiments and the resulting problem of debts incurred in
                    raising them brought forth the best efforts of the State officials. May 20 the
                    Governor wrote to the Secretary of War and inquired whether loans advanced for
                    aiding the volunteers would likely be repaid by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> government. Five days later he sent a circular to the banks in the
                    State, asking them to make loans to help in clothing the volunteers. The <placeName>

                    second lieutenant, four sergeants, four corporals, two musicians and eighty
                    privates. The commissioned officers of each company were to be elected after the

                    designated by the majority of the company. The judges and clerks were to certify
                    the election to the adjutant-general. The regimental commissioned officers were
                    to be elected in the same way. The volunteers were to have the same pay and

                    suggested that, in the way of clothing, each man should have for service uniform
                    a cloth or forage cap, a gray mixed or sky blue jeans hunter's frock

                    romance and attractiveness of war first began to dim at Camp Clark. The weather
                    was hot, the only water to be had was dirty river water and there were the usual
                    hitches in the commissary department. Added to these physical discomforts was a
                    system of petty politics and political scheming which got most of the volunteers
                    in a very bad humor. Governor Whitcomb and Lieutenant-Governor Paris C. Dunning
                    were on hand to see that their favorites were well taken care of. A ticket or
                    "slate" was prepared in each of the regiments, for the field
                    officers. Many of the volunteers were puzzled to <list type="footnotes">

                    limited to enable them to comprehend such a simple expedient as a
                    "slate". The candidates favorable to the State powers were
                    successful in every instance. Aided by the Governor's influence,
                    William A. Bowles, who did more in the war to bring disgrace upon the State than
                    all her volunteers, finally won the contested election for the colonelcy of the
                    Second. It was also charged that the President handed out commissions in the
                    army in exchange for votes against the Wilmot Proviso.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                    Most of the dirty intriguing at Camp Clark fell to the lot of Paris C. Dunning.

            <p>The larger slate of the day was as follows: Brigadier-general, Joseph Lane

                    William A. Bowles (Dem.); colonel of Third, James H. Lane (Dem.). Evidently
                    someone knew how to provide opportunities for military reputations and political
                        careers.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The appointment of brigadier-general by the President was sought by many western
                    members of congress as a prize for their constituents. Approximately fifty names
                    had been handed in. Congressman Robert Dale Owen, in whose district Lane
                    resided, did not seem to manifest much interest in the appointment, and probably
                    would not have submitted a name but for the suggestion of one of the Indiana
                        senators.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Owen said he had not offered a candidate, as
                    there were no candidates from his district, but if it were proper to name one he
                    would submit the name of "Joe" Lane. President Polk made the
                    appointment. He told Owen that he hoped he had considered his man well, as the
                    position was a responsible one. Owen replied that he knew nothing of
                    Lane's military talent, but that he had those elements of character
                    which, in times of difficulty, made men rally instinctively around him as a
                    leader. That had been the case in early days, when lawless men infested the

            <p>The election of the regimental officers took place June 24. For the field
                    officers of the First regiment there was but one ticket. The names were: Colonel
                    James P. Drake, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There was no regular opposition to Drake and the two other men had
                    a clear field. Not one of these officers could have carried his company through
                    the manual of arms.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colonel Drake, an innkeeper at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a politician and a good-natured individual, perhaps too much so,
                    had an excellent presence on horseback, and was willing to learn the tactics. In
                    three months he had mastered the "School of the Battalion," by
                    Scott, and had his command well drilled and disciplined.</p>
            <p>Command and responsibilities of war never seemed to fit upon the shoulders of
                    Major Henry S. Lane. Successful as a lawyer and in politics, he was careless as
                    a soldier. On parade he often appeared with his sword and belt in his hand, and
                    he hated a horse. On the march his saddle was always at the disposal of the sick
                    and the footsore. For a shirk Major Lane had the eyes of a hawk. In the service
                    he was reserved and dignified, and desired the respect rather than the fear of
                    the volunteers. Lane was a man of honor and brave to a fault. He was so liked by
                    his regiment that his indifference to military forms, though laughed at, was
                    forgiven and tolerated.</p>
            <p>The company officers of the First were perhaps above the average ability, and
                    among them were to be found some remarkable men.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> At the
                    end of six months the First Indiana could very well have been depended upon to
                    give a good account of itself under the most adverse circumstances. Few new
                    military commands ever saw less of the glory of war and more of its monotony and
                    hardships and stood up so well under it all as did this regiment.</p>

            <p>The trip down the river was not unpleasant. The men were in good spirits and
                    enjoyed themselves in an orderly way. Music and the dance were the commonest
                    diversions. Some of the men had not gone far before they began to feel the touch
                    of military aristocracy, even in a body of volunteers. "Those who hold
                    the commissions get the best pay, the best fare and all the honor. The private
                    performs the work and endures all the privation."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                    Some of the companies drew up and signed resolutions indicative of their
                    disapprobation of the course of Governor Whitcomb and his advisors in officering
                    and forming the regiments.</p>
            <p>Once past the beautiful bluffs of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> the boats rode forth on the broad <placeName>

                    </placeName>, with its low-lying banks. Even this ugly and monotonous scenery
                    was beautiful in the eyes of many a zealous youth. They were going to a land
                    rich in history; to the land of Montezuma and Cortez, to campaign through
                    palmetto lands, take cities, fight battles and become heroes.</p>
            <p>At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> the volunteers landed below the city, to wait for ships to carry
                    them across the gulf. Here the men were introduced to the soldier's
                    life without the frills. Through mismanagement of the officers the troops were
                    compelled to pitch their tents on a stretch of blubbery slime. There was not
                    enough dry land for a bed. Straw and brush were unattainable, and the ooze went
                    through the army blanket much as water goes through a sieve. Here the men lay,
                    or rather wallowed, for four days. Some of the boys made more or less cutting
                    remarks about General Andrew Jackson for selecting such a site for one of his
                    country's greatest battles. But for some fiery spirits the fact that
                    they were on the scene of the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> was enough, and, with an old Negro peddler for a guide, they
                    explored the field, caring little for the mud and slime.</p>
            <p>At last, on July 17 and 18, the ships arrived to carry the troops across the
                    gulf. The men were crowded into these boats pretty much like cattle. Five
                    companies of the Second were economically stowed aboard the Governor Davis. Five

                    rough and of inferior quality, and the men, accustomed to being well fed, had a
                    hard time stomaching it. The chief ration consisted of "some stuff
                    called smoked meat, that was side of hog, half liquid and half solid. When a
                    piece was picked up something like lard oil oozed out."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> This had been taken on at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The bread supply was also of a low grade. Sugar and coffee were to
                    be had, but there were only two cooking fires for the five companies. Sleeping
                    accommodations were still worse. The lower quarters of "most of the
                    boats were so full of freight that the men had little or no room to sleep. Those
                    who found room were almost suffocated. The most desirable place was the upper
                    deck. Here the men were frequently disturbed by the sailors, as they managed the
                    boat, but they reasoned that it was better to be stepped upon than smothered.</p>
            <p>The sea was rough and, as this was the first sea experience of most of the
                    Hoosiers, wholesale seasickness resulted. The rain contributed to the general
                    gloom and low spirits of the men.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> In one of the ships two
                    hundred men were stowed in a hold four and one-half feet deep. In addition to
                    the volunteers, the crew had to sleep in that hold on the warm nights, with
                    hatches down, a heavy sea running and no air holes. They had to live on coffee,
                    slop-fed pork and dry crackers. "Half the men were seasick and spewing
                    all about you; sometime you would find yourself eating and someone close by
                    would let slip on your dinner and on your clothes."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The sailors were kind to the sick, and tried to find places for them.
                    The officers were well fed with chicken, beef, pork, potatoes, etc.</p>
            <p>As the weather cleared and the sea calmed down the voyage grew more tolerable,

                    were made. One of the questions discussed in a masterly fashion was,
                    "Should the pay of the volunteers be increased?" The arguments
                    on both sides were unanswerable, and consequently unanswered. The debates ended
                    early and were followed by music. The captain of the <placeName>

                    In somewhat better humor, they passed the time reading Shakespeare and
                    Headley's <hi rend="i">Napoleon</hi> to each other. On one of the boats
                    of the First regiment an enormous turtle was captured. It was laid, back down,
                    on the deck under a tarpaulin. Twice each day the cook resorted to it to supply
                    the officers' mess with soup and steak, and when the men landed, it was
                    still alive.</p>
            <p>The beautiful semi-tropical nights were very impressive. The moonlight was of
                    such a whiteness as to dim the stars. Sailing vessels silently passing, like
                    spectres in the night, never failed to inspire the men with awe.</p>

                    repaired. On the second night out the lights of Brazos were sighted. All of the
                    boats except one made Brazos in three days, but this one, driven out of its path
                    by storm, took eleven days to cross the gulf.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>Now that the volunteers had been sent to the front, the State turned to its task
                    of caring for their families and raising money to defray the cost of organizing

            <p>The taxes on the property of the absent soldiers worked some hardships. Real

                    pushed. The people generally favored an extension of the time limit for the
                    volunteers to January, 1848. An act was passed in January, 1847, providing that
                    the volunteers then in the service or discharged, and who had poll taxes
                    standing against them, be exempted. It also provided that the county treasurers
                    list the county and State taxes of the volunteers and send them to the State
                    treasurer, who was to credit them and enter the receipt on the books.</p>

            <p>December 4, Adjutant General Reynolds submitted his report to the Governor. In it
                    he told of the unpreparedness of the State, the sudden call for volunteers, the
                    failure of congress, in the excitement of the moment, to furnish in advance the
                    means with which to pay their expenses, the response of the banks, and the
                    successful effort of the State to fill and equip its quota on time. The total
                    amount drawn from the banks by the Governor for transporting the volunteers was
                    $5,218.78, of which $3,718.78 was drawn from the <placeName>

            <p>About sunset, July 26, the boats bearing the Indiana volunteers reached Brazos,
                    Santiago. Some of the men of the Second were seated astern, smoking and enjoying
                    a scene unlike anything they had ever witnessed before. The sky was gorgeous and
                    the sun, like a fiery ball, slowly approached the liquid blue into which it
                    suddenly dropped. Long streamers of dark mist shot upwards towards the clouds
                    above. Everything was sublimely beautiful. The sea breeze and rocking of the
                    boat contributed to the effect. At noon <list type="footnotes">

                    regiments landed, and toward evening they pitched their tents and ate supper.
                    Many of the men proceeded immediately to the shore for a sea bath. It was the
                    first experience of the kind for most of the Hoosiers, and thus refreshed, they
                    were almost ready to forget the inconveniences of the trip across the gulf.</p>
            <p>The island of Brazos de Santiago was a waste of sand dunes, about three and
                    one-half miles wide. A narrow inlet, not much larger than a canal, led into the
                    bay behind, which was several miles across. On the farther side of the bay was a
                    white tower, the lighthouse on Point Isabel, Taylor's base of
                    operations against <placeName>

                    </placeName>. A chain of shifting sand dunes was the only scenery revealed as
                    far as the eyes could reach. The soil was naked save for a scanty vine here and
                    there. A solitary hut half buried by the sand and surrounded by drying hides was
                    the only dwelling in sight. There was no town, no grass, not even a tree. This
                    rather barren spot sorely disappointed those who had expected pleasant scenes
                    for fighting.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>There were close to five thousand troops camped at Brazos. The diarrhea and
                    measles broke out, and unfitted scores for service. The Indiana troops did not
                    suffer so badly at this time as did those from <placeName>

                    for these diseases, but very likely the food was the main cause. As a strong sea
                    breeze swept the island the heat was not noticed.</p>
            <p>The men soon found that they could not live as they had been accustomed all their
                    lives. By common consent, shaving was abandoned. The laundering methods which

                            continued flux and reflux of the tide. It is large and roomy but barren
                            and desolate. There is not a tree or a shrub visible. Over it the wind
                            sweeps without obstruction, sprinkling food, eyes, ears, etc., with
                            sand. ‘Middling’ we serve with a most delightful

            <p>The usual number of camp followers of the pedlar class followed the small army.
                    They set up all kinds of shops, hucksters and gambling houses. The sutlers had a
                    monopoly of all the little luxuries and of many necessities, and got monopoly
                    prices for their wares. Ice water was twelve and one-half cents per glass, and
                    ice thirty cents per pound. Writing paper (foolscap) was five cents per sheet;
                    flour, ten cents per pound; tobacco, $1.50, and bacon, twenty cents;
                    and tin cups were twenty-five cents each.</p>
            <p>The First and Third regiments left July 30 for the mouth of the Rio Grande, eight
                    miles down the beach from Brazos. The Second expected to leave the next day for
                    Barita, farther up the river. On the 30th the Second held another election, to
                    fill the vacancy left by the promotion of Colonel Joseph Lane to the command of
                    the Indiana brigade. William A. Bowles (captain) was elected by about one
                    hundred majority.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The result was not altogether
                    satisfactory to the minority. It seems that Captain Sanderson had been honestly

                    election. It was evident to all that Colonel Bowles was not a man fitted for
                    military command. Commenting on his election, a member of the Second said:
                    "How we have been gulled and led about by a set of political
                    demagogues, who, regardless of the fearful responsibility, have forced
                    themselves into positions they possess no qualifications to fill, with a hope
                    thereby to promote their future political aggrandizement. O, shame on such
                        patriotism!"<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    about was troublesome work, as not only all the bushes had thorns, but all the
                    insects as well. The encampment was beautifully situated on a grassy ridge. In
                    front lay the Rio Grande and Barita, while in the rear the wide plain was
                    besprinkled with salt lakes. The situation was not very desirable, however. The
                    mouldy crackers and fat bacon had to be lugged through the swamps and thorns,
                    and the rain did its part. The clear nights and bright skies of the
                    "Sunny South" were yet to be experienced.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the men found it hard to bear the ignorance and inattention of the
                    field officers. Perhaps their ignorance was not always to blame for badly
                    selected ground and frequent want of full rations, but certainly they were the
                    ones to whom the soldiers looked for redress of grievances. Other regiments near
                    by, better officered, fared better, and the Indiana volunteers were not long
                    becoming aware of this fact. Members of the Second visited another corps and
                    were surprised to find that for some time they had been drawing excellent flour,
                    good pickles and molasses. This was the first time the men of the First became
                    aware of the fact that molasses could be obtained except from the sutlers, at
                    seventy-five cents a quart.</p>
            <p>One of the congenial groups in the Second at Camp Belknap was the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> Greys of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These men got along together very well and, as a rule, were a
                    jolly set. Their entertainments not only succeeded with themselves, but they
                    attracted other companies with their music and dances. Whether carrying river
                    water in camp kettles, across the swamps, waist deep, or caring for their
                    accoutrements, these boys usually went after it singing and speech-making.</p>
            <p>The daily program at Camp Belknap was somewhat as follows: At daybreak the troops
                    were aroused by reveille and had company or squad drill for two hours, after
                    which eight men and a sergeant or corporal from each company were detailed for
                    guard. Company drill came again at four o'clock and regimental at five.
                    The intervals between were occupied in getting wood, water and provisions, and
                    cooking, washing, and caring for the camp. Hunting parties sometimes went <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-015-3-081"/> out and killed fowls, cattle, wolves and
                    snakes. One of the messes served a seven-foot rattlesnake for dinner.</p>
            <p>By October time began to drag heavily on the Second, which was still waiting for
                    orders. Colonel Lane's regiment (the Third) had moved up to Palo Alto,
                    seven miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Matamoras</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> General Lane still drilled the Second, as its
                    colonels were both sick and one, Colonel Bowles, had gone home. The evil results
                    of inaction were as dangerous and as much to be feared as battle. The moral
                    standards of all were affected, and some seemed to have suffered a total loss of
                    moral principle. The young men, when at home, were more or less moral from
                    habit, but camp life with its hardships and drudgery and absence of refining
                    features, brought out all traits of character, the bad often quicker than the
                    good.</p>
            <p>After the rainy season was past the nights became very pleasant. The moonlight
                    was clear enough to read by. The idle soldiers let their minds and imaginations
                    wander back to home and its joys. Then came refreshing slumbers, interrupted
                    only by the musical mosquitos and industrious ants.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                    Sanitary conditions were improved with cooler weather, and but few were confined
                    to the tents.</p>
            <p>Early in November quite an excitement stirred the camp as the result of orders
                    received by General Lane to hold the regiment ready to march at an
                    hour's notice. After that he drilled it twice a day. The prospect of
                    leaving so elated the men that they indulged in a number of musicals and
                    jollifications, Mexican style. Some of the boys had picked up a little Spanish
                    and some Mexican dances, and furnished amusement free of charge.</p>
            <p>The Second remained in darkness as to its future movements, but hoped to move
                    toward Tampico, to active service and fame. General R. Patterson assured the
                    Indiana men that it was no mark of disrespect to Indiana troops that they had
                    not been pushed forward, nor would it affect their reputation.</p>
            <p>By the end of the month the Tampico fever raged higher than ever. The general
                    impression was that the regiment would leave within a week. At last, December 3,

                    boat for Camargo, and thence to Monterey. The joyous excitement gave way in a
                    celebration lasting most of the night. Several companies left immediately,
                    leaving three to take the next boat. On the night of the 6th these companies had
                    a peculiar adventure. They were disturbed by what they thought was the
                    enemy's bugle. They were ordered to lie near their arms, and slept
                    fitfully until about 2:00 A. M., when they heard the call "to arms, to
                    arms!" Much excitement and rushing about ensued. All fell into line and
                    marched steadily, determining to win glory, and thinking of the praise they
                    would receive. Anxiously, they awaited the return of the detachment. After many
                    agonizing minutes it returned and reported to the general. He dismissed the men,
                    saying that their only enemies, the wolves, had retired to the chaparral.
                    Crestfallen, the men returned to their tents. Very few jokes were sprung at this
                    time.</p>
            <p>December 10 found Camp Belknap deserted. The place that a few months previous had
                    contained 8,000 souls was without an inhabitant. There was one regret mixed with
                    the pleasure of leaving Camp Belknap. There, the volunteers could at least hear
                    from home regularly, while further up the river the service would be doubtful.</p>
            <p>The three companies which were last to leave were packed on the stamer

                    placed them all in the boiler-room. This angered the men thoroughly, and was the
                    occasion for an outburst against the abuses suffered. <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The First arrived at the encampment near Barita, August 2, as did all the Indiana
                    volunteers, and expected to remain there a few weeks before receiving marching
                    orders for Camargo and Monterey. Great was their surprise and dismay when they
                    were ordered back to the mouth of the Rio Grande, to guard the rear. Colonel
                    Drake reported the men very sore at this, but said they would try and obey
                        orders.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The order for the First to proceed to Camp
                    Belknap came from Brigadier-General Lane, but the order to go into garrison duty
                    at the mouth of the river came from General Taylor, in headquarters at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Matamoras</settlement>
                    </placeName>, so there was nothing to do but obey. "Had the men known
                    in advance of the misery and humiliation awaiting them in the Rio Grande camp,
                    despair would have overcome all discipline, and the eight hundred men would have
                    become an ungovernable mob."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Lew Wallace says
                    there is not another instance in the American wars of a command so wantonly
                    neglected and brutally mislocated.</p>
            <p>The camp at the mouth was inherited from the First <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Regiment under Colonel Jefferson Davis. A sense of desolateness
                    pervaded it on the first night. On the right of the camp, and separating it from
                    the sea were long rows of sand dunes. A few hundred yards to the left was the
                    river. At its mouth it was about two hundred yards wide, very rapid, muddy and
                    full of shrimps which could be seen at any time of the day and every bucket of
                    water had to be strained to keep from them. To the north the camp faced a
                    monotonous stretch of land, level as a floor, treeless, unending, and subject to
                    tidal overflow. Across the river was a Mexican smuggler village nicknamed
                    Bagdad.</p>
            <p>The rations, issued three times per week, consisted of beans, coffee, sugar,
                    pickled pork, flour and biscuit, with no vegetables. The biscuits were
                    disk-shaped and alive with brown bugs. They were often the cause of much fun.
                    The soldiers on inspection frequently substituted pieces of them for gunflints.</p>

                    hope. It was only broken now and then by the chance news which drifted in. The
                    regiment heard of Taylor's operations after leaving <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Matamoras</settlement>
                    </placeName> and of the enemy abandoning Camargo. With a regiment at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Matamoras</settlement>
                    </placeName> the First felt that it was entirely useless to keep a regiment at
                    the mouth of the Rio Grande. A company would have done just as well.</p>
            <p>Then to make life almost unbearable came disease, chronic diarrhea. In after
                    years members of the First shuddered at the name. The river water which the men
                    drank, the spoiled pork called meat, and the bad cooking, which was common, all
                    made the appearance, sooner or later, of this dreaded disease practically
                    inevitable. The symptoms were unmistakable. A man may have been in perfect
                    health when he went into camp, in a few weeks a change came about; his cheeks
                    took on the color of old gunny sacks, under his jaws the skin became flabby, his
                    eyes filmy and sinking, his voice flat and he moved about listlessly. Instead of
                    supporting his gun the gun supported him. All knew that he had been to the
                    surgeon and received an opium pill, the only remedy in the meager medicinal
                    outfit. Another week and his place was vacant. A mess mate answered for him.
                    There was no need of looking for him in a hospital. Although a fixed post, the
                    camp boasted no hospital and he was to be found, one of six, in a tent nine by
                    nine feet. Under such conditions night did not bring enough coolness to soothe
                    the fever of the day. His only nurses were his companions. They did their best,
                    which often was not very much. In his delirium the victim prayed for some
                    delicacy, for something new to eat. He received the very food which made him
                    sick, bean soup, unleavened slapjacks, and bacon. Another week and the weakened
                    man was giving all his remaining strength to decency. Then mind and will went
                    down together.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>There were days when two hundred on dress parade was encouraging. The hours of
                    daylight seemed too short to take care of the funerals, so the hours of night
                    received their share. The dead march rendered with fife and muffled drum became
                    a daily occurrence.</p>

                    future of the regiment. Colonel Drake received his share of the blame for
                    existing conditions, yet it was not his fault. He did all in his power to save
                    the well and keep the sick from dying. When the situation became so bad he sent
                    for Major Lane and told him that he was ready to do an unsoldierly thing, go see
                    Taylor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Matamoras</settlement>
                    </placeName> without leave. Lane went along and the two men made an earnest plea
                    on behalf of their regiment. They told how their medicines had run out and calls
                    for more had gone unheeded. But General Taylor, hardened to service, paid no
                    heed, and the First remained at the Rio Grande in its misery. Taylor left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Matamoras</settlement>
                    </placeName> for Monterey in September. The First continued to hope that it
                    would get to go along. A commissariat man gave the death blow, however, when he
                    brought definite news that Drake's Regiment had been left out.</p>
            <p>Deaths continued until all the lumber in camp had been used for coffins. Next all
                    the cracker barrel staves and gun boxes were exhausted. After that the only
                    coffin was the blanket. With burial the troubles did not cease. The winds moved
                    the dunes and left the naked corpses exposed. Late in September when the heat
                    became intense, there was not even a bush under which to hide. The only hope for
                    better health lay in cooler weather, which was expected with October. As for any
                    hopes of getting into the war, the First gave up all they had ever had and
                    resigned themselves to fate. Some fully expected to remain at the Rio Grande
                    until the volunteers were discharged.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The general

                            about a mile from the boat. When within about twenty yards the guards
                            were placed and the captain, together with two other men, approached the
                            light. They found it to be a small rancho, with a man, woman and two
                            children in it. They were much frightened. After a thorough search the
                            men failed to find any arms. As they started to leave one of the men
                            reminded the captain that he had not searched the bed where the woman
                            was lying. Captain Boardman went up to it at once and as he began
                            fumbling around suddenly saying, "Boys, here's a
                            gun!" The woman started jabbering and making signs, but the men
                            could not understand her so went up to assist their captain. They soon
                            found that the captain had hold of the woman's leg and told him
                            that he had made a serious mistake: what he had found was legs and not

                    buildings were dilapidated and falling. The mud and cane houses looked more like
                    cow houses and hog pens than human dwellings. The next day old "Rough
                    and Ready" brought up the remaining six companies of the First and they
                    began breaking mules at once. The Third had already finished with their own pack
                    train and departed on the 16th. Two days later everything was put in readiness
                    for the trip to Monterey. The men were completely outfitted in arms, canteens,
                    etc., in preparation for the forced march. On the 19th the whole camp rose
                    before daybreak. All were anxious to go, but some who were not well were left in
                    the hospital because there were enough wagons only for provisions. A wearisome
                    and tedious journey was expected, but the haversacks contained only bread,
                    boiled pickled pork, coffee and salt. The road was ankle deep in dust and it
                    rose in such clouds as to choke the men and make it impossible to see the
                    company ahead. At the end of the second day, after a twenty-mile march with full
                    equipment, the men were pretty well exhausted. Their noses were so sore with

                    blistered that it was hard to tell when they were closed. The heat, dust and
                    salt pork produced such a thirst that the men drank heavily of a pond of water
                    covered with a green scum. Sore feet and aching limbs so tortured the men that
                    every time they stopped long enough they gave them water treatment. The bread
                    ran so low occasionally that one-half a loaf served eleven men of the Second for
                    two meals.</p>
            <p>The fifth day of marching found the two regiments about half way to Monterey.
                    Feet were becoming tougher and limbs ceased to ache so much. The men even began
                    to notice the scenery which was becoming wilder and more impressive. The rising
                    sun cast its beams on the mountains on the left. The whole chain appeared like
                    piles of burnished silver.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> "The wonders of war

            <p>As the men neared the end of their march their feet grew heavy but their hearts
                    were light, for at last they were to become a part of the army. They were within
                    six miles of Walnut Springs, where they were to camp, when without warning the
                    column jammed and came to a stop. A courier rode up and gave Colonel Drake a
                    dispatch. The colonel reddened as he read it in the saddle. He had the men face
                    about and then started to read it. The task was too much for him and he could
                    not finish it. He handed it to the men. The First was to go back to its sand
                    hill at the mouth of the Rio Grande. The troops of the First were put into
                    motion and had to take back as it were, every one of the three hundred and
                    ninety miles which they had advanced. Many of the unfortunate men of the First
                    received the farewell of friends in the Second with tears in their eyes. The
                    order had come from General Taylor. Every man felt that his regiment was being
                    purposely punished but why, he knew not. Two motives were generally offered to
                    explain Taylor's conduct. He either wished to punish Colonel Drake for
                    his unmilitary request to move the regiment, or he wished to reprimand General
                    Patterson for his assumption of authority in giving the orders to march.
                    Patterson in later years said he was acting from pity and not from orders from
                    head quarters. This sudden disappointment brought the following estimate of
                    Taylor from one of the members of the First: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The General who could serve innocent soldiers of his command so securely,

            <p>Lieutenant Colonel Nave was so resentful at the treatment of his regiment that he

            <p>As the regiment was on its way back to Camargo it was overtaken by another order.
                    Taylor had evidently relented as he lightened the sentence by stating that
                    Colonel Drake was to send two companies to the mouth of the river and keep the

                    and the men took the boats for their return journey. On the fifth day they were
                    stalled and they were not yet half way. The men had to get out and forage. Three
                    were ambushed by the Mexicans so their comrades stormed and took a small town.
                    They did nothing to the inhabitants but captured four beeves which proved very
                    useful.</p>

                    </placeName> the men of the First rested from their long march. For the first
                    time in eight months the men were able to lie down to sleep with a roof over
                    their heads. Companies A and H (Roberts and McDougal) encamped in the Main
                    Plaza; company F (Lewis) at Ft. Paredes; company C (Milroy) at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the remaining six companies in barracks at the lower Plaza.
                    The regiment drilled in the Plaza in the heart of the city. There were some
                    social functions to enliven the soldier's existence on garrison duty.
                    The Mexican belles proved great waltzers and the men showed their appreciation
                    by serenades. Colonel Drake was made civil governor and military commandant at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Matamoras</settlement>
                    </placeName>, succeeding Colonel Clark of the Eighth infantry. Considerable
                    responsibility fell upon the colonel, as he came in contact with local usages
                    and customs so old that they were practically law. It was necessary for him to
                    arbitrate every little difficulty and to employ an interpreter.</p>
            <p>The First had hardly settled in their new quarters before orders again came to
                    proceed to Walnut Springs, this time from Adjutant General Bliss. For the third
                    time the regiment covered the long route to Monterey. This time it reached its
                    destination without interruption. As the men drew near General Taylor's
                    headquarters they became anxious to see the general in spite of the poor
                    treatment they had received from him. They expected to find a magnificent tent
                    with staff officers round about in flashy uniforms, surrounded by orderlies.
                    They found only a white flagpole on which was a tattered, dirty flag, a dingy
                    tent, flap up in front, and under it a plain deal table and a few camp chairs.
                    The troops marched past to be reviewed. Few saluted. They saw no one to salute.
                    Leaning against the flag staff was a small man, dressed in an unbuttoned blouse
                    of no particular color, a limp-bosomed shirt far from white, hang-down collar,
                    no tie, what was once <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-015-3-090"/> light blue trousers,
                    and a pair of heavy marching shoes red with use. A slouch wool hat was drawn low
                    over an unshaven face, dull and expressionless.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Most of
                    the men did not learn until afterwards that this was General Taylor.</p>
            <p>Walnut Springs was the site of the battle of Monterey. It was four miles from the
                    city, and an ideal spot for a camp. Towering peaks rose majestically on all
                    sides and the place was well shaded with the largest and straightest trees that
                    the men had seen in the country.</p>
            <p>Soon after the arrival of the Indiana troops General Taylor left with his command
                    for Victoria. The Second Indiana did not remain long at Walnut Springs but
                    hurried on toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as Colonel Haddon had received an order from General Lane to that
                    effect. With it came the report that Santa Anna was within two days'
                    march of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The regiment had sixty-five miles yet to travel. It had already
                    covered one hundred and fifty, carrying heavier burdens than the regiments from
                    the other States.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Just as camp was being broken general
                    orders arrived giving a day's rest as the provisions were not yet
                    ready. The troops spent this time visiting the cathedral, markets, tanneries,
                    and other scenes of interest in Monterey. The details of the battle of Monterey
                    were related and discussed.</p>
            <p>Before daybreak, December 27, the Second started for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In Monterey the regiment attracted quite a bit of attention
                    because of the healthy appearance of all its members. At night it halted at the
                    Shrine of St. Catherine near the mountain pass. On the way from Monterey some of
                    the men visited the gardens of General Arista. Compared to the country through
                    which the troops had marched in the past, these suggested the Garden of Eden.</p>
            <p>The road to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saltillo</settlement>
                    </placeName> was broken and rocky, the wind blowing the dust to the rear in
                    suffocating clouds. As it approached Reneonida it led through a grove of trees
                    which formed a shady archway above, while here and there were enormous century
                    plants from fifteen to twenty feet high. On the morning of December 31, the
                    regiment marched twelve miles to a place called Warm Springs, where the Second

                    time it got to the messes. The discomforts affected the spirits of all. A few

                    1,400 of whom were Indianians. On the last day of the year, 1846, General

                    </placeName>, and New Leon. The streets were narrow and the sidewalks roughly
                    paved with stones. Lime-water fountains and streams were abundant, and the water
                    was free and good. The flat-roofed houses were built of stone and mud bricks,
                    whitened with plaster. Two of the five churches were impressive cathedrals.
                    These the volunteers had an excellent opportunity to examine in their search for
                    arms.</p>
            <p>Around and above ‘the city towered the mountains which reached into
                    the clouds. At sunrise and sunset they reflected many gorgeous colors, and the
                    men thought they surpassed all descriptions of Alpine scenery. The abrupt sides
                    supported no trees or vegetation, and the separate peaks stood clearly outlined
                    like the towers of a castle. The clear atmosphere apparently reduced distances
                    many times, as the men found when what they estimated to be a couple of miles

            <p>The soil in the valleys was productive, but the seasons were irregular and crops
                    were produced only by irrigation from the small mountain streams. Wheat, corn,

                    per load.</p>
            <p>The people were very much alike, all dusky brown, eyes dark and sparkling, of

            <p>The troops were pleasantly situated and furnished with comfortable quarters and
