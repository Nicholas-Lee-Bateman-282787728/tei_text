            <p>Historians have differed widely about the underlying causes of the War of 1812. Their writings
                    concerning its background, however, have emphasized four basic factors: the prolonged controversy
                    and conflict over neutral rights during the two decades preceding the War of 1812; English
                    impressment of American seamen during these two decades; the role of the English in supporting the
                    Indians of the Old Northwest against the Americans from the 1780's; and the desire of
                    Americans to gain part or all of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> as a result of conflict with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Some writers have given their attention to all of these factors, while others have
                    devoted their emphasis mainly to questions concerning neutral rights and impressment.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Most historians have given the War Hawks a major responsibility for the congressional declaration of
                    war against <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in June, 1812. Two historians, Professors Reginald Horsman and Roger H. Brown,
                    presented papers at a session on "The War Hawks and the War of 1812" at the
                    fifty-sixth annual meeting of the <placeName>

                    but the basic views and conclusions of the authors remain unchanged. The comments on the articles by
                    Professors Alexander DeConde and Norman K. Risjord have also been reworded, but their basic views
                    and conclusions are also unchanged. The articles and comments are presented in the order in which
                    they were given at Omaha.</p>

            <p>These articles and comments do not attempt to evaluate the fundamental or underlying causes of the
                    War of 1812. Instead, attention is focused on two questions: was there a group in the first session
                    of the Twelfth Congress<hi rend="sup">3</hi> with enough cohesion and consensus to warrant the
                    appellation of War Hawks and, if so, did the War Hawks have a major role in bringing on the War of
                    1812? All other questions raised in the articles and comments are subordinate to these queries.
                    Horsman's article is largely a statistical and analytical study of the voting records of
                    members of the House of Representatives on eleven "measures leading toward war"
                    during the first session of the Twelfth Congress. <placeName>

                        1811. Senators at that time were chosen by the state legislatures.</item>

            <p>Among the more eccentric features of the strange little War of 1812 was the manner in which the
                    American Congress wrangled through more than six months of debate in an attempt to resolve whether
                    war should be declared against <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The whole affair was reported daily in a British press which delighted in telling its
                    readers that the American legislators were now debating whether the thousand-ship British navy could
                    be defeated by the addition of ten frigates or four seventy-fours, or whether perhaps a war could
                    better be fought with no navy at all. The aura of unreality which surrounded the proceedings of this
                    Twelfth Congress was epitomized on June 4, 1812, when the declaration of war finally passed the
                    House of Representatives by a vote of only 79 to 49, not even a two-thirds majority. Seldom has a
                    nation entered a war with less <hi rend="i">élan.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner in which this modest majority was created has received less attention from historians than
                    the general problems of causation. Who were the enthusiasts—those who for six months had
                    consistently argued for war and had supported war measures? Most writers on this subject have been
                    content to assert that the core of war feeling was to be found in the small group which gathered
                    around Henry Clay in the fall of 1811 and from that time on urged war measures and war itself upon a
                    reluctant Congress. Others, however, have identified fifteen or twenty members of the House of
                    Representatives as War Hawks. Bernard Mayo in his excellent biography of young Henry Clay lists over
                    thirty men when he discusses <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s supporters in the drive for war. In his recent comprehensive account of
                    these years Bradford Perkins indicates that the Republicans could be divided into four groups, one
                    of them being the War Hawks, and argues that five men—Henry Clay, Langdon Cheves, William
                    Lowndes, John C. Calhoun, and Felix Grundy—formed the core of the war party in the House
                    of Representatives. Though he never formally lists those who could be <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Most historians who have worked in this period could probably agree on a hard core of four or five
                    men who formed a nucleus of war sentiment. If, however, they were asked to list the other War Hawks,
                    there might be considerable disagreement. Who were those men who from the beginning of the Twelfth
                    Congress were determined that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> should go to war and who spent the next six months convincing their often reluctant
                    colleagues that war was a desirable step? Though some information can be gleaned from contemporary
                    correspondence and diaries, it was in the debates and votes on the floor of Congress that the
                    supporters of war made their public affirmation.</p>
            <p>Two problems occur when the debates and votes are used as a basis for identifying the war enthusiasts
                    in the Twelfth Congress. The first difficulty arises from the method of reporting debates in the <hi rend="i">Annals of Congress.</hi> Unlike the <hi rend="i">Congressional Record</hi> of
                    today—where the difficulty is to sift the spoken word from a huge deposit of the
                    unspoken—the <hi rend="i">Annals</hi> err on the side of frugality. At times one has to
                    be content with such cryptic comments as "Mr. LACOCK spoke in favor of the
                    report," from which even the most optimistic of historians would have difficulty
                    ascertaining Abner Lacock's motives or degree of enthusiasm. It is possible, nevertheless,
                    to use the <hi rend="i">Annals</hi> to some effect in identifying the war enthusiasts from their
                    remarks in debates of the House of Representatives; the reporting of Senate debates, however, is so
                    scanty as to preclude the usefulness of the <hi rend="i">Annals</hi> for identifying the senators
                    who supported war.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second difficulty appears when one begins to analyze the votes. One might legitimately conclude
                    that a representative who voted for every measure leading toward war that came before the House
                    between November, 1811, and June, <list type="footnotes">

                    conflict. The situation, however, was not so clear cut. Though there generally seemed to be a
                    Republican majority in favor of war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, there was a striking lack of party unanimity on the best methods of fighting the war.
                    Some representatives, headed by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, thought that all minor or even major
                    disagreements on specific policy should be subordinated to a firm drive toward war. Other members of
                    the House, though apparently supporting war, were unwilling to ignore their particular prejudices.
                    For example, a considerable group—the most notable among them was Felix Grundy of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>—though otherwise seeming to favor war, could not agree that a navy was
                    needed to fight it; they argued that any navy that could be built would be swept from the seas by <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, would saddle the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with a huge debt, and would in the long run subvert American liberty. Another group,
                    otherwise pressing for war, could not agree to the taxes that would support it; they seemed afraid
                    that Congress would pass the taxes, and then, perversely, refuse to declare war. Other groups
                    opposed the authorization of a large increase in the armed forces or did not want the militia to be
                    used outside the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Since these groups and individuals overlapped, the votes for war measures in the
                    Twelfth Congress are remarkably confused. There were few who would vote for every measure tending
                    toward war, regardless of their particular prejudices, and some of those who were most ardent in
                    their support of war voted against specific war measures. The votes were further complicated by
                    Federalist efforts to embarrass the administration. At times members of the Federalist opposition
                    were enlisted in favor of what was in effect a war measure, and prowar Republicans were to be found
                    voting against it. In spite of all this, however, it is possible to discern patterns in the voting
                    of members of the House and, combined with the debates, the voting does help to identify the real
                    enthusiasts for war.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    coming of the War of 1812 much stress has been laid on a western-southern alliance. Others have
                    pointed out, however, that though the representatives of the <placeName>

            <p>An analysis of the debates in the Twelfth Congress does support the view that congressmen from the

            <p>When these twenty-one members of the House are viewed in terms of the regions they represented, a
                    clear pattern emerges. By far the largest number—twelve—came from the South
                    Atlantic states. The next largest number—five—came from the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Valley states. The Middle Atlantic states had only two reasonably articulate supporters
                    of the war; one was Peter B. Porter of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, chairman of the House foreign relations committee, and the other was Adam Seybert of
                    Pennsylvania. And only two outspoken war advocates came from New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>; one of these was John A. Harper of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, a man who lived on the outer fringes of that state, and the other was William Widgery
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. Widgery's arguments, however, were at times somewhat equivocal, and it could
                    well be argued that he should not be called a true War Hawk.</p>
            <p>Congressional debates, however, do not provide a truly reliable estimate of the support that any
                    individual was giving to a particular course of action, and an attempt to discover the War Hawks on
                    the basis of the debates is obviously impressionistic. A more effective method of discovering the
                    true war enthusiasts in the Twelfth Congress is to examine the votes taken in the period from
                    November, 1811, to June, <list type="footnotes">

                    for measures leading toward war, though the voting patterns are confused by those who supported war
                    measures in the hope of persuading <placeName>

            <p>The number of key House votes in the Twelfth Congress was not excessive. During most of the winter of
                    1811-1812 they covered three main aspects of war preparation—military, naval, and
                    financial. By April, 1812, the votes were on measures leading directly to the actual conflict. For
                    the purposes of this paper eleven votes were studied; they include the important and some of the
                    less important measures.</p>
            <p>The first of the three votes on military matters to be examined was the measure to increase the
                    regular army. The bill, which had been passed by the Senate and sent to the House, called for an
                    increase of 25,000 men; it was amended in the House foreign relations committee to call for only
                    15,000 additional men. After debate the House reinstated the 25,000 figure but was willing to
                    provide initially for only part of the commissioned officers needed for the increased force. The
                    amended bill passed the House by a large majority on January 6. The second vote to be considered
                    took place on this same measure three days later after the Senate had declined to accept the major
                    House amendments. On January 9 the House reluctantly decided to agree to the Senate version of the
                    bill. Those who urged the House to yield to the Senate on this issue argued that a quarrel with the
                    Senate (even if justified) would only serve to slow down war preparations. The third military
                    measure examined was that calling for volunteers; this passed by a substantial margin on January 17
                    after a bitter argument over whether the militia could be used outside the country.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two votes on naval matters were reviewed. The first, which provided for the arming of merchantmen,
                    passed with little opposition on December 19, 1811. The second was the proposal to eliminate from
                    the navy bill the clause calling for the building of new frigates. This passed by three votes on
                    January 27, 1812, defeating the efforts of those, including Henry Clay, who wanted to increase the
                    navy in order to combat <placeName>

            <p>On financial matters three votes were examined. The first was the defeat on February 28 by three
                    votes of the resolution to levy a tax of 20 cents on each bushel of imported salt. The second was
                    the reconsideration and passage of this same resolution by twelve votes on March 2. The third was
                    the agreement on March 4 to accept all the tax resolutions taken together. These were the taxes
                    which it was presumed would enable the <placeName>

            <p>The other three votes examined include two that were basic to the declaration of war and the
                    declaration itself. On April 1, 1812, by a vote of 70 to 41, the House passed a sixty-day embargo
                    (subsequently increased to ninety days by the Senate) which was looked upon by those who argued for
                    it as a direct precursor of war against <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. On April 25 the House agreed by the narrow margin of seven votes to postpone
                    indefinitely the subject of an adjournment. This proposal had gained support earlier in the month
                    but was opposed by most war advocates, who viewed it as a means of delaying, and possibly avoiding,
                    a decision. Finally, on June 4, 1812, the House approved a declaration of war against <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> by a vote of 79 to 49.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It can be argued that the ardent enthusiast for war would have voted affirmatively on ten of these
                    eleven issues, the exception being the proposal to eliminate from the naval bill the section calling
                    for the building of new frigates. Thus a war advocate would have voted for an increased army in
                    spite of the manner in which the Senate had imposed its will on the House; would have supported the
                    arming of merchantmen and the building of new frigates in spite of western warnings that a large
                    navy would lead to bankruptcy and despotism; would have agreed to the various taxes in spite of
                    historic Republican objections to such impositions; would have advocated the sixty-day embargo as a
                    measure which would lead directly to war; would have opposed adjournment as a vacillating device to
                    avoid a decision; and finally, on June 4, would have voted triumphantly for war. Such consistency
                    was exceedingly rare.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                    assumed that the speaker, Henry Clay, would also have supported the war party on all these measures

                    than half of those who had spoken as War Hawks in debate are to be found in this group of consistent
                    voters for war measures.</p>
            <p>If the net is spread farther to include those who cast only two votes that hindered the war effort,
                    then eighteen more members of the House can be included in the regular war party. This group, like
                    those who voted once in opposition, showed greatest dissatisfaction on the issue of naval
                    expansion—seventeen of the eighteen were opposed to the plan to build more frigates. Most
                    of the other opposition votes were related to the withdrawal of the House from its amendments to the
                    Senate armed forces bill; there were also some votes against the arming of merchantmen and the tax
                    on imported salt. The sectional pattern becomes far less distinct in this group of eighteen: the

                    forty-five representatives who generally supported the war effort voted against the proposal to
                    build additional frigates for the <placeName>

            <p>When one adds to the forty-five already studied the sixteen representatives who cast three votes in
                    opposition to the war drive, the feeling against naval expansion becomes even more apparent.
                    Thirteen of these additional sixteen opposed the proposal to build new frigates. Most of the other
                    opposition votes in this group were directed against the Senate armed forces bill and the tax on
                    imported salt.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were, then, sixty-one representatives who can be described as usually giving their support to
                    measures leading to war. The sectional alignment of these sixty-one members of the House is fairly
                    distinct: ten were from New <placeName>

                    and seven from the West. Eighteen of the twenty-one who can be considered the vocal supporters of
                    war in the debates of the Twelfth Congress are included <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="131" id="VAA4025-060-2-017"/> among these sixty-one representatives. The exceptions are
                    Samuel McKee of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, Robert Wright of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>, and David R. Williams of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The records of all three are somewhat surprising. McKee and Wright both spoke for war
                    in Congress but, for varying reasons, managed to cast four votes out of the eleven against war
                    measures. McKee was bitterly opposed to naval expansion and thought the war could be won by an
                    invasion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. He voted against the arming of merchantmen and the building of new frigates, would not
                    yield from his support of House amendments to the army bill, and did not wish to see the matter of
                    adjournment postponed indefinitely in late April, 1812. McKee was an outspoken and independent
                    westerner. Wright's chief stumbling block was the question of taxes. He opposed the tax on
                    imported salt, its reconsideration, and the general tax resolution which was passed early in March,
                    1812. Wright also opposed the arming of merchantmen. Williams, though speaking for war, voted
                    positively on only four occasions of the eleven and missed four votes; he opposed the arming of
                    merchantmen and the building of frigates, and did not want the adjournment postponed in April, 1812.
                    The manner in which these three managed to speak for war and at the same time vote against various
                    measures which were to make it possible typifies the difficulties of the war party in the Twelfth
                    Congress.</p>
            <p>The whole period from November, 1811, to June, 1812, demonstrates clearly the importance of the five
                    South Atlantic states in bringing about the war. These states provided half of the sixty-or-so
                    regulars who could reasonably be depended upon to support war measures. The West could offer little
                    numerically, but its representatives were usually—and often
                    enthusiastically—in favor of war. The Middle Atlantic states provided more total votes
                    but they had more representatives in opposition than the West, and New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> contributed less than a third of her representation to the ranks of the more than sixty
                    who generally supported war measures.</p>
            <p>When an attempt is made to single out the twenty or thirty true enthusiasts—the War Hawks
                    who harangued and finally persuaded the other members of the House that war was the only way out of
                    the American dilemma—the part played by the South and West becomes even more evident.
                    Some 50 per cent of the representatives from the West and over 20 per cent of those from the South
                    Atlantic states <pb n="132" id="VAA4025-060-2-018"/> worked actively for war; less than 6 per cent
                    of those from New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and less than 3 per cent of those from the Middle Atlantic states were in this
                    category. These percentages mean little in detail, but the general impression they give is
                    reinforced by the voting records. Some twenty-seven representatives cast not more than one vote
                    tending to hinder the war effort out of the eleven votes considered here. Among these the South
                    Atlantic states had almost 31 per cent of their representatives, the West 20 per cent, and the
                    Middle Atlantic states and New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> together had less than 10 per cent. Both the debates and the voting records show the
                    South and West by far the most enthusiastic supporters and advocates of the drive for war.</p>
            <p>Though the party allegiance of the members of the Twelfth Congress is not always distinct, all
                    twenty-one of those who supported the war in the debates of the House of Representatives can
                    reasonably be classified as Republicans; the same is true of all the sixty-one who gave most support
                    to the various war measures. The main support for war after November, 1811, came from a combination
                    of western and southern Republicans. The true enthusiasts were remarkably few, but they were able to
                    enlist a solid group of Republicans to vote with them on most of their measures and eventually
                    obtained enough beyond this solid core to pass a declaration of war.</p>
            <p>The records of the Twelfth Congress abound in instances of the difficulties which beset the advocates
                    of war. Even those who were willing to speak in its behalf were frequently unwilling to support the
                    measures which would make it possible. It is not uncommon for nations to go to war in a burst of
                    enthusiasm or desperation and worry later about the specific details of conducting the war. In 1811
                    and 1812 the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> argued over the details, announced her difficulties to the world, and painfully crawled
                    toward war. The difficulties were great. The true enthusiasts—the War
                    Hawks—certainly numbered less than forty, and it can be argued that there were fewer than
                    thirty. And the total group that usually could be depended upon to support war measures was not much
                    more than sixty. Out of a House of Representatives of 142 members this was a remarkably poor
                    representation on which to base a war. It is surprising not that it took six months for war to be
                    declared, but that it was declared at all.</p>

            <p>Historians have long presumed the existence of a belligerent Republican faction, the War Hawks,
                    genuinely bristling and warm for a war with Great Britain. Urged by economic grievances,
                    expansionist designs, a hypersensitive sense of national honor, or simply the conviction that no
                    other course remained open, these men, led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, drove their more
                    reluctant colleagues into a contest for which the country was ill-prepared.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Federalist opponents of the war, men not privy to the views of Republicans, coined the term War
                        Hawk.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> They relied on false appearances. No Republican ever answered this
                    description. There were differences among Republicans as to the time for beginning hostilities and
                    the initial strategy to be followed. But there is no firm evidence of heedless bellicosity among
                    either the Republican leaders or the rank and file.</p>
            <p>The immediate cause of the Republican declaration of war in 1812 was the apparent determination of
                    Great Britain to maintain her Orders in Council limiting American commerce with Napoleonic Europe.

                    </placeName>, Augustus J. Foster, held in Washington in July, 1811. Following these negotiations the
                    two American leaders came to the conclusion that Great Britain would not repeal the Orders in
                    Council unless compelled to do so by armed force. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>

            <p>That the refusal of Great Britain to repeal left no alternative but force was also the basis of
                    Republican war sentiment in Congress. Letters written by twenty-seven Republican members of Congress
                    from every section of the country—south, west, and north—show Republican
                    representatives and senators agreeing with President Madison and Secretary Monroe that diplomacy
                    unsupported by force no longer offered any hope of redress. The correspondence of Jesse <placeName>

            <p>Recent writing on the causes of war in 1812 strongly supports this thesis. Norman K. Risjord,
                    Bradford Perkins, and Reginald Horsman, in publications that have appeared within the last three
                    years, all agree in locating the basis for war in a feeling that the peaceful policies of diplomacy
                    and commercial restrictions, operative since 1806, no longer offered hope of redress. Nevertheless,
                    significant differences arise among these writers on the matter of when and how Republicans reached
                    this consensus. Risjord and Horsman see the process as one of gradual conversion, a process that
                    began with the agitation of war advocates as early as 1809, then gathered strength and numbers as
                    more "conservative" Republicans gradually joined their ranks. Perkins, on the
                    other hand, finds no war advocates until late 1811 when by word and action a belligerent wing of the
                    party began forcing peace-minded "scarecrow men" and "moderates"
                    into hostilities.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>It is true that some Republicans had given up all hope in peaceful methods as early as 1809.

                    towards us could alone preserve peace—and there is no stronger reason to calculate on
                    such an event now, as than there has been for several years past." And William H. Crawford,

                    working closely with the administration, they helped to shape much of its program and guide it
                    through the House. Both men, their letters and speeches clearly demonstrate, believed the country
                    had before it only the two alternatives of war or submission. <placeName>

                    In December he voiced confidence that Americans would support the administration in its views and
                    policies "now that war was the only alternative left to us by the injustice of one of the
                        powers."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Calhoun, too, saw no other way out. Addressing the House
                    he declared: "The extent, duration, and character of the injuries received; the failure of
                    those peaceful means heretofore resorted to for the redress of our wrongs, is my proof that it [war]
                    is necessary." One month before war began he wrote a former schoolmate: "War, I

                    made it very clear that the time for forcible resistance had not yet come. He then proposed either a
                    more stringent nonimportation law or congressional authorization for arming merchant ships to take
                    effect after another negotiating attempt. In the early months of 1811 he intimated that Britain
                    still might repeal her Orders in Council. In August, 1811, he told a party colleague that repeal was
                    possible, but that if Britain did not follow <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s example by repealing her edicts, war would be
                    "inevitable." During the war session he said again and again, in public and
                    private statements, that war had <hi rend="i">now</hi> become necessary owing to British
                        intransigence.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Nor does Calhoun appear to have advocated war before the fall of 1811. Nowhere in the first volume of
                    his papers is there any indication that before that time he believed war necessary. His biographer,
                    Charles M. Wiltse, hypothesizes that Calhoun campaigned for Congress in 1810 on a war program.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Yet during the war session Calhoun seemed concerned as to how his
                    constituents would take the prospect of a coming British war: his letters suggest that he was
                    anxious about their response to war and its financial burdens. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Precisely when and how did the members of Congress reach consensus that no alternative remained but
                    war? A close study of congressional correspondence for the period November, 1811, to June, 1812,
                    shows widespread agreement developing among Republican members during the first month of the
                    session. President Madison's message, transmitting the results of the negotiations of July,
                    1811, with the British minister and recommending military preparations, reached Congress on November
                    5. As a result, Republicans in the House and Senate quickly agreed in general terms that it had
                    become necessary to devise some new policy to protect American commerce. As George Poindexter,

                    will be done, until the Committees report. No one has suggested a specific measure; but all agree

            <p>Following presentation of this report, Republican opinion began moving swiftly toward a war position.
                    It is clear that the document made an impact on Republicans and brought into sharper focus incipient
                    ideas and tentative positions. The rapid development of agreement is to be seen in the sudden
                    confidence of Republicans that there would be war. In mid-November Representative Jonathan Roberts
                    of Pennsylvania had complained that the "house wants [lacks] men to take the lead"
                    and confessed: "In politics I know not whether to say we shall have bold &amp; great
                    measures or not." On November 30, the day following the report, he could write with
                    assurance: "I think these principles will go into effect—&amp; they must
                    speedily lead to peace or War." A week later on December 8 he told his brother:
                    "Congress will declare War against Britain if she does not do us justice before we rise. I
                    shall vote for it." Following the report other members were confident Congress would
                    declare war. On December 2 Representative John A. Harper of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>There were Republicans—very few at most—who did not back war until well into
                    the session when retreat from war seemed impossible without absolute disgrace. Representative John
                    Smilie of Pennsylvania was one. He admitted that at the beginning of the session he had been for
                    commercial restrictions, not war. He had been against the 25,000-man army, "but as the
                    House have determined otherwise he would now go to war—if we now recede we shall be a
                    reproach among all nations." It is unlikely there were many others. Calhoun—who
                    certainly should have known—believed that a majority had felt that war was necessary and
                    that the "same sense of the justice and necessity of the [war] measures, which originally
                    induced Congress to adopt them, will also coerce us to resort to that last redress of a
                    nation's wrongs."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is doubtful that there were many "bluffers" among those Republicans who
                    originally supported measures of military preparation, hoping Britain would retreat under the threat
                    of hostilities but having no idea of war if she did not. Members frankly and openly expressed hopes
                    that military preparations still might possibly produce repeal. Representatives William Findley of
                    Pennsylvania and Hugh Nelson of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> both avowed that military measures might prevent war, but both men were clearly willing
                    to vote for war if threats proved unsuccessful. But this was true of virtually all Republicans, who
                    clung to a dim hope that preparations might possibly produce British repeal and would have rejoiced
                    in such an event. Calhoun expressed the party sentiment <list type="footnotes">

            <p>No Republican genuinely hoped for war or joined the consensus that war had become necessary with any
                    other feeling than deep reluctance and regret. Thus Nathaniel Macon asked the rhetorical question of
                    his congressional colleagues whether there was "a man in the House" who
                    "wishes to go to war if it could possibly be avoided?" Jonathan Roberts accurately
                    perceived this mood when he wrote in January: "There seems to be no disposition to relax
                    our war measures but I beleive [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] every body would be exceeding glad to remain
                    at peace, the federalists seem sanguine the orders in council will be revoked—I confess I

            </p>
            <p>These men did not minimize or close their eyes to the disadvantages and evils of war. Historians have
                    portrayed the leaders as bellicose, fervent, enthusiastic, and heedless as to the evils of war. A
                    reading of their correspondence suggests that this does not do them justice. A few Republicans
                    foresaw danger in a standing army, a swollen national debt, corruption of public virtue, and a
                    possible alliance with Napoleon. All foresaw hardships and dangers in war—casualties,
                    expenses, taxes, and commercial and business losses. The nation's military and naval
                    establishments were weak. There was great concern as to whether public opinion would wholeheartedly
                    and unitedly support war against Great Britain at this time with all the hardships and sacrifices it
                    entailed, and which Federalists were bound to exploit.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    prosecute the War. It will certainly add to our embarrassments if we have to carry on a war with
                    them, as well as their good friends, the English." One enemy at a time was certainly

            <p>True, a good deal was said in debate to suggest that some Republicans were spoiling for a fight with
                    Great Britain. In their speeches men did wax belligerent, they did ignore or minimize the evils of
                    war, and they did predict quick and easy victory. They talked heatedly and emotionally of
                    accumulated British aggressions on national rights and honor—Orders in Council,
                    impressment, British-incited Indian attacks, the <hi rend="i">Chesapeake</hi> affair, and much else.
                    They seemed eager for war, for a chance to get revenge for half a decade of un-redressed injuries
                    and insults. But one should consider the situation they were then facing. The country needed to be
                    aroused. The recruitment of men for the new army, the subscription to the $11,000,000
                    loan, and the conversion of the economy to a war footing, all required the war to seem credible and
                    worthy of sacrifice to private citizens. And how were these objects to be met except by rousing
                    speeches that received a wide circulation through the public prints?<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Henry

                    </placeName> well understood the problem. His principal argument for a brief embargo in March was
                    that it would "give tone to public sentiment," repress "indiscreet
                    speculation," enable the prudent "to put under shelter before the storm,"
                    and "above all powerfully accelerate preparations for the War."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One should consider other motives also. While Congress had as yet no official stenographer and kept
                    no record of its debates, such speeches as were taken down by newspaper reporters and printed in the
                        <hi rend="i">National Intelligencer</hi> and other town and country papers reached a wide
                    national audience. The opportunities in the situation should be obvious. While motivation is
                    extremely difficult to prove, there is the case of Jonathan Roberts, a freshman representative from
                    Pennsylvania. Roberts regretted the need for war—"every body would be exceeding
                    glad to remain at peace," he wrote his brother. Yet it was not inconsistent with this
                    attitude for Roberts to wish to seem "active" on his first introduction to the
                    national legislature, or to worry that a speech of his would be so placed, in the <hi rend="i">Intelligencer's</hi>, account, as to appear "to little
                        advantage."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Observers were probably right when they surmised that
                    members often spoke with an eye to the gallery.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Possibly, too, members wished
                    to justify their conduct before constituents. Would voters approve their decision for war simply on
                    the basis of Britain's refusal to repeal the Orders in Council? Should they not be reminded
                    of the long catalogue of unredressed aggressions from this hostile power? Finally, the heavy
                    concentration of belligerent speeches during the December debates suggests the possible operation of
                    another motive. A faint hope remained that Great Britain needed only to be convinced that the
                    Republican majority genuinely meant war, and she would repeal the Orders. By January <list type="footnotes">

                    believed Republicans meant to back out of war. As one Federalist observed at the end of January, the
                    "war fever" seemed to have "all evaporated," thereby confirming

            <p>On the existence of a conflict between War Hawks and "peacemen," the evidence is

                    the army, navy, taxes, or adjournment—that might reveal such a struggle; the same men may
                    be found on different sides of these issues at different times. There were

            <p>Nor is it the contention of this study that Republicans were generally agreed on the manner and
                    timing of hostilities. A sizable group in the party wanted an undeclared limited maritime war
                    instead of the full-scale hostilities that a declaration of war would bring. Some of the same men,
                    and others, wanted to postpone hostilities until the nation was more adequately prepared. But these
                    were differences over strategy, not over the more fundamental question of war or peace.</p>
            <p>It is contended, however, that the main body of the Republican party was not divided into two
                    factions which differed during most of the session over the question of war or peace; that the great
                    majority of Republicans reached a consensus between the termination of the Foster negotiations at
                    the end of July, 1811, and the report of the House foreign relations committee at the end of
                    November, 1811, that no acceptable alternative to force remained; that most Republicans came to this
                    decision with no little regret and reluctance, however much some might appear in their speeches to
                    be eager and bellicose. If these contentions are correct, perhaps the time has come to relegate a
                    misleading term—"the War Hawks of 1812"—to the realm of
                    partisan misunderstanding and historical mythology.</p>

            <p>Causation and its problems have always fascinated the historian. In the literature of American
                    history the exploration of the causes of the War of 1812 has been particularly attractive to the
                    scholar and has led to a number of controversial interpretations. Several recent books, articles,
                    and these two essays by Professors Reginald Horsman and Roger H. Brown show that the interest in the
                    causes of the War of 1812 is as vigorous as ever and the question still open to controversial, and
                    even contradictory, conclusions.</p>
            <p>These two papers attempt to isolate and analyze one element in the chain of causation—the
                    group of men in the Twelfth Congress who favored war and provided the leadership that led to the
                    declaration of war against Great Britain in June, 1812. The identities of all these men, who have
                    been dubbed the War Hawks, have never been entirely clear. Both essays attempt to bring needed
                    clarity to the subject, but each author, after surveying the evidence, offers an argument and a
                    conclusion that seemingly contradicts the findings of the other. It would appear, therefore, that
                    instead of clarifying the issue Horsman and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> have added to the interpretive confusion in the historiography of the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>A close reading of the essays and their documentation, however, indicates that the views of these two
                    investigators are not in themselves contradictory. The contradictions stem mainly from methodology,
                    the nature of the data these historians chose to use in support of their theses, and from semantic
                    differences. Horsman not only insists that there were War Hawks, but also that they were important
                    and can be identified with reasonable accuracy—or at least with greater precision than in
                    the past. <placeName>

                    in the sense that the term implies that Republican leaders were bellicose and eager for war, there
                    were no War Hawks in the Twelfth Congress.</p>

            <p>While admitting that there are limitations in his methodology, Horsman arrives at his conclusions
                    through a statistical analysis of the debates and votes of the Twelfth Congress on selected issues
                    which he believes were decisive war measures. On the basis of this technique he stresses throughout
                    the essay that western and southern Republicans in the Congress provided the leadership for war
                    against <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and hence were the War Hawks. He maintains that their eagerness for war was not a quick
                    emotional enthusiasm, but a sustained desire running from November, 1811, to June, 1812. Since,
                    according to Horsman's interpretation, the War Hawks were Republican partisans who numbered
                    only about thirty in a House of Representatives of 142 members, it is not surprising that the
                    declaration of war came slowly, even reluctantly.</p>

               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s argument hinges on this Republican reluctance to vote a declaration of war.
                    "No Republicans," he writes, "genuinely hoped for
                    war…". Unlike Horsman, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> maintains that "the speeches of individual congressmen afford a false
                    impression of eagerness for war." A better tool of analysis, he believes, is the study of
                    the private letters of the legislators of the Twelfth Congress. Human motivation and true desires,
                    he maintains, are usually revealed with greater candor in personal correspondence than in public
                    debates. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, therefore, bases his analysis primarily on a study of the private correspondence of
                    the men in the Twelfth Congress who provided the leadership that led to the declaration of war.</p>
            <p>The theoretical basis of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s analysis appears sound and convincing, but its practical application in this
                    case is so difficult that it casts doubt on his sweeping conclusion. While it is seemingly true that
                    men's speeches frequently do not reveal their inner motives, it does not necessarily follow
                    that legislators do not vote their convictions, particularly on war measures. Furthermore, it
                    appears from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s documentation that not all the private correspondence of the members of the
                    Twelfth Congress, or even of the alleged War Hawks, is available for close investigation or for an
                    analysis that can be tabulated. Yet all the votes of the Twelfth Congress are on record and
                    truncated versions of debates are also available for study.</p>
            <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-060-2-040"/>
            <p>Nonetheless, Professor Brown has performed a valuable service in reiterating that the men of 1812 did
                    not plunge the nation into war in a moment of fiery and belligerent passion; in this sense, he is
                    correct in arguing that they, or their leaders, were not War Hawks. Yet, as he himself admits, some
                    of the Republicans sought war with greater eagerness than others, and actually did provide the
                    leadership that brought a reluctant Congress to declare war. In this sense, then, one can argue that
                    there were War Hawks and, through rigorous analysis as shown by Professor Horsman, that these War
                    Hawks can be identified. Moreover, the term War Hawks has long been a legitimate generalization for
                    the historian to use when describing men who sought war for various reasons, whether in 1812 or at
                    some other time. I see no reason why, especially with reference to 1812, the term should be
                    discarded or relegated to the realm of mythology.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Horsman have written essays that give evidence of careful and extensive research on
                    a significant subject. Even more important, they have applied critical and rigorous analysis to
                    their material, and in so doing have given their subject new meaning. Both have attempted to tell
                    not only what happened, but also how it came about. Horsman has succeeded in defining the term War
                    Hawks with greater precision than have other historians and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> has shown how and why the term can be misleading if not used with care. Both essays
                    reveal how important it is for the historian to be self-concious in his methodology and in his use
                    of generalizations in any pattern of explanation.</p>

            <p>Political factions are nebulous things. It is easy to discuss them and their ideas; it is much more
                    difficult to define them with any precision. This laborious task Professor Reginald Horsman has
                    performed for the War Hawks through an examination of voting patterns in the Twelfth Congress. This
                    has enabled him not only to count the War Hawks, but to determine their consistency and the extent
                    of their support for war. And it has enabled him to offer statistical evidence to support the
                    impression gained by all who have read the debates of the Twelfth Congress—that the South
                    provided both the enthusiasm and the votes for war, the West furnished only enthusiasm, and the
                    great silent mass of representatives from the middle states provided only votes.</p>
            <p>Horsman's technique is certainly scientific, but an attempt to extract behavior patterns
                    without reference to personalities or to the historical context can be misleading. For example, he
                    lists the vote to increase the army by 25,000 as a significant war measure, and, indeed, it would
                    appear to be so. The bill actually originated in a Senate committee headed by William Branch Giles
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, a leading Republican critic of the administration. Since the President had asked for
                    only 10,000 men and there was some doubt that the treasury could finance an army of 25,000, it was
                    widely suspected that Giles was interested only in embarrassing the administration. Secretary of
                    State James <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>

                    measure.</p>
            <p>The complex of factions and personalities that made up the Republican party is not revealed by a
                    simple examination of voting patterns. The antiadministration faction in the

                    declaration of war. It seems likely that their belligerence was largely a pose which permitted them
                    to criticize the foreign policy of the President and the fiscal policy of treasury secretary Albert
                    Gallatin. This would explain, for instance, the behavior of Representative Robert Wright of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>, whose verbal demands for war and votes against it seemed to puzzle Horsman. Another
                    enigmatic figure was David Rogerson Williams, representative from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who loudly demanded war yet voted against taxes, the navy, and the expansion of the
                    War Department. Williams was a former Quid who had not completely cast off the spell of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s Representative John Randolph and the Old Republican "principles of
                    1798."</p>
            <p>This is to argue only that the behaviorist approach needs to be softened by historical perspective
                    and the use of other kinds of evidence. Voting patterns alone reveal little of personal motives,
                    passions, or fears. This, however, is but a minor reservation concerning Horsman's method.
                    With his conclusions no one can disagree.</p>
            <p>While Horsman identifies and counts the adherents of war in the Twelfth Congress, Professor Roger H.
                    Brown denies that the War Hawks even existed as an identifiable faction. The two views, however, are
                    not necessarily incompatible. Horsman's discovery of a remarkably small group of consistent
                    supporters of war is perhaps explained by the reluctance which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> observed. Perfect consistency, after all, is too rigid a criterion by which to judge
                    any politician. It is obvious that some people were more eager for war than others. The more
                    reluctant had to be converted gradually, and there was much backsliding—particularly on
                    issues involving Republican principles, such as taxes and the navy.</p>
            <p>With <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s thesis that Congress went to war with great hesitation and many misgivings I
                    agree completely. War sentiment evolved only gradually, in company with growing disillusionment with
                    the policy of commercial retaliation. But the evolution of war sentiment began earlier than <placeName>

                    that of the twenty-seven representatives listed by Horsman as being most consistent in their votes
                    for war in the Twelfth Congress, seventeen had served <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-060-2-043"/> in
                    previous Congresses. And many of these began the process of conversion from Jeffersonian pacifists
                    to War Hawks well before 1811. In connection with my study of the Old Republicans I have had
                    occasion to investigate the extent of war sentiment in the Eleventh Congress (1809-1811), using much
                    the same technique as Horsman. Although the Eleventh Congress never faced a clear-cut issue of war
                    or peace, there were a number of political issues—coastal fortifications, proposed
                    convoys for American merchant vessels, the size of the army and navy—which reveal a
                    certain degree of belligerence. Examining nine such issues, I discovered that fourteen
                    representatives voted consistently for military and naval preparedness and another eighteen stood
                    for warlike measures in all but one of their votes.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Considering the extent of belligerent sentiment in the Eleventh Congress revealed by these statistics
                    (only twenty-seven men had a similar record in the Twelfth Congress, although the issues there were
                    more clearly defined), why did the Eleventh Congress appear so weak and vacillating? <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-060-2-044"/> Why was the issue of war never squarely faced? I can only
                    conclude that it was a lack of leadership. The administration offered no encouragement, and
                    congressional leaders, such as Representatives Nathaniel Macon of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> and John Taylor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were still wedded to commercial retaliation. Would-be War Hawks, moreover, exerted no
                    leadership. Representatives Peter B. Porter of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and Ezekiel Bacon of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> were absent or not voting on key issues. Representatives Richard M. Johnson of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and George M. Troup of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> whimsically voted often with John Randolph and the Quids. The growing national
                    frustration needed leadership to crystallize it into a declaration of war—this was the
                    function of the War Hawks in the Twelfth Congress.</p>
            <p>Even in the Twelfth Congress the War Hawks had a continuous job of persuasion and conversion. If, as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> insists, the consensus in favor of war was formed as early as November, 1811, when the
                    Twelfth Congress opened, it took an inordinately long time to get around to declaring war. Since the
                    Federalists provided only an ineffective and vacillating opposition, it is apparent that the long
                    delay resulted from the necessity to convert reluctant Republicans—a process that
                    continued down to the very eve of the war declaration.</p>

                    </placeName>'s conclusions I have no serious dispute—except to suggest that the
                    evolutionary process began earlier than the summer of 1811, and continued into the spring of 1812
                    before the "great majority" (to use <placeName>

                    suggests that they were not as lighthearted as perhaps some historians have supposed.</p>

                    selling and leasing land, by conducting an ill-fated lottery, by circulating school subscription
                    lists, by accepting "in kind" tuition fees, by collecting certain penal funds from <placeName>

                    they did not save it from extended periods of suspended operation nor did they ever make possible

                    owed much to that eminent jurist's opinion. The university realized approximately
                    $40,000 from its suit against the state. These funds, combined with the proceeds from the
                    sale of its original properties, provided the means for beginning in the decade before the Civil War
                    a continuous educational program housed in the university's own buildings.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

            <p>In the twentieth century the university again narrowly escaped corporate extinction in the
                    1920's, survived the financial crisis of the 1930's, and, in the period since
                    World War II, has made a truly remarkable recovery by all the indexes of educational growth and
                    prosperity—student body, quality of faculty, physical plant, and academic respectability.
                    Along the way the survival of the school has owed something to timely financial assistance from the
                    state of Indiana and from <placeName>

                        and, with some exceptions, original punctuation has been retained. Periods have been added after
                        abbreviations and initials of persons; they have also been used at the ends of paragraphs.
                        Decimal points have been added. Commas have been inserted only to separate series of words and
                        phrases. The abbreviations "A.M." and "A.D." have been
                        standardized by uniform use of capital letters and periods. A colon has been used consistently
                        following "viz." and "to wit" and before each list of board
                        members present at a meeting, and a colon has been added occasionally where its use was clearly
                        indicated. Quotations and parentheses have not been closed if they were unclosed in the
                        original. Superior letters have been brought down to the line; unintentional repetitions have
                        been omitted. Space limitations have prompted the listing of members present and the recording
                        of votes in series instead of the columns which often appear in the original. Inconsistent or
                        unusual spacing used in the original minutes has dictated some modification of spacing and
                        paragraphing for the sake of clarity and uniformity; the locations of headings and signatures
                        have also been standardized. Topic headings and other notations which appear at times in the
                        margins of the minute book have not been included in this reproduction.</item>

                    lease or rent the remaining part of the Township for the use of the University, For greater
                    Satisfaction to purchasers and perhaps to dissipate Scruples, the act of Congress of April 27th
                    1816, ch. 118, confirmed in fee the Title of purchasers of Land in the Township from the Board of
                    Trustees of the University, When the Territory of Indiana was admitted into the Union as a State
                    under the act of Congress of April 19th 1816 and formed the State Constitution in June of that year,
                    It was declared that "all rights, contracts and claims, both as it respected Individuals
                    and Corporations, should continue as if no change had taken place in the government; and that it
                    should be the duty of the general assembly to provide by law for the Improvement of such Lands <hi rend="i">actual</hi> as might thereafter be granted by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to the State for the use of schools, <hi rend="i">and apply any funds</hi> which might
                    be raised from such Lands to accomplishment of the grand object for which they were
                    intended."</p>
            <p>There is no doubt that such <hi rend="i">rights, contracts, and duties</hi> as are alluded to in the
                    Constitution would upon general <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-060-2-057"/> principles of public Law and
                    morality have existed and been of binding obligation without that provision, But the declaration
                    serves to give a monitory and impressive Lesson of the sacred and indefeasible nature of such rights
                    and duties.</p>
            <p>Congress likewise by the act for admitting Indiana into the Union, shewed a still further and most
                    earnest solicitude for the endowment of Institutions of Learning, for they declared that one entire
                    Township, to be designated by the President, <hi rend="i">in addition to the one heretofore reserved
                        for that purpose</hi>, should be reserved for the use of seminaries of Learning, and vested in
                    the Legislature, <hi rend="i">solely for that purpose</hi>; This act may be Justly considered a
                    recognition of the reservation and appropriation by the act of March 1804 of the entire Township,
                    located by the Secretary of the Treasury in obedience to that Law as the Gibson Township, It is a
                    direct affirmance of the title, previously granted to the University, It had no other meaning or
                    application than to that Township.</p>
            <p>Here then is a title to the Gibson Township complete and perfect, under the repeated and Solemn
                    Sanction of the Governments both of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and of Indiana, There has been no question, as I think may be assumed from the case, as
                    to the validity of the Title of the University to the Township down to the year 1820. The subsequent
                    pretext for Legislative invasions of the rights of the University to the Lands in question, is not
                    put upon any original defect of title, but upon the assumed forfeiture or loss of that title by the
                    default of the University, and which pretexts will here after be considered.</p>
            <p>2 question. The Interest of the corporation by virtue of their power to lease indefinitely?</p>
            <p>The Charter of Incorporation of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University designated that institution as the object or receptacle of the congressional
                    donation for charitable or literary uses of the Gibson Township. It located and vested the charity
                    in that institution, If there was any vagueness or uncertainty in the specific object or subject of
                    that grant, this Legislative Charter removed it. There cannot be any doubt of the legal right and
                    Seizen of that Donation of 1804, vesting in the University by means of the Charter, and it is a well
                    Settled principle in our jurisprudence, that a Subsequent act of Incorporation of a literary or
                    other charitable Institution, for the purpose among other things of an endowed capacity to receive a
                    prior grant of property for charitable uses, acts <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-060-2-058"/>

                    perpetuity, to sue and be sued and to purchase, hold, lease and convey real and personal estate, and
                    it Secondly [?] authorized the Trustees or a majority of them to sell and convey to the amount of
                    4,000 acres of the Township and to lease the residue for the use of the University. That grant
                    implies and assumes an absolute right of disposition of the university Lands under the limitations
                    specially declared, I suppose the better construction to be that the general Power to convey was
                    limited by the subsequent provision conferring the power to sell to the amount only of 4,000 acres
                    and the power to lease the remainder. There are no prescribed limits given to the power to lease, It
                    is a power at large and it was competent for the Trustees of the University to lease for any term of
                    time however long, and upon any reasonable rent and upon any other usual conditions Known to the
                    Law, Without those restrictions, the power to sell and the power to lease would have been equally
                    unlimited and governed only by a sound and honest discretion.</p>
            <p>3 question. What right vested in the Legislature by Virtue of the 4th proposition in the 6th section
                    of the act of Congress for the admission of Indiana into the Union?</p>
            <p>I am of opinion that the proposition did not apply to the Gibson Township, previously appropriated
                    and given by the act of Congress of 1804. It related exclusively to another or new Township and was
                    appropriated for the use of a Seminary of Learning <hi rend="i">in addition</hi> to the one
                    "heretofore," as the act expressed it reserved for that purpose.</p>
            <p>4 Question. Under the Charter would removal from the State, or failure to attend the meetings of the
                    Board <hi rend="i">of itself</hi> without any action on the part of the Board, vacate the seats of
                    the members so removing or failing to attend?</p>
            <p>This and the two following relate to the effect of <hi rend="i">a loss of Trustees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am clearly of opinion, that such a removal or default would not of itself produce that effect.</p>
            <p>A private eleemosynary Corporation such as the one before us, contains by its Charter a <hi rend="i">Contract</hi> between the <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-060-2-059"/> Government &amp; the
                    Corporation, and the Legislature has not the lawfull power under the Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to repeal, impair, alter, or vacate any of the rights and privileges conferred by the
                    Charter, against the consent of the Corporation expressly given or without the default of the
                    Corporation <hi rend="i">judicially</hi> ascertained and declared.</p>
            <p>This principle was avowed and settled in the <hi rend="i">Dartmouth College</hi> Case<hi rend="sup">14</hi> which has ever since been regarded as a kind of <hi rend="i">Magna Charta</hi> in
                    favour of Corporate rights, and which cannot be questioned or shaken without disturbing the
                    foundations of the Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, grants of property and of franchises coupled with an Interest are beyond Legislative
                    control, unless that control be expressly reserved, in the Charter or grant, misuser or nonuser of
                    corporate franchises which are private or charitable and not of a civil and municipal character,
                    will not work a forfeiture, untill the corporation has been duly brought to answer and the default
                    and the forfeiture be adjudged by a court of Justice, Perhaps the rule may not be so strict, when
                    the integral part of a corporation is gone, without whose existance the functions of the corporation
                    cannot be excercised, and when there are no means left of supplying the integral part, and it
                    becomes incapable of acting and has no vitality left.</p>
            <p>That would be a singular case, but it has no application to the one we are considering. Here are a
                    number of Trustees remaining and competent under the qualifications in the charter; and as late as
                    1838 when the legislature of Indiana interfered by a special provision enabling the remaining
                    Trustees to supply vacancies, a majority of the former Trustees were still living, though not as
                    residents of the State, and their seats had not been declared vacant. The Charter provides for the
                    supply of vacancies in the Board of Trustees, arising either from resignation, removal, death, or
                    wilfull absence, and it is provided that "extraordinary meetings" of the Board
                    might be had by the President or any three of the Trustees on Ten days notice and at which such
                    vacancies might have been supplied.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">14</hi> One of John Marshall's most famous Supreme Court opinions

            <p>5 &amp; 6 questions. What would be the effect of an actual reduction of the Trustees to a number
                    less than a majority? and could less than a majority supply vacancies at a Charter meeting?</p>
            <p>The charter in this case declared that vacancies in the Board of Trustees should be supplied, by the
                    Board itself at <hi rend="i">their stated meeting</hi>, and that the whole number which Originally
                    consisted of 23 and after a regular course of reduction according to the charter, should not be less
                    than fifteen, and every vacancy there after, should be supplied at the stated meeting. I should
                    think that an integral part of the corporation, in respect to this Power of electing Trustees was
                    definite, and that a majority of this integral part must be present When vacancies were to be
                    supplied, and the powers of the corporation were accordingly <hi rend="i">suspended</hi> from this
                    action for the want of this majority of the Board, It is true that the charter provides that <hi rend="i">extraordinary meetings</hi> of the Board may be had, by the president or any three of
                    the Trustees, but this means only that meetings other than the ordinary stated semi annual meetings
                    may be called by the President or three Trustees, and I conclude from a review of the adjudged cases
                    on the subject, that less than a majority of the fifteen qualified Trustees after the reduction, or
                    less than a majority of original Twenty three Trustees before any regular reduction, were
                    incompetent to supply vacancies. I do not consider that the corporation was thereby disolved Its
                    franchises were <hi rend="i">suspended</hi>, and it was capable of reanimation and its vitality
                    restored to action by the Legislature without any new charter, and this was done by the act of the
                    Legislature of February 1838 The new Board of Trustees under this act possessed all the powers which
                    belonged to their predecessors, and all the rights and privileges which belonged to the corporation
                    prior to the act remained unimpaired, The proviso to the act left the rights of the University and
                    its title to the Gibson Township just where it found them, and though the university might have been
                    subjected to a judicial process of forfeiture for its default in loosing the competency of the Board
                    of Trustees, it would be absurd to suppose that the act intended that the corporation should still
                    be liable to such a judicial process of forfeiture, for a cause which the legislature had itself
                    removed, all pretence of forfeiture on that ground I consider to have been effectually taken away
                    The office of a proviso is only to qualify and restrain the generality of the enacting clause <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-060-2-061"/> and to exclude all ground of misinterpretation of its extent,
                    The act of 1838 assumes that the incorporation of the University was still a valid subsisting
                    Corporation, not withstanding that its franchises might be suspended from the want of a competent
                    Board of Trustees. It would indeed have been a violent and disastrous consequence, to have fixed an
                    absolute dissolution of the Corporation with all its ruinous result, without a trial, or hearing, or
                    judgment, The regular course for such an Inattention or negligence in leaving the Board of Trustees
                    in a minority.</p>
            <p>The act of 1838 is to be considered as putting an end to every pretext of forfeiture from the want of
                    a requisite quorum of the Board of Trustees and as removing all difficulty as to the capacity of the
                    remaining Trustees by restoring the Board to its original competency and vigor.</p>
            <p>7th Question. What is the effect of the <hi rend="i">proviso</hi> in the act of 1838, and could the
                    Legislature impair or destroy the rights under the Charter?</p>
            <p>These questions have been anticipated and answered under the heads of the three last questions.</p>
            <p>8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th questions. These all relate to the <hi rend="i">remedy</hi> assuming that
                    the original chartered rights of the corporation remain unimpaired and unaffected by Legislative
                    Interference?</p>
            <p>The rights of the corporation to bring suits by ejectment or writs of Disseisen, to recover
                    possession of Lands in the Gibson Township, against Intruders holding adversely under legislative
                    sales is unquestionable. The University has an equal right to lease the land, unsold by them, and
                    unoccupied by adverse Intruders, the real difficulty lies in the <hi rend="i">duration</hi> of
                    adverse Possession, held under adverse Titles derived from sales ordered by the State.</p>
            <p>It is stated that in 1820 and 1822 a portion of the lands were held under leases from the Corporation
                    In that case adverse possession had not then commenced, and the statute of limitations had not begun
                    to run, It is further stated that all the lands are now held by purchasers under the State, and the
                    grave question of fact then occurs has 20 years already run in favour of the adverse claimants, so
                    as to bar an ejectment or the Writ of Disseisen, and ripen the adverse claims and occupancy into a
                    right of possession? as to this fact I am not sufficiently informed, By the joint ressolution of the
                    legislature of Indiana of January 22nd 1820 (nearly 24 years ago) a superintendant was appointed of
                    the lands <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-060-2-062"/> claimed by the University, with directions to collect
                    the rents accruing on leases granted by the University, If submitted to by the Tenants, it was an
                    ouster of the right full possession of the University, On the 22nd day of January 1822 (nearly 22
                    years ago) the legislature followed up this violent intrusion, by the statute authorising
                    commissioners to execute deeds on behalf of the state for lands sold by the University, Under the
                    Joint resolution above named, it seems that the state authorities took the control of the Lands and
                    received the profits and sold all that could be sold and received payments into the State Treasury,
                    The assumption of right and of adverse Possession by the exercise of ownership over the Land under
                    the Joint resolution of 1820, and as purchasers and Lessees have been in possession claiming right
                    and title under the state such possession continuing for 20 years would be a bar to actions now to
                    be commenced by the corporation, The act of the Legislature in 1838 reorganizing the Board of
                    Trustees I do not consider, as a waiver of their right and Title set up against the lands and
                    conveyed by their authority to purchasers under them, for the <hi rend="i">proviso</hi> to the act
                    saves and reserves the existing claims of right, (whatever they may have been) to the lands in the
                    Gibson Township, and forbids the construction that the act confers any right or power to the
                    Trustees over that Township, or to the funds which had or might there after accrue from sales of the
                    Lands therein. Here the proviso has significancy and efficacy. The act of 1838 would seem to have
                    intended to resusicate the University, but stripped of all its valuable powers and means to promote
                    the cause of Learning.</p>
            <p>I do not see how any form of action will help the case, if the adverse possessions have existed for
                    20 years, a much shorter period of Limitation would bar the action for use and occupation or the
                    action of account, If there was no such adverse possession barring the right, I should think that
                    the corporate Title would bear down and destroy the operation of all legislative Ressolutions and
                    statutory enactments, The provision in the Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> that "no State can pass laws impairing the obligation of contracts,"
                    would be a Bulwark of protection, If it were not for the unacountable negligence of the Trustees of
                    the University, sleeping the sleep of death on its rights.</p>
            <p>The University states in its forcible and affecting petition to the Legislature, that they did not
                    wish to disturb the Titles of the numerous Body of Purchasers of their valuable lands and would be
                    willing to receive the proceeds of the sales made <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-060-2-063"/> by the State,
                    and confirm the sale, Nothing can be more reasonable and just than this offer, &amp; unless
                    there be some equitable considerations which do not appear for this invasion of corporate rights,
                    and charity funds and property, I am of opinion that the legislature of Indiana is bound by the most
                    imperious obligations of Justice and honor to indemnify the University for this unconstitutional
                    arrest and detention of their property.</p>

                    from the Teacher Mr. Jocelyn—which was read.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Alexander seconded by Mr. Judah, it was resolved—that the sum of
                    $100. be appropriated for the rent of the School House for the ensuing
                    year—and that the further sum of $50. be appropriated to assist in the payment

                  <hi rend="sup">27</hi> The communication from Jocelyn is preserved in the archives of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                        </placeName> University. In it Jocelyn reported that 112 students had been enrolled in the
                        preparatory school during the past year, including 31 female students. In a rather long passage
                        Jocelyn set down his philosophy of education, and assured the board that he and the instructors
                        had "endeavored to expand the minds under their charge and instill into their hearts
                        correct moral principles," convinced as he was that "if the heart be not
                        educated, education would be a curse … and the children … moral
                        monstrosities." Among his suggestions for the board's consideration Jocelyn
                        recommended greater publicity for the institution as a means of attracting students from
                        "abroad … giving us greater character and standing," and
                        "letting the world know that at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                        </placeName> there is a Protestant Institution for the education of the young."
                        Further, he reminded the board that his assistant, who had been paid $175 during the
                        past year, could not be expected to stay for that amount, which would "scarcely pay his
                        immediate expenses." In a conclusion strikingly modern in its content and tone, Jocelyn
                        stated that "the people in this community cannot and need not expect that qualified
                        teachers will come here and wear away their lives for the sake of their children, and receive no
                        remuneration."</item>

                            Greek. A total of 92 "scholars" had paid a total of $375.04 in
                            tuition to Jocelyn, who was pleased with their academic progress, except for a few who were
                            "petted and caressed at home— permitted to do as they please and [paid]
                            little or no attention to the request of their teacher." Among other
                            recommendations, Jocelyn suggested that the board establish a "living
                            salary" for the teacher and do away with the system under which his salary was
                            derived from tuition fees. The additional statement requested of Jocelyn by the board at

            <p>This correspondence between Albert Gallatin, for half a century a figure of national and
                    international importance, and John Badollet, from 1804 to 1837 a leading citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, gives a picture of affairs in territorial Indiana and the early days of
                    statehood, as well as one of an enduring and devoted friendship. All the letters published in this
                    volume are in the Gallatin Papers in the New-York Historical Society, the letters from Gallatin to
                    Badollet having been returned to Gallatin in 1846 by a member of Badollet's family.</p>
            <p>Badollet and Gallatin were both born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Geneva</settlement>,
                            <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
               </placeName>, of well-known families, and both were
                    college trained. Attracted by the free atmosphere of America they determined to emigrate. Gallatin
                    came in 1780. After traveling for several years he settled in western Pennsylvania in 1785 and urged
                    Badollet to join him. The latter arrived by 1786. In 1795 the two, with three other men, purchased
                    650 acres and laid out the town of New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Geneva</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with a view to attracting a Swiss colony. In 1799 the partnership broke up; Badollet
                    returned to his Pennsylvania farm and Gallatin, who had begun a career of public service, spent most
                    of his time in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
               </placeName>, and Washington. Badollet found it difficult to
                    maintain his family although he had a position of modest importance in the region. Gallatin, who had
                    become secretary of the treasury under Jefferson, obtained for Badollet the position of register of
                    the newly created land office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He highly recommended Badollet as being of strict integrity, and having an excellent
                    command of English. "This is the only instance of favoritism discovered during
                    Gallatin's long service in the Treasury Department" (p. 14) and was to be amply
                    justified by Badollet's faithful service. The correspondence begins in April, 1804, with
                    Gallatin's notification to Badollet of his appointment. Badollet took the oath of office in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on September 19.</p>
            <p>Badollet was full of misgivings as to his ability to cope with the duties of the office and poured
                    out to Gallatin his problems and fears. Gallatin was too occupied with affairs of state to answer as
                    fully, but he wrote encouragement and never lost confidence in his friend. Soon Badollet assumed a
                    place among the more important citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, being a member of the first board of trustees of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, first president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Library Company, and later president of the Historical and Antiquarian Society.</p>
            <p>Badollet's letters indicate that he soon became disillusioned about the morals of Americans.
                    Of unswerving honesty himself, he was highly critical of the often devious methods of his
                    fellow-citizens to rise in <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-060-2-086"/> the world politically and
                    financially. At first an admirer, he soon became violently critical of William Henry Harrison and
                    other officials in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. With his love of freedom, he could not reconcile himself to the machinations of the
                    slavery party to abrogate the provision of the Ordinance of 1787 against involuntary servitude. He
                    wrote that he did not approve Harrison's relations with the Indians; in fact nothing the
                    governor did was right. In a letter to Gallatin in 1809 Harrison speaks highly of
                    Badollet's integrity, but says that he is "extremely irritable &amp; Pevish
                    &amp; altho possessed of a sound understanding he is so extremely diffident of himself &amp;
                    so little acquainted with the world that there is not a man on earth more easily duped" (p.
                    111). Previously Gallatin had written Badollet who had complained of persecution: "As to
                    your squables &amp; disappointment, they are matters of course. At what time, or in what
                    country, did you ever hear that men assumed the priviledge of being more honest than the mass of the
                    society in which they lived, without being hated &amp; persecuted? … When you are
                    tired of struggling with vice &amp; selfishness, rest yourself, mind your own business, and
                    fight them only when they come directly in your way" (pp. 106-07). In spite of this good
                    advice from his devoted friend, Badollet continued to write his criticisms of local persons and
                    conditions. Gallatin, too, was critical of society, but being more a man of the world accepted it
                    more calmly.</p>
            <p>Along with others, Badollet believed that the Prophet was leading his group of Indians in the right
                    direction by encouraging habits of industry and sobriety, and that Harrison's enmity toward
                    Tecumseh and the Prophet was due to a wish to "stifle the murmurs of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Indians in relation to the late treaties and the unwarrantable means employed to effect
                    them" (p. 195). He felt that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> expedition was unnecessary, as most of the Indians were entirely peaceable and the
                    occasional outrages were the work of only one tribe, the Potawatomi. He considered Harrison a poor
                    military leader, not, however, questioning his personal bravery. He was apprehensive of being
                    falsely accused of communicating with the Indians. Inevitably he became involved in the squabbles
                    over the relative merits of the Regulars under Col. John P. Boyd and the militia, and felt that the
                    fact that he had subscribed to resolutions praising Boyd had put him in danger of physical violence.
                    For some time after the battle he was in a state of terror regarding possible Indian attacks and

                    Convention and served on several committees. He introduced sections having to do with education,
                    care of the indigent, and establishment of libraries. In spite of their devoted friendship, Badollet
                    and Gallatin met only once after 1804 when, in 1825, Badollet journeyed to New <placeName>

                    </placeName> where Gallatin was then living. The correspondence ends with Badollet's last

            <p>It seems strange that Badollet did not mention John Cleves Symmes Harrison, son of the governor, who

                    popular and well thought of, and perhaps Badollet found nothing in his conduct to critieize. This

            <p>The biography of Charles Evans reads like a modern Horatio Alger story. It is the incredible
                    narrative of a lowly inmate of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Asylum and Farm School for Indigent Boys. As a nine year old, the orphaned Evans was
                    admitted to the distinguished charitable institution "that supplied the sense of direction
                    and training which would lead to opportunities for his life's work" (p. 3), that
                    of creating one of the greatest bibliographical works of all times. For, in spite of
                    "ghosts and omissions, errors and inaccuracies, complexity and inconsistency,"
                    this monumental work is often cited for praise as well as blame. From the titles in a volume for a
                    given year it is possible to obtain "a splendid picture of the cultural, intellectual,
                    political, and social conditions of that period of American history" (p. 320).</p>

                    </placeName> librarians, scholars, and citizens should find this biography of special interest
                    because of Evans' connection with the public library of that capital city. In 1872, when
                    Evans was but twenty-two years of age, he became the first librarian of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library. In a few years he had placed it among the leading American libraries.
                    Among his goals "was a collection of source materials for the study of Indiana
                    history" (p. 44). His determination to make the library the depository for all materials
                    relating to the city and state was demonstrated by his becoming a member of the Indiana Historical
                    Society where he hoped to exert sufficient influence for the support of this venture.
                    Evans' efforts to promote social, literary, and aesthetic culture, however, did not
                    materialize until January, 1877, at which time the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Literary Club was organized. The following year <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> failed to reappoint its first librarian. "As the board rejected Charles Evans
                    for personal and political spite, it turned its back on six years of almost phenomenal library
                    progress" (p. 76). After an interval of over ten years he was again selected librarian of
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library. This appointment, however, lasted for only about three years.
                    Fortunately, whenever Evans lost a post, his staunch supporter, William F. Poole, was usually
                    successful in placing him in some other library. Among the libraries that Evans served were the
                    Enoch Pratt Free Library, Omaha Public Library, Newberry Library, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Library of McCormick Theological Seminary. In 1896 he was appointed librarian of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Historical Society. <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-060-2-088"/> Still Evans' evil
                    genius continued to pursue him, and seven years later the Society dismissed him. "Charles
                    Evans was capable of rare kindliness and geniality … but he never strove to apply these
                    charms to board members. This was a serious oversight and it made his career as a librarian a
                    failure" (p. 194).</p>
            <p>Evans was a charter member of the American Library Association, and he regarded it a real honor to
                    hold membership in the American Antiquarian Society. Through these organizations he met many
                    outstanding scholars, which proved to be a definite advantage when he was dismissed as librarian of
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Historical Society. By that time, luckily, Evans had gained the recognition of several
                    influential friends who were able to obtain grants from the American Council of Learned Societies
                    which made it possible for him to devote the remainder of his life to the <hi rend="i">American

            </p>
            <p>All the stress and strain of the past was forgotten by Evans on June 18, 1934, when <placeName>

            <p>The thesis of this work—the emergence of the lower houses as the dominant element in
                    colonial government during the eighteenth century— is familiar to anyone who has ever
                    read a basic textbook in American history. Related to the major theme is the proposition that
                    British measures after 1763 threatened the power of the lower houses, and that the Declaration of
                    Independence was indeed an accurate, valid statement of grievances against King and Parliament. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName>'s book could have provided an excellent opportunity to test the thesis set
                    forth by Bernard Bailyn in an address delivered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> some years ago that appeals to the constitutional power of the lower houses were the
                    rationalizations of newly emerging economic and social elites against an entrenched local group
                    whose political authority stemmed from the imperial government. Aware of this thesis, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> thought originally to consider the economic and social position of colonial politicians
                    as it was related to the structure of political power, but found this too large a task for a single
                    volume. Consequently, he has designated his work an institutional and constitutional rather than a
                    political study. Unfortunately this type of history is artificial, for men, not institutions, make
                    history. In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName>'s treatment, a monolithic institution, seemingly with a mind—and
                    one mind at that—is the actor. But how can we explain those members of the lower houses
                    who were Loyalists, or the fact that so very often disputes were between factions <hi rend="i">within</hi> the lower house, one supporting and the other opposing the royal executive and
                    imperial government?</p>
            <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-060-2-089"/>

                    </placeName> for not writing a different book. He is vulnerable, nonetheless, on the work he did
                    produce for his conclusions are at worst <hi rend="i">non sequiturs</hi> and at best none too
                    convincing. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> discusses in great detail sixteen powers won by the lower houses before 1763 to prove
                    that they had become the dominant element in colonial government and describes the relationship of
                    these powers to the measures adopted by the British government after the French war. Yet by <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName>'s own admission British acts after 1763 did <hi rend="i">not</hi> interfere
                    with or threaten the power to frame money bills, audit accounts, disperse money, regulate fees, or
                    control the internal proceedings of the lower houses, the public works or public printers, or the
                    existing regulation of the militia. He further acknowledges that salaries for governors and
                    comparable matters did not become important issues. The disputes on appointment of agents, control
                    of Indian affairs, church patronage, and paper money were resolved before the Revolution on terms
                    favorable to the assemblies. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName>'s entire case rests on Parliamentary taxation and a few measures (many
                    abandoned before 1774) in particular colonies purportedly designed to tighten imperial control.
                    These last points in themselves, he argues, were insufficient to bring on the Revolution. In
                    attacking British policy <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> emphasizes Parliamentary taxation as a threat to home rule and the power of the lower
                    houses and assumes that men always believe and act on the basis of what they publicly profess. But
                    is there no room for propaganda or self-delusion? <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> does not demonstrate the immediacy, reality, or even the potentiality of the supposed
                    imperial threat. How and why did Whig leaders come to such an erroneous conclusion? British
                    officials would have allowed home rule under a formula recognizing the theory but not the exercise
                    of Parliamentary authority; they would not allow a challenge to governmental authority. Could any
                    responsible government do differently? Professor <placeName>

                    </placeName> might have contributed to a better understanding of the unstated motives of the Whig
                    leaders and the development of the Revolution by considering the economic, social, and political

                    the Back Country under the aegis of the Circuit Court Act of 1769, relinquished their organizations
                    and their extralegal activities. By 1771—certainly by 1774—the movement was
                    dead, its grievances satisfied or at least legally expressed through the grand juries'
                    presentments to the circuit courts.</p>

                    to the decline of extralegal activity once law was established. He also analyzes the property
                    holdings and subsequent political and social positions of 120 Regulators (all he could identify out
                    of several thousands), finding them to be for the most part men of substance or young men on the

                    </placeName> holds, was confined both in intent and practice to rhetoric. The major grievance was
                    not the lack of representation or the existence of discriminatory taxation, but the failure to
                    provide courts to protect family and property from the lawlessness of the frontier brigands and from
                    the shiftlessness and immorality of the "lower people." The absence of major

                    Instead of finding the few Regulators whose attitude he is able to identify as overwhelmingly

                    </placeName> over the Revolution. In this sense, his findings are essentially negative and they
                    reduce the subject to local history. As a substitute, he sees in the extralegal measures taken to
                    preserve law and order an aspect of the American character which was later given the name of
                    vigilantism.</p>
            <p>"The opposing strands of obedience and revolution have been ultimately reconciled in the

                    </placeName>. "The vigilante movement is a striking example of the way in which [these]

                    of social stability and mature institutions they found it necessary to resort to illegal acts of
                    violence to clear the way for the normal function of law and order. Violence was a means to an end.
                    When it had served its purpose, it was discarded. The significance of the Regulators' use
                    of violence remains as a measure of the intense devotion which respectable men of property give to
                    the principles of law and order" (p. 142).</p>

                    </placeName> is probably right in his conclusions. At any rate, I do not have the facts at hand to
                    refute the extensive array he has compiled, and I doubt that they exist. But one may legitimately
                    ask if the facts <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-060-2-091"/> that can be ascertained by industrious (and in
                    this case, imaginative) dredging among the sources can really tell us what the significance of the
                    movement is. I shall use this book and the information presented in it to help me understand the
                    coming of the American Revolution as well as the nature of that Revolution. The failure of the
                    British to provide adequate local government, reasonable equality of taxation, proper
                    representation, educational and religious facilities, the protection of property, and a means of
                    resolving conflicts between groups within the colonies is represented in microcosm in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. That these conditions, which existed for a decade, perhaps decades, just prior to the
                    Revolution, had no connection with the Revolution itself, can hardly be an acceptable conclusion,
                    implicit or explicit. In my opinion, <placeName>

            <p>The Tory view of the American Revolution and the actions which resulted from that view form the theme
                    of <hi rend="i">Royal Raiders.</hi> Professor Callahan thinks that Americans have long had a
                    one-sided conception of the war for independence, with the mistaken notion that the colonists rose
                    as one unified body to expel the enemy. Now they are realizing more and more, he feels, that the
                    struggle also pitted Americans against Americans.</p>
            <p>By Professor Callahan's definition, the Tories comprised those Americans who preferred the
                    security of the Empire to the uncertainty of a new government under inexperienced leaders. From this
                    kind of change they shrank, perhaps aware that they stood to lose a job, land, trade, a hoped-for
                    bishop, or their idolized king. Many Tories who had approved a little rioting as a means of bringing
                    the British government to terms later opposed the movement when propertyless mobs began to destroy
                    for the sheer joy of destruction and when those without political privilege cried loudest for
                    liberty. When war came, about 50,000 Tories helped the British armies with enthusiasm and vigor.
                    Their failure arose from a lack of unity, leadership, arms, and aggressiveness; furthermore, their
                    position was defensive and they had no positive program, for they were satisfied with a system which
                    had been successful for 150 years.</p>
            <p>Many familiar stories appear in the book, but there is also a definite effort to present the truth
                    about some Tory leaders whose reputations have been distorted by hatred and propaganda. One meets
                    Thomas Hutchinson, who loved his country and deplored some of the British policies; the Reverend
                    Jonathan Boucher, who preached with loaded pistols on the pulpit cushion; and the delightful
                    Congregationalist, <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-060-2-092"/> the Reverend Mather Byles of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who gravely marched guard, musket on shoulder, before his own door while his official
                    " 'observe-a-Tory'" ran an errand for him. One also meets
                    Americans—on both sides—who persecuted, tortured, and defiled graves.</p>
            <p>A topic such as this is difficult to organize, and at times the reader comes away with impressions of
                    a rambling, repetitive account; for instance, the same prominent families that were split by
                    opposing sympathies are named on pages 92 and 101. And in view of the fact that at least a dozen
                    books treat Loyalists and their problems, it is strange to read that "they have
                    … virtually lost their place in history" (p. 35).</p>
            <p>There are a few errors such as an incorrect reference to Lord George Germain, secretary of state for
                    American affairs. The index is very inadequate; for example, because the individual colonies or
                    states are not entered, it is impossible to draw together what Professor Callahan says about any one
                    of them.</p>
            <p>All in all, the book rounds up much information about the Tories and is especially valuable because
                    the author has used Tory materials. The evaluations are so fair and moderate that Professor Callahan
                    has certainly given a frequently maligned devil his due.</p>

                    </placeName> State University Press, 1963. Pp. xi, 316. Notes, index. $6.50.)</head>
            <p>In this volume Paul A. Varg surveys American foreign policy from the outbreak of the Revolution to
                    the declaration of war in 1812. Although monographs on aspects of the period abound and there are
                    several general surveys of only slightly smaller scope than Varg's, his volume is the first
                    to perform this precise task. For the general reader or beginning student, <hi rend="i">Foreign
                        Policies of the Founding Fathers</hi> will perhaps be useful as an introduction. Varg writes
                    clearly, tells an uncomplicated story, and generally apportions his space reasonably. He describes
                    such matters as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s nationalism and Jefferson's dislike of Genet with an air of
                    discovery that makes his treatment seem fresh. Because his fairly numerous errors concern matters of
                    detail (Washington did not "deliver" the Farewell Address, the Tripolitanians did
                    not "arrest" the <hi rend="i">

                    irritate the scholar rather than seriously mislead the tyro.</p>
            <p>As original scholarship, Varg's book has little to offer. He presents few new
                    interpretations, although in analyzing the diplomatic implications of the Constitution he plows
                    ground too long fallow. Aside from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> manuscripts, he has examined almost no non-printed sources. Given the scope of his
                    volume, this is perhaps not surprising. More upsetting is the absence of reference to the printed
                    works of many American statesmen and to numerous important historical studies, although the text
                    sometimes shows an awareness of material and interpretations <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-060-2-093"/>
                    pretations not specified in the footnotes. Still, for the period of the American Revolution alone,
                    the reader finds no reference to Gerald Stourzh, Felix Gilbert, C. Page Smith, Samuel Flagg Bemis,
                    Alfred L. Burt, or Vincent S. Harlow.</p>
            <p>Varg's basic theme is the interplay of ideals and reality, particularly economic reality.
                    The need for foreign assistance caused many reluctant Americans to favor independence in 1776, and
                    commercial considerations played a decisive part in the formation of a new government in 1789.
                    Thereafter, says Varg, there was a conflict between the realistic Hamiltonians, with whom the
                    author's sympathies lie, and the "agrarian" idealists led by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Washington, Adams, and to a lesser degree Jefferson, receive much less attention. The
                    conflict became worse, he correctly observes, because each side wildly misrepresented the position
                    of the other. Varg is less safe when he declares, commenting on the Republican regime that gained
                    power in 1801, that "Jefferson and Madison began by rejecting existing realities and sought
                    to implement an ideal" (p. 146), and then in succeeding passages both describes and singles
                    out for notice the many compromises with idealism, some forced and some voluntary, made by Jefferson
                    and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. War finally came in 1812, he says, primarily as a consequence of economic pressures
                    upon a people who preferred idealism as a course of action.</p>

            <p>This volume, the second by Professor Cunningham on the Jeffersonian Republican party, will not
                    disappoint those who awaited its appearance. It is a clearly written, scholarly study of the
                    practical operations of the party during the Jefferson administration. It continues
                    Cunningham's account of party operations which was terminated in the first book with the
                    election of 1800.</p>
            <p>The first transfer of national power from one party to another forced Jefferson and the party leaders
                    to evolve patronage policies. The new President was more sanguine, and unrealistic, than many in his
                    party in anticipating a Federalist-Republican amalgamation. In this spirit he wrote that he would
                    disturb no man "for mere difference of principle" (p. 24). Those to be dismissed
                    included officials guilty of misconduct, the Adams lame duck appointees, and federal attorneys.
                    Uncompromising Federalist activity, however, ended any hope of a rapprochement; meanwhile party
                    pressure compelled Jefferson to announce an expanded program of removals in his famous reply to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Haven</settlement>
                    </placeName> remonstrance. Although he later resumed a cautious policy, his own calculations
                    revealed that the Republicans held 60 per cent of the appointive offices by 1803. Throughout his
                    administration he was aware that his policy suited few in either party.</p>
            <p>In discussing congressional leadership, Cunningham concentrates on the House of Representatives. A
                    struggle for leadership marked <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-060-2-094"/> House proceedings during the
                    Seventh Congress. It did not prevent, however, the passage of the party's program.
                    Jefferson was not completely satisfied with John Randolph's work in the succeeding
                    Congress, but his efforts to groom Caesar Rodney for House leadership were frustrated. After <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> broke with the administration, the President experienced continued frustration in this
                    respect, although his major policies were approved by the House.</p>
            <p>Factionalism based on personal ambition, patronage disputes, and policy considerations was a constant
                    threat to Republican unity. As regards state level controversies, this account demonstrates that
                    Jefferson maintained correct relations with all factions but endorsed none publicly. The discussion
                    of the isolation of Aaron Burr and the counter-measures against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName> reveals Jefferson's success in molding national party policy. Professor
                    Cunningham follows his own recent article on the Quids to demolish the older notion that they were a
                    third party united under <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s leadership.</p>
            <p>A commendable feature of the book is its examination and analysis of the party machinery in every
                    state—a welcome contrast to the first volume which was selective in its treatment of
                    state material. By the time of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s inauguration the Middle Atlantic states had the most advanced party
                    organizations; in the South, with the exception of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, informal influences and occasional local organizations directed affairs.
                    Electioneering techniques, particularly in the South, and basic national party issues are described.
                    While Jefferson's anonymous newspaper articles are brought into full view, the drive of
                    party leaders to enlarge and improve their newspaper coverage is treated in rather broad terms.</p>
            <p>It is lamentable that this fine account contains no recognition and assessment of the implications
                    for the party of Chilton Williamson's work on suffrage reform. Nevertheless, the book is
                    distinguished for its perceptive qualities and its judicious balance in the treatment of national
                    and state party operations. While the thoughts and activities of Jefferson and his close adviser,
                    Albert Gallatin, are examined in great detail, other national captains and significant local leaders
                    are not ignored. Nor is Cunningham afraid to point to Jefferson's inconsistencies, although
                    he writes with an understanding pen. Based as it is on prodigious research, this excellently printed
                    volume is a valuable contribution to the study of Jefferson the President and the Republican party.</p>

                    </placeName>, who has collected and edited the book, is to be congratulated for having brought
                    together contemporary accounts which admirably delineate the character and the color of the time as
                    it appeared to a rather catholic and frank group of observers representing both American and foreign
                    backgrounds. A random sampling of these writers—including such well-known luminaries as
                    Andrew Jackson, Thomas H. Benton, John C. Calhoun, Martin <placeName>

                    Simms, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Alexis de Tocqueville, to name but a few—? indicates both
                    the variety of their backgrounds and approaches and the competence of their analyses. Certainly the
                    book lives up to the claim on the jacket that it is "a compact library of the original
                    sources."</p>
            <p>The general introduction written by the editor is helpful in setting the scene for the primary
                    writings, and in recalling some of the main issues and characteristics of the period. A short
                    introduction to each of the sections points up particular issues and ideas which are to be found in
                    the contemporary writings that follow and also assists the reader in identifying the authors.</p>
            <p>Occasionally it is difficult from reading the Table of Contents to decide what the subject or point
                    of view of a particular selection may be, because the titles of the selections and the brief
                    quotations which follow them are not always very revealing. The use of these short quotations,
                    however, is generally fresh and interesting as well as informative.</p>
            <p>The organization of the book is clear and logical. Attempting to cover a variety of subjects from a
                    variety of viewpoints, the book might well have developed into chaotic history, but the editor has
                    managed to maintain both variety and order by orienting the writing around political, geographic,
                    social, and ideological facets of American life. Thus there are sections on government, the North,
                    the Old South, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Valley, the reformers and preachers, the plain people, the emigrants and Manifest
                    Destiny, and the American character. Finally, and most important of all, the writings are most
                    judiciously selected and therefore represent vividly and accurately the kaleidoscope of opinion then
                    extant on all these areas and topics. The grace and chivalry of the Old South, for example, is
                    contrasted with the evils of slavery; the raw ebullience and sharp practice of the Yankee are placed
                    alongside the sturdy egalitarianism of the yeoman farmer. It appears that no significant area of
                    American life has been neglected or slurred over with protective bias.</p>
            <p>While the book can only whet the appetite of the professional historian for more of the same, even he
                    can find here a useful collection of primary accounts. The less sophisticated student making his
                    first foray into the sources may well come to a much deeper understanding of the color, the flavor,
                    and the vitality of history. In short, he will learn something about the raw material out of which
                    history is written, and will perhaps begin to understand better the way in which historical
                    generalization grows out of the infoi-mation and insight derived from the original sources. It is
                    difficult to see how he could avoid catching some of the perennial excitement of the historian at
                    his task.</p>

            <p>This book is well written and researched and accomplishes in the main what its author intended. By
                    taking as his vantage point the Democratic party, Professor Hollingsworth presents a number of
                    original insights into the personalities and events forming his rightly named whirligig in the
                    decade from 1893 to 1904, a time when party platforms tended to come full circle and when party
                    loyalties veered with the winds of changing conviction.</p>
            <p>Since, as the Preface points out, most major national problems had also to be fought out within the
                    only truly national political party, a study of internecine Democratic battles provides an
                    especially colorful reflection of the times. The reflection, to be sure, is a distorted one, for
                    Democrats and their singularly wrongheaded leaders acted with even more than the normal degree of
                    American irrationality in developing issues with sufficient emotional appeal for voters. The
                    Democrats' job was often easy, for opinion over our hotheaded stumbling into the world
                    power arena at the turn of the century was divided and acrimonious. And even more explosive was the
                    issue of silver, that metallic touchstone of the misguided. Never understood and seldom even
                    objectively approached, the silver question immeasurably complicated domestic American politics by
                    injecting volatile elements of self-interest aligned on class and regional lines in a fashion more
                    dangerous than anything seen since the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Professor Hollingsworth provides a lucid account of how the one political party with a potential for
                    uniting the country could instead tear itself apart by rallying behind leaders like Bryan and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, men dedicated to sharpening divisive issues at a time when conciliation of those
                    issues would have meant Democratic success on a national scale. Understandably, Democratic party
                    fortunes underwent a rapid decline from control of both White House and Congress in 1893 to the low
                    of 1904, when virtually the only Democrats left in office were persistent perennials of the Solid
                    South.</p>
            <p>In analyzing the Democratic decline, <hi rend="i">The Whirligig of Politics</hi> passes the major
                    tests of a good book. Both scholarly and readable, its judgments are supported by superbly
                    wide-ranging evidence skillfully sifted for significance, as in the ingenious detective work on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> vote of 1896 (p. 99). The focus of the study is suitably balanced between the detail
                    essential to an understanding of individual behavior in local episodes and the panoramic sweep
                    required for events on a national scale. Among the book's more important contributions to
                    our understanding of the period is the corrective applied to Nevins' version of the
                    "courageous" <placeName>

                    Professor Hollingsworth's conclusion that the effect of the free silver crusade was far
                    less destructive of Democratic unity and urban strength than has been generally supposed. His vivid
                    account of Bryan's extraordinary behavior at the 1904 Democratic convention goes far toward
                    explaining the nomination of the innocuous Judge Alton B. Parker.</p>
            <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-060-2-097"/>
            <p>Written with a fond understanding of the frailties of the American political process, the book has
                    many of the attributes of a good yarn, including perceptible movement and a discernible beginning,
                    middle, and end. Nevertheless, since scholarship consists also of minutiae, the reviewer must look
                    for faults and report even minor ones. In my overseas location I have been able to make only a
                    limited check for accuracy, but the results were a bit disconcerting. For example, TR's
                    biographer appears as "Herbert" rather than Henry F. Pringle (p. 202) and the
                    source given for Bryan's daily average of speeches in 1896 (p. 86) can hardly be correct.
                    Calling 1893 "the worst depression in the nation's history" (p. 10) is
                    probably only evidence of inexact expression, but even the most tolerant reader may wonder about
                    statements in the same paragraph that Bryan "had gone unobserved by most commentators on
                    national affairs" but that he had "attracted nationwide attention with his
                    speeches" (p. 50).<hi rend="sup">∗</hi> Then, too, while the book's
                    documentation is exhaustive to the point of including M.A. theses and papers read to learned
                    societies, the best source is not always brought in nor do footnotes always appear at the most
                    applicable spot. But they are, mercifully, at the bottom of each page of text, and the
                    bibliographical essay at the end provides a fine general evaluation of sources.</p>
            <p>The impression remains that in this book a skilled young scholar has contributed admirably to his
                    field. More works like this growing out of doctoral dissertations would go far toward settling
                    discussions on the value of that traditionally required "contribution to
                    knowledge."</p>

            <p>This book deals with the idea of conservation, particularly the history of the movement in its
                    American aspect during the administrations of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. Swain devotes a chapter
                    each to the federal administrative and conservation policies touching the commonly recognized
                    resources of water, timber, soil, wildlife, minerals, and natural beauty. A final chapter posits the
                    Republican era as a prelude to the New Deal. The author attempts "to establish the
                    direction in which the sprawling federal conservation program was moving during the 1920's
                    and to indicate those facets of national resource policy which contributed to the progress of the
                    conservation movement" (p. 8).</p>
            <p>The author has utilized much unpublished material in the National Archives, the Library of Congress,
                    and the records sections of the departments and bureaus of the federal government. His research
                    reveals that the 1920's were productive years for conservation in <list type="footnotes">

                    that the foundations for subsequent New Deal conservation achievements were laid. True to his
                    scholarly interest in the evolution of science in America, Swain carefully notes the growth and
                    emphasis upon scientific research in almost every facet of conservation. He documents the struggle
                    leading to the acceptance of principles of multi-purpose resource planning and how it went hand in
                    hand with increased federal reliance upon science.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most interesting point made—but one on which the author fails to
                    capitalize—is the leadership role in the progress and achievement of any worthwhile
                    venture. Swain observes Harding's and Coolidge's utter lack of anxiety in matters
                    of conservation and comments upon the ambivalent attitude of Hoover. But in this vacuum of executive
                    leadership appear Gifford Pinchot and his successors William B. Greeley and R. Y. Stuart on the one
                    hand and Stephen Mather and his alter ego Horace M. Albright on the other. This is, to borrow a
                    phrase from Shakespeare, "a paradox that chastens as it mocks." Swain is at his
                    best when writing about the foresters' commitment to utilitarian conservation and the
                    parkmen's to preservation. The reader becomes vividly aware of the high devotion and
                    ceaseless energy of Greeley, Stuart, Mather, and Albright on behalf of their respective causes.</p>
            <p>Once the historian discovers that in the administrations of three American
                    presidents—Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover—there existed on the part of the
                    chief executive no conservation leadership, then there is room for further comment. It is not enough
                    to observe that "Nevertheless, the Park Service bureaucracy attained its success while
                    operating within the pattern of Republicanism" (p. 142). In such an atmosphere of executive
                    unconcern and laissez faire we can be thankful for men of vision like Stephen Mather and Gifford
                    Pinchot. But, the next moment we must observe the waste of human and monetary resources in the
                    pointless struggle between the forest and park services. Pinchot speaks of forestry and conservation
                    as if he had a monopoly on its concept. Indeed, the words which Pinchot repeatedly stated,
                    "Conservation means the greatest good to the greatest number for the longest time"
                    (p. 7), are a paraphrase of the definition of his theoretician W J McGee. No less wrong, the
                    preservationists speak of conservation as if they alone possessed its wisdom. Conservation is
                    many-sided. Herein lies the difficulty. Thus, it never was a question of exclusiveness. And an
                    interested Republican or Democratic chief executive should embrace a conservation philosophy which
                    includes Gifford Pinchot and Stephen Mather. Furthermore, it is the President's task to
                    make them appreciate the opposite viewpoint and work together for the good of the nation.</p>
            <p>From 1921 to 1933 not only was there uneven bureaucratic leadership, but there were also sporadic
                    attempts by congressional leaders to oppose the Republican chief executives. Professor Swain
                    concludes his interesting and important monograph: "Contrary to widely held opinion, the
                    national conservation program did not deteriorate in the 1920's. It expanded and
                    matured" (p. 170). Yet when the vigorous conservation leadership rendered by the two
                    Roosevelts is recalled, some followers of Clio would be tempted to dwell upon what might have been.</p>

               <hi rend="i">In Search of Peace: The Senate Munitions Inquiry, 1934-36.</hi> By John E. Wiltz. ([<placeName>

            <p>It is a commentary upon the partiality of contemporary observers, upon the eagerness of the mind to
                    believe what it wills to believe, and upon the tendency of writers of general histories to accept
                    widely held subjective judgments as fully and objectively valid that the task of setting the record
                    straight is left to monograph writers of later generations. Thus within the year, Armin Rappaport,
                    for example, revised an all-but-universally-held evaluation of the role of the Navy League; Wayne S.
                    Cole put the career of Senator Gerald P. Nye in proper perspective; and now John E. Wiltz has
                    provided a balanced (but lively) account of the Senate Munitions Inquiry of 1934-1936 which will
                    demand a revision of prevailing historical interpretations in regard to the processes of foreign
                    policy and public opinion formation in the mid-1930's.</p>
            <p>Wiltz traces the origins of the munitions inquiry; he analyzes the varied roles and contributions of
                    its senatorial members and its staff (Stephen Raushenbush, not Alger Hiss, was the crucial staff
                    member); he provides a detailed description of its procedural methods and a summary of its
                    substantive findings; he sets forth those factors and forces which led to its demise; and finally,
                    on the basis of the evidence, he offers an evaluation of its impact both upon public opinion and
                    upon legislation.</p>
            <p>Among his many conclusions the author demonstrates that although the Senate committee set out to dig
                    up proof that during World War I munitions manufacturers had been "merchants of
                    death," it found but scraps of evidence to support its hunch, and that it failed,
                    therefore, "to establish existence of an international munitions conspiracy" (p.
                    98). So also in its investigation of the ship-building industry, of war profiteering, of J. P.
                    Morgan and other financiers—-the evidence would not support a conspiracy interpretation
                    of national and world events. The committee majority, Professor Wiltz concludes, "hoped to
                    persuade Americans that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> should avoid economic ties with countries at war, that it should not become an arsenal
                    for belligerents" (p. 227). But the investigation, he reports, "bore only a minor
                    responsibility in passage of the neutrality laws" (p. 228). It failed to win an effective
                    control of international munitions trade; it failed to secure restrictions upon lobbying; it failed
                    to win means for the control of collusive bidding. It won a few modest achievements—the
                    passage of a loan-credit amendment to the Neutrality Act, for example; it contributed to the
                    establishment of the National Munitions Control Board; its findings made possible a more effective
                    mobilization after 1941. Wiltz concludes, moreover, that the committee's investigations
                    were usually carefully conducted, that witnesses were not hounded or harried, and that the committee
                    was no more guilty of "politics" than is usually the case in such inquiries.</p>
            <p>The book has the ring of truthfulness because it portrays the real complexity of events where once
                    simplicity prevailed. Studies such as <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-060-2-100"/> this demonstrate again
                    the hazards of attempting general overall interpretations of an era (particularly one so close to
                    the present) before the hard, detailed research has been accomplished.</p>

            <p>Of indefinite projection, these are the first eight volumes in the <hi rend="i">Figures
                    Canadiennes</hi> series of paperbacks. Quick digests of salient biographical information about some
                    of the men prominent in Canadian history, apparently for consumption by the layman, the commuter
                    trade, or the student, they range in time from the establishment of New <placeName>

                    </placeName> into the early decades of the present century.</p>
            <p>With one exception, each is concerned with the life, sometimes the life and times, of one man. The
                    exception, <hi rend="i">Les Fougueux Bâtisseurs</hi>, is a series of thumbnail sketches
                    of adventurers who were animated by "une ferveur qui par sa qualité se rapproche
                    de l'enthousiasme presque religieux des compagnons de Roland" (p. 5). They include
                    Charles Le Moyne, colonizer and head of a famous family of sons; Pierre d'Iberville, one of
                    the sons, who merits a place "très particulière" in the
                    history of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and who should have a full scale biography in this series; Louis Hebert,
                    "valeureux apothicaire" and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>'s first farmer; Marc Lescarbot, historian and poet; François Hertel

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> villages; Nicolas Perrot, a voyageur who established "une
                    généreuse entente" with the Indians and left his valuable <hi rend="i">Memoire</hi>; Pierre Boucher, pioneer governor and historian; Pierre Radisson and
                    Médart Groseilliers, fur traders and explorers who ranged over vast areas of the
                    wilderness and who later inspired organization of the Hudson's Bay Company; and Louis
                    Jolliet, "grand voyageur devant l'Éternel."</p>
            <p>There is considerable qualitative difference among these volumes. Those by Serge Fleury and Pierre
                    Benoit are substantially superficial and romanticized. By its very inclusiveness, Fleury's
                    book can hardly do more than skim the surface. Benoit's account of Paul de Chomedey, Sieur
                    de Maisonneuve, founder of Montreal, leaves Maisonneuve still in need of a first-class biography and
                    Montreal of a first-class history.</p>
            <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-060-2-101"/>
            <p>Rosario Bilodeau's <hi rend="i">Cham-plain</hi> and Roger Viau's <hi rend="i">La
                        Salle</hi> are quite respectable and are based upon familiar sources and secondary accounts.
                    They are acceptable reliable introductions to their subjects. Although the lives of John George
                    Lambton (Lord Durham) and Guy Carleton (Lord Dorchester) are still fruitful fields of study for
                    historians, Viau and Benoit, each two timers in the series, have written useful summaries.</p>
            <p>While the makings of a biography on Wilfrid Laurier are perhaps easier to come by than for any other
                    man in these eight volumes, it is disappointing that Raymond Tanghe does not take advantage of this
                    by introducing new information to his readers and by offering his own interpretations of the age of
                    Laurier. Despite this, <hi rend="i">Laurier: Artisan de VUnite Canadienne</hi> is one of the best of
                    the <hi rend="i">Figures Canadiennes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In most respects, <hi rend="i">the</hi> best is the Frontenac biography. Although something is
                    inevitably lost in the process, Franchise de Tilly deserves much credit for this translation of <hi rend="i">Frontenac: The Courtier Governor</hi>, first published in English in 1959. Even though
                    the format of the series does not permit it, it is still regrettable that the documentation and
                    other historical apparatus which William Eccles presented in the English edition could not be
                    included in this one.</p>
            <p>Most of these books serve their purpose fairly well. Except for bringing conformity to the format of
                        <hi rend="i">Figures Canadiennes</hi>, editorial supervision is apparently exercised at a
                    minimum. An extension of editorial scrutiny and standards—with the Tanghe and Eccles
                    contributions as examples—would improve the qualitative tone of the volumes to come.
                    Additions to <hi rend="i">Figures Canadiennes</hi> are awaited with interest. And if perhaps the
                    publishers entertain the idea of an English equivalent, this too would be of merit.</p>

            <p>To researchers in the fields of Latin American and Western American history the Bancroft Library at
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> has long been an academic citadel. In this magnificent library are housed more than
                    four million manuscripts pertaining to the above mentioned fields. An important portion of these
                    manuscripts, together with the largest single collection of printed books (40,000) in these areas,
                    were initially collected by the historian Hubert Howe Bancroft and were sold to the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> in 1905. Since then, especially under the directorships of Herbert Eugene Bolton and,
                    more recently, George P. Hammond, these original collections have been appreciably augmented.</p>
            <p>For the library staff and users alike, these materials have been habitually referred to as the
                    "old" (the original collection) and the "new" collections. Until
                    the publication of the present volume the best and perhaps only complete guide to the
                    "old" manuscripts was in the voluminous footnotes and bibliographical references
                    appearing in Bancroft's <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-060-2-102"/> colossal thirty-nine volume
                    history based upon his own collection. Gradually card catalogues developed, and
                    now—thanks to many devoted members of the staff and especially to the editors of the
                    present volume—there is currently being produced a three-volume guide to the manuscript
                    collections presently housed in the Bancroft Library. The particular volume discussed here, and the
                    first to appear, covers the American West, minus the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> manuscripts. To come are a one-volume guide to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>

                    Central America, and Spanish Colonial America. In preparation for these guides the director relates
                    that the entire classification of the collections was altered in such a way as to bring the
                    "old" and the "new" into proper physical relationship
                    "without loss of identity" of each. For all this the fraternity of Western
                    American scholars owes much thanks to Director <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who possessed the imagination to see what was needed as well as the administrative
                    ability and fortitude necessary to execute this grand design.</p>
            <p>The volume now published is the epitome of simplicity. The various manuscript items or collections
                    are arranged alphabetically by states. The contents of each unit are noted and briefly described.
                    Thus under <placeName>

                    followed by a four- or five-line statement as to the contents of this particular manuscript. When
                    the last of the three volumes appears, George P. Hammond, with the able assistance of Dale L.
                    Morgan, will have achieved a highly laudable goal he set for himself when in 1946 he assumed the
                    directorship: the finding of a way to make the resources of Bancroft Library better known and more
                    readily available to scholars.</p>

                    its usefulness. This letter was made available for publication by Mrs. Fred Deal of La Grange,

                    </placeName>: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1963. Pp. xviii, 347. Notes, maps, charts, tables,
                    illustrations, bibliography, index. $6.50.) This is among the best of the many books that
                    have been published about the Amish. The author was Amish by birth, but his family was later
                    "excommunicated" from the fold. While obtaining his doctorate at Pennsylvania
                    State University and since, Hostetler has studied and written about the Amish. This book gives
                    particular attention to the Amish of Pennsylvania but considers also their settlements in <placeName>

                    interprets Amish religious beliefs, analyzes their society, and describes their family life.
                    Hostetler uses enough of the jargon of the sociologist to indicate his professional status but not
                    enough to spoil his volume for the general reader. Especially interesting is the description of the
                    variety and cleavages which exist within Amish society, the tendency toward revolt among Amish
                    youth, and the manner in which change creeps into Amish life. The description of how one Amish
                    church in Pennsylvania gradually adapted its rules and practices to permit automobiles is intriguing
                    (pp. 298-304). <hi rend="i">Amish Society</hi>, however, is a descriptive scholarly study and not an

                    historical knowledge, they have—as this address by Peckham illustrates—indeed
                    been useful in developing interest in the history and culture of <placeName>

                    connected with the pioneer era and the historic Indians. His <hi rend="i">Song of Metamoris</hi> is
                    a novel of Indian-white relations in the Old Northwest during the early nineteenth century.
                    Metamoris is a legendary chief of the <placeName>

                    of Tecumseh. Supporting characters include William Henry Harrison, John Conner, Little Turtle, and
                    other historical persons of the period. Anness attempts to picture early relations between Indians
                    and whites from the Indian point of view. The author believes that the Indians had the same basic
                    outlook on life, on God, and on nature as had the frontiersmen.</p>

                    </placeName>, Ind.: Lawrence W. Shultz, 1964. Pp. 320. Illustrations. $4.00.) This volume
                    of Indian stories, which first appeared nearly six decades ago, is based both on historical sources
                    and on traditions about the Indians. Despite considerable research on and knowledge of the Indians
                    exhibited by Dunn, the word "true" in the title infers an accuracy not then or
                    even now possible in many items about Indians. The stories are nevertheless interesting, include
                    much that is reliable, and are valuable in introducing students and adults to important
                    personalities and questions concerning Indian history. Dunn's <hi rend="i">True Indian
                        Stories</hi> can be very useful in teaching Indiana history to junior high school students.</p>
