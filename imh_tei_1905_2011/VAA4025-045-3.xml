            <p>History, political theory, and economics were not wholly neglected even in the colonial colleges. But
                    history was chiefly treated as the handmaiden of theology and the Greek and Latin classics, while
                    economic and political matters were dealt with in the courses in moral philosophy and ethics.</p>
            <p>The American Revolution and the experience of constitution-making gave a great impetus to the study
                    of politics. In 1779, Thomas Jefferson was instrumental in bringing about a notable revision of the
                    curriculum of William and Mary College whereby more emphasis was placed upon political studies; by
                    1792 a knowledge of "National Law, Law of Nations, and the general principles of
                    politics" was required for graduation. Other colleges followed this example. In the two
                    succeeding generations the <hi rend="i">Federalist</hi> was listed as a text in many catalogs, and
                    Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu, and the Declaration of Independence were often included in required
                    reading. New books on moral philosophy appeared with an expanded political emphasis. In 1795 a
                    professor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> published a <hi rend="i">Systematic Treatise on Moral Philosophy: Comprehending the Law

                    would "inflame the American youth with a true love for their country."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    by, various new, American-made textbooks. Separate courses in political economy appeared in the
                    early years of American protectionism following the War of 1812. Before the Civil War a speaker at a
                    meeting of the Indiana State Teachers Association (then including at least as many college as
                    public-school teachers) recommended that all Western institutions of collegiate grade provide for
                    the teaching of political economy "on account of the simplicity of its facts and the
                    breadth of its generalizations."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The early textbooks in political economy were notable for the "breadth" of their
                    "generalizations," depending as they did chiefly on deductive reasoning. Something
                    like an inductive process was more likely to be adopted in history because of the availability of
                    more data. Frangois P. G. Guizot's <hi rend="i">History of Civilization</hi>, translated
                    from the French, was the most widely used textbook of this period, and its emphasis on the unity of
                    western culture has had a long-term influence. Textbooks are important because of the dependence at
                    that time on rote learning and the general use of the question-and-answer method of instruction.
                    Some history texts even had the lines of type on each page numbered in the margin so that the exact
                    wording could be assigned for memorizing.</p>
            <p>Students were not expected to use the library, though collections of books were maintained in all
                    colleges for their amusement and amazement. A hundred years ago Indiana University bragged that its
                    library contained five thousand volumes. Students who paid fifty cents a semester were allowed to
                    take out one volume every Saturday. The Wesleyan University library at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName>, had eleven thousand books and was open every Monday and Thursday
                    for half an hour. The Bowdoin library was open three hours a week, the library at Williams, two
                    hours. At the University of <placeName>

                    </placeName> no effort was being made to get new books because the shelves were already crowded.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, despite the fact that the courses in history and the other social studies were few and poorly
                    taught, they seemed so much more practical and more closely related to the world of everyday
                    experience than the traditional classics, mathematics <list type="footnotes">

                    natural sciences. The students showed a surer sense of the probable future trend of educational
                    practice than most educators.</p>
            <p>And many young men got an education in college despite the barriers placed in their way. Francis
                    Parkman was a bit remiss in preparing for and attending his classes at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but his wide reading along the lines of his hobby has made a lasting impression on the
                    record of American historical literature. Many got their education in the social studies chiefly
                    through their preparations for debates and orations at the meetings of the ubiquitous literary
                        societies.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The mid-century saw the rise of college journalism, sponsored
                    often by these same societies, and, therefore, other students entered the fields of the social
                    sciences and of literature through the gateway of journalism.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was high time by the 1870's that more educators got busy and caught up with their
                    students.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in Germany a remarkable group of scholars was developing a more scientific approach to the
                    study of man in society. Most American colleges had treated education as a process of pouring a
                    fixed quantity of eternal truth into the heads of passive (and probably somnolent) youth. These
                    Germans said that, as final truth was not fully known and never would be, higher education should
                    consist of a continuing search for truth—a truth which would be a constantly changing
                    synthesis of critical interpretations of data drawn from the careful observation of original
                    sources. There had long been American scholars and teachers who had a similar conception, but they
                    had refused to take their students into their confidence. Some of them struggled with the problem of
                    truth in the privacy of their studies, but then came forth with a more-or-less reasonable facsimile
                    of a finished product which they insisted their students should accept on authority.</p>
            <p>The German <hi rend="i">Herr Professor</hi> proposed to take his students backstage, right into the

                    tools to be used were: the seminar (a small class of co-operating seekers for truth), the research
                    library, and the formal lecture for the personal presentation of the latest, always-tentative
                    synthesis. To speed the process by cross-fertilization, new discoveries were published in learned
                    journals or as separate monographs, and the migration of students between institutions was
                    encouraged. Essential and most difficult of all was the development of an attitude of unsparing and
                    objective critical realism. In fact, the encouragement of this attitude was in itself a chief end of
                    the new higher education.</p>
            <p>Throughout the mid-century most American college teachers were the products of graduate work in the
                    divinity schools, where they received the best training available in the United States at the time.
                    A scattering had studied abroad, but it was not until after Appomattox and Sedan that the great rush
                    from the United States to the German universities took place. In the last quarter of the century
                    some thousands of American young men drank the beer of Heidelberg, Halle, and Berlin, and some,
                    though by no means all, felt the stimulation of that even headier brew, the new historical

            <p>Wherever they appeared they introduced the formal lecture, a tool so effective in the hands of the
                    scholarly, personable, enthusiastic, and courageous, but so deadly when used by the lazy, the timid,
                    the time-serving, and uninspired. (Some want to abolish it today. This would eliminate some of the
                    worst college teaching—and some of the best.) With them they brought also a professional
                    pride in their rôle as leaders in the battle of civilization against ignorance,
                    provincialism, and obscurantism, a pride which was pitiful and heroic in the era of the rising
                    plutocracy.</p>
            <p>Here and there (particularly if their names happened to be Adams) they gathered together the more
                    promising undergraduates and some graduate students into seminars to participate in the organized
                    search for truth, to learn by doing, to use the "project method" in the field of
                    history and the allied social studies. These men taught facts but, more than that, they taught

                    learning. When Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876, Daniel Coit Gilman, its first president,
                    announced that the main emphasis would be on the training of college graduates by the German methods
                    for careers of research and college teaching.</p>
            <p>Hopkins in its first twenty years fulfilled the most sanguine expectations, transplanting and
                    acclimating German scholarship in the American environment. Here the emphasis was put on the quality
                    of the faculty rather than physical plant; and the institution was thought of as a society of
                    scholars like the universities of the middle ages rather than a campus and buildings. President
                    Gilman assembled a distinguished faculty—in the classics, in mathematics, in natural
                    sciences, and in the social sciences.</p>

                    which came so many of the truly heroic figures in the fields of history, economics, political
                    science, and sociology. Once a week masters and students sat down together around the "long

            <p>There was hardly a figure of any importance among the social scientists of this period, with a few
                    notable exceptions like William Graham Sumner of Yale, who did not hope to find a fulcrum for the
                    lever of Archimedes to move the world. They did not study history for history's sake alone,

                    introduced the brilliant idea of classifying the books according to subject. (For many years <placeName>

                    its woodland setting it had reputedly served as a trysting-place for Jefferson Davis and Sarah Knox

                    citizen of the county, was courting Christopher Wyant's daughter Susan. The two couples,
                    according to the story, often met at the boulder and exchanged greetings and in sentimental memory

                        residence of his son Ralph, near the Highlands, three miles east of the city. … Mr.
                        Donovan leaves two immediate descendants, a son Ralph … and one daughter, Mrs.

                        subject of this sketch as he was always very reticent on the question, especially as to his age.
                        It is known, however that he had long passed the age of ninety and was probably nearing the
                        century mark and was beyond question the oldest man in the county. He came to this place early
                        in the present century and engaged in his trade (tanner) with John Cleves Symmes Harrison, son
                        of President Harrison. He was a great friend of the latter and knew him personally and
                        intimately. Mr. Donovan was city marshal of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Upon reading the marker at the boulder, Miss Kellogg said that this story of Jefferson

            <p>Checking of dates and correspondence with authorities on Taylor, including descendants, showed that
                    many parts of the local legend were erroneous. Known facts were briefly as follows: Taylor was

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, during parts of each year from 1811 to and including 1814, the total period of his
                    residence being about twenty months. He was in and out of Fort Knox, fighting Indians, visiting his
                    family in <placeName>

            <p>The Peck and Davis letters would seem to settle once and for all the question of Jefferson Davis,
                    Sarah Knox Taylor and the boulder. They did not "occupy it as a seat," as Mrs.
                    Peck delicately puts it. She herself may have lost interest in the matter as on the reverse side of
                    the letter is written a recipe for "cucumber ragout." Is it to the recipe or to
                    the fame of Jefferson Davis that the preservation of the letter is due?</p>
            <p>Mrs. Peck's letter raises several questions, first of all as to her identity. She claimed

                            House Regent of the Confederate Museum, who had supplied the typed copy of Mrs.
                            Peck's letter. She wrote in reply: "Not any of the letter you have seems
                            to have been written by Mr. Davis. In his latter years he seemed to have depended on Mrs.
                            Davis and Miss Winnie Davis or Mrs. Dorsey to do his writing. Mrs. Davis, as she grew older,
                            wrote more and more like her husband, and some of her handwriting looks almost identically
                            like his. … I do not think you need have any doubt about your letter being from
                            Mr. Davis since we, have the original one of which yours is the answer, and the handwriting
                            is the same as some of the other letters from Mr. Davis in his last years."</item>

                    on her ancestry, recalling that she lived very quietly with her son and four grandsons. There must
                    have been some fairly close connection with the Donovans as Mrs. Peck was one of the witnesses to

            <p>The deed is for "That certain lot and parcel of land whereon Benjamin Parke hath erected a

                    less." This deed was acknowledged by Harrison before William Polke.</p>
            <p>In 1902, the Parke-Wise property was purchased for a lumber yard and the <hi rend="i">Daily Sun</hi>
                    carried an article on the history of the property.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The house was described as
                    a landmark older by one year than the State of Indiana, as Judge Parke bought the land from Harrison
                    in 1815. The writer based his article on the deed record given above but did not indicate why he
                    placed the purchase in the year 1815 instead of 1816, the year of the deed. No mention was made of
                    occupancy by Taylor and his family.</p>
            <p>At first glance it seems strange that Parke should have built his house before obtaining title to the
                    land. On March 18, 1815, however, he was given Power of Attorney by Harrison to buy and sell
                        land.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> He and Harrison were the best of friends and they probably arranged
                    the purchase by letter, agreeing that the deed be executed upon Harrison's next coming to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The house was presumably not ready for occupancy even after the land was made over to
                    Parke, as in July of 1816 he was living in the Harrison Mansion itself.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The history of this Parke property effectively disposes of it as a place of residence for the
                    Taylors. It did not exist in 1814.</p>

                    from the reticent Jeremiah, and with the ending of that hope, decided to consult the one living
                    principal of the legend.</p>
            <p>The boulder itself is something of a rarity in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. One other, of comparable size, which was found deep in a gravel pit about forty years
                    ago, has been moved three times as its owner has changed his residence.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
                    Several persons have offered to buy it, testimony to its status as a "curiosity."
                    The owner estimates its weight at six or seven hundred pounds. When it was found, gravel was
                    shoveled out by hand. With present methods of obtaining gravel, boulders, if present, would sink
                    unseen to the bottom of the water in the pits. The writer, in many journeyings about the county, has
                    never seen stray boulders such as sometimes occur in considerable numbers farther north in the
                    state. The Donovan boulder may be one of the so-called "erratics," such as are
                    sometimes found as far south as <placeName>

                    several versions varies, giving Taylor's non-existent farm, the woods in the neighborhood
                    of the Highlands, or merely an inviting woods.</p>
            <p>A specimen chipped from the boulder was sent to the Department of Geology of Indiana University for
                    expert identification. The reply gave the expected verdict: a granite boulder of glacial origin.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> The stone has weathered slightly on the top, but, barring accidents, is due
                    for a long life in its present location. Souvenir hunters have left it intact; after all, the
                    average tourist does not carry a geological hammer in his hand.</p>
            <p>The lot where the boulder now rests was not the property of Donovan but of his wife. She acquired it
                    by deed in 1851<hi rend="sup">55</hi> and bequeathed it to her daughter Ellen with the proviso that

                    </placeName> in charge of a trading post at the south bend of the <geogName>St. Joseph
                    River</geogName>. He must have been successful in his dealings at the post since four years later,
                    he was rewarded with a partnership in the <placeName>

                    when the end of the partnership was announced in the local newspaper, the notice stated that Taylor
                    would settle the affairs of the firm.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> There was no indication, however, that he
                    would profit by collecting unpaid accounts of the previous store, as had been the case at the
                    beginning of the partnership. In the same year, Taylor began independent operations. His first years
                    were a struggle for survival because of the panic of 1837 which was a dominant factor in the eleven
                    years of Taylor's soie ownership.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Early in the spring of 1838 in a letter to Hanna, Taylor gave a good summary of business conditions
                    during the past winter. The letter indicated the difficulties Taylor had encountered, the efforts he
                    was making to keep in business, and his reliance upon Hanna who was president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> bank. Taylor was fortunate to have a brother-in-law to whom he could
                    say—"attend to my business." The letter also shows that Hanna retained
                    his interest in the sale of town lots in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The growth of the town, however, had been temporarily halted because only two lots had
                    been sold during the year.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Letters to Hanna always gave evidence of confidence
                    and deference. Since the panic had allowed collections of credit extensions through notes and charge
                    accounts, and the currency in circulation was usually unsound, except for local distribution, it was
                    important to have someone who could be depended on to secure drafts, notes, or currency which would
                    be accepted where Taylor's accounts were due. Then too, it was necessary to rely on friends
                    to t<hi rend="sup">r</hi>ansact business for him when transmitting money because there was no
                    reliable, fast communication or transportation system. A merchant who did business on a large scale
                    could not possibly take care of all transactions and operate his own store without assistance.
                    Taylor also performed services for his friends when he traveled on business.</p>
            <p>That Taylor was a necessary part of any financial movement in the local community is evidenced by the

            <p>In a letter to Caleb Shearon of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, written in May, 1838, Taylor gave some interesting facts about his fur
                    business. He was trying to find a market for sixty thousand muskrat skins at seventeen cents each in
                    order to receive some funds. The letter stated that if the skins were hauled to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>

                    </placeName> by his own team, they might produce good money at eighteen cents each. He closed the
                    letter by stating that he had already sent his father-in-law, Peter Johnson, with a load of
                    forty-nine hundred prime muskrat skins from the Kankakee.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> It was apparently
                    necessary to find new markets, and Taylor was casting about for them rather than accepting prices
                    offered by the American Fur Company or other fur houses. His initiative in using the new <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Road to seek better markets may explain why he survived the panic.</p>
            <p>Another matter which gave Taylor some concern with respect to his business was the removal of the
                    Indians in the fall of 1838.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> He was sure that his fur business as well as
                    Indian trade would suffer, but there was some likelihood that the white trade and real estate
                    ventures would increase. Unfortunately the pages in his letter book for that period were cut out, as
                    were numerous pages written at the time of other important events, and it is difficult to give an
                    account of the business at that time.</p>
            <p>The year 1838, however, ended on a hopeful note. Taylor wrote his brother, Horace B. Taylor of <placeName>

            <p>In April of the following year, Pitts Taylor, his brother and clerk, returned from the Kankakee where
                    he did not do much business and had found few Indians. At this time Taylor had on hand seven
                    thousand muskrat skins, five hundred raccoon skins, and a few other skins. While he had sold
                    $5,450.25 worth of furs to Brewster and the American Fur Company through Coquillard in
                    May, only $2,527 of the above amount was paid in cash, the balance was in notes.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because of conditions, Taylor made his business connections with Brewster the basis for an
                    interesting series of maneuvers during the winter of 1839. He first asked for an advance of cash on
                    his expected winter's catch by requesting one thousand dollars in November and another
                    similar amount on January 15, 1840. Brewster, however, did not agree to such an arrangement until
                    December. Taylor promised the furs in the spring. The latter explained that the Ewings of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> had promised him good prices, but since he had been dealing with Brewster for some time
                    and did not like the Ewings too well, he preferred to sell his furs to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> firm.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Yet, Taylor wrote the Ewing and Walker Company at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> that he might do business with them at his own prices and had about one thousand
                    raccoon skins and two hundred deer skins on hand. Two days later, however, he wrote Brewster again,
                    that the Ewings were trying to get in on the fur catches since the latter could only get
                    white-handled furs, which were inferior. He, therefore, was sending approximately three thousand
                    dollars in trade goods to the Kankakee where furs were plentiful, but the Indians were scarce.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taylor then sent instructions to his clerk, Thomas S. Stanfield, who was at law school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, that he was to meet the furs already sent to <placeName>

                    sold at eighteen cents apiece, Taylor would refund the advance and clear a profit on the price given

                    success or failures.</p>
            <p>Since Pitts Taylor had not been successful on the Kankakee the previous winter, Pierre F. Navarre, an
                    Indian trader, was outfitted in the fall of 1839. He restocked twice that winter for a total of
                    $1,641.95 in trade goods. A note was added in the sales book, "Navarre selling
                    the goods to the Pottawatomies. To account to Taylor for the goods at stated prices, but selling
                    them at his own discretion for his profit."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Taylor was primarily interested in his business, he did show some
                    interest in politics. This was particularly true in 1840, which was a presidential campaign year,
                    when a <placeName>

            <p>His association with the Whig party was possibly dictated by his experience with the financial

                    many notices of sheriff's sales, foreclosures, and changes of mercantile establishments
                    between 1838 and 1840. Taylor too was concerned about the debts and inserted a "Pay
                    Up" notice in the local newspaper in August. It read: "All persons indebted to me,
                    by note or book account, are requested to make immediate payment—my circumstances will
                    not warrant me in giving further indulgence."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>Taylor also was directly concerned when General William B. Mitchell was sent to examine Indian claims

                    now twice that amount. His assets also showed quite an increase. They had been
                    $18,-420.83 in 1835 and were now $32,539.75. While he had accumulated debts,
                    he also had acquired property, of which real estate was the largest single item. It is especially
                    noteworthy that the book accounts and notes were reduced in amount. The judgments which had been

                    the 1840's.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Then too, there was to be a factional contest for a
                    director in this bank in October, 1841, and Taylor asked Hanna's assistance in getting a
                    Dr. Thompson's proxy.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Taylor had reason for concern since he had sent
                    a draft to Robert Hyslop and Soil in <placeName>

                    The situation became worse in November when the State Bank of Indiana withdrew permission for the
                    twelfth branch to loan money or discount for three months. There may have been an infraction of the
                    charter. This tended to freeze money in <placeName>

                    obtain for his brother Pitts. The latter was prepared for the pork-packing season but was now unable
                    to secure cash to buy the farmers' pork.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>

            <p>Probably to improve his financial status, Navarre took an outfit to the Kankakee that winter stocked
                    with $1,421.65 in goods and charged to collect $1,542.20 in Indian accounts.
                    In April, 1842, he returned with $286.06 of unsold goods, $231.87 in collected
                    accounts, and furs worth $997.57.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> There were Indians on the

            <p>Since Taylor's Letters and Orders ended in 1841 and there were no newspaper files available
                    for the period from 1842 to 1845, there is little information 011 his activities for this period.
                    The Sales Book and the Indian accounts, Ledgers B and C, contain only a small amount of data on his
                    fur trade.</p>

                    outfit. He took goods worth twenty-one hundred dollars to the Kankakee in the fall of 1844.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> There is no record of his return. Taylor assumed more risk for his
                    outfit's failure in this case, but if it was successful his profits were all his own.</p>
            <p>That Taylor was anxious to improve his finances is further indicated by the insertion of a
                    "Look Out" advertisement and an ad for furs in the winter of 1845.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> The "Look Out" notice was a boxed advertisement that debtors must pay
                    or face legal action. It was not as preemptory, however, as an earlier "Pay Up"

            <p>In December, 1846, the railroad question again came into the foreground. At a public meeting a

            </p>
            <p>While other interests occasionally diverted Taylor's mind from the fur business, it was,
                    however, the most important activity in which he engaged. In May, 1846, two outfits led by Bertrand
                    and Chris Wolf returned from the fur ground with the season's catch, which amounted to
                    $2,370.24 worth of furs.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> The following spring Bertrand bought furs
                    from Taylor for which he paid $1,099.51.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> This was a departure from
                    previous years, for Bertrand had formerly been in Taylor's employ. A list of the fur shows
                    that mink skins had become a staple article while the number of muskrat was small in comparison with
                    the catches of previous years. This was probably not the season's catch, but the only
                    transaction recorded. Muskrat were still the staple article of the trade, and deer skins were still
                    taken in quantities.</p>

            <p>This was the last transaction which was recorded for the L. M. Taylor store. A "Sold

                        bills.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> The next week Pitts Taylor advertised his start in L. M.
                    Taylor's store location. He had just bought the entire stock, and "will not be
                    undersold." His goods were brought by the railroad.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> He had previously
                    clerked for his brother and engaged in the pork-packing business. There is no record of the reasons
                    for this change. L. M. Taylor continued to buy and sell goods, especially furs, but there is no
                    mention of his location. He may have used a part of his old store for headquarters and storage or a
                    part of his home located where the Wyman store now stands.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>

            <p>The period from 1836 to 1847 was the most strenuous of L. M. Taylor's career. The factor
                    which conditioned most of his business affairs was the panic of 1837. Because hc was able to avoid
                    bankruptcy and expand during the panic, his financial condition was firm in the 1840's.
                    During the following decade, his interests shifted from Indian trade to white trade. He also became
                    vitally concerned with internal improvements and real estate. This period also saw his gradual
                    retirement from numerous public offices, though he continued to remain active in civic affairs.</p>

                    something of the spirit of the writers was pictured in these remarks and because the pleasant and

            <p>In his arguments for the immortality of the soul, Cicero polished off the subject with a kind of
                    afterthought of startling modernity—unique, so far as I know, in classical philosophy.
                    "No one," said he, "has ever been able to persuade me that the memory of
                    great men and their achievements would endure so long were they not themselves still alive and
                    active in promoting it." As Cicero saw it, the souls of the distinguished dead spend their
                    long Elysian hours promoting their publicity and watching their political fences.</p>
            <p>There is considerable evidence of a circumstantial nature to support his thesis. At any rate, there
                    is every reason to suspect that the successful "Great Books" movement originated
                    not in this world, as is generally believed, but in the celestial state of bliss known as Elysium;
                    moreover, that it was the result of a conspiracy on the part of a group of bitter
                    immortals—like as not led by the shades of Plato and Aristotle—who, for the
                    past thirty years and more, have <list type="footnotes">

                    ever-increasing decline of the reputations they left behind. Nor is it possible to account for the
                    general awareness of the biographical fact that this year marks the bicentennial of
                    Goethe's birth without suspecting that the ghost of Frankfurt's Wunderkind had a
                    hand in peddling the news.</p>
            <p>And except for one conflicting fact, there is reason, too, to suspect that the group of Hoosier
                    immortals we celebrate tonight not only conceived but actually abetted the plans of this sumptious
                    testimonial dinner. The damaging evidence, in this case, comes by way of the rather obvious
                    discovery that had Charles Major been a party to such a plot he most certainly would have picked a
                    more articulate booster than me to handle his publicity. There is nothing I can say to increase the
                    stature of Charles Major. His place among the immortals is assured. I share a secret concerning two
                    and, possibly, three collaborators, however, without whose help the novel-writing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName> lawyer never could have attained the purple heights. And knowing what I do about the
                    generous side of his nature—to say nothing of the Ciceronian concept—I feel
                    fairly certain that Major would want me to give the story the widest possible circulation. An
                    occasion such as this appears to be designed for the purpose. One of the collaborators was Lee Burns
                    who, thank Heaven, is still with us. The other one was John J. Curtis of blessed memory. As for the
                    third, his identity will emerge as the plot develops.</p>
            <p>Fifty years ago the Bowen-Merrill people had Mr. Burns out on the road selling law books. He covered
                    the entire state and, in the course of his professional perambulations, got to know every reputable
                    lawyer including Charles Major of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was on one of these occasions that the youthful book agent attempted to sell the
                    seasoned lawyer the choicest item of his distinguished line. Major declined in a voice that Mr.
                    Burns recognized as final.</p>
            <p>A situation such as this called for savoir-faire, a God-given gift of which Mr. Burns had, and still
                    has, plenty; enough, indeed to equip a dozen men. Thus by dint of playing his cards right, Mr. Burns
                    learned that Major had written a novel in his spare time. What's more, that he had
                    submitted it to Harpers who wanted no part of it. The dejected lawyer wondered whether it was worth
                    while to let the Bowen-Merrill people have a look at it.</p>
            <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-045-3-051"/>
            <p>When Mr. Burns returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he dumped the Major manuscript into the lap of John J. Curtis who, at that time, ran
                    the publishing end of the Bowen-Merrill Company, a department then still in its infancy. For some
                    reason, Curtis was too busy to read the manuscript right away. And so it came to pass that Mr.
                    Burns' intellectual curiosity got the better of him; thus establishing the first point I
                    want to make—namely, that Mr. Burns was the first in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and possibly anywhere in the world outside of Major's immediate family, to
                    read the novel in manuscript form. I deliberately dismiss the Harper people because of the highly
                    probable fact that they never took the trouble to unwrap the manuscript, a not unreasonable
                    conjecture when one reflects that Harpers had all they could do at the time supplying the demand for
                    a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> lawyer's best seller.</p>
            <p>Eventually, however, Curtis got around to reading the manuscript, too. He liked it as well as Mr.
                    Burns did. All except the title. The more he thought of "Charlie Brandon, Duke of
                    Suffolk" as the name of a gripping love story with the colorful background of the sixteenth
                    century, the more it got on his nerves. And there's no telling what might have happened to
                    Major's manuscript—or, indeed, to Curtis' nerves—had not an
                    eighteenth century poet continued to get into the act. Anyway, one night preparatory to going to
                    bed, Curtis picked up Leigh Hunt's "The Gentle Armour" when suddenly, not
                    unlike the behavior of a well-greased Jack-in-the-Box, two exquisite lines leaped from the page:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"There lived a knight, when knighthood was in flower, Who charmed alike the tiltyard
                            and the bower."</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>Which leaves me only to account for the singular circumstance that moved Curtis to pick up Leigh
                    Hunt's poem at that precise moment. Obviously it was an act inspired from above by an
                    almost forgotten English poet who, in 1898, after an Elysian residence of almost forty years, had
                    watched his reputation slipping; to such an alarming degree, indeed, that he set out to do something
                    about it—thus confirming the soundness of Cicero's argument for the immortality
                    of the soul.</p>

            <p>In a group such as this there is little need to discuss Booth Tarkington as a writer. While all of
                    his work is not of uniform quality, he did create some characters, Penrod, Alice Adams, The Man from
                    Home, who have taken their places as immortals of English literature on the level with Tom Jones,
                    Pickwick, Micawber, Becky Sharpe, Sherlock Holmes, and the host of imaginary characters who are more
                    real to many of us than most of our personal acquaintances.</p>
            <p>That is an accomplishment of the first order and places Tarkington in the forefront of the host of
                    Hoosier writers who are enshrined in the bibliography just published.</p>
            <p>But I should like to pause for a few brief moments to speak of Booth Tarkington as a man, a
                    personality, who until just the other day was still among us and enjoying to the very end the
                    various interests with which he enriched his life aside from writing. For his was a rich
                    personality, of high spirits and of a lively, humorous fancy. He loved life. He loved good company.
                    He loved luxury and lived in the grand style.</p>
            <p>At the peak of his powers, from 1910 to 1930, when his books were best sellers and he had hits
                    playing on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he made and spent large sums. He is still remembered in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> at the Lambs Club and other gathering places of old writers and artists and actors as
                    the intimate of John Barrymore and James Montgomery Flagg and some of the greatest playboys of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was full of fun and was ready for a frolic at the drop of a hat. He loved life and
                    lived hard and was a gay spirit. His friends were legion, and his cheerful, happy nature endeared
                    him to all of us.</p>
            <p>In later life he collected beautiful objects of all sorts—paintings, porcelains, and
                    fabrics. He maintained a magnificent estate at Kennebunkport, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>, which he filled with things of rare beauty. He loved his garden, although he knew
                    nothing of horticulture. His wife tells how he would walk about the grounds with his trained
                    gardener and say "I want some red there—some heliotrope—some blues
                    there." It was <list type="footnotes">

                    gorgeous and suited his exacting tastes.</p>
            <p>He worked each day almost to the end dictating rapidly to his secretary. He preferred this to
                    changing his way of life and living more restfully and modestly. He preferred to work and spend and
                    if the quality of his labor output was not up to his best, the quality of his personality never
                    deteriorated. At seventy he had not yet passed the age of laughter and adventure.</p>
            <p>He had a great life and he enjoyed every minute of it. And so I give you Booth Tarkington, the
                    aesthete, the bon vivant of all of our writers. He was a connoisseur of life.</p>

            <p>Here is a toast to George Ade first because he on June 9, 1887, predicted that "the hub of

                    </placeName>, Indiana." This prediction was made in a student valedictory at Purdue at the
                    end of a stay there of which it has been said: No other college could have done this man less harm.
                    And we toast him next because he went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the nineties and looked upon that fierce and dazzling city as only a newspaper
                    reporter can. He saw what Lincoln Steffens saw and Upton Sinclair saw but he left for us pictures of
                    it not as a muckracker but as an average person had to see it, compelled to live there day after day
                    and pushed to get some laughter and jokes out of life. We today know we toast the Fables in Slang
                    for their social commentary as well as their concealed art. But our country boy himself went from

            <p>Our Kin Hubbard was born Frank McKinney Hubbard at Bellefontaine, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, September 1, 1868, and died in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, December 26, 1930. He came to the <hi rend="i">News</hi> in 1891 as a chalk plate
                    artist and became a caricaturist. His cracks attributed to a lanky rustic began to appear in the <hi rend="i">News</hi> December 31, 1904. Mixing sketches and lines produced laughs and led to his
                    permanent assignment to keep his character, whom he called Abe Martin, going. His signature on his
                    drawings was "Hub" which he made with six vertical lines which could not be read
                    as spelling anything. Thus Hubbard became Abe Martin.</p>
            <p>On the jacket of Hubbard's 1929 annual Christmas book is this writing by 0. O. McIntyre:
                    "Will Rogers, who is no slouch of a wit himself, once told me: ‘Kin is the
                    funniest man in America.’ I'll take in a little more territory. … Kin
                    is the ‘funniest guy in the world.’"</p>
            <p>Most of Kin's cracks were in the form of personals as written by country editors. But he
                    ranged as whimsy and the passing scene caught him up. He said humor is not what you say, but what
                    you nearly say.</p>
            <p>Twenty and more years ago he was saying about the automobile: " ‘I did want
                    t’ live to see President Hoover drive poverty from our land, but I reckon I'll
                    have t’ miss it,’ said Gran'maw Pash after tryin’ to cross
                    the street."</p>

            <p>I propose we drink to the honor or salvation, as you choose, of the man who made Kinsey possible;
                    whose father, the child, grew up on the other side of the tracks and resented it bitterly; the black
                    sheep among Indiana's authors, the prodigal son who never came home; the greatest American
                    novelist of all, a voice crying in the wilderness—or, a mere reporter and a bad one, with
                    no sense of shame, whose shocking frankness gave hypocrisy the tinge of virtue. Whatever the
                    judgment, the fact remains he assisted powerfully in changing the course of this country's
                    literature. He <list type="footnotes">

                    they see fit, despite would-be censors. He gave the censors battle, and he gave then cause. Never at
                    peace with the world or himself, this man was full of conflicts and contradictions. He believed that
                    most lives are failures and that human beings are powerless to change their destinies; yet he became
                    a worker for social reform. He was a free-thinking individualist, yet he joined the Communist party
                    and believed Stalin was a truly spiritual person. This most controversial of Indiana writers once
                    wrote: "In short, I catch no meaning from all I have seen, and pass quite as I came,
                    confused and dismayed." To his more discriminating followers, he was a brooding, clumsy,
                    earthbound giant, of little talent but much genius.</p>

                    </placeName> boy there was an atmosphere of real veneration for the great writers of Indiana,
                    particularly for General Wallace and for Maurice Thompson. About these men, there were many things
                    wonderful to a boyish mind. The one thing that seemed most amazing was that a great national weekly
                    magazine of opinion, published in <placeName>

                    Bostonian, but a man living along with the rest of us in our own Indiana county seat. That still
                    seems rather wonderful.</p>
            <p>When Hoosier Mosaics came out, in the middle seventies, an alarmed Eastern reviewer exclaimed,
                    "Here comes another Goth from the other side of the mountains!" And he went on to
                    deplore the injury done to American literature by the low-ness of tone, the hopeless vulgarity of
                    Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Eggleston,—and now this newcomer. The reputations of the other
                    Goths have taken care of themselves very well. And as for Thompson, within a few years after Hoosier
                    Mosaics he was supplying the publishers of books and magazines with novels and short stories,
                    essays, and poems, as carefully finished, as urbane, as anything that was being produced in the
                    East; and he was criticizing other men's books with what was everywhere recognized to be
                    keen perception, sure taste, dependable judgment.</p>
            <p>He began to write when it was the general belief that to be a Hoosier was to be a Barbarian and a
                    Yokel. He had a great deal to do with changing that belief. In this he did us all a service, and it
                    is with gratitude for that service in mind, that I give you—Maurice Thompson.</p>

                    Indiana Volunteers on September 10, 1861. Seventeen months later he was promoted to captain which

                    Company E were captured at the Battle of Elk River. The prisoners were marched through Moulton to <placeName>

            <p>The significance of the diary lies in its portrayal of conditions in Confederate prisons in which
                    Hughes was confined. There are also many passages referring to the beauty of some of the Southern
                    towns. Then too, Hughes apparently was impressed with the vegetation in Dixie and often commented
                    upon it.</p>

            <p>The circumstances surrounding the removal of a great part of the Potawatomi Indians from Indiana in
                    1838 caused much hardship and suffering among them.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> At the outset there were
                    those who because of sickness were unable to accompany the emigration. During the first two weeks of
                    the trek westward several were sent back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, to recuperate and to await a future emigration.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Captain Jacob Hull, who had been appointed assistant conductor of the Potawatomi emigration of 1838
                    to succeed Luther Rice, was placed in charge of the small detachment that remained in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the numbers of which were soon augmented by stragglers from the main emigrating
                        party.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> About three weeks after the main emigrating party left, Hull started

                        <p rend="center">EARLY HISTORY OF INDIANA</p>
                        <p>A citizen of Indiana is engaged in the task of preparing for the press a historical work,
                            entitled "Early Days in Indiana,"—The time over which the work
                            is designed to extend includes a period of nearly one hundred and twenty
                            years—beginning with the early settlements of the French in the valley of the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="county">Wabash</region>
                            </placeName>, and ending with the conclusion of the Territorial Government of Indiana. The
                            nature of the task demands much time and untiring research; and when completed, it will not
                            form, of itself, a complete history, but "it will furnish to the future historian,
                            the materials upon which he may work, and without which (or a similar collection) all his
                            efforts and his talents will be spent in vain."</p>
                        <p>The toil and the perplexity which must be endured in collecting facts, have often
                            disheartened historians in the path of their duties. "Those" says the
                            learned D'Israeli, "who have grasped at early celebrity, have too often
                            been satisfied if they give a NEW FORM to History, without having contributed any thing new
                            to the MATTER." It is recorded that when Pere Daniel undertook a history of France,
                            the King's Librarian opened for his inspection an immense treasure of charters, and
                            another of Royal autograph letters and another of private
                            correspondence—treasures reposing in fourteen hundred folios! The historian
                            passed two hours impatiently looking over them. He became frightened at the mass before him,
                            and very civilly told the Librarian that he could "write a very READABLE history
                            without the aid of the old paper rubbish." He wrote a history of France,
                            remarkable, principally, for the many blunders which it contains. A similar circumstance has
                            been told of a modern historian, who, on receiving a volume of old manuscript letters said,
                            that "what was already printed, was more than he was able to read."</p>
                        <p>As the state grows older, and the arts and sciences advance, its early history will attain a
                            high degree of interest. The people who, in a century from this time, shall look back upon
                            the period in which we now live, will be anxious to learn every thing relating to the
                            physical character of the state—the manners and customs of the
                            citizens—the state of morals, and the political principles which govern the mass
                            of the people in the present day. A learned author has said that time will make the present
                            age as obsolete as the last. "Those who come after us will cast a new light over
                            the ambiguous scenes which are now around us. They will know how some things happened, for
                            which we cannot account. They will bear witness to how many characters we have mistaken.
                            They will be told many of the secrets which our cotemporaries [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] hide
                            from us. They will read the perfect story of <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-045-3-075"/> man, which
                            can never be told while it is proceeding. All this is the possession of posterity because
                            they will judge without our passions and without our prejudice.</p>
                        <p>If our history is to be regarded with feelings of interest, by those who are to come after
                            us, shall we not value the history of those who have gone before us? The manners and
                            customs, and the toils and dangers that marked the character, and attended the pursuits of
                            the pioneers of Indiana, are passing away, if they have not already vanished, and those who
                            now wish to share in the excitement and danger of a frontier life, must travel far towards
                            the setting sun.</p>
                        <p>Many interesting facts, connected with the early settlement of Indiana, have been perverted,
                            or lost for ever, because they were never recorded, and the stream of tradition seldom bears
                            to the present, faithfully, the history of the past.</p>

                    for each county in Indiana. The booklets will contain the names of all Hoosiers in the military

                    paragraph of information of the deceased, including names of parents or next-of-kin, time and place
                    of birth, residence, military history, decorations, place and circumstances of death, and place of
                    burial for each individual so far as it could be obtained. Since the booklets will vary in size, the
                    price will range from twenty-five cents upwards. To date two Honor Rolls have been

            <p>When a group of editors begin such a task as is represented in <hi rend="i">Indiana Authors and Their
                        Books</hi>, they must, if they would perserve their sanity, decide early on the intent of the
                    work. Is it to satisfy an immediate or a distant need? If the former, though the labor still remains
                    stupendous, some difficulties are at once eliminated. The compilers absolve themselves of long,
                    detailed research on individual authors, forego critical evaluation, and concentrate on identifying
                    writers with a place, on sifting biographical materials for facts, and on selecting and putting
                    these facts in order. The editors of <hi rend="i">Indiana Authors</hi> make but slight claim to
                    originality and none <hi rend="i">to</hi> completeness. They frankly say that what they do is a
                    start, that what they provide is but the encloser of things to be. They might claim that here in
                    embryo are critical studies of the future. As they are aware, they have missed some names and titles
                    which will gradually be added. I think, for instance, of Charles O. Thompson, who left in pamphlet
                    form his inaugural address <hi rend="i">The Modern Polytechnic School</hi> at his induction as
                    president of the Rose Polytechnic Institute on March 9, 1883. There are others: John P. Pettit, <hi rend="i">Restoration of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> of Hendricks County, who did a work, I believe, on his visit to the Holy Land, and
                    Ambrose Bierce, educated in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> schools and remembered for his hair-raising tales, for his services as a soldier in the
                    Civil War, and for his sudden, mysterious disappearance. To the bibliography of Robert Dale Owen may
                    be added <hi rend="i">Darby and Susan: a Tale of <placeName>
                            <region>New England</region>

                    Vorhees, <hi rend="i">The Farragut Statute</hi>, Washington, 1881.</p>
            <p>The values of <hi rend="i">Indiana Authors</hi> can hardly be estimated. The most obvious is the
                    factual knowledge given of more than nine hundred writers who have been associated with Indiana <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-045-3-078"/> life and thought. This value is not to be minimized. Ask any
                    grade or high-school teacher, any member of a literary club, any librarian. Names of authors are set
                    out for him here in alphabetical order without regard to essential worth. Edward Danville Wright and
                    the Bard of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alamo</settlement>
                    </placeName> have their niches just as do the internationally known poet, editor, and literary
                    historian William Vaughn Moody and the critic of Elizabethan poetry Felix Schelling. Perhaps a fault
                    of the work is that in a few instances performers occupy space out of proportion to their
                    achievement. With the name is information about the relationship of the author to the
                    state—whether he is native or adopted, some account of his life, and a list of his
                    publications.</p>
            <p>Another value of the book lies in the sheer interest stimulated by bits of surprising information
                    appearing in the biographies—some of it serious, some light. How many of us Hoosiers have
                    known, for instance, that Dr. John Shaw Billings was one of our products? that the creator of Elsie
                    Dins-more was educated in the state? that we have sent out a dozen historians to achieve national
                    and international reputations with their research? that we supplied some capable militant leaders to
                    the Woman's Rights Movement? that <hi rend="i">Hoosier Mosaics</hi>, by Maurice Thompson,
                    is a set of fascinating stories with settings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Colfax, Jamestown, and other cities and villages which we are not accustomed to think
                    of as hubs of fictional plots? that Robert Louis Stevenson had a stepdaughter who is listed as an
                    Indiana writer? Other gems may be uncovered. John McGovern, Hoosier, appeared as a literary expert
                    in the plagiarism case of S. E. Gross against Edmund Rostand concerning <hi rend="i">Cyrano de
                        Bergerac</hi> and helped the plaintiff to win. From our borders went Charles Denby to supply a
                    name for a one-time five-cent cigar. And one thumbing through the book pauses at the possibilities
                    afforded by the inaugural addresses of presidents of Indiana colleges; for the fact that Joseph
                    Tuttle, as he was taking over at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> in 1862, attacked Carlyle's <hi rend="i">Heroes and Hero Worship</hi>,
                    suggests that in these speeches live coals linger which, by some researcher, may be blown to flame.</p>
            <p>There is bibliographical value, too, in the work. Items of all sorts attract the curious and alert
                    eye. One is aware of the inception here of bibliographies on Hoosier journalism, schools and
                    education, government, the state's response to <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-045-3-079"/> the
                    Civil War, art, wild life, secret orders, county history, state history, state parks, rivers and
                    other geological phenomena, and religious life. The importance of the last to Indianians of the
                    century is attested by the number of clerical writers. Of the first 142 entries almost twenty per
                    cent are concerned with church or creed or interpretation of the Scriptures. And the Mormons must
                    have been aware of Hoosier literary lashings long after they had passed the state on their trek
                    west.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the chief value of <hi rend="i">Indiana Authors</hi> rests in its latent possibilities. The
                    promise of the book begins already to be fulfilled, for James Whitcomb Riley and for George Ade
                    excellent bibliographies have been prepared, and for the former a critical biography is announced in
                    the series of studies which includes the names of Hawthorne and Thoreau. The book in front of us is
                    a mine from which additional rich ore will come—perhaps, at length, a cultural history of
                    the state. And the work so ably done by Mr. J. K. Lilly, Jr., Mr. R. E. Banta, and others will
                    surely be a stimulus to other states to examine and publish accounts of their literary resources.</p>

            <p>The landholdings of the French and of the early American frontiersmen in and about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> were in a state of confusion for many years. Although the territorial and land-office
                    officials brought order to the titles, an adequate study has not previously made the subject clear
                    for students of history. This pamphlet does present an orderly account of the subject.</p>
            <p>The French had been careless about their land titles and generous about making grants to Americans
                    who came to live among them. Congress, however, in response to their petitions adopted an act in
                    1791 which promised four hundred acres of land to heads of families who were residents in 1783 and
                    to such persons who had received grants from the various <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-045-3-080"/>
                    commandants and who had given evidence by making improvements that they considered the donation to
                    have been bona fide. One hundred acres were to be given to each militia man of 1790 if he had not
                    received another allotment.</p>
            <p>Winthrop Sargent, Secretary of the Northwest Territory, investigated the claims at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1790–2791 and in 1797–1798. He confirmed many of the claims
                    and these were surveyed, but the government did not issue patents of title. When the land office was
                    established at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1804, it became the duty of the officials to complete the investigation of claims.
                    They made two reports in 1806 which completed their work. The land of the later confirmations was
                    then surveyed and patents issued for all grants approved.</p>
            <p>Most of the land had passed into American ownership by the time the investigations were complete.
                    This included 313 of 415 tracts given by French and British governors, 242 of 264 of the 400
                    acre-donation tracts, and 201 of 235 militia grants. Francis Vigo bought 101 of the 400 acre tracts.</p>
            <p>The author erred when he wrote that Governor Hamilton sent Lieutenant-Governor Edward Abbott to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. 435). Both men were lieutenant-governors and both were sent to their posts by the
                    home government.</p>

            <p>This book, as well as the others in the series, is of interest to two kinds of readers: the historian
                    who is studying the territorial period of the Old Northwest, and the layman who is looking for
                    entertainment and incidental information about how his ancestors lived. It is the first of two
                    volumes of the papers of the Territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Chronologically, the documents cover the years from the separation of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Indiana territories in 1809 to the end of Governor Ninian Edwards second term in
                    1814. Geographically, they are concerned with the vast area which is now the states of <placeName>

            <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-045-3-081"/>
            <p>Most of the documents are from the files of various bureaus and offices of the Departments of State,
                    War, and Treasury, and of the House and Senate, and now in the National Archives. To these are added
                    some documents from <placeName>

                    chronologically and the location of the original is clearly indicated. All persons mentioned are
                    properly identified, and the index is adequate. As Dr. Carter points out in his introduction, one
                    cannot read the entire territorial history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> from this book (and from the forthcoming second volume). The material here given must
                    be suppleinented by documents in other volumes of the <hi rend="i">Territorial Papers</hi>, in the
                    historical collections of the states, and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>In spite of its limitations, however, this is readily available source material that illuminates many
                    aspects of the earlier history of the Middle West: the settlement of land claims of former French
                    and British nationals; Indian relations; the preliminaries to the War of 1812, and of the war
                    itself; the vexing matter of assembling and outfitting militia companies; the complexities of
                    leasing saline and mineral lands; and the survey and sale of the public lands.</p>
            <p>But this book is not an arid waste of dull papers. It contains the makings for fascinating
                    reconstruction of the lives and passions of pioneer ancestors. For example, from court depositions
                    and land commissioners reports, one can unravel the story of that self-declared Revolutionary hero,
                    John Edgar, who sought to make good his fradulent claims to large areas of the public lands. It is a
                    tangled tale of forgery, perjury, and dirty politics that finally climaxed in murder. Another
                    incident of violence, among many, is that of the murder of the post-rider on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Kaskaskia route. It was reported that his body "had been staked down under
                    water."</p>
            <p>In a more peaceful mood are such absorbing accounts of life on the frontier as that written by
                    Obadiah Jones, a territorial judge who lived at Cahokia. The long, detailed reports of the
                    government factors at the posts of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Peoria</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Prairie du Chien, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> tell much of the tortuous intrigue of British and Americans struggling for control of
                    the Indians. Still another story is that of the ambitious settlers at Shawneetown on the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, who sought to <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-045-3-082"/> have the
                    government surveyors lay out a town site. In spite of warnings of flood and actual inundation, the
                    people clung tenaciously to their river bottom homes, just as they do today, although the town has
                    been officially moved to higher ground. So, inside its sober government-blue cover, this book
                    contains the raw meat of history.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> has been writing much about its past, as its recent six-volume co-operative history
                    attests. With this study the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> State Archaeological and Historical Society has inaugurated the ambitions project of a
                    series of lives of the state's governors.</p>
            <p>Joseph Benson Foraker (1846–1917) was raised in the conservative philosophy, became one of
                    its chief spokesmen in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and national politics, and refused to make an adjustment to the Progressive Era of his
                    closing years. His biography, therefore, has a general significance as a case study of this
                    transitional period.</p>
            <p>Professor Walters' account is clear, free of bias and unwarranted generalizations, and
                    documented in all the right places. A reader wishing to know how Foraker stood on any conceivable
                    issue could find a dependable answer in this book, for the rules of scientific research have
                    obviously been followed with meticulous integrity. The editors have done as careful a job on the
                    mechanical aspects.</p>
            <p>Yet this reviewer closed the book feeling that something was missing—that the parts were
                    more satisfying than the whole. One defect appears to be a lack of emphasis. Fact follows fact on
                    approximately the same level. Furthermore, the man is inadequately related to his times. That the
                    author is aware of the social and economic groups that supported Foraker's conservatism is
                    clear enough from his general statements. But these special interests are seldom related to the <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-045-3-083"/> specific event by names and figures. The ever present
                    difficulty of the historian in finding a working alliance between the topical and the chronological
                    has not been satisfactorily resolved. Chapter seven, for example, entitled "Campaign For
                    Senator, 1890–1896" is succeeded by one on almost the same years entitled "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> Lawyer, 1890–1897." A chapter on "Imperialist Senator,
                    1897–1900" is logically followed by "The Foraker Act, 1900,"
                    but then the reader is directed backward to "Repairing Political Fences,
                    1897–1901."</p>
            <p>Perhaps the fault lies in part in the subject rather than the author. Conservatives, especially ones
                    as unreconstructed as Foraker, do not make as lively topics as do the rebels. That this is at least
                    partly true is readily apparent when one comes to the more dramatic and interesting chapter on
                    Foraker's defense of the Negroes and break with Theodore Roosevelt in the Brownsville
                    Affair. The style is clear but would have profited by variation.</p>
            <p>Let it be emphasized, however, that this biography has more merits than defects. The above criticisms
                    are probings rather than blanket indictments.</p>

            <p>If one were to write only a single-page account of the Civil War, he would have some words of praise
                    for the gunboats in the West—unless he were a soldier completely without conscience. The
                    editors of <hi rend="i">Battles and Leaders of the Civil War</hi> did not fail to take good account
                    of the gunboats, the mortars, and the rams; and the four well-known volumes contain adequate
                    coverage in articles from the pens of distinguished participants. The increasing literature of the
                    war has, however, lacked a unified treatment of the whole important theme, one which would not only
                    bring out new facts, but would reappraise the entire inland naval operations from a present-day
                    standpoint. Such a work could evidently be written only by a naval officer versed in naval lore and
                    himself fresh from guns and ships. Lieutenant Commander Gosnell <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-045-3-084"/>
                    was well qualified to produce exactly the work that was needed, and he can speak easily of
                    "smooth water," "narrow waters," and "fleet
                    action" in a way that is convincing; still he can refer to gunboats tied up to trees
                    (though he gets that nautical monstrosity into a quotation from another writer).</p>
            <p>Very properly the book begins with a description of the boats and their modes of fighting. Here
                    technical questions enter; marine engines, guns and gunnery, the boats themselves, and the
                    protection—if any—given to them. The Civil War occurred when boilers and
                    engines, as well as ordnance, were in a critical state of development. Gosnell makes this clear,
                    although he gives fundamentals, he remembers that general readers do not want too much on technical
                    matters, and in some instances he tells that information on important matters is
                    wanting—especially in the case of the Confedelate craft.</p>
            <p>The first Union gunboats described are the "Tyler," "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>," and the "Conestoga." The reader familiar with the Battle
                    of Belmont knows that the first two convoyed Grant's three thousand men to that place and
                    brought the expedition back to Cairo; and one who has studied the activities of the Brigadier
                    General C. F. Smith at Paduach during the fall of 1861, remembers that "Conestoga"
                    was the "Lincoln gunboat" that made frequent expeditions up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and Cumberland to see what the Confederates were doing at Forts Henry and Donelson.
                    These three vessels were converted freight-passenger boats. They were strengthened by oak bulwarks
                    but being protected by no armor, their sides would keep out nothing except musket shots and stones
                    thrown in anger. "Conestoga" had four 32-pounders to fight with whilc the other
                    boats had in addition some eight-inch smoothbows ("<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>," 4; "Tyler," 6).</p>
            <p>Good descriptions with some plans are given of the nine ironclads, seven of which were
                    "sisters." The arrangement of guns and the manner in which the twin stern wheels
                    were given protection by being recessed are shown. Two and a half inches of iron protected front and
                    sides of the casemate, the plating in front being backed by twenty inches of oak. The armament
                    consisted of 32-pounders, 42-pounders, and 64-pounders (8-inch Dahlgrens); speed in still water was
                    six to seven knots. Gosnell states that James B. Eads "did a splendid job in building these
                    seven craft." Something might <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-045-3-085"/> well have been said
                    about the difficulties encountered and pertinent dates given. The boats were built in a hundred
                    days—as Gosnell says—though the contract had called for only sixty. Delivered
                    and accepted on January 15, 1862, they were commissioned the next day. But so bad was the condition
                    of the national treasury that months passed before Eads was paid, and it was only his own private
                    means and assistance of friends that kept the work in progress.</p>
            <p>While the seven Union sisters, with thirteen pieces each, were well gunned, the eight Confederate
                    boats described can be called "gunboats" by little more than courtesy, for Gosnell
                    says that "at a rough guess" each carried only two guns—one forward,
                    one aft. They were intended rather as rams. For this purpose speed was essential, and all the
                    vessels were transformed river boats with powerful engines that could drive them with speeds of
                    nearly twelve knots. In case a boat had one-fourth inch of iron, she was a
                    "tinclad"; otherwise she would be a "cotton-clad" or
                    "hay-plated," depending upon the sort of bales placed upon her decks. The
                    Confederate craft must have been more comfortable than their opposite numbers, and one of them had
                    so much draft that it was driven by a screw propeller. The others were side-wheelers, and so they
                    not only were faster but had greater maneuverability than the Northern iron-clads, although these
                    had two stern wheels, each with its separate engine, in order to increase rapidity of turning.</p>
            <p>In the North there were also men who thought the handsomest way to deal with an enemy craft was to
                    smash boldly into it at a brisk speed and have the affair finished with one big crash instead of
                    tediously and noisily shooting at it. Gosnell gives a good treatment of the Ellet ram fleet. There
                    were a confusing number of Ellets, brothers, sons, nephews; but the man who "sold"
                    his idea to Secretary of War Stanton was Charles Ellet, Jr., an engineer. Though himself a former
                    navy officer, Gosnell does not hesitate to state that it was entirely possible that the ideas Ellet
                    entertained as to the best way to fight in narrow waters would not have been well received by navy
                    men; so it was probably as well that he did his experimenting with a colonel's commission,
                    a copious number of eager and brave relatives, and adventure loving rivermen, supplemented by ten to
                    twenty soldiers for each boat, who could shoot unwary Confederates <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-045-3-086"/> with their rifles and furnish a little prelude to the impending smash.
                    The Ellet rams were converted river boats. In order that they could engage with impunity in a life
                    of bumping their enemies, each was given three bulkheads running the entire length of the boat.
                    These were from twelve to sixteen inches thick, which was "very, very thick for such small
                    boats, or for any vessels." A shield of twenty-four inches of oak surrounded the power
                    plants, and the pilothouses were made proof against musketry. At first there were no camons, but
                    some were later added, an acknowledgement that fondness for guns was not just a matter of navy
                    tradition. Four of the boats were side-wheelers, three were driven from the stern. Ellet had hoped
                    for a still-water speed of fifteen knots and probably achieved thirteen.</p>
            <p>Gosnell points out faults of command arrangements but is not severely critical, for he is aware of
                    the difficulties of working out combined operations, especially when there are so many novel
                    situations. Though the Union gunboats were commanded by naval officers, they were under the command
                    of army officers in the field. No serious trouble arose and Gosnell says, "This was because
                    of the happy circumstance that, in the real fighting, Navy officers like Porter and Foote were
                    dealing with Army officers like Grant." Going further he states, "The top Army
                    offices in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> appear not to have interfered very much with these gunboats directly." (The
                    War Department certainly had a proprietary right in them, and it was to Quartermaster General Meigs
                    that Foote sent his appeals for money and his reports on construction difficulties: <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>, ser. 1, vol. 8, pp. 367–369, and elsewhere.) General John
                    Pope also worked very satisfactorily with Foote in the difficult operation at Island No. 10, though
                    he was impatient before two gunboats ran the heavily gunned forts. There was confusion, however,
                    over command of the ram fleet and an act of Congress failed to straighten it out, for it transferred
                    to the Navy the "Western Gunboat Fleet constructed by the War Department." Thus
                    the rams—the real bone of contention—were not explicitly covered. Lincoln
                    straightened the matter out by directing that the rams also be put under the department which
                    initially would probably have refused to have anything to do with them.</p>
            <p>If some objections can be raised to the command of the Federal craft, the story of the Confederate
                    boats is worse, <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-045-3-087"/> and Gosnell writes: "The organization
                    of this fleet was of a most amazing character. All of the ships' companies were civilians
                    from beginning to end! President Jefferson Davis appointed two river steamboatmen to start the ball
                    rolling. They appointed others to the commands of the remainder of the boats, making a total of
                    fourteen at first, and the appointments were approved. ‘Commodore’ <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> and his outfit reported theoretically to the general commanding the area."
                    Gosnell quotes <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> as saying that "fourteen <placeName>

                    </placeName> captain and pilots would never agree about anything after they had once gotten under
                    way."</p>
            <p>The story of operations on the Western Waters begins with a description of the contest for the
                    "Head of the Passes"—the name given to the important place below <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> where the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> divides, to empty into the gulf from several mouths, of which at least four were
                    important. Early in October, 1861, four Union vessels under the command of Captain John Pope took
                    station at the point. Presently a surprise attack was launched against them by Confederate Commodore
                    Hollins, whose command included the "Manassas," a craft to achieve considerable
                    renown and which had been given an underwater ram. In a chapter entitled "The Story of
                    Pope's Run," Gosnell gives an informative account of what took place,
                    characterized by fairness to both sides, and in which he reveals his competency as a critic of naval
                    matters. The Federal actions give little to be praised, and Gosnell says, "The Southerners
                    had really done an extremely creditable job when they drove all the blockading ships entirely out of
                    the river, because they did it with a greatly inferior force." <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> armchair strategists criticized Hollins for not doing more than he did; but months were
                    to pass before the Federals secured a lasting hold on the Head of the Passes.</p>
            <p>Action is resumed eleven hundred miles upriver, and in his description of the gunboat operations in
                    connection with Forts Henry and Donelson, Gosnell begins his practice of long quotations from
                    important participants and eyewitnesses, confining himself largely to connecting narrative, critical
                    comments, and analysis. The account of the "Carondelet's" brilliant
                    running of the batteries at Island Number 10 on April 4, 1862, is composed of quotations from
                    reporters for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi> and the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi>. The gunboat "Pittsburg" repeated the achievement two
                    nights later, <pb n="304" id="VAA4025-045-3-088"/> and Gosnell concludes that "the midnight
                    dash of the <hi rend="i">Carondelet</hi> made possible an absolutely complete victory."
                    This surely is not putting the case too strongly, for on April 7, the important island surrendered
                    to General Pope.</p>
            <p>Foote now had to retire because of his Donelson wound, and before Captain Charles H. Davis fairly had
                    his hands on his new command there occurred "The Affair at Plum Point
                    Bend"—just above Fort Pillow on the east bank of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>—in which the Confederates were successful in a
                    "tip-and-run" attack. Gosnell states that the battle "was one of the very
                    few affairs of the entire war that can properly be called a ‘fleet
                    action.’" He adds that "the only fight in which the Confederates
                    attacked was the only fleet fight the Confederates won." The account was soon evened in the
                    Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a surprise dash by some of Ellet's rams finished things temporarily for
                    the Confederates, Gosnell saying, "The effort of the River Defense Fleet was glorious but
                    the failure was fatal and complete."</p>
            <p>The Southerners, however, did not stay off of the waters long, for keeping open a passage for
                    supplies from west of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, as well as for munitions imported into un-blockaded <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> harbors, or ports in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mexico</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was vital to their success. Two chapters of the work under review are devoted to
                    "The <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>

                        </placeName>
                    </hi> Saga." This vessel was built under the greatest difficulties at Greenwood, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, on the Pazoo River. "Her career," says Gosnell, "lasted
                    only twenty-three days, but what a career! It included so much action that there probably never was
                    another vessel that averaged anything like so much fighting per day as did the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                        </placeName>."</hi> There must indeed be great merit to a case that can draw such
                    praise as that from a naval officer in the year 1949.</p>
            <p>The rest of the book deals with matters probably better known to students of the Civil War, the
                    gunboats at Vicks-burg, at Port Hudson, and on the Red River. The chapter "Guns on the
                    Suwanee River" is likely to give one his first knowledge of operations on the stream that
                    empties into the west coast of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>, and "The Cracker Line" furnishes some interesting appraisals and
                    narrative about operations on the <geogName>Tennessee River</geogName> in the fall of 1863, that
                    helps round out the gunboat story.</p>
            <p>The concluding paragraph of the book begins, "Too great a proportion of the interest and
                    study of the Civil War has <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-045-3-089"/> been lavished upon the slogging to
                    and fro on the martial highway between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>." For unique thrills the adventures of the little gunboats on western bayous
                    or eastern sloughs cannot, according to Gosnell, be approached by anything in the war. Thrills there
                    certainly were, and plenty of danger too, for when a boiler was exploded by a shell—which
                    sometimes happened—loss of life from scalding and drowning was appalling, while casualtes
                    from gunfire were also high at times. Readers may say either yes or no to Gosnell's general
                    contention, but certain it is that he has helped fill a gap long needing to be filled. And no one
                    will believe Gosnell guilty of overstatement in his parting salute to the river vessels:
                    "West and east, those on both sides behaved splendidly."</p>
            <p>Only a person with good naval knowledge would safely venture to take issue with judgments expressed
                    in the book. But it hurts a mathematician a little to read that "force is proportional to
                    …" when the correct word is "energy," and to see an essential
                    one-half omitted from a formula (p. 21). Those familiar with the generals of the war will note that
                    William T. Sherman is incorrectly given credit for coastal operations in November, 1861. It was in
                    fact General Thomas W. Sherman who carried on the successful operation with Flag Officer S. F.
                    DuPont. The better known of the two generals was at the time in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in a state of discouragement about Northern prospects. The other Sherman, kept from his
                    just due by a mere permutation in letters (any editor might change T. W. Sherman to W. T. Sherman),
                    had a very creditable career. (He lost a leg in the attack on Port Hudson on May 27, 1863, but
                    returned to duty after some weeks of absence.)</p>
            <p>Twenty-eight illustrations are a goodly number for a book with less than three hundred pages, and
                    they add interest and value to it. But the two maps are poor, due to the fact that lettering was put
                    on by typewriter and the drafting was apparently done with poor ink. The book also lacks an index,
                    which lessens somewhat its value as a work of reference. These are minor flaws in a very readable
                    and informative work, and <hi rend="i">Guns on the Western Waters</hi> is to be recommended for
                    everyone's shelf of books upon the Civil War.</p>

            <p>These two books contain the history of the religious sisterhood indicated in the titles from its very
                    humble beginning (it was founded in 1845 by the Reverend Louis Gillet, a Redemptorist) till its
                    centennial celebration (1945), including some of its activities even of 1946. The external work of

                    </placeName>, this work is—especially at present—so vast and so well organized
                    and done that it would take a historical essay rather than a book review to do justice to the
                    account given of it in these two books. The author is to be commended for her comprehensive research
                    and exact authentication. Further, she does not hesitate to give an account also of major
                    difficulties, even of crises, that arose in the history of a hundred years, though at times the
                    reader is likely to catch himself reading in between the lines. These qualities of her work make it
                    a trustworthy history of Catholic education in a large part of the state of <placeName>

            <p>As to composition, the impression forces itself upon the reader that the author could with advantage
                    have omitted many details and digressions that make the first book unduly voluminous. For instance,
                    the first two chapters are an extensive summary of the history of New France, which could with
                    profit have been condensed into a few pages. In chapter three, two and a half pages are devoted to a
                    history of the island of San Domingo merely because it was the birthplace of the mother of the first
                    superioress of the community, even though the former left the island at the age of ten, never to

                    thereafter to many dioceses in the United States, France, perhaps even South America, by way of
                    Africa; for four months on the sea, and, finally, in three Cistercian monasteries in France; his
                    death in the third monastery, in the fifty-sixth year after his connections of not quite two years

                    summarized and the life in a Cistercian monastery is described; thirteen illustrations accompany
                    this Cistercian history and life. Now, whereas all this manifests comprehensive research and filial
                    piety, it detracts from the main narrative, which thereby loses in concentration and continuity.</p>
            <p>The second book is not a continuation of the first; yet it is complementary to it. The Congregation
                    has the laudable regulation that each of its institutions and missions keep a chronicle from the
                    time of the opening of the house. This book records the entries in the chronicle for the opening
                    year at each mission. These entries are followed by a neat chart, Mission Progress, recording the
                    Pastor, Number of Sisters on Mission, Number of Secular Teachers, Enrollment Grade School,
                    Enrollment High School at the opening of the mission and for the year 1945 or, as the case may be,
                    for the year in which the Sisters relinquished the school. This volume presents indeed the <hi rend="i">Achievement of a Century</hi>. Even though the editor has laudably endeavored to
                    preserve the individuality of each chronicle, it would have been well to establish uniformity as to
                    the word "superior" or "superioress"; in some of these
                    chronicles it is used indiscriminately in either form.</p>

            <p>This book brings out clearly both the pitfalls into which the untrained writer of history may so
                    easily fall, and the peculiar difficulties inherent in writing the history of science. <pb n="308" id="VAA4025-045-3-092"/> It is a rare individual who brings to such a task both adequate
                    training in historical method and a thorough understanding of science. In preparation for writing
                    this book, which covers not only the ancient history of the Near East and the Graeco-Roman World but
                    also the prehistoric period, the Far East, and Pre-Columbian America, Dr. Gordon has done an amazing
                    amount of study. Special chapters are devoted to such outstanding figures as Hippocrates and Galen;
                    and the encyclopaedic coverage of known individuals is impressive.</p>
            <p>On medical theory and practice his observations clearly reflect the experience of an up-to-date
                    practicing physician. To the reader unfamiliar with medical science and medical terminology his
                    remarks are frequently difficult to understand, but they will undoubtedly be of great interest to
                    members of the medical profession. The extensive knowledge which the ancients possessed about
                    anatomy, physiology, and pathology, as well as their medical and surgical skill, will amaze the
                    reader unacquainted with the history of medicine in Antiquity.</p>
            <p>To the historian of Antiquity, however, this book unfortunately presents some glaring defects. Though
                    the author has consulted many modern books in French and German as well as in English, a casual
                    check with the items in the Utrecht Classical Bibliography does not indicate familiarity with the
                    up-to-date literature on the subject. This is in line with his use of the ancient sources, which he
                    appears to have read all too frequently in old and out-of-date translations. There is no evidence
                    whatsoever of familiarity with the original languages and no indication that any effort was made to
                    check on the accuracy of the translations or to assess the historical value of the sources.</p>
            <p>A good example of his uncritical attitude may be found on page 550 where he quotes a translation of a
                    supposed letter from Menocrates to Philip of Macedon taken from a book published in 1831 with no
                    indication of the place where the author found the original text of the letter and no discussion of
                    the problem of its authenticity. An even more exasperating example of carelessness is to be found on
                    pp. 496–497 where the translation of an Athenian inscription in honor of the physician
                    Evenor (apparently <hi rend="i">Inscriptiones Graecae II, editio minor</hi> 374) is given without
                    citing any publication where either the Greek text or the translation was published. This <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-045-3-093"/> is particularly disturbing, for the translation would give the
                    reader not accustomed to the language of Athenian official documents the impression that the Demus
                    of the phrase translated "it seemed good to Demus" was an individual rather than
                    the Athenian popular assembly. To some this might seem a trivial point, but it raises serious doubts
                    concerning the reliability of other translations involving important points of medical history. In
                    addition to the Evenor inscription, another example of careless omission will be found in his
                    remarks on the Roman oculists (pp. 624–625) in which he fails to indicate where the
                    inscriptions are published. His method of citing modern authors is often rather baffling, as for
                    example his citation of his own "The Romance of Medicine" in note 19, p. 644,
                    which the reader can identify only by looking back to note 4. He often follows this strange method
                    of giving the title of his books in quotations when he cites them for the second and subsequent
                    times instead of using the conventional abbreviations understood by all historians. Finally the
                    student of ancient history will notice far too many examples of inaccuracy on points of general
                    history and chronology. A few examples will suffice: <list type="simple">
                  <item>(1) Augustus, 30 A.D. (p. 616)</item>
                  <item>(2) Hammurabi, 2285–2242 B.C. (p. 159) as compared with 1950 B.C. (p. 179)</item>
                  <item>(3) Galen said to have been the court physician of Septimius Severus for thirty years (pp.
                            701 f.) though Septimius was emperor for a considerably shorter time.</item>
                  <item>(4) The important Roman office of <hi rend="i">censor</hi> held by Cato is regarded as a
                            surname instead of an office (p. 626) and on the same page he was said to have been
                            "appointed" <hi rend="i">Consul</hi>.</item>
               </list> There are also many careless spellings of ancient names, such as: Ptolemean and Pyda (p.
                    617), Lex Aemela (p. 623), and Addaras (p. 475).</p>
            <p>It is a shame that the value of such a learned work should be viciated by such careless neglect of
                    important historical facts and the canons of historical writing. With a little more attention to
                    historical methodology, perhaps with the help of a professional historian, many of the mistakes
                    could easily have been avoided. Yet, despite these defects, the reviewer is convinced that this will
                    be an immensely interesting and useful work for the medical profession as well as for the general
                    reader. He cannot but feel the greatest ahhation <pb n="310" id="VAA4025-045-3-094"/> for the busy

            <p>This pamphlet translated from the <hi rend="i">Yivo Bleter</hi> attempts by topical treatment to show
                    the mutual ties and the varying relationships between the German Jews and the Germans in America.
                    The loyalty of the German Jews to German culture is emphasized. The unifying role of the German
                    language is presented as a patent cohesive factor in preserving the close relations between the
                    Jewish emigrants of Germany and the Germans in America. The German press of Pennsylvania in
                    particular served both the German Jews and the Germans and thereby added to an already existing
                    community of interests.</p>
            <p>The author shows the waning of some ties in the late nineteenth century occasioned when second and
                    third generations of the German Jews, naturally enough, use the English language as their medium.
                    Since both groups took firmer root in their new land, the common interests between them were
                    substantially lessened.</p>
            <p>It is unfortunate that the author treated topics of secondary importance as fully as those of greater
                    import. Nevertheless the pamphlet represents solid research and provides an introduction to an
                    interesting subject.</p>

                    constitute the greater part of the Government's records which are worth preserving. The

            <p>Although the Indiana Historical Society is among the oldest historical organizations in the Middle
                    West, two other state historical societies in this area have a larger membership—<placeName>

                    </placeName> 4,950 and <placeName>

                    </placeName> 3,472. At the end of July, Indiana had only 1,979. Every library in the state, teachers
                    of Indiana history, as well as all other Hoosiers interested in the history of Indiana should avail
                    themselves of the advantages of membership in their historical society. If every member could
                    interest a friend or two to join the Society by the time of the Territorial sesquicentennial
                    celebration in 1950, it should be possible to have a total membership of four thousand.</p>
            <p>Contact with persons possessing any materials relative to the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in
                    Indiana including diaries, letters, and papers of its ministers and members concerning the history
                    of the church is sought for a study of that church in Indiana.</p>
