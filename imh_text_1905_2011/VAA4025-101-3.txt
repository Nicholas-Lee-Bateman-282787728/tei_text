                     Introduction
                JAMES J. CONNOLLY
                When Robert and Helen Lynd chose 
                        Muncie

                            Middletown
                        : A Study in Modern American Culture, the city was an uncommon place. Like many
                    small eastern and midwestern cities, it had industrialized rapidly over the preceding fifty years,
                    particularly during and after the northeastern Indiana gas boom of the 1890s. Yet its social
                    composition was unusual for a factory town. It was home to families from both the upland South and
                    the northeastern U.S., but, unlike most urban settings outside the South, it had relatively few
                    immigrants. At the same time, African Americans were settling there at a rapid rate-more rapid than
                    that of white newcomers. 
                        Muncie
                     during the 1920s was a demographic oddity, proportionately more black and less ethnic
                    than the average northern city and more industrialized than most southern towns.1
                
                Despite these idiosyncrasies, the Lynds helped make 
                        Muncie

                     served as a bellwether for social scientists and journalists seeking to discern trends and
                    patterns in modern American life.2 The Lynds did not intend for their work to
                    have such an effect. Indeed, they chose 
                        Muncie
                     in part for its distinguishing social characteristics. Although they noted the
                    "middle-of-the-road quality" of the city, chose the generic name of 
                        Middletown
                    , and added the subtitle "a study in modern American culture," they also insisted that
                    it was not a "typical" city and that the findings could be applied to the rest of the country "only
                    with caution." Nevertheless, Americans quickly began to view the city as a representative slice of
                    the nation, and scholars, including the Lynds themselves, repeatedly returned to the city to measure
                    the degree of change in American culture and society over the course of the twentieth century.3

                    tensions connected with it. They were first presented in November 2004 at the fourth Small Cities

                     The conference marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of the
                    publication of the Lynds’ first book. It featured scholars from a variety of disciplines who
                    presented recent work on 
                        Middletown
                     and who reflected on the origins and development of research on 
                        Muncie
                     as 
                        Middletown
                    . Included here are Staughton Lynd's keynote address, which links the ideals and
                    experiences of his parents with their choice of

                    ; a revised version of Sarah Igo's provocative paper explaining how "
                        Middletown
                    " came to be seen as the quintessential American community; and John Straw's catalog of
                    the rich set of resources that continue to attract investigators of the 
                        Middletown
                     experience. Together they help us understand the legacies of the Lynds’ original
                    investigation, including both the difficulties created by the selection of an apparently homogeneous
                    white Protestant community and the reasons why those seeking to understand modern America continue
                    to return to 
                        Muncie
                     despite its demographic quirks.
                The question of typicality has been at the center of 
                        Middletown
                     studies from the start. The Lynds addressed it in the first pages of 
                        
                            Middletown
                        , and virtually every researcher who has followed in their footsteps has
                    acknowledged it to some degree. A few observers, mostly journalists, have accepted the notion
                    uncritically. But academics have usually been more cautious, promising to construct "a chain of
                    inference" before generalizing from 
                        Middletown
                     to the nation. Nevertheless, the same scholars have felt compelled to defend the idea
                    that the city was representative. As the foremost successor to the Lynds recently declared, in
                    response to a question about 
                        Muncie
                    's typicality, "if you look at the divorce rate, the robbery rate, the number of books
                    taken from the public library, whatever, 
                        Muncie
                     does come out very close to the national average."4
                
                To grasp how 
                        Muncie
                     became a barometer of American life requires an understanding of the origins of the
                    first 
                        Middletown
                     research. The Lynds were executing a "small city study" commissioned by the Institute
                    for Social and Religious Research (ISRR). Launched with the financial support of oil magnate John D.
                    Rockefeller, Jr., the ISRR sought religious solutions to the social problems of industrial America.
                    Rockefeller was alarmed by escalating class conflict in the early twentieth century. He believed
                    religious activism offered the most likely means of reducing the tensions of industrial life and so
                    funded the organization that would become the ISRR. After

                     sponsoring a series of traditional surveys of church life in various communities, the
                    agency commissioned the more in-depth analysis of social and religious life in a small urban setting
                    that would become

                    .5
                
                The Lynds were the second choice to direct the project, and a surprising one in some respects. In
                    1923 the ISRR tapped Northwestern University sociologist William Louis Bailey but soon rejected him
                    as unsuited to the participant-observer-style research they sought. In his place they selected
                    Robert S. Lynd, a native Hoosier, 
                        Princeton
                     alumnus, and former divinity student. That Rockefeller accepted Lynd was surprising,
                    given that Lynd had sharply criticized Rockefeller and Standard Oil for its treatment of workers in
                    a 1922 article published in The Survey Graphic, a reform magazine that mixed
                    empirical analysis and illustrations of social problems. The article recounted Lynd's experience as
                    a preacher and laborer in a Wyoming oil field during the summer of 1921 and blamed Rockefeller for
                    the poor working conditions there. The ISRR nevertheless chose Lynd, in part to imply that it was
                    independent from Rockefeller, its chief financial backer.6

                     as the study of a typical community, was less surprising given the Lynds’ agenda. Robert Lynd
                    originally selected 
                        South Bend
                    , Indiana, from a list compiled by Bailey, but decided not to conduct the study there
                    for fear that the size and cultural variety of the city would make a fine-grained analysis
                    impractical. After further consideration, he picked 
                        Muncie
                    , a smaller and considerably less diverse community that would allow a more thorough and
                    complete investigation. The choice of a more ethnically uniform city was intentional. The Lynds
                    explained in the opening section of 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     that "it seemed a distinct advantage to deal with a homogeneous native-born population, even
                    though such a population is unusual in an American industrial city." As for the growing black
                    population, they simply ignored it, making "

                        Muncie
                    . This would permit the investigators to deal with just one major issue-the impact of
                    modernization on the community-"instead of being forced to handle two major variables, racial change
                    and cultural change." In the parlance of 1920s America, the phrase "racial change" meant not only
                    shifts in the ratio of blacks and whites in the city, but also the growth of immigrant populations.
                    By eliminating racial and ethnic complexity, the Lynds aimed to concentrate on the issue of class
                    conflict that had inspired the ISRR project in the first place.7
                
                
                    
                        Muncie
                     was certainly an industrial city. The site along the White River
                    that would become 
                        Muncie
                     was first peopled by 
                        Delaware
                     Indians forced westward during the late eighteenth century. The first white settlers
                    arrived during the 1820s, and the village they established grew slowly, remaining a sleepy market
                    town of 5,000 into the 1880s. The discovery of natural gas in nearby Eaton, Indiana, in 1886, along
                    with the efforts of local boosters, drew manufacturers such as the Ball Brothers’ glass jar company
                    to 
                        Muncie
                     during the last decade of the nineteenth century, and the population grew dramatically.
                    By 1890 there were 11,345 people in the city; a decade later the federal census reported a
                    population of 20,942. The natural gas supply ran out in the early twentieth century, but the city
                    continued to attract new factories, most notably automobile plants, and the population grew
                    steadily. It had climbed to 36,524 in 1920 and reached 46,548 a decade later.8

                The central purpose of the Lynds’ research was to gauge the impact of this dramatic transformation on
                    the values and habits of local residents. Robert Lynd, his wife Helen Merrell Lynd, and a
                    three-person staff arrived in the city in January 1924 and spent almost two years there. Although
                    none was a formally trained social scientist, they employed anthropological methods, particularly a
                    framework devised by W. H. R. Rivers. It divided human experience into six areas: getting a living,
                    making a home, training the young, using leisure, engaging in religious practices, and engaging in
                    community activities. These became the organizing categories of the book, which in turn became far
                    more than the survey of religious life that the ISRR had commissioned. The Lynds also structured the
                    volume as a comparison between life in 
                        Muncie
                     in 1890 and life during the mid-1920s. To complete the project they conducted surveys,
                    participated in and observed community activities, clipped newspaper articles, and examined archival
                    materials before returning to 
                        New York
                     to write.
                What the Lynds produced was a sharply observed portrait of a community not entirely aware of the
                    changes wrought by industrialization. The fairly harmonious city of 1890 had given way to a
                    community split into two groups, the business class and the working class, each of which led
                    significantly different lives. But the conflict such divisions might be expected to produce had not
                    developed in 
                        Middletown
                    , largely because the availability of consumer goods made the prospects for material
                    success and improved social status seem real to workers and their families. This critique of
                    American society was accompanied by an impressive array of detail about work experiences, family
                    life, gender roles, reading habits, the social impact of the automobile, and a host of other topics,
                    large and small.
                In departing so dramatically from the original concept of the project, the Lynds lost the support of
                    the ISRR. After reading an early draft of the manuscript, Rockefeller's lawyer wrote to Galen
                    Fisher, the director of the Institute, that "it is very scopey and its range of ideas positively
                    bewildering." He was particularly hostile to the Lynds’ emphasis on class differences and expressed
                    doubt as to whether they would ultimately produce a publishable manuscript. In the end, the
                    Institute's staff concluded that the book was not publishable, and the Lynds were given permission
                    to market it on their own. They sent the manuscript to Alfred Harcourt, who quickly agreed to issue
                    it under his Harcourt and Brace imprint. The book appeared in 1929 and was a huge success. It was
                    widely reviewed and widely praised, and became a best seller and sociological classic that has
                    remained in print ever since.9

                     was the slew of follow-up studies it generated. The Lynds themselves produced a second book on 
                        Muncie
                     in 1937, after a shorter investigation by Robert Lynd alone.

                         in Transition found a community that still clung to tradition and resisted the
                    efforts of New Deal planners despite the hardships of the Depression. Robert Lynd's politics had
                    beco me more overtly radical by this time, and the second 
                        Middletown
                     book reflected this shift. A chapter on the distribution of power claimed the city was
                    dominated by the "X family"-the Balls-and another chapter on the "
                        Middletown
                     Spirit" stressed the stubborn persistence of individualistic values even in the face of
                    the current economy. These chapters gave the book a sharper, more critical tone than the first
                    volume, and it never achieved quite the same status or popular resonance as its predecessor.10
                
                Others picked up where the Lynds left off, although often from a different political perspective.
                    During the 1970s, a team of sociologists led by Theodore Caplow, Howard Bahr, and Bruce Chadwick
                    came to 
                        Muncie
                     to replicate and expand upon the original studies in a project they labeled 
                        Middletown
                     III. They produced two books, 
                        
                            Middletown
                         Families and All Faithful People, along with numerous articles in academic
                    journals. The first book reported optimistically that family life had remained stable in 
                        Middletown
                    , impervious to the modernizing changes that were supposed to have undermined it. The
                    second contended that institutional religion remained a strong element of American life, but that
                    tolerance of religious differences had increased. Caplow and Bahr returned in the late 1990s, along
                    with sociologist Louis Hicks, to conduct 
                        Middletown

                    Middletowners. Filmmaker Peter Davis came to the city in 1979 and commenced a critically acclaimed
                    documentary film series that was broadcast on public television during the early 1980s. Interspersed
                    among these larger projects have been dozens of smaller academic and journalistic inquiries, all of
                    which testify to the enduring power of the proposition that research on 
                        Muncie
                     tells us about something more than just one community.11

                    the Lynds and their successors constitute the world's longest set of time-series data.14
                
                The breadth and depth of the Lynds’ studies also made them relevant to a wide range of scholarly
                    inquiry. Historians and social scientists have turned to 
                        
                            Middletown

                    the impact of the automobile, and many other trends at work in 1920s and 1930s America. Mark C.
                    Smith and Richard Wightman Fox, for instance, have both credited the Lynds as being among the first
                    to grasp the significance of the rise of a consumer culture. Still others have challenged the
                    couple's findings. Nelson Polsby and Carrolyle Frank took up the analysis of the X family's power
                    offered in 
                        Middletown
                     in Transition. Frank argued for modifications of the Lynds’ claims; Polsby argued for a
                    more pluralistic understanding of the distribution of power in 
                        Muncie
                     and the nation as a whole. Stephan Thernstrom, in a study of

                     studies, argued that the Lynds underestimated the degree of social mobility in American
                        society.15
                
                Through all of the research and commentary on 
                        Middletown
                    , the question of the relationship between 
                        Muncie
                     and the nation has remained open. Two of the articles published here directly address
                    the issue of how a small eastern Indiana city became a microcosm of America. Staughton Lynd's
                    "Making 
                        Middletown
                    " offers insights into his parents’ political commitments and personal experiences and
                    their connection to the choice of 
                        Muncie
                     as the site for their research. The younger Lynd, a respected but controversial
                    historian of American radicalism whose anti-
                        North Vietnam
                     War activism led him to leave the academy to become a lawyer and advocate of
                    working-class causes, stresses the sympathy his parents held for the downtrodden and their belief in
                    the capacity of white Protestant Americans to create a just community. He suggests that along with
                    the baseline rationale for selecting

                     white parts of southern Indiana and 
                        Louisville, Kentucky
                    , shaped their choice. Their experiences and preconceptions steered them to a familiar
                    setting. Their intent, he argues, was not to report on a typical American community but "to excavate
                    [the] experience of genuine religiously based community from the provincialism and crass materialism
                    with which that experience was encrusted."16
                
                Sarah Igo's article shows us that it was not so much the Lynds as their audience who made 
                        Middletown
                     a typical American community. Some of the Lynds’ techniques, most notably their
                    studiously scientific language and the choice of title, contributed to the tendency of Americans to
                    accept 
                        Middletown
                     as a representative slice of American life. But there were larger forces at work as
                    well. The demand to identify the typical in America-"part empirical quest, part cultural obsession"
                    as Igo puts it-intensified sharply during the 1920s and 1930s. Several decades of immigration and
                    industrialization fueled this demand and 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     was soon caught up in it, despite the Lynds’ explicit disavowal of any claims of typicality
                    for 
                        Muncie
                    . Journalists, marketers, and social scientists flocked to the city in the ensuing
                    decades, all confident to one degree or another that they were examining a quintessentially American
                    community.
                As the articles by Lynd and Igo imply, the most significant challenge to assertions of 
                        Muncie
                    's typicality revolves around the question of cultural diversity. The Lynds’ decisions
                    to choose a city with few immigrants and to ignore the city's black community have long been the
                    chief impediments to claims that 
                        Muncie
                     was or is a representative community. While 
                        
                            Middletown
                         in Transition discussed African Americans more than its predecessor, blacks
                    remain largely invisible in both studies. Criticism of their absence is more than a matter of
                    political correctness. As Jack Blocker has noted, the presence of a growing number of black workers
                    may well have hindered unionization in 
                        Muncie
                    . The city was a relatively hospitable place for blacks in part because of the local
                    elite's racial tolerance, a stance that may have been fueled by a desire to keep the working class
                    divided. Since the city had few immigrants, the ethnic obstacles to worker unity that were so common
                    in other industrial communities did not exist in 
                        Muncie
                    . Without a significant pool of black labor for employers to draw on, workers would have
                    been less divided and perhaps more likely to act collectively. While the Lynds 
                        
                            16 Rita Caccamo offers a similar explanation of the Lynds’ purpose in
                            selecting 
                                Muncie
                            : they chose it "because they were convinced that the hope for social progress
                            and moral reawakening resided wholly within the original American spirit, the adventurous,
                            strong spirit of the Protestant pioneers of the Midwest." Caccamo, Back to

                    scattered references to blacks elsewhere. All Faithful People briefly notes that
                    African Americans now make up 12 percent of the city's population, but makes no other reference to
                    them except to note that black Muslims were "known in 
                        Middletown

                     IV team has begun to remedy this absence by surveying African Americans as well as
                    whites and comparing the two patterns of social experience. But the bulk of 
                        Middletown
                     work has been a whites-only enterprise, ignoring not only the presence of blacks but
                    the very real impact they have had on the community.18

                    by the Lynds. Not surprisingly, the project's results indicated similarities between blacks and
                    whites in some areas but substantial differences in others, differences that force a reconsideration
                    of at least present-day 
                        Middletown
                     culture and society. The authors do not claim to have recovered the experiences of the

                        Middletown
                     as well as to community studies in general. As a collaborative ethnography, it involved
                    community members to a far greater degree than any of the survey research or other analysis
                    conducted by the Lynds or their many successors. Chapter drafts were reviewed by

                        Middletown
                     researchers have employed the participant-observer method, none have had the degree of
                    input from their subjects that Lassiter and his colleagues had. The detached, social scientific
                    narration that has characterized writing on 
                        Middletown
                     from the Lynds onward muted the voices of community members. In The Other

                    controversial technique not only gave black Middletowners a significant role in defining their own
                    experience, but offered a different model of a community study with implications for ethnographic
                    research generally.

                     as a homogeneous white Protestant community during the era of the Lynds remains intact.
                    Jack Blocker's analysis of black migration to the city offers a valuable starting point for a
                    consideration of the black experience in 
                        Middletown
                     and of the role of race in the community during the early twentieth century.

                    oral histories edited by Dan Rottenberg, documents the experience of another minority group and the
                    impact of anti-Semitism during the 1920s and 1930s, but other experiences remain unexplored. The
                    Catholic community of 
                        Muncie
                     receives modest consideration in the Lynds’ studies, although it gets more in later 
                        Middletown
                     research. We know relatively little about how the city's early Catholic community
                    carved out a place in local civic life, beyond the Lynds’ report that it "pursued … a quiet,
                    resolute and inconspicuous course" and their claim that it had no impact on the city's public
                        life.20 Perhaps even more significantly, we also know little about the
                    importance of cultural differences between the upland southern migrants and those tracing family
                    roots back to the northeastern 
                        United States
                    . These two groups constituted the core of 
                        Muncie
                    's white population through most of the twentieth century. But the Lynds’ emphasis on
                    cultural homogeneity and class differences all but erased the religious, social, and political
                    variations among white Protestants. Early twentieth-century 
                        Muncie
                     was hardly a polyglot community, but the Lynds’ desire to eliminate racial and ethnic
                    variables and to stress common values unjustifiably flattened their picture of the city.
                As a culturally plural understanding of American society has gained ascendance, the notion that 
                        Muncie

                    analysis, interpretations, and empirical data about an otherwise modest community. That abundance
                    continues to attract scholars and journalists seeking to understand America.
                What they find may not be the typical American city in purely demographic terms, but rather a deeply
                    explored slice of middle America.

                    non-metropolitan, non-coastal America, a segment of the nation that has gained increasing attention
                    in the wake of recent election results. Investigators returning to idiosyncratic 
                        Muncie
                     should approach it in those terms, rather than seeking a mythical average American
                    community. In doing so, they would hew more closely to the Lynds’ original intentions.

                We are told in the introduction to Middletown that "two streams of colonists" met
                    in the Midwest: "the Yankees from New 
                        England and New York
                    ," and the "southern stream" who, "having passed through the 
                        Cumberland Gap
                     into 
                        Kentucky
                    , went down the 
                        Ohio
                     River."1 My parents exemplified the two kinds of colonists.
                My mother Helen Merrell Lynd came from a libertarian New 
                        England
                     background suggested by the blue sky, evergreens, and granite rock of that part of the
                    world. A Merrell, she once told me, had fought in the American Revolution. As the Merrells moved
                    west they founded colleges: Ripon College in 
                        Wisconsin
                    , and Whitman College in Walla Walla, 
                        Washington
                    , attended by the future Justice of the 
                        United States
                     Supreme Court, William Douglas. My mother's mother, my maternal grandmother, was a
                    small and unassuming woman who taught school in 
                        Illinois
                    . But my grandmother refused to lead her students in saluting the flag, because, she
                    said, it isn't true that there is justice for all.2

                It seems that between the first and second years at Union, students were expected to volunteer for
                    summer preaching assignments.3 Somehow my father wound up at a Rockefeller oil
                    camp in Elk Basin, Wyoming, where he arrived by stagecoach. He located a boarding house, but at
                    dinner the first evening he sensed a chill around the table. He concluded that men who worked six
                    days a week for Mr. Rockefeller were not excited about a handsome young man from the East spending
                    his days visiting their wives.
                So my father got a job as a pick and shovel laborer, and preached in the school house Sunday nights.
                    It is the single thing about him of which I am most proud. When I was growing up stories were told.
                    One was about the man who stood at the school house door as the hat was passed for the collection
                    and shouted, "Lucky to get the hat back!" And songs were sung, especially a song that I have never
                    heard elsewhere which begins:
                
                    When the Good Lord made the copper ore
                    He said, "I'll put you away to store
                    Where man won't find you any more
                    Unless he's a human mole."
                    But he reckoned without the miner man,
                    Who isn't built on the regular plan,
                    So ever since the world began
                    It's the miner who digs the hole.
                    
                        Chorus:
                    
                    Colonel, another bowl!
                    My throat's as black as coal
                    But if you listen well,
                    You can hear me tell,
                    If there's mines up in Heaven
                    I'm a-going to Hell,
                    I'm a poor old busted son of a gun
                    The miner that digs the hole.
                
                When I was a teenager, I thought I saw a momentary reappearance of the pick and shovel laborer of the
                    early 1920s when my father was invited to 
                        
                            3 See chapter 1, "Father and Son: Intellectual Work Outside the
                            University," in Staughton Lynd, Living inside Our Hope: A Steadfast Radical's
                                Thoughts on Rebuilding the Movement (

                     address a UAW educational conference in 1949. The speech was
                    printed as a pamphlet because, according to Victor Reuther's preface, "reports of it have circulated
                    through the union with the result that there has been an insistent demand for its publication."4 I remember my father's face as he came in the door of our family apartment
                    after giving that speech. I had never seen him so happy.
                But there was a second side to my dad's ability to relate to workingclass folk. He did not
                    romanticize them. He had not found a union upsurge in 
                        Muncie
                     even in the 1930s. I remember a fragment of conversation in which he said that what
                    workers like to do is sit in the sun and drink beer.
                And so I was somehow prepared by my father for a two-sided experience in approaching the poor and
                    oppressed. On the one hand, I recognized their oppression and their persistence in combating it, and
                    sought to be helpful. On the other hand, I was prepared to understand that for persons battered by
                    economic necessity there was inevitably an overriding concern with short-term material security.

                So far as the wide world was concerned, my parents Robert and Helen Lynd have always been the people
                    who wrote those books about 
                        Muncie
                    . I remember very little about the making of the 
                        Middletown
                     books. I was born after the publication of the first book. 1 have a memory of the
                    writing of 
                        
                            Middletown
                         in Transition, but it may be one of those quasi-memories that actually derives
                    from what others tell you that they remember.
                For years the Lynd family rented a summer home called Innisfeld in the 
                        New Hampshire
                     lake district during the break between academic semesters. My mother has said about the 
                        Muncie
                     project, "At first it was his study. Then when we came to the writing [of 
                        
                            Middletown
                        ] it was decided that we were sharing the book." Just down the road from
                    Innisfeld was the summer home of Lawrence Frank, a friend of the family, in whose garage my dad
                    wrote the first draft. My mother relates that "[t]hen we came back to 
                        New York
                     and worked on it together for another year…. We did a lot of revision. The manuscript
                    was 900 typed pages and we cut it to 600. We worked terribly hard, and revised and revised and
                    revised. I can remember even after it was in page proof sitting in Harcourt's office and changing
                    this and that."5 My mother adds:

                    what we did as we actually wrote it was that we would each write a chapter and then we would
                        exchange and rewrite. The one absolutely unbreakable rule was that no matter how silly either of
                        us felt to be something that the other had written, it couldn't be thrown away. We had to
                            consult.6

                         In Transition, was written in the Innisfeld study. The room had patterned
                    brown and white wallpaper showing some sort of English hunting scene. As one entered the study from
                    the living room, there were two desks placed against the walls which met to form a corner at the far
                    side of the room. Each of my parents sat at one of the desks. And my memory, for what it's worth, is
                    of one day coming into that study with a glass of orange juice for each of my parents.
                
                    Why My Father?
                
                Why was my father asked to do the 
                        Muncie
                     study? After his summer at the Rockefeller oil camp in Wyoming, he and John D.
                    Rockefeller, Jr., exchanged views in the pages of a periodical named The Survey
                        Graphic.
                    7 My dad was quite critical of Mr. Rockefeller's operation. Moreover, there was
                    an oft-repeated story at the family kitchen table that after his summer in Elk Basin, my father
                    asked John D. Rockefeller for a contribution to the community center there, and Mr. Rockefeller
                    declined on the ground that it had been a bad year for Standard Oil.
                All of this being so, why did the Institute of Social and Religious Research of the Rockefeller
                    Foundation ask Robert Lynd to do a study of the religious life of a typical American city?
                An adequate answer would require more knowledge than I possess about Rockefeller family history. I
                    have the impression that after the notorious massacre of the wives and children of striking miners
                    in Ludlow, 
                        Colorado
                    , just before World War I, the Rockefellers began to espouse a more benign form of
                    capitalism. If I am not mistaken, Rockefellers helped to fund, through the Interchurch World
                    Commission, a somewhat sympathetic study of the 1919 steel strike. Perhaps hiring my father was a
                    part of this same course of conduct. As I put it ten years ago, perhaps "the boss was

                There is an interesting echo of my father's relationship to the Rockefellers in my parents’
                    relationship to the Ball family of 
                        Muncie
                    . According to my mother, when my dad selected 
                        Muncie
                     as the city he would study "he did not know that 
                        Muncie
                     was dominated as much as it was by the Ball family."9
                    
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     placed heavy emphasis on economics, as in the chapter on "The Long Arm of the Job." My mother
                    comments, "It became very clear that there were two classes in the community, which we called the
                    business and working classes."10 She herself came from a very meager

                     economic background. The family took in boarders to make it
                    possible for the three girls to attend college, and my mother, as a student at Wellesley, made sure
                    not to take a nickel with her when she went downtown for fear that she would use it to buy an apple.
                But the first 
                        Middletown
                     book, for all its emphasis on economics, placed less stress on what my father later in
                    life called business as a system of power. By contrast, 
                        Middletown
                     in Transition contained an equally wellknown chapter entitled "The X Family: A Pattern
                    of Business-Class Control." The X family was the Ball family, makers of glass jars for preserving
                    fruit and vegetables. Once more according to the lore dispensed at the Lynd kitchen table, after the
                    appearance of the second book my parents no longer received Christmas cards from the Balls.
                
                    Whose Book?
                
                A few years ago I corresponded with a Dutch student of 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     about how the book came to be published. He was convinced that there was a harmonious
                    relationship between my parents and the committee sponsoring the study. My mother said the opposite,
                    and as I explained as politely as I could to my overseas correspondent, she was there and I believe
                    her. According to my mom, the project that resulted in 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                    
                
                
                    went through various vicissitudes. At times the Institute wanted to drop it. One reason they
                        disliked the manuscript so much at the end was that they said it was savage on religion. There
                        is an account of a Methodist revival that they particularly disliked. Later, the Methodists in 
                            Muncie
                         built a new church, and felt Bob's was the best account there had ever been of a
                        revival service, and in the cornerstone of the church placed a copy of the Bible, and of the
                        Methodist creed, and of 
                            
                                Middletown

                What underlay the dispute between the Lynds and the committee sponsoring their study was not
                    religion, but anthropology. My parents were convinced that any single facet of a community's life,
                    such as religion, could only be understood in the context of the total life of the community. That
                    is why the foreword to 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     was written by the well-known anthropologist Clark Wissler, who called the book "a pioneer
                    attempt to deal with a 
                        
                            11
                            Ibid., 34.
                    
                     sample American community after the manner of social
                        anthropology."12 My mother says, "We were very much interested in what it
                    would look like for an anthropological technique to be applied to an American city. We were
                    fascinated with whether this would work."13
                
                The anthropological approach struck the sponsoring committee as formlessness, according to my mother.
                
                    After eight or nine months, the people at the Institute were discontented because they didn't
                        know where the study was going. And neither did we. Something would come up, and that would lead
                        to something else, which wasn't on any chart….
                    But the Institute people saw what they thought was a formlessness with no schedule being
                        followed. I think it was true that what we were doing didn't fit into any category.14
                    
                
                My mother states that after she and my father completed the second draft of 
                        
                            Middletown
                        ,
                    
                        it sat around for a year because the Rockefeller committee didn't want to publish it. They
                            told Bob that they had read it and they thought it wasn't any good, it was unpublishable.
                            They thought it didn't cohere. They'd never seen that kind of a book before. They didn't
                            think it was interesting, and they thought it was irreligious.
                        It was a grim period. We didn't know the manuscript was good. I was about 26, Bob was under
                            30. It was getting on for four years then, and we had worked long hours and long days….
                        We kept hoping that something would happen that would change their minds. Somewhere along the
                            line Bob showed the manuscript to Clark Whistler [sic] and he said he
                            liked it and would do an introduction. And then, after about a year, Bob asked the Institute
                            people if they would allow him to publish the manuscript if he could find a publisher. They
                            owned it. It was

                            he could was because they were sure he couldn't. They told him so. They said they didn't
                            think he could possibly get it published, but they wouldn't forbid him trying, and if he
                            could get a publisher they wouldn't forbid its publication.15

                There is, however, a gigantic qualification one must make to the suggestion that my parents’ approach
                    was "anthropological." In a nation scarred and significantly defined by the experience of chattel
                    slavery, they chose to study a community that was almost all white.
                Here I must mention a matter that gives me pain and shame. My father grew up in New 
                        Albany
                    , Indiana, just north of the 
                        Ohio
                     River, and in 
                        Louisville, Kentucky
                    , on the other side. Both settings were saturated with racism, as are geographically
                    comparable communities like 
                        Cincinnati, Ohio
                    , and Cairo, 
                        Illinois
                    . My dad, although kindness itself to any African American he encountered, was
                    imperfectly aware of what was implied by jokes and songs that he repeated endlessly. Such a joke
                    concerned the African American soldier who confronted a German soldier during World War I. Each took
                    a pass at the other. The German said, "Missed me." The black man, armed with a razor, replied, "Just
                    wait till you wiggle your haid." Such a song at 
                        Princeton
                     contained the lyric, "It takes a long, tall, brownskinned gal, To make a preacher lay
                    his good book down." Much later, a certain chapter in DuBois's The Souls of Black Folk brought home
                    to me the full horror of those lines.16
                
                In truth, I became conscious of these matters slowly and awkwardly. At 
                        Harvard
                    , I once left a note at the room of a high-school classmate in which I said that I had
                    not seen him in "a coon's age" (another of my father's expressions). My friend had to explain to me
                    that the word "coon" did not refer to a four-footed animal.
                How does 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     justify the decision deliberately to study a city with a "small Negro and foreign-born
                    population"? The introduction states forthrightly:

                            Sketches (
                            Chicago

                    In a difficult study of this sort it seemed a distinct advantage to deal with a homogeneous,
                        native-born population, even though such a population is unusual in an American industrial city.
                        Thus, instead of being forced to handle two major variables, racial change and cultural change,
                        the field staff was enabled to concentrate upon cultural change. The study thus became one of
                        the interplay of a relatively constant native American stock and its changing environment. As
                        such it may possibly afford a baseline group against which the process of social change in the
                        type of community that includes different racial backgrounds may be studied by future
                            workers.17
                    
                
                Some of my parents’ own findings call this baseline methodology into question. The most recent census
                    at the time the first book was written reported that 2 per cent of 
                        Muncie
                    's population was foreign-born, a little less than 6 per cent were African American, and
                    "nearly 85 per cent, in 1920 was native white of native parentage."18 In the 
                        Muncie
                     of the mid-1920s:
                
                    The small group of foreign-born mingle little with the rest of the community. Negroes are … [not
                        allowed] in the larger motion picture houses or in Y.M.C.A. or Y.W.C.A.; they are not to be
                        found in "white" churches; Negro children must play in their own restricted corner of the
                            Park.19
                    
                
                A decade later the percentages of foreign-born and African American families in 
                        Muncie
                     remained 2 and 5.5 percent, respectively.20 But the second book has
                    14 index entries under "Negroes" as compared to 3 in the first. And the authors indicate that when
                    the number of African Americans increases, or when they compete directly with whites for jobs, white
                    hostility escalates. A few Negroes or Jews may be tolerated, "but as the number increases they may
                    become a ‘problem’ and mild antipathies may crystallize into antagonism."21

                    It may have been true in the past that, as a 
                            Middletown
                         employer remarked, "Our Negroes work for the most part at jobs where there is
                        little or no competition from whites. They apply for certain jobs and whites apply for the
                        others"; but in a world of too few jobs such tentative color lines will tend to vanish. And the
                        Negro, always suspect to the whites in a crisis, will tend to receive the full brunt of white
                        resentment as the whites seek to wrest their jobs from them.22
                    
                
                Thus the baseline concept of the first 
                        Muncie
                     study seems questionable in light of the second study. The attitudes of whites when the
                    number of African Americans is small do not tell us much about what their attitudes will be when the
                    numbers are more nearly equal. Likewise the benign tolerance of suburban whites who do not compete
                    with African Americans economically23 does not throw much light on what will be
                    felt by white workers who compete for the same unskilled jobs that African Americans hold or aspire
                    to.
                I think the baseline rationale should be set aside. A simpler way of accounting for my parents’
                    decision to study a community that was almost all white is that this was what their life experience
                    qualified them to do. I often heard my father speak of what "religion" meant to him growing up in
                    New 
                        Albany
                    , Indiana, and 
                        Louisville, Kentucky
                    : it was the experience of standing up to sing hymns with his family in the oak pews of
                    the local Presbyterian church, in the midst of a community to which they belonged. Mother relates
                    that while Dad always said that he could have lived happily in 
                        Muncie
                    , she could not have. Yet she shared with my father the experience of growing up in an
                    all-white community centered on the Protestant church. She wrote about it to a friend after her
                    mother died.
                
                    … The nurse who came in for night care was a stranger to me but said she was in Mother's "circle"
                        at the Church and told of letters Mother had written her when she was ill. I asked her if she
                        had known Father and she said, "Oh, yes, I joined Grace Church under Deacon Merrell."

                    The man who has done painting and odd jobs for Mother for years came in and looked at her, tears
                        streaming down his face. He said that the first anniversary of Father's death he had turned down
                        a ticket to the World Series so that he could be painting at the house as he knew it would be a
                        hard day for Mother.
                    Before the funeral service began as we were sitting in an alcove apart from the "friends" a woman
                        came over, put her arms around us and kissed us-the woman who had done cleaning for  Mother my first years in college when Adela and Margaret were in
                        high school. And two of the people whom Mother took in to board to help on expenses when we were
                        going through college.
                    The new minister was a well-meaning, banal, boy scout hard to bear…. But he, too, took on stature
                        when he read with quiet dignity the passages we selected for the service …. I'm glad I grew up
                        with that, and that sort of affirmation of "the length and breadth and depth and height" of love
                        "beyond all that we ask or know" is in whatever world I am trying to work for.24
                    
                
                I am convinced that what my parents were trying to do in 
                        Muncie
                     was to excavate this experience of genuine religiously based community from the
                    provincialism and crass materialism with which that experience was encrusted.
                
                    Fetishism And Misplaced Concreteness
                
                A fetish is a material object that has been invested with the powers of the spiritual reality it
                    represents. Thus a mask is a fetish when it is believed to possess the potency of the person or God
                    depicted. Idols are fetishes, and a great deal of the Old Testament is devoted to discussing and
                    occasionally destroying idols.
                Words can also be fetishes. The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead coined the term "misplaced
                    concreteness" to indicate what happens when we attribute to an abstraction like a word the concrete
                    particularity of something real. My mother, as a teacher, would sometimes say to her students when
                    they seemed to be caught up in a discussion of words and labels, "Let's just call what we are
                    talking about X, and proceed."
                I say all this pursuant to a plea that we not make fetishes of the 
                        Middletown
                     books, the city of 
                        Muncie
                    , or Robert and Helen Lynd. Assume for the moment that what I have just suggested is
                    true: that my parents’ experience of African Americans and the foreign-born was limited, and they
                    chose for this reason to study a community consisting almost entirely of persons who were white and
                    born in the 
                        United States
                    . Let's not make a fetish of this decision or of the community thus chosen. Instead
                    let's ask: What would my parents say if they could comment on this decision now? What would they do
                    if they were 25 years old again in the first years of the 21st century, and were once again asked to
                    make a study of the religious life

                     of a typical American community? What would they perceive to be
                    the next step in the anthropological methodology that they pioneered? I am convinced that, if they
                    had to do it again in the 21st century, they would find a way to put the transcendence of racial,
                    ethnic, and national boundaries at the center of their project.
                I remember two movies I attended with my parents as a child. One was a Soviet documentary portraying
                    the surrender of German troops after the battle of Stalingrad in 1943. The Germans were shown in
                    rags, their feet bound in huge clumps of cloth against the cold. Derisive music played as they
                    surrendered. My mother was furious. You don't humiliate a defeated enemy. You don't contemptuously
                    caricature any other human being.
                The other movie was a French film of the 1930s, Grand Illusion. Two soldiers
                    captured during World War 1, an auto mechanic and a middle-class Jew, escape from a German prison.
                    Rosenthal twists his ankle and Marechal becomes increasingly angry with his companion's slow
                    progress. They quarrel and decide to separate. Marechal says, "I never liked your kind anyway."
                    Rosenthal responds, "It's a little late for that." Marechal strides off, singing. Rosenthal calls
                    after him that he is so happy to be rid of Marechal that he, too, can sing, and starts to do so. The
                    moment Marechal is out of earshot Rosenthal, sitting on a rock, begins to cry. Then Marechal's
                    overcoat comes into view at the edge of the movie frame. Marechal takes his friend under the arm,
                    helps him to his feet, and they go on together.
                This movie (which I have watched literally dozens of times) displayed the ethic that my parents acted
                    out at Christmas, when they invited to our home persons who were alone for the holiday and had
                    nowhere else to go. As T S. Eliot says:
                
                    We shall not cease from exploration
                    And the end of all our exploring
                    Will be to arrive where we started
                    And know the place for the first time….25

                    more insight into the social processes of this country than any other I know." Even the
                    characteristically cynical H. L. Mencken proclaimed, "I commend [it] to all persons who have any
                    genuine interest in the life of the American people. … It reveals, in cold-blooded, scientific
                    terms, the sort of lives millions of Americans are leading." And The Nation

                    -Robert S. and Helen Merrell Lynd's 1929 study of 
                        Muncie
                    , Indiana-captured the national limelight should be surprising. Social surveys, one
                    response to the challenges posed by a new industrial order and rapid urbanization, would hardly have
                    been unfamiliar to contemporaries. Similar investigations had been fixtures of the American scene
                    since the late nineteenth century, from Jane Addams's Hull House Maps and Papers
                    of 1895 and W. E. B. Du Bois's The 
                            Philadelphia
                         Negro of 1899 to the six-volume 
                        Pittsburgh
                     Survey of 1909-1914. These ventures, by turns altruistic and anxious, mapped urban
                    poverty, explored the structures of African American and immigrant communities, tracked
                    transformations in rural life, and examined industrial working conditions. By one count, at least
                    2,775 such surveys on various aspects of American life had been completed by the time of 
                        
                            Middletown
                        's publication. Yet no other study was instantly pronounced a revelatory
                    investigation into the modern 
                        United States
                    , a "mirror held up before us," telling Americans "how we live and what we think about."
                    And none would have the impact-or the reach-of the Lynds’ survey2
                
                Indeed, one of the most striking things about 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     was how many non-experts were aware of it. Readers seemed spellbound by the sweep of the
                    Lynds’ findings: that workers rose earlier in the morning than their employers; that schoolgirls
                    preferred silk to cotton stockings; that the newest homes in town lacked parlors; that belief in
                    hell was weakening. A reviewer noted with astonishment in 1929 that "not many years ago it would
                    have seemed incredible that any social survey could achieve the distinction of a big seller in the
                    book trade. This, however,

                     has accomplished." The book went through six printings in its first year of publication alone,
                    and bookstores and libraries could hardly keep it on their

                     was discussed on the front pages of major as well as minor newspapers and journals-from 
                        Florida
                    's Fort Myers Church News, to The American Teacher,
                    to The 
                            New York
                         Medical Week-and in classrooms, community centers, churches, and households
                    all over the country. Its publisher, Harcourt, Brace, and Company, was perhaps justified in its
                    advertisements trumpeting 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     as "the latest and most indispensable word in the new American vocabulary"3
                
                What accounted for the astounding success of this more than five-hundred-page study of an anonymous
                    community in the Midwest? How and why was it judged uniquely illuminating of the modern 
                        United States
                    ? Answers lie both in

                        's content and in its form. Extensive interest in the Lynds’ findings signaled
                    a growing curiosity about what "ordinary" Americans did and believed. It also expressed a
                    fascination with the very social scientific mode that permitted such discoveries. Historian Lynn
                    Dumenil writes that the 1920s were "distinguished by Americans’ growing consciousness of change, a
                    perception that a yawning gulf separated them from the world of only a decade before." As such, 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     located patterns in and imparted shape to a new world, responding to worries over
                    standardization and conformity, changes in work and leisure, and shifting gender roles and moral
                    codes. Or as Good Housekeeping observed of the study, "Nothing is so interesting
                    as ourselves, and this was like looking at yourself in a mirror."4
                
                The fact that 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     seemed to offer definitive, scientific knowledge about the mainstream 
                        United States
                     allowed it to resonate differently than had prior surveys, more narrowly focused on
                    specific problems and reforms. But there is more to the story. The Lynds’ survey also offered a
                    reassuringly familiar picture of just who Americans were amidst unsettling social, demographic, and
                    economic developments. As such,

                     crucial step in the social scientific production of "typical

                    the question of national self-definition-and how broadly accessible social data were coming to shape
                    understandings of the U.S. public in the early twentieth century.
                "The Genus Americanus"
                For contemporary observers, 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     had two separate claims to novelty. The first was its dispassionate, objective, and most of
                    all, anthropological approach to American culture. In his foreword to the study, Clark Wissler, an
                    anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, summed up the shock the book would create:
                    "to most people, anthropology is a mass of curious information about savages," that is, not a tool
                    that had been applied to "civilized" white Americans. Commentators, both popular and scholarly, made
                    much of this new way of looking at the 
                        United States
                    . The Lynds "made an anthropological study of the genus Americanus just as their
                    fellow-scientists frequently study the habits of primitive man in Africa or of the Indian tribes in
                    Central America," reported the 
                        Boston
                    
                    Herald. "Ethnologists and sociologists have been examining the cultures of other
                    peoples in such fashion for a half century, but have only begun to give us an equally objective
                    interpretation of our own culture," proclaimed 
                        Chicago
                     School sociologist Harvey Zorbaugh. 
                        
                            Middletown
                        , he stated, "cannot fail to increase our objectivity in considering the social
                    life of which we are a part." It was this unusual step of viewing U. S. culture as alien or other
                    that made the Lynds’ study so illuminating, claimed Wissler. Until 
                        
                            Middletown
                        , he pronounced, "we ha[d] no complete picture of life in a modern community,
                    especially one that is so nearly objective." The study was a breakthrough in impartial scholarship,
                    "true to life, remorselessly realistic."5

                     applauded its stringently scientific tone. One described the Lynds’ treatment of the materials
                    they gathered as "without any emotional gloss, as clean as a butterfly crisply labeled and stuck on
                    a pin." Impartial observers watching and recording their subjects, another claimed, the researchers
                    "simply turn[ed] the lens of social science upon the flow of community life and let its folkways
                    disclose themselves." The Lynds, of

                    knowledge; their calculated use of the naive observer and sharp critique of 
                        Middletown
                    's commodity culture have been well documented. But the technical apparatus of the study
                    and its particular style of reportage could make it appear otherwise. The Lynds "have collected case
                    reports and their pages are larded with percentages and statistics," explained one journalist. "Our
                    authors do not tell us … [their conclusions] in so many words. They are too unbiased and too
                    scientific to do so." Observed another, "These are the cold, objective facts, as impersonal as the
                    fluid in a laboratory test tube." As such commentary reveals, 
                        
                            Middletown
                        's brand of social scientific realism managed to persuade.6
                
                
                    The second aspect of the Lynds’ study that seemed stunningly new was its object of
                    investigation: "average" American life. Hundreds of studies of gangs, factory workers, immigrants,
                    and paupers predated 
                        
                            Middletown
                        . But the Lynds’ project, many commentators noted, marked a bold departure from
                    "special studies … made of the notorious trio, ‘dependent, defective and delinquent.’" Unlike
                    surveyors who had gone before them, Wissler recognized, the Lynds’ attention was trained not on
                    worrisome subgroups or social problems-"coal miners, teamsters, working girls, etc."-nor indeed on
                    any particular fraction of the population, but on the nation writ large. The rhetorical turn from
                    "others" to "ourselves," from the usual objects of anthropology to "typical Americans," was a key
                    source of fascination for those who encountered the Lynds’ survey. 
                        
                            Middletown
                        , in contemporary reviewers’ words, put "the average American city under a
                    ruthless microscope" and uncovered "the real culture of the American small town." It analyzed
                    national "manners, morals, habits, ideas" and presented "an authentic picture of America in
                    process." It revealed, in sum, "the truth about ourselves." In the Lynds’ hands, 
                        Muncie
                     would become a microcosm of the mainstream

                It was this particular conjunction of objective science and "average America" that enabled a social
                    scientific survey to carry so much weight in public discussions of the day. Historian 
                        Warren
                     Susman long ago pinpointed the interwar years as a time when many "began thinking in
                    terms of patterns of behavior and belief, values and life-styles, symbols and meanings," and made
                    "the effort to find, characterize, and adapt to an American Way of Life." Like Herbert Hoover's
                    ambitious data-collecting project, Recent Social Trends, and the social
                    documentary impulse that would engage so many artists and writers across the next decade, the Lynds’
                    survey was at once a symptom of national introspection and an agent in defining the terms of the
                    discussion. One contemporary admirer of the Lynds’ work put it this way: "the portrait of a
                    community, representative of millions of our population, barely groping for a national culture still
                    to be born, jumps out of their careful paragraphs."8
                
                Moreover, 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     made "the typical" visible, and empirically real, at a moment when any sense of American
                    commonality was difficult to discern and national culture seemed deeply fragmented and unstable.
                    Noting the intense class, racial, ethnic, and political conflicts of the early 1920s, historian
                    Margo Anderson writes that, to many, urban industrial society had come to appear "a monstrous
                    perversion of American ideals and ways of life." The 1920 Census, which indicated that the
                    rural-urban balance of the country was tilting decisively toward the latter and that the
                    foreign-born were overtaking old-stock Americans, "seemed to confirm the pessimist's worst fears."
                    Rather than viewing these trends as harbingers of inevitable social change, elites in Congress and
                    elsewhere sought to reverse the current. It was, of course, a coincidence that the Lynds set out for
                    their 
                        Muncie
                     fieldwork in 1924, the same year that the Johnson-Reed Act, "crudely discriminatory" in
                    its effort to curtail immigration from all countries save those of Western Europe, became law. But
                    in the context of renewed nativism, eugenic designs, and postwar patriotism-indeed, the height of
                    "racial nationalism" in the twentieth century-a scientific description of the 
                        United States
                    , trained not on urban problems but on a "typical" Midwestern town, could act as a
                    powerful cultural arbiter. Like national origins quotas,

                            Middletown
                        , the Lynds mounted a critique of American life, and particularly of modern
                    commodity culture, in the hopes of effecting change. But, perhaps paradoxically, they also put into
                    circulation a newly authoritative representation of that culture. The study would not enlighten
                    readers in ways the surveyors had expected. In the end, the detached and "objective" portrait of U.
                    S. culture found in 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     served to reify as fixed the very aspects of that culture that the Lynds had meant to
                    question.
                
                    A "Representative" Community
                
                One of the most striking aspects of commentaries about 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     was the speedy acceptance of the notion that its authors had discovered a community that could
                    stand in for the whole 
                        United States
                    . This was apparent in journalists’ constant invocation of the words "average,"
                    "normal," and "typical" to characterize the Lynds’ findings. Writing of their portrayal of 
                        Muncie
                    , for example, the 
                        
                            New York
                        
                     Evening Post asserted, "these are normal activities, and ‘
                        Middletown
                    ’ is a normal city." One reporter claimed that in 
                        Middletown
                    , the researchers had found Aristotle's "mean man … the average man." Another wrote of
                    the Lynds, "the reader sees in their picture of 
                        Middletown
                     the spiritual lineaments of Hometown, of Anytown in the U.S.A." Even for John Dewey, 
                        Middletown
                     was "Anytown."10
                
                For those prepared to accept 
                        Middletown
                     as America, what mattered was not that the Lynds had tabulated "representative" rates
                    of unemployment or divorce; indeed, most readers would not have been able to evaluate such a claim.
                    Instead, the advantage of the anthropological stance was that it seemed to have allowed the
                    researchers to penetrate to the very heart of the nation's culture: its guiding habits, political
                    and economic ideologies, and modes of living. Reviews in popular publications easily slipped between "
                        Middletown
                    " and "America" or "

                     challenging-instead more often creating-the dominant
                    understanding of the study as a scientific explication of mainstream American values and behavior.
                    Collapsing any distinctions between Middletowners and himself, the book's reviewer for the Saturday Review of Literature stated, "38,000 of us were recently observed to
                    work, learn, love, and play in a typical though anonymous Middlewestern city." Comparing the study
                    to an unforgiving mirror, he continued: "If you believe it would do your soul good to look at such a
                    reflection of yourself-yourself and all the rest of us-then look into this book's pages-and if you
                    can, keep from unhappy pondering as to what manner of man-and woman-you and all the rest of us are
                    apparently becoming!" "Surely these people cannot be our fellow citizens," lamented another
                    commentator, "they cannot be us. But they are." Embracing Middletowners as "us," this sort of
                    reportage reinforced 
                        Muncie
                    's status as an authentically representative place, one profoundly revealing of the
                    modern 
                        United States
                    .11
                
                There were deep ironies in such endorsements of 
                        Middletown
                    's typicality. One British commentator pronounced that the Lynds were "determined to get
                    at the normal in American life." This was certainly true. However, the Lynds explicitly eschewed any
                    claim for their site's typicality in the introduction to the first study. They wrote: "although it
                    was its characteristic rather than its exceptional features which led to the selection of 
                        Middletown
                    , no claim is made that it is a ‘typical’ city, and the findings of this study can,
                    naturally, only with caution be applied to other cities or to American life in general." Over the
                    years, both researchers reiterated this disavowal. Of course, by titling the study "
                        Middletown
                    " and by describing it as an account of "contemporary culture," the Lynds did suggest
                    that 
                        Middletown
                     was representative of something larger than itself. As a shrewd reporter for the 
                        
                            New York
                         Evening Post observed, "To have called the book by the actual name of the city
                    … would have made it only another social survey. But to call it

                More paradoxically still, Robert Lynd had selected 
                        Muncie
                    , indeed sought it out, for its atypicality in one key respect. Whereas the original
                    plan for the study that became 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     had called for a high level of ethnic and racial heterogeneity at the field site, Lynd settled
                    on 
                        Muncie
                    , a town he believed to have a small African-American and foreign-born population. This
                    was not an oversight, but a carefully considered aspect of the research design-one that broke
                    dramatically with the emphasis of both prior social surveys and contemporary studies like those of
                    the 
                        Chicago
                     School on urban minority and immigrant populations. Middletowrn's
                    authors, however, reasoned that there were scientific advantages to dealing with "a homogeneous,
                    native-born population," namely fewer "variables" to contend with. Explained Robert Lynd to his
                    sponsoring agency regarding the decision to limit the study to native white American stock: "The
                    reason for this is obvious: since we are attempting a difficult new technique in a highly
                    complicated field, it is desirable to simplify our situation as far as possible. The interaction of
                    the material and cultural trends in the city with our native psychology is problem enough without
                    introducing into this initial study the complicating factor of a psychology molded by a foreign
                        environment."13
                
                What was supremely incongruous given 
                        Middletown
                    's received status as a representative American community, however, was that a
                    population as ethnically homogeneous as 
                        Muncie
                    's was, as the Lynds themselves pointed out, "unusual in an American industrial city."
                    Subsequent scholars have substantiated this statement, pointing out that the 
                        Muncie
                     of the 1920s "was strikingly different" from the majority of American industrial cities
                    because its ethnic diversity was so limited. Populated largely by farm-born factory workers, it was
                    a "demographic curiosity," more "old stock" (88 percent of the population) than any other Midwestern
                    city of its size apart from New 
                        Albany
                    , Indiana (where, interestingly enough, Robert Lynd was born). In contrast, the overall
                    percentage of African American residents in the city more closely matched national patterns. In
                    fact, in contrast to the Lynds’ belief, 
                        Muncie
                    's black population was growing faster than the native white population and was larger,
                    proportionally, than that of cities like

                            original plans for the study, see Galen Fisher's letters to William L. Bailey of January 22

                        New York
                    . Yet Robert Lynd stipulated in his plan for the study, "the elimination in so far as
                    possible of consideration of the negro element." In flat social scientific language, 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                    's Note on Method-itself a scientific innovation praised by many scholars-announced, "no
                    answers from negroes were included in the tabulations." "Civilizing" anthropology's traditional
                    subjects by turning from exotics to "ourselves" would have the effect of almost completely excising
                    non-white, non-native, non-Protestant Americans from the study's pages.14
                
                If for the Lynds, 
                        Muncie
                    's African Americans and immigrants were "complicating factors," not constitutive
                    components of the community, so too were most of the pressing, and even typical, problems of
                    American cities in the 1920s. "The very middle-of-the-road quality about 
                        Middletown
                     would have made it unsuitable for a different kind of investigation," announced the
                    Lynds in the opening pages of their first book. Here they reinforced the novelty of their survey,
                    its turn to the normal and average: "Had this study sought simply to observe the institution of the
                    home under extreme urban conditions, the recreational life of industrial workers, or any one of
                    dozens of other special ‘social problems,’ a far more spectacular city than 
                        Middletown
                     might readily have been found." By labeling "spectacular" and "special" the everyday
                    forces reshaping U.S. cities, the Lynds implied that such forces were aberrant, and therefore not
                    truly representative of mainstream American life. 
                        Muncie
                    , on the other hand, was sought out precisely because it was sheltered from "extreme,"
                    if common, urban conditions. Indeed, the more deeply the Lynds’ representative community is probed
                    for signs of representativeness, the more the claim unravels. Historian Richard Jensen has noted,
                    for example, that of all American cities of 
                        Muncie
                    's size in 1930, ninety percent had a greater proportion of women in paid employment.15
                
                The exclusion of black and immigrant 
                        Muncie
                     from their "total-situation study" suggests that the Lynds’ vision of average America
                    was less an empirical than a normative proposition. Even in selecting a small and

                     Midwestern city for their site, the surveyors (and their sponsoring agency) displayed
                    their presuppositions about what parts of American culture, and which Americans, were truly typical.
                    Robert Lynd's choice of 
                        Muncie
                    , historian Richard Wightman Fox argues, was "the product of his belief that the hope
                    for social progress lay uniquely in the spirit and vision of the ‘substantial type’ of American, the
                    native-born Protestant of the Middle West," rather than the foreign-born industrial workers he would
                    have found elsewhere. That the Lynds began their investigation with a concern for "urban industrial
                    civilization" and wound up in 
                        Muncie
                     indicates that, despite their professed interest in contemporary culture, the
                    researchers chased a backward-looking 
                        United States

                        Middletown
                     was a representative community more wished-for than real, its studiers steeped in
                    nostalgia for a purer, simpler, indeed pre-industrial, America.16
                
                The Lynds’ rendering of typical America and their assumptions as to what constituted "normality" were
                    seldom noted by either general or

                     academic readers. The few observers skeptical that 
                        Muncie
                     could stand in for America were social scientists wary of making claims outside the
                    bounds of a strictly defined scope. A member of Indiana University's Department of Economics and
                    Sociology, for instance, wrote to Robert Lynd regarding the "rather live controversy over the
                    relative merits and limitations" of the "case study" versus the "statistical study," and pronounced
                        
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     to be an example of the former since it did not permit "generalization beyond the cases
                    studied." Those who noticed the survey's other source of ungeneralizability-its omission of blacks
                    and marginalization of "ethnics"-were rare indeed. Perhaps not surprisingly, such recognition came
                    only from those closely linked to surveyors’ old terrain of "social problems": religious and social
                    workers. In an otherwise laudatory review of 
                        
                            Middletown
                        , The Christian Century noted that "there is no way of proving that the
                    community which they have studied is typical. In some respects it is not entirely so, chiefly
                    because it is too homogeneous racially, has too few foreigners and Negroes. The typical American
                    city is not so strictly ‘American.’" The writeup of 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     in Social Service Review stated: "one of the unwarranted claims of this
                    investigation is that it is a ‘total situation study of a contemporary civilization.’… The student
                    of race relations would look in vain for adequate material dealing with this perplexing problem." On
                    the other hand, many reviewers (including this last one) remarked upon and critiqued the Lynds’
                    neglect of any analysis of Prohibition.17
                
                In general, however, commentators, believing the surveyors had found something "as close to the
                    average as could be attained," did not reflect upon what was missing from the Lynds’ picture of a
                    representative community. And even when they did, they were more likely to praise than to condemn
                    the Lynds’ method, as did one reviewer who described 
                        Middletown
                     as a city that "remained ‘American’" since it contained "comparatively few foreigners
                    and fewer Negroes." H. L. Mencken caught a key distinction, observing that the Lynds, in selecting a
                    site for the study, "did not seek the one that was most completely typical, but simply the one that
                    was as thoroughly American as possible." His words neatly capture the analytic confusion at work in
                    the term "typical." The same confusion can be

                     glimpsed in a report that listed 
                        Muncie
                    's defining feature as the "absence of peculiarities-lack of contact with big cities,
                    absence of large foreign or negro elements, and non-domination of one industry." Following the logic
                    of the Lynds’ research design, readers not surprisingly concluded that it was 
                        Middletown
                    's lack of "peculiarities," no matter how common those peculiarities were, that made it
                        typical.18
                
                It is worth noting that other regions or populations of the 
                        United States
                     could not make this same leap from the local or particular to the national. Consider
                    the anonymous community "Southerntown," the field site for John Dollard's 1937 study, Caste and Class in a Southern Town. Southerntown was "much less a ‘typical’ American
                    community than 
                        Middletown
                    ," in the words of one reviewer, "typical only of the average small Southern town in a
                    rural county devoted to a staple crop and traditionalized by a black belt history and psychology."
                    Such a historically, economically, and of course, racially distinctive community, it seemed clear,
                    could not represent America. 
                        Middletown
                    , on the other hand-small, isolated, Midwestern, industrial, white, native-born-required
                    no similar list of qualifiers. Although as racially distinctive as Southerntown, it could be
                    considered representative because of its already-imagined averageness, a quality that bore little
                    relation to empirical foundations. In a strange transmutation, that which made 
                        Muncie
                     particular at the same time made it typical. A general public fascination with social
                    science thus coexisted easily with a decidedly unscientific notion of representativeness. Despite
                    the Lynds’ anthropological distance from their object of investigation, their study promoted a
                    vision of the typical that their readers would find quite familiar.19

                    's dubious claim to representativeness did not stop the wide circulation of its image as
                    an icon of the typical. National commentators, as we have seen, rushed to affirm 
                        Muncie
                     as "average America." And a conjunction of interests-economic and cultural, tangible
                    and intangible-would conspire to maintain 
                        Middletown
                    's typicality far beyond the purposes of the original survey.

                     by those who stood to profit from a scientifically derived capsule of the average. That 
                        Middletown
                     was becoming a synecdoche for America was clear in the rush of marketers and
                    advertisers who read the Lynds’ studies to discover the mind of the typical consumer. 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                    's publisher encouraged this interpretation, telling professional advertisers: "Here is the
                    scientific low-down on how the Average American Citizen lives-what he buys, eats, reads, thinks,
                    does in his spare time-and why …it would cost you $50,000 to get this
                    information!" In another instance, Harcourt, Brace publicists vaunted 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     as "just the book that every advertising man has always said he'd go out and make for himself
                    if he only had time." Business Week echoed this assessment, calling the study a
                    godsend to marketers and noting that companies "preparing campaigns for refrigerators and
                    automobiles found it helpful in charting the course of prospective buyers’ expenditures, habits and
                        desires."20
                
                The equation of Middletowners with the general American consumer market only intensified in the years
                    to follow. By the time 
                        
                            Middletown
                         in Transition appeared in 1937, a sales journal could proclaim that "the only
                    two books that are absolutely necessary for an advertising man are the Bible and MIDDLETOWN!" Scores
                    of marketers were not content to stop there, but made pilgrimages to the site itself, flocking to 
                        Muncie
                     to find out what kinds of products "Mr. and Mrs. John Citizen of 
                        Middletown
                    , U.S.A." were willing to buy. Trade journals as specialized as Electrical
                        Merchandising made trips to 
                        Middletown
                     to check on sales figures and buying patterns. Marketers of school products seized upon 
                        Muncie
                    -"as nearly the typical U.S. city as any in the country," with a school system "as
                    typical as could be found"-as the ideal place for targeting their customers. When the journal Sales Management commissioned a public relations survey on ordinary citizens’ view
                    of large corporations, this too entailed a visit to 
                        Muncie
                    , specifically to every twentieth residence thereof, to tap into the townspeople's
                    ostensibly representative opinions. 
                        Middletown
                    , the journal commented approvingly, was the perfect "testing laboratory." Similarly,
                        McCall's magazine visited every 
                        Muncie
                     subscriber's home and ran an article picturing

                    , noted the writer, "in the aggregate constitute by far the most important group of
                    people sociologically and market-wise in America."21
                
                Other businesses and individuals reaped benefits, albeit less concrete, from the cultural summation
                    that the Lynds had provided. A certain investment in the typical, and in shorthands for the nation,
                    for example, was evident in Margaret Bourke-White's 1937 assignment to photograph 
                        Muncie
                     for Life magazine. The resulting photo essay, published to coincide
                    with the debut of 
                        
                            Middletown
                         in Transition, cashed in on the city's status as "typical America."
                    Bourke-White's images-the vice president of a local union giving a member of the prominent Ball
                    family a shave, the orderly rows of middle-class housing plots-were meant to encapsulate mainstream
                    patterns of small-town life, work, and family. "Since 
                        Muncie
                    , Ind. is today accepted as the typical U.S. city," the caption under one photograph
                    read, "this picture is a vital document of U.S. life." The magazine announced, "Here, set down for
                    all time, you may look at the average 1937 American as he really is." Readers’ letters to Life included several from admirers of the "set of factual scenes" the
                    photographer had produced, one raving that "in years to come it will be a priceless picture
                    portfolio of the average 1937 town and its people. Bourke-White, added a complimentary reporter for

                Journalists, photographers, marketers, and social surveyors all joined the quest to determine "the

                     historians have shown, surfaced in celebrations of the "common man" and the "American Way

                        United States
                     cultureits allegiance to habit, its lack of self-consciousness, its unexamined
                    ideologies-could begin to mutate into something else entirely: an affirmation of the unchanging,
                    essential, and even laudable core of American life.23
                
                In 1929, many commentators had viewed 
                        
                            Middletown

                            23 See Susman, "The Culture of the Thirties"; Stott, Documentary Expression and Thirties America; and David P. Peeler, Hope Among Us Yet: Social Criticism and Social Solace in Depression America (

                     clarify the challenges facing the nation. Many reviewers of the
                    earlier volume decried the ill effects of standardized work and leisure on 
                        Muncie
                    's existence, and hoped, as did the Lynds, that the study would provoke a
                    reconsideration of cultural habits and attitudes. But as the 1930s progressed and the Depression
                    took its course, the purportedly average American lifestyle that the Lynds described in their survey
                    was slowly revalued, taking on a different, more generous cast. This was most apparent in national
                    coverage of 
                        
                            Middletown
                         in Transition, which subtly shifted the meaning of the "typical" even as the
                    Lynds’ critique of American norms intensified.
                
                    
                        
                            Middletown
                         in Transition won the same kind of plaudits for its scientific approach to
                    culture as had its predecessor. "Mr. and Mrs. Robert S. Lynd with a large corps of statisticians,
                    investigators, etc, have been measuring, counting, adding, subtracting and multiplying all the
                    happenings, economic, cultural and political, in 
                        Middletown
                     for months on end in an attempt to see just how an average town in the nation's Middle
                    West ‘took’ and survived the late depression years," pronounced one newspaper. Once again, there was
                    glowing praise for the researchers’ ability to capture modern America through their capsule study. A
                    writer for the 
                        
                            Chicago
                         Daily Tribune called "The 
                        Middletown
                     Spirit"-the Lynds’ 1937 summation of what 
                        Muncie
                     believed-the "most brilliant synthesis of the American credo of life and living that
                    has been made in our generation." 
                        Middletown
                    , as a headline in the New York Herald Tribune put it, was "as
                    American as a Baked Apple." Another reviewer made the point even more adamantly: "Pick a man up from 
                        Springfield
                    , Mass., or from Fresno, Calif., and set him in 
                        Middletown
                    -and, despite all differences between New 
                        England
                     hills, San Joaquin orchards, and Midwest flatlands, he will feel instantly at home."24
                
                The tone of such reviews had changed, however, between the first study and the second. If
                    Middletowners were often a target of reviewers’ scorn in 1929, by 1937 some commentators were
                    praising the modal American found in the Lynds’ pages. There were those who wondered, in fact, if
                    there was anything wrong with 
                        Muncie
                     as the Lynds pictured it. One commentator wrote in The Christian Century
                        of 
                            Middletown
                         in Transition's cataloguing of "the median American mind" without irony or
                    distaste.

                         Herald Examiner went further, closing his review of the 1937 study with a
                    ringing endorsement of the Lynds’ research site. "More cities like 
                        Middletown
                     are needed here-good, sane, substantial, hard-working communities that breed the best
                    citizens," he proclaimed. Reversing the surveyors’ negative assessment of 
                        Muncie
                     as an ostrich with its head in the sand, the commentator was reassured by their
                    judgment that "
                        Middletown
                     remains singularly the same."25
                
                In a period rife with international tensions, the commonality of the American people and their
                    beliefs, as documented by the Lynds, could also be marshaled politically. "What Herr Goebbels does
                    not know about America," editorialized the 
                        
                            New York
                         Times as war loomed in the late 1930s, "is that when it comes down to a test
                    of American fundamentals, Mr. Roosevelt of 
                        Washington
                    , and Mr. Smith of 
                        Middletown
                    , and Mr. Smith of Oliver Street think alike." The social surveyors’ microcosm had
                    achieved symbolic purchase in the culture at large. Moreover, in some quarters it was being treated
                    not simply as a descriptive account of American life, but a prescriptive one.26

                During the 1930s, the notion that 
                        Middletown
                     typified America was crystallizing. The nearly unanimous praise in the national press
                    for the "truths" that the Lynds had uncovered in their community studies was one thing. The reaction
                    in 
                        Muncie
                    , the object of the Lynds’ endeavors, was quite another. City residents squirmed under
                    the surveyors’ critical scrutiny and protested their interpretations, vigorously questioning whether
                    the Lynds could provide an adequate picture of the place they believed they knew best.
                Locals’ challenges to the surveys ranged from protests over specific characterizations-of the Rotary
                    Club, the school system, and the clergy, for example-to wide-ranging critiques of social science
                    itself. Their suspicion of the impersonal facts that seemed to trump local knowledge and their
                    insistence on the humanity and fallibility of the researchers countered the awed reaction of
                    national reviewers who called 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                     "an amazingly painstaking study," "an extraordinarily objective piece of work," "a gold mine
                    of social data," "scientific and sociological to the last degree," and governed by "the austere
                    principles of modern anthropology."

                     that the Lynds had "gained considerable fame-and we trust,
                    dollars-by making 
                        Muncie
                     a sociological laboratory." Locals found it especially galling that outsiders were
                    willing to take the Lynds at their word and embrace the authors’ supposedly scientific impressions
                    of

                    's practices and values.27
                
                Middletowners’ status as typical Americans might have put them in a unique position to challenge that
                    designation. But for all the uneasiness of residents, and despite their rejection of some of the
                    Lynds’ findings, something of the allure of the typical seeped into the terms of their arguments.
                    Local reaction to the Life photo-shoot is instructive on this score. Initially,
                    many in 
                        Muncie
                     had been flattered by the attentions of a famous photographer. However, Bourke-White's
                    supposedly definitive portrait would stir up plenty of controversy in the city it was meant to
                    represent. As one of the Lynds’ correspondents related after the

                         in Transition was meeting a better reception from locals than he had expected,
                    but only "because they have a new villain, Margaret Bourke-White." Another would report that "the
                    LIFE pictures were vigorously resented here, by practically everybody."28
                
                What about the photographs had riled people? In eleven pages of images, two in particular-which
                    pictured four

                     residents objected to this depiction of class differences, the stark presentation of
                    the shabby one-room shack in "Shedtown" aside the opulent parlor of the Ball family. One man
                    described Bourke-White's approach this way: "she ‘shot’ the upper crust and the lower (soaked)
                    crust, but left out the middle filling, which is the most important part of any community-pie."

                         Press wondered where the pictures were of the "good, substantial middle
                    class." In a letter to Life, he echoed the Lynds’ distinction between the
                    "spectacular" and the "middle-of-the-road" and protested that "The most common adverse criticism
                    (and most of it was adverse) of your series on 
                        Muncie
                    … was: They didn't show the average 
                        Muncie
                     family-only extremes.’" He went so far as to append to the letter his own competing
                    photographs of a truly "typical" 
                        Muncie
                     family. This repeated emphasis on the "middle," whether the "middle filling," the
                    middle class, the "middle-of-theroad," or the largely implicit Middle West, illuminates what the
                    "average" and "typical" were coming to mean in 
                        Middletown
                    , as in the nation. A panoramic view of the range of 
                        Muncie
                    's people and houses was not considered representative; instead, "important," "good,"
                    and "substantial" middling people could best stand in for the whole.29

                Sensitive about their portrayal in the Lynds’ surveys, many townspeople saw in Bourke-White's
                    photographs yet another distortion of themselves and their community. But if the furor over Life magazine and the studies was, on the surface, about accuracy, bias, and the
                    awkwardness of being under the investigator's microscope, it was more deeply rooted in the strange
                    slippage between the typical and the good, the average and the ideal. As we have seen, the two
                    concepts had merged in much of the national coverage of 
                        
                            Middletown
                         in Transition. Similarly, a 1937 editorial in the 
                        
                            Muncie
                         Morning Star anticipated that Bourke-White's photographs would demonstrate
                    that 
                        Muncie
                     was not only the most typical, but also the "best city of any its size." Just as the
                    Lynds’ critical account of 
                        Middletown
                    's ever-widening gap between working and business people had been lost in the rush to
                    uphold average America, Bourke-White's documentation of social differences was critiqued as
                    showcasing "extremes." The typical, at least in its idealized form, could not countenance the hard
                    facts of class and poverty in 
                        Muncie
                    .30
                
                In fact, the convergence of norms and ideals in the "representative community" had begun very early
                    in the study's career, blurring scientific and common sense understandings of the typical. The very
                    first mention of the 
                        Middletown
                     survey in local papers in 1924 announced that the researchers had chosen 
                        Muncie
                     for their investigation "because of its being a typical American city, devoid of a
                    large foreign population and having diversified industries and interests." This was of course
                    already a misreading of the Lynds’ project, but it was not an uncommon one. The claim, usually with
                    a touch of pride, to 
                        Middletown
                    's typicality-often conflated with its being predominantly native-born-was a recurring
                    theme in local reportage of the studies. 
                        Muncie
                    's Chamber of Commerce, for instance, declared itself honored to represent "the most
                    typical American City." It then went on to proclaim in its promotional materials that the community
                    had been "selected as the ideal American City," and even mounted a sign on Main Street reading: "
                        Muncie
                    : The Ideal American City." This fusing of the typical and the ideal involved more than
                    a booster's sleight of hand. It demonstrated the ease by which "middleness" or typicality was
                    becoming a worthy aspiration, 
                        photographs in a subsequent issue. Lewellen was later asked by Life to

                     some years ago." He noted that the editorial director of Collier's
                    magazine " ‘made’ 
                        Muncie
                     regularly and he learned that the city was made up of average American citizens. [His]
                    opinion is that what is read in 
                        Muncie
                     will be read the country over. And he's right."32
                
                Munsonians, it is clear, could simultaneously be dismayed by their social scientific portrait and
                    eager to be called typical. In this vein, perhaps the strangest offshoot of the Lynds’ work was a
                    contest run by the 
                        
                            Muncie
                         Evening Press in 1937 to locate the town's most "typical American family." The
                    designation was based solely on the Lynds’ statistics, and had as its prize a trip to 
                        Chicago and New
                        York
                    -the latter sponsored by the National Institute for Straight Thinking. Many
                    questionnaires were filed in the competition. The winning family, above and beyond fitting the
                    statistical profile, professed to "believe in every opinion cited by Dr. Lynd as held by the typical 
                        Muncie
                     resident." The national press had been quick to fasten upon 
                        Middletown
                     as typical America, paving the way for marketers and 
                        Muncie
                     residents alike to employ such claims for their own purposes. Unusually homogeneous,
                    native-born, middle-of-the-road 
                        Middletown
                     had become an icon of "average" American life. And this, it seemed, was a title worth
                    competing for.33

                    's authors could not have expected this valorization of the average. Robert and Helen Lynd had
                    shied away from labeling 
                        Muncie
                     as "typical," but they saw 
                        Middletown
                     almost immediately enshrined as the epitome of American life. The surveyors worried
                    about the corroding effects of a commercial culture but saw their "representative" research site
                    used as a basis for extensive test-marketing and advertising. Perhaps most significantly, they
                    attempted to heighten awareness of what they saw as disturbing tendencies in modern American life,
                    only to watch their critical account reified as "how things are." Ultimately, the Lynds’ concerns
                    with economic irrationalities and class divides were overshadowed by the all-too-compelling portrait
                    they painted of typical America. This, more than any sort of social critique, would be Middletowri's legacy in the public sphere.34
                
                In yet another twist, the Lynds despaired at the lack of self-consciousness and self-knowledge on the
                    part of Middle to wners, people they claimed were unable to see their culture for what it was. Yet
                    what they unleashed was a relentless examination of "average" American life with 
                        Muncie
                     as the medium. By the 1930s, "
                        Middletown
                    " had become one of social science's most important entities-its "most studied
                    community"-and the Lynds only the first wave of an invasion by social scientists and others. 
                        Muncie
                    , chosen in part because of its atypicality, nevertheless became a scientific
                    "everytown," subject to one survey or poll after another, whether by marketers, political pollsters,
                    or sociologists. As a local reporter put it several decades later, 
                        Middletown
                     "became the place to analyze, to look at, to probe for the ‘typical’ American reaction
                    to almost anything, from Jimmy Carter's presidency to the impact of divorce on school children to
                    the marketability of a new dog food." A 
                        Muncie
                     resident mused in 1982: "The rest of the world perhaps will pardon us if we express the
                    wish that the Lynds had climbed off the train in some other town."35

                Nearly all of these successors to the Lynds took it on faith that a town chosen for its purportedly
                    small percentages of racial and ethnic minorities could represent the nation. Even in times more
                    politically attuned to a differentiated America, social scientific rules of longitudinal comparison
                    kept a truly representative 
                        Muncie
                     from view. As Theodore Caplow, 
                        Middletown
                    's most prolific scholar apart from the Lynds, has acknowledged, re-studies of the town
                    were straitjacketed by the lack of early data on African Americans as well as on Catholics, Jews,
                    and immigrants. Thus a form of social scientific collusion kept 
                        Middletown
                     whiter, more native, and more homogenous than it actually was. Replications of the
                    Lynds’ original questionnaires and survey schedules in the 1970s and 1980s, perhaps for this reason,
                    uncovered the centrality of traditional family and religious values to 
                        Middletown
                    's-and by extension, the 
                        United States
                    ’-population. In the end, the Lynds had indeed chosen a "representative community." But
                    what it represented was less an empirically typical place than an ideologically-loaded argument
                    about what America and Americans should be.36

                     after the first study was published, he admitted that the
                    overwhelming praise for, and staying power of, the books gave him pause. He noted that he became
                    "uneasy" when people "over-play [ed]" the 
                        Middletown
                     books or considered him an authority on American life. The social scientist's
                    reflections might have offered a useful counterweight to the ways the 
                        Middletown
                     studies operated in the public sphere. But it was too late for that. Breaking away from
                    older, reform-oriented survey conventions and acting as anthropologists of contemporary culture, the
                    Lynds-in a particularly authoritative way, and at a critical juncture in national life-had created a
                    new social scientific object: "average America." Given 
                        
                            Middletown
                        
                    's unexpected arrival on the best-seller charts, the study's vision of who and what was
                    typical, and equally, who and what was marginal, would be broadly influential.37
                
                Seventy-five years later, the Lynds’ depiction of 
                        Middletown
                     still colors popular representations of the nation. And it continues to bedevil
                    contemporary political and cultural discussions, which more often than not excise immigrants,
                    African Americans, and urban dwellers-as well as their "extreme" habits and opinions-from "average
                    America." The authentic American of Chevrolet advertisements and political campaigns may no longer
                    always be white, but he or she holds firmly to small-town heartland values. In some sense, the
                    imagined typical, even today, is lodged in 
                        Muncie
                    . But it would be well to ask in 2005: is 
                        Middletown
                     in fact representative of America's essence and ideals as recent national discourse
                    would have us believe? Or does it remain a myth, one so familiar we cannot see that it represents
                    "us" no better than it did in 1929?

                            United States
                        . Since the initial research was begun in 1924, the community has learned to endure
                        the probing of numerous investigators, whose many reports have reflected the tensions and
                        concerns of the scholars searching for clues to the American urban experience. One might well

                    The Archives and Special Collections Research Center
                
                The Center consists of five basic units: the University Archives; Rare Books and Manuscripts; the
                    Stoeckel Archives of local history materials; and the 
                        Middletown
                     Studies Collection. This article focuses on the last two.
                While the Center for 
                        Middletown
                     Studies and the Archives are separate entities, they work cooperatively. Researchers
                    from the Center use the Archives’ collections and facilities. The director of the Archives also
                    serves as archivist for the 
                        Middletown
                     Studies Collection and is an ex-officio member of the advisory board of the Center for

                        Middletown
                     studies and on research that has been done in the collections; he also has the
                    opportunity to meet with local citizens and to pursue additional collections through those contacts.

                     Studies and scholarship that is generated on

                    ; and second, local history materials on 
                        Muncie
                     that support 
                        Middletown

                The first category of records includes material generated by 
                        Middletown
                     research, such as publications, writings, surveys, documentary films, and oral and
                    video histories. The Archives maintains a large collection of articles, excerpts from monographs,
                    research papers, student papers, dissertations, theses, bibliographies, books, and unpublished
                    drafts.
                While the Archives has a few items dating from the Lynds’ original studies (including a pair of
                    letters from Robert Lynd and a copy of an original survey form completed by a local church), the
                    papers of Robert and Helen Lynd are housed at the Library of Congress. Microfilm of the papers (8
                    reels) is available in the university libraries’ microforms area. The papers include correspondence
                    (1923-67), writings (1895-1967), and biographical and genealogical materials (1918-68). A
                    substantial amount of material in the collection relates to sociological research, especially on 
                        Middletown
                    . 
                        Middletown
                     materials in the writings section of the Lynd Papers include comments on the manuscript
                    of the first book, correspondence, reviews, lectures, and research files on such topics as clubs,
                    individual biographies, the Ku Klux Klan, leisure activities, the Ministerial Association, organized

                    materials related to 
                        
                            Middletown
                         in Transition, including a corrected galley, correspondence, reviews, and
                    lectures.
                The Archives holds the records of the 
                        Middletown
                     III research, conducted in the late 1970s, that was the first major replication of the
                    Lynds’ original studies.2 The three lead researchers were Theodore Caplow
                    (University of 
                        Virginia
                    ), Howard Bahr, and Bruce Chadwick (both of Brigham Young University). These records
                    include survey forms and notes, working papers, computer tapes (or data archives),
                    problem-identification sheets, and coding forms. The surveys are divided into categories: American
                    Family; Women; Government and Service; Getting a Living; Religion; Community; High School; and Black 
                        Middletown
                    .
                From an archival viewpoint, one of the more challenging collections is related to the 
                        Middletown
                     film series produced by Peter Davis for PBS in 1982. The series consisted of 6
                    episodes:
                
                    • "The Campaign" followed the 1980 
                            Muncie
                         Mayor's race.
                    • "The Big Game," not surprisingly for the state of Indiana, was about high school basketball.
                        It traced the rivalry between 
                            Muncie
                         Central's Bearcats and the Anderson Indians.
                    • "Community of Praise" investigated a charismatic religious cult based in the 
                            Muncie
                         area.
                    • "Family Business" examined a family's problems as they attempted to save their Shakey's
                        pizza franchise.
                    • "Second Time Around" followed two divorced people as they courted and prepared to marry.
                    The controversial "Seventeen" followed the lives of a racially mixed group of high school
                            students.3
                    
                
                The collection includes videotape copies of each program in the series, scripts and editors’ notes
                    for each episode, and hundreds of reels of outtakes and original film footage that were shot in
                    preparing the programs.4 Producer Peter Davis deposited all this film with the
                    Archives, but for many years retained the rights, so that researchers who wanted to use the films

                Critics have often cited the Lynds’ original work for neglecting 
                        Muncie
                    's minority population, especially the African American community. Ball State professor
                    Luke Eric Lassiter has suggested otherwise: "one can almost excuse the Lynds for missing this,
                    especially because, in recognizing their omissions of ‘racial change’ in lieu of their focus on the
                    larger ‘baseline group,’ they acknowledged that they were ignoring significant heterogeneities such
                    as race and thus encouraged that ‘racial backgrounds may be studied by future workers.’"5 During the last three decades, researchers have followed the Lynds’ advice and
                    have attempted to correct their omissions. Recent efforts have produced new documentation on 
                        Middletown

                Beginning in 1971, Hurley Goodall andj. Paul 
                        Mitchell
                     conducted the Black 
                        Muncie
                     History Project, funded by a grant from the 
                        Muncie
                     Human Rights Commission. The researchers interviewed 38 African Americans who had lived
                    in 
                        Muncie
                     in the early 1900s and also gathered information from pamphlets and newspapers. They
                    published A History of Negroes in 
                            Muncie
                        
                     (1976) as a result of the project.6 The project files include audio tapes
                    of the interviews, transcripts, summaries, and research documentation. In 1981, researchers from the
                    University of 
                        Virginia and Virginia
                     Commonwealth University conducted a "Black 
                        Middletown
                    " study. The Archives holds the tapes and transcripts of their 33 interviews, as well as
                    survey forms completed by more than 450 black residents. The surveys provide information in eight
                    areas: social background; community and family relations; getting a living; making a home; training
                    the young; leisure activities; religious activities; and racial issues.7
                
                In 2003, Lassiter and his students, working with Goodall, developed "The Other Side of 
                        Middletown
                    " project.8 This collaborative ethnography project on 
                        Muncie
                    's African American community included interviews with many black city residents. The
                    tapes and transcripts are housed in the 
                        Middletown

                            Middletown
                         in Transition, the Lynds wrote that "the Jewish population of 
                        Middletown
                     is so small as to be numerically negligible."9 Dan Rottenberg,

                    studies that "virtually nothing about this typically American town escaped the Lynds’
                    notice-including, here and there, references to a miniscule and equally anonymous Jewish
                        community"10 The Jewish experience in 
                        Middletown
                     is documented in two oral history collections in the Archives. A

                The local history collections in the Stoeckel Archives are the largest category of material to
                    support 
                        Middletown
                     research.13 The collections can be categorized in the same manner
                    as the chapters in the Lynds’ original book: Getting a Living; Making a Home; Training the Young;
                    Using Leisure; Engaging in Religious Practices; and Engaging in Community Activities.14 There is cross-over within the categories: for example, family papers that document
                    "Getting a Living" also fall into the "Making a Home" category. But using these categories shows how
                    the collections support 
                        Middletown
                     research in the areas defined by the Lynds.
                Many of these collections were described in the September 1999 issue of the Indiana
                        Magazine oj History.
                    15 The following provides only a brief explanation of the types of materials in
                    each category and mentions a few examples of collections acquired primarily since 1999.16

                        Muncie
                     make up the bulk of this category. Since the gas boom of the late 1800s, manufacturing
                    has been important to this part of Indiana. One recent addition to the Stoeckel Archives are the
                    records of the McCormick Brothers Company. Founded in 1907 as a manufacturer of kitchen accessories,
                    the company later expanded its electro-tin plating operation, produced military materials during
                    World War II, and contracted with U.S. Steel

                            13 The local history collections in the Archives were named after Ball
                            State history professor Althea Stoeckel by the board of trustees in 1979. Stoeckel was
                            responsible for saving hundreds of

                The papers of U. S. Congressman Philip R. Sharp (D-Indiana) opened in 2002 to researchers. Sharp
                    served the Second District (formerly the Tenth District prior to redistricting in 1982) of Indiana
                    for 20 years, arriving in

                    , D.C., as part of the so-called "Watergate Democratic landslide" of 1974. When he
                    decided not to seek another term in 1994, Sharp made arrangements to donate his congressional papers
                    to Ball State University, where he had served as an assistant and associate professor of political
                    science from 1969 to 1974. He also provided funds for political science students to organize his
                    papers in the Archives. His papers include correspondence, reports, legislative issues subject
                    files, town meeting materials, voter profiles, and other documentation that provide evidence of
                    constituency concerns. On the national as well as local and state level, a large portion of the
                    collection concerns energy policy in the 1970s and 1980s as documented in Sharp's files as chair of
                    the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power.22

                Many of the collections fit into more than one category, but one area of collections supports all the
                    categories. The Archives’ photograph collections  are perhaps
                    the materials used most heavily by researchers, students, and the media. Several strong collections,
                    containing over 30,000 photographs in all, document the history of

                     and life in a typical American community for most of the twentieth century. Three that
                    merit particular mention are the Otto Sellers, W. A. Swift, and Spurgeon-
                        Greene
                     collections, which contain over 5,000 images of life in 
                        Muncie
                    . These three collections were described in the 1999 issue of the IMH,24 but since then, the photographs have been digitized and are available in the

                     resources constantly available for students, faculty, and researchers anywhere in the
                    world. As part of the Digital Library Initiative, the Archives uses a digital content management
                    system that allows for searching, browsing, displaying, downloading, and worldwide access. The
                    vision of the Digital Library Initiative is to provide a centralized, user-focused resource,
                    bringing together the digital collections and activities of the Ball State University Libraries in a
                    cohesive and Web-accessible environment that also provides access to external digital resources to
                    support educational and research processes. The 
                        Middletown

                        Middletown
                    ," are available on the Archives’ website. The Archives’ practice has been to develop
                    in-house exhibits and then create a virtual version of each that includes samplings. These virtual
                    exhibits increase the life span of the exhibits and also provide a means to reach a much larger
                        audience.29
                
                Streaming video is being used to promote the collections and help researchers use them through the

                    being prepared on each of the Archives’ collection areas: the first was on rare books and
                    manuscripts, the second on the 
                        Middletown

                When Ben Wattenberg visited the Archives for the First Measured Century
                    documentary, he asked a question that others have asked: Is 
                        Muncie
                     still 
                        Middletown
                    ? It is the domain of scholars to do the research required to answer that question.
                    Whether 
                        Muncie
                     is, or ever was, 
                        Middletown
                     may be beside the point. The city and its residents have kept researchers coming back
                    to the soil that the Lynds cultivated seventy-five years ago. The fact that so much historical data
                    exists to cite, examine, interpret, and compare with new data ensures that there will be a future
                    for 
                        Middletown
                    .
                As long as the researchers keep coming, the Archives and Special Collections Research Center will
                    strive to provide the resources needed to aid them in their research. New technology offers the

                         A Biography of John Purdue, By Robert C. Kriebel, (West 
                        Lafayette
                    : Purdue University Press, 2002. Pp. x, 182. Illustrations, appendix, references, index.
                    Clothbound, $14.95.)
                John Purdue is best known for his gift that made possible Indiana's landgrant university. But how he
                    actually spent his life as a merchant and American capitalist is told in great detail by Robert C.
                    Kriebel in his 2002 biography, The Midas of the 
                            Wabash
                        . Not only does Kriebel detail Purdue's hard work, accomplishments, and public
                    beneficence, but he also reveals his subject's lack of tact, his moodiness, and his notable
                    generosity.
                Purdue was a mentor for many young and aspiring businessmen, some of whom were his business partners,
                    others simply young men he bankrolled. He also had a special affinity for children, whom he often
                    treated to candy and ice cream and took on long, chaperoned buggy rides.
                Purdue used his hard-earned wealth to benefit his community and his state in many ways. For example,
                    he not only served on 
                        Lafayette
                    's first school board, but in the absence of tax funds to support the schools, he used
                    his own money to keep them open. For all of his generosity, Purdue (despite his early, brief
                    experience as a grammar school teacher), knew little about higher education and much less about
                    establishing a university, though he liked to think he did. Two of the stipulations accompanying his
                    gift for a land-grant college were that it be called Purdue University in perpetuity and that he
                    serve on the board of trustees for the remainder of his life.
                Kriebel has done a masterful job of research. He successfully delves into Purdue's occupational
                    environment and political activities. For example, Purdue once bought a 
                        Lafayette
                     daily newspaper for a personal  campaign vehicle in
                    his unsuccessful bid for a seat in Congress. He also invested in a gold mine, as well as an early
                    Indiana railroad, and he owned a large farm near West 
                        Lebanon
                    . He established the Purdue Rifles, a military unit that saw Civil War action under a
                    100-day commitment.
                Following the end of the war and his temporary residency in 
                        New York
                     City, where he bought pork to sell to the Union military forces, he returned to 
                        Lafayette
                    , where a Purdue-for-Congress movement sprang to life. Persuaded by his friends, Purdue
                    ran for Congress, though his naivete in matters political was monumental. Kriebel documents Purdue's
                    accomplishments and portrays his personality as well.
                For the student of Indiana history, The Midas of the 
                            Wabash
                        
                     is must reading. To ignore John Purdue's life is to miss an essential chapter of Hoosier
                    history.

                American writer Ambrose Bierce holds particular interest for students of Indiana history because,

                    , Indiana, when the Civil War broke out. He joined the 9th Indiana Volunteer Infantry

                    . His experience earned him fifteen commendations and, arguably, a career. After the war
                    he became a journalist and made his reputation, in part, by writing disagreeably, but honestly,
                    about his experiences as a soldier and as a civilian. Bierce was one of the few American writers to
                    have served in active combat, and he was one of an even smaller number who refused to  glorify, romanticize, or in any way extol what had been a bloody, often
                    barbaric war.
                It was after he was snapped up by William 
                        Randolph
                     Hearst to be a regular columnist for the 
                        
                            San Francisco
                         Examiner that Bierce's reputation for moralistic invective and political
                    satire became legendary. While his greatest legacy remains his first-hand accounts of the horrors of
                    war-horrors so grievous that they meld into tales of the supernatural-he is today most remembered
                    for a single short story, "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" that continues to appear in literary
                    anthologies, including most recently Tales of Soldiers and Civilians, edited by
                    Donald Blume (2004).
                Readers at all familiar with Bierce might wonder why another publication of these particular tales is
                    necessary. A collection of this name has been published several times, including a 2000 edition that
                    included other stories. The answer lies almost exclusively in Blume's introduction. The editor
                    writes of his efforts in reassembling these nineteen tales that "In the preparation of this edition,
                    for each story six physical texts were considered: the original newspaper text, the edited paste-up
                    copytext to the 1892 text, the 1892 text, the 1898 text, the edited copytext to the 1909 text, and
                    the 1909 text." Blume feels that he has made a thorough study of Bierce's intentions and has thus
                    provided readers with the definitive version of the original collection. Given that the 1898 version
                    included extra stories (for a total of 22), and the 1909 version contained 26, the fact that Blume
                    has reverted to the original 19 is commendable. Blume's edition also surpasses the 2000 edition,
                    published by Penguin Classics, by including an original story that was excluded in the latter. All
                    to the good. Where Blume will lose the general readership, however, is in his heroic but
                    excruciating attention to the smallest details of grammar and punctuation. For example, "Again
                    seeking to follow Bierce's intentions, many more colons appear in this edition than in the 1892 and
                    later collections" (p. xxviii).
                But then, the general reader is not Blume's intended audience. In his introduction he comments in
                    detail upon Bierce's "artfully constructed plots that function on two different levels for two
                    different groups of readers, which we can denote the informed and the uninformed." Presumably, those
                    in the latter category will miss the nuances of this new collection. And so, although Blume's
                    introduction is useful to serious students of Bierce, this volume has a limited audience, and
                    whether it fills any "void in American literature," as the cover claims, is debatable.
                Similarly, the casual reader will find little of interest in A Much Misunderstood Man,
                        Selected Letters of Ambrose Bierce. Editors S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz have selected
                    slightly more than 200 letters from among Bierce's prodigious correspondence. The problem is that,
                    while the editors  have provided voluminous notes that make the
                    otherwise indecipherable letters decipherable, they are not made entertaining or informative for any
                    but the most ardent student of a brief period in 
                        San Francisco
                     literary history. The letters in this collection address and/or discuss, almost
                    exclusively, minor regional authors such as George Sterling, Charles 
                        Warren
                     Stoddard, and Herman Scheffauer. While there are half a dozen or so letters addressed
                    to the likes of William 
                        Randolph
                     Hearst and H. L. Mencken, they do not suffice to interest any but the most limited
                    audience. Furthermore, most readers will find the subject matter of the letters to be rather
                    prosaic. As the editors themselves admit, "it is disappointing how infrequently Bierce discusses his
                    fiction in his letters." Given that Bierce is best known, and loved, for his short fiction, this is
                    indeed problematic. However, someone out there knows and cares about the minutiae of 
                        San Francisco
                     letters at the turn of the century. This is his/her book.

                The Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s attained its greatest strength in Indiana, but the state was relatively
                    free of the violence that sometimes accompanied the rise of the Invisible Empire elsewhere. The
                    rowdy confrontation that took place between robed Klansmen attending a tristate gathering in 
                        South Bend
                     and aroused Notre Dame students was an exception. The skirmishes that occurred on May
                    17 and 19, 1924, resulted in a few minor injuries and arrests but a large number of bruised egos on
                    both sides.
                Todd Tucker, a professional writer whose work has appeared in several national magazines, has put
                    together an engaging account of this 
                        South Bend
                     "riot." He succeeds in placing the event in a broad framework that includes the origins
                    and development of both the Klan and Notre Dame. He provides absorbing biographical sketches of
                    Notre Dame founder Father Edward Sorin; Father Matthew Walsh, Notre Dame president at the time of
                    the disturbances; the university's legendary football coach Knute Rockne; and David C. Stephenson,
                    the infamous Grand Dragon whose unbridled lust culminated with the death of Madge Oberholtzer,
                    leading to his homicide conviction and the  collapse of the
                    Indiana Klan. Tucker skillfully weaves together these stories, and doubtless many will enjoy this
                    spirited account. As a scholarly work, however, the book falls short.
                A Hoosier and 1990 Notre Dame alumnus with an undergraduate degree in history, Tucker had heard
                    nothing during his college years about the 1924 riot or about the influence that the Klan,
                    "Indiana's family secret," (p. xxi) once wielded. In his subsequent effort to learn more, he
                    consulted secondary works, examined documents from Notre Dame archives, looked at contemporary 
                        South Bend
                     and Klan press accounts, and interviewed two surviving riot participants. In his
                    prologue, however, he discloses that for "the sake of the story, I have taken a great liberty" (p.
                    xxiii). In particular he assigns thoughts and feelings to key figures, creates a composite character
                    to serve as a central focal point, and has "extrapolated historical events in order to bring out the
                    drama of the situation" (p. xxiii). As he explains throughout his end notes, he fabricates details,
                    dialogue, and speeches (or sometimes presents them in inaccurate contexts).
                Despite this, the author's speculations often seem plausible, and he is fair-minded in assessing the
                    Klan's broad appeal to so many Indiana Protestants. As a Catholic convert, Tucker is sympathetic
                    towards the Notre Dame students’ outrage at the Klan's virulent anti-Catholicism, but acknowledges
                    that these skirmishes appeared at the time to confirm the ruffian Irish Catholic stereotype and
                    brought some embarrassment to Father Walsh, Notre Dame, and 
                        South Bend
                    's sizable Catholic community. Indeed, the book's subtitle is something of a misnomer,
                    since the riot constituted an immediate propaganda coup for the Klan, and made little contribution
                    to the Indiana Klan's precipitous decline over the next few years.
                The Notre Dame triumph that Tucker outlines stemmed from the remarkable successes of its football
                    team under Rockne's celebrated leadership. The team's championships offset the Klan's denunciation
                    of Catholics, and "offered proof that the University of Notre Dame and Catholic institutions of
                    learning in general could mold successful Americans" (p. 188). Notre Dame would emerge as the
                    nation's premier Catholic institution of higher learning, while Catholics, particularly Irish
                    Catholics, would eventually attain social and political influence, as symbolized by the 1960
                    election of John E Kennedy (although Tucker errs in suggesting that the Catholic Church became the
                    nation's largest denomination after the Notre Dame riot, when in fact it had reached this position
                    by the mid-1800s).
                
                    Notre Dame vs. the Klan has serious flaws. The research could have been more
                    extensive, the methodology more rigorous, and higher value might have been placed on historical
                    accuracy. A comparison of the South  Bend incident with
                    confrontations between the Klan and its opponents in 
                        Ohio, Illinois
                    , and elsewhere would have been useful, although mention is made of the 1923 clash in
                    Carnegie, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , that left one Klansman dead. Yet the book has appeal as a personal quest to probe the
                    meaning of an intriguing part of Indiana history.

                By mid-eighteenth century, private hunters and traders were tentatively probing the 
                        Kentucky
                     country, and speculative land companies were seeking royal charters for acreage to
                    induce settlement. In 1750, Virginian Thomas Walker's scouting expedition found a long-used wild
                    animal and Indian trail, a natural V-shaped passage through the Cumberland Mountains near the
                    juncture of 
                        Virginia, Kentucky
                    , and

                        Cumberland Gap
                    , and the 
                        Ohio
                     River became the principal trans-Appalachian gateways to the conquest and settlement of 
                        Kentucky
                    . Together they provided the setting for one of the great migratory epics in the annals
                    of frontier American history that opened up successive Wests across the continent.
                Incorporating "Mad" into the title for this volume is perhaps metaphorically overdrawn. To be sure,
                    the movement was at times frenzied, even irrational, motivated by the need and desire of hundreds of
                    families seeking to establish themselves on farms in this new West. This possibility became even
                    more desirable as news trickled back east about the rich soil of 
                        Kentucky
                    's bluegrass region.
                The volume's lengthy introduction, approximately one-fourth of the text, is a review sketch of the
                    early settlement of 
                        Kentucky
                    , including the routes the settlers took and the dangers and obstacles they confronted
                    on their journies. The body of the book consists of excerpts from thirteen travel accounts, dating
                    from 1775 to 1796. Anyone who has used early travel accounts as primary source materials for
                    historical research, or has read them in their edited and published forms, knows that they are often
                    rich lodes of descriptions, observations,  and opinions that
                    vicariously inform the reader of experiences in a way otherwise unattainable.
                Of the travelers represented in these accounts, three used the Wilderness Road gateway to 
                        Kentucky
                    ; nine traveled by way of the 
                        Ohio
                     River; and one escorted relatives down the 
                        Ohio
                     and returned to 
                        Virginia
                     by way of the Wilderness Road. As settlement in 
                        Kentucky
                     is proclaimed to be the theme of this book, it should be noted that five of these
                    travelers were motivated by other reasons and had other destinations. Another among them, a
                    slaveholding 
                        Virginia
                     plantation owner, expected to relocate to 
                        Kentucky
                     but later decided to settle in slave-free territory north of the 
                        Ohio
                    .
                Of the thirteen accounts, ten have been previously published in full, two are excerpted from the
                    original manuscripts, and the source of the thirteenth is not listed. Only four of the accounts come
                    with any editorial documentation to help the reader better understand the travel experiences
                    described. Their role here seems to be as appendixes rather than as "edited" centerpieces of the
                    volume.
                The "numerous letters and oral histories" and secondary accounts the dust jacket says were used to
                    support the books introductory essay are cited in the inconveniently located endnotes. A formal
                    bibliography would have been most helpful as a survey to the available literature. With the aid and
                    suggestions of the publisher's editors, this volume might have become a welcome addition to the
                    shelf of books on this important aspect of westering American history.

                Long a story with a grip on the American imagination, the history of the Underground Railroad (UGRR)
                    has recently attracted intensified interest. Programs like Conner 
                        Prairie
                    's Follow the North Star and the opening of the National Underground
                    Railroad Freedom Center in 
                        Cincinnati
                     attest to this renewed focus on the story. With this renewal has come a needed
                    reappraisal.
                Much early work on the UGRR centered on white "conductors" (perhaps in some part as an exercise in
                    expatiation of white guilt over slavery) or attempted to identify houses that were "stations" along
                    the circuitous pathway to freedom. Historians and restorationists soon realized that if every house
                    with a basement or hidden room which adherents claim once hid fleeing slaves actually performed that
                    noble function, the South would have been emptied of the victims of the "peculiar institution."
                Keith P. Grifflers important, wellwritten account, Front Line of Freedom: African
                        Americans and the Forging of the Underground Railroad in the 
                            Ohio
                         Valley, is part of welcome recent efforts to focus on the role of African
                    Americans in the UGRR. "African American fugitives who were whisked away," he notes, "… were no more
                    than minor characters" (p. 3) in many previous tellings. This "received tradition" of viewing the
                    UGRR through the prism of the white experience ignored the fact that it was "an interracial movement
                    … [that] took the form of white activists working not alone but in concert with African American
                    communities" (p. 8). With black participants’ stories spotlighted, Griffler aptly likens the UGRR to
                    underground resistance movements that spring up among subjugated peoples elsewhere. In this case the
                    front line was not occupied 
                        France
                     of World War II, but the areas along the 
                        Ohio
                     River where predatory slave hunters (often working handin-hand with local authorities)
                    shared the landscape with freedom-seeking African Americans.
                As an example, Griffler relates how Francis Scroggins, a free northern black woman, whisked away an
                    escaping female slave with her master on their heels. Scroggins later led her charge out the back
                    door of a safe house as the angry slave owner tried to break down the front door. Such efforts were
                    white-hot sparks of controversy in river communities, and the author ably profiles the tension-and
                    sometimes the violence-that the UGRR engendered. The book also discusses those who went "behind
                    enemy lines," the Midwest's own Harriet Tubmans. Individually or in groups, these interracial
                    "special forces" went into the South to rescue slaves, often with the active support of the enslaved
                    in the area.
                Griffler does not diminish the important work of whites in the movement. As he points out, the UGRR
                    was a smart, organized effort carried out by people of both races. Perhaps the best known white
                    leader,  one who long symbolized the movement, is Levi Coffin,
                    "president of the Underground Railroad." Coffin's Reminiscences forms part of
                    another new book about the UGRR, Fleeing for Freedom: Stories of the Underground
                        Railroad. Edited by George and Willene Hendrick, the book abridges Coffin's famous work
                    along with William Still's The Underground Railroad, both seminal texts. The
                    Hendricks’ introduction provides a valuable overview of the UGRR and of the lives of Coffin and
                    Still.
                Coffin's Reminiscences is, of course, an important work from which grew much of the
                    public's perception of the movement. In it, Coffin traces his commitment to abolitionism and his
                    involvement in the UGRR. He also tells the often heartbreaking stories of the escaping slaves,
                    including the about-to-be-captured Margaret Garner, who killed her own child rather than "see it
                    taken back to slavery" (p. 91). The editors’ deft condensation of the 700-pluspage work retains its
                    essence while making it more accessible.
                Less well-known than Coffin, William Still was the son of former slaves, a successful 
                        Philadelphia
                     businessman, and a skilled organizer of the UGRR in the East. He kept notes of his
                    activities and the people he encountered, and they formed the basis for his book, originally
                    published in 1872. Prominence in this abridged version is given to the "Christiana tragedy" in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , including the killing of a pursuing slaveowner and the ensuing "treason" trial, but
                    the work also contains smaller, more personal stories. Among them is the fascinating tale of Ellen
                    Craft, who escaped bondage in 
                        Georgia
                     by disguising herself as a white planter and bringing her husband William along as her
                    servant. The Crafts eventually migrated to 
                        England
                    , where they taught in an agricultural school before returning to America to establish a
                    school for blacks in 
                        South Carolina
                    .
                Taken together, these works, one old, one new, shed light on the African American experience in the
                    Underground Railroad.

                The 
                        Chicago
                     and Alton was a midwestern railroad now forgotten by all but enthusiasts of
                    transportation history. During the nineteenth century, however, it ranked as a major carrier and
                    left an indelible mark on the industry. George Mortimer Pullman's elegant Pioneer,
                    his first "modern" sleeping car, ran on 
                        Chicago
                     and Alton tracks, and so did the funeral cortege that brought the body of the martyred
                    President Abraham Lincoln home to 
                        Springfield, Illinois
                    .
                The tracks of the 
                        Chicago
                     and Alton created a roughly triangular network to link the cities of 
                        Chicago, St. Louis
                    , and 
                        Kansas
                     City, and as such it was an important railroad. Unfortunately, its presidents believed
                    that the railroad had achieved its destiny and had no need to reach farther afield. Its motto, "The
                    Only Way," was perhaps indicative of a dangerous form of corporate smugness, because along each of
                    its main routes the 
                        Chicago
                     and Alton was clearly not the only way to ship or travel. The
                    Atchison, 
                        Topeka
                    , and Santa Fe competed along its 
                        Chicago
                    -to-
                        Kansas
                     City route, the 
                        Illinois
                     Central and the 
                        Wabash
                     did likewise between 
                        Chicago and St. Louis
                    , and the 
                        Missouri
                     Pacific and 
                        Wabash
                     offered alternative and better routes between 
                        St. Louis and Kansas
                     City.
                Gene V. Glendinning does an excellent job of tracing the rise and fall of the 
                        Chicago
                     and Alton, and by doing so provides a case study of how not to succeed in business, at
                    least not in the highly competitive business of nineteenth-century railroads. The twentieth century
                    saw the 
                        Chicago
                     and Alton stumbling along financially, confined by poor earlier decisions to one of the
                    most highly competitive territories in the 
                        United States
                    , and overly dependent on a shrinking base of natural resources, mainly 
                        Illinois
                     coal. In the end, it became an affiliate of the 
                        Baltimore and Ohio
                     in 1930, and then in the 1940s became the northern end of the Gulf, Mobile, and 
                        Ohio
                    , a railroad aggressively reaching north from the Deep South.
                
                    The 
                            Chicago
                         and Alton Railroad is far more successful as a book than was its namesake
                    railroad. Physically, this is a beautiful volume, with numerous illustrations to amplify the text.
                    There are not only many photographs of locomotives, but also several that detail the creation of the
                    railroad landscape, and there are maps and advertisements. Glendinning excels at detailing how the 
                        Chicago
                     and Alton acquired its component lines, and then examines its failure to reach beyond
                    its relatively small and comfortable place in the  nation's
                    heartland, as its successful competitors did. As Glendinning observes of President Timothy
                    Blackstone in the late 1880s: "After the push to 
                        Kansas
                     City, he added virtually no new mileage. Nor did he add new traffic by taking over
                    weaker, troublesome short lines. He was content to dominate the relatively limited territory he
                    controlled and leave to others the pursuit of-in his opinion-unwise and unbridled expansion.
                    Blackstone's railroad became increasingly isolated" (p. 115).
                Glendinning nicely blends the strands of national and regional history with those of leadership
                    successes and failures on the 
                        Chicago
                     and Alton. The result is an intriguing case study of a railroad that should have done
                    better than it did. The 
                            Chicago
                         and Alton Railroad offers a good counterpoint to history's fascination with
                    railroad empire builders.

                    From Small Town to Downtown A History of the Jewett Car Company, 1893-1919, By
                    Lawrence A. Brough and James H. Graebner, (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 2004. Pp. xi, 254. Illustrations, maps, tables, references,
                    index. $49.95.)
                The Jewett Car Company, established in 1893 in Jewett, 
                        Ohio
                    , built cars for interurbans, street railways, and rapid transit lines. Seeking a higher
                    profile, more extensive facilities, and wider markets, the owners moved the company to 
                        Newark, Ohio
                    , in 1900. The life of the company mirrored the trajectory of U.S. interurban and street
                    railway systems; it closed up shop in 1919 after several years of rapidly declining production.
                    While many of the cars produced by Jewett were destined for the country's largest cities, Indiana
                    lines were notable among the list of customers.
                Those looking for a full-blown history of the company will not find it here, however. Approximately
                    80 amply illustrated pages of history (totaling only about 30 pages of text) are followed by some
                    170 pages of additional photographs, appendices, references, and index. The authors assume that
                    readers know a fair amount about both midwestern interurban history and the history of car building,
                    so the narrative is adequate, but not definitive. It is also uneven. For example, they devote
                    excessive space to a list of inventions patented by William Wright, Jewett Car Company president for
                    most of the life of the firm, while more significant issues, such as an aborted merger of car
                    manufacturing  companies, are treated sketchily.
                The book's main defect is its lack of footnotes or endnotes. In the introduction to the appendices,
                    the authors state, "as any researcher knows, when digging into the distant past, conflicting
                    information is often found, making it nearly impossible to determine the true facts" (p. 101).
                    Unfortunately, they neither clarify how they resolved conflicts nor provide their readers a road
                    map-in the form of appropriate documentation-to find those conflicts and be able to reach their own
                    conclusions. Anyone whose interest is piqued by a particular quotation or statistic receives little
                    guidance about reading or researching further, other than to try to choose likely sources from the
                    extensive bibliography and cover ground presumably already covered by the authors. In addition,
                    where the authors cite specific archival or manuscript collections in the references, they provide
                    no date, series title, box number, or other standard citation details.
                It is also unclear what criteria the authors used in deciding which photographs to reproduce in the
                    text and which to place in the chapter titled "Photo Album." One example of the confusion this
                    causes: The University of 
                        Illinois
                     "test car" is described and its exterior illustrated on page 27, but its interior is
                    not pictured until page 97, as part of the "Photo Album." Many other photographs are placed
                    seemingly at random, with no corresponding references in the text.
                The primary value of this book, then, is the information in the "Appendix," which is divided into
                    four sections: Table 1, "Roster of Cars Made by the Jewett Car Company"; Table 2, "SurvivingJewett
                    Lot Lists"; Table 3, "Cost Information"; and a fourth titled "Research Data on Cars Manufactured by
                    the Jewett Car Company, 1893-1919." These lists are invaluable to transit aficionados, owners of
                    surviving Jewett cars, and those researching the economic history of car production.

                         Aviation An Illustrated History, By David M. Young, (De Kalb: Northern

                David Young puts aviation in its place in his newest illustrated history, 
                        
                            Chicago
                         Aviation. The author uses many of the organizational strategies  typical of aviation writing-retelling "old-timers’" stories, revealing
                    the relevance of local aviation organizations, digesting for the reader the significance of federal
                    regulations in the business of carrying the mail and building airlines-to show how 
                        Chicago
                     became an "[a]irport to a nation" (p. 133). This local aviation history, however,
                    expands the genre. Young explains how the geography, the existing transportation infrastructure, and
                    capital resources of 
                        Chicago
                     and its environs affected the development of aviation in the city, and he explicates
                    the city's importance to the history of the national transportation system.
                Young documents the role of balloonists and private citizens, such as Wright brothers’ mentor Octave
                    Chanute, in developing Chicagoans’ aeronautical awareness at the turn of the century. In the years
                    following the Wright brothers’ famous flights at Kitty Hawk, 
                        North Carolina, Chicago
                    's most aviation-minded people aimed to turn their city into an international center of
                    aeronautical activity. Air shows sponsored by the Aero Club of 
                        Illinois
                    , established in 1910, brought flyers from all over the world to a city famed for its
                    railroad and manufacturing industries. Club members, many of them wealthy and influential 
                        Chicago
                    -based businessmen as well as pilots, developed the city's first airports. The
                    combination of the Club's advocacy and monetary contributions made 
                        Chicago
                     the hub of nine out of thirty-four contract air mail routes awarded by the U. S. Post
                    Office between 1925 and 1930. By the mid-1930s, airline corporations had usurped the Aero Club's
                    role as arbiter of public relations. Young's chapter on air safety provides a rare look at how the
                    fledgling airlines spent capital downplaying their accidents while railroad passenger services,
                    already in decline, attempted to use this bad news to their advantage. The innovation of the jet
                    airplane pushed the railroad passenger business further to the side and overcrowded 
                        Chicago
                    's two main airports.

                        Chicago
                     and its suburban and exurban areas have played a significant role in the cultural
                    geography of 
                        Michigan, Wisconsin
                    , and Indiana, and Young shows how aviation strengthened

                    book discusses the controversial problem of "The Third Airport." More than seventy years  ago, aviation advocates in 
                        Detroit, Michigan
                    , failed to win the air mail routes which were crucial, as Young argues, to making a
                    city part of the permanent infrastructure of commercial aviation. In the twenty-first century, Gary,
                    Indiana, may win its bid to host the

                    The Treatment The Story of Those Who Died in the 
                            Cincinnati
                         Radiation Tests, By Martha Stephens, (Durham, N. C,: Duke University Press,
                    2002. Pp. xxi, 349. Illustrations, appendices, notes, sources, index. $29.95.)
                This is the story of experimental radiation procedures designed by the radiology group at the
                    University of 
                        Cincinnati
                     Medical School and used on about ninety seriously ill cancer patients from 1960 to
                    1972. Patients tended to be poor, and sixty percent were African American. All died, most before the
                    term indicated by regular diagnosis. They were human subjects in one of a series of more than 4,000
                    such experiments funded by the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and other
                    federal agencies.
                Martha Stephens divides her account into three sections: discovery and public knowledge of the
                    hitherto semi-secret experiments; case studies of selected families; and legal issues and trial.
                    Stephens learned of the radiation experiments about the time they were being concluded, in 1974. As
                    a member of the Junior Faculty Associates at the university, she began her investigations because
                    she felt that "what had happened … touched me directly" (p. 8). "It seemed to me then," she writes,
                    "and it seems to me now, that we had become a secret slaughterhouse, a secret death camp" (pp. 8-9).
                    Her horror and outrage inform the whole book. The author does not offer a history of whole-body
                    radiation, nor an analysis of oncology from the 1970s onward. There is no broad perspective.
                In the early cold war period restrictions upon human subject scientific experiments were fluid. The
                    subjects of these experiments were  generally poorly educated,
                    economically disadvantaged, and unaware of the dangers of massive radiological dosages. Informed
                    consent was nonexistent: verbal assent was sufficient. Dr. Eugene Saenger, the principal
                    investigator, was a respected radiologist. Officials of the American College of Radiology, who
                    investigated the program in 1972, found no fault in its procedures or results. In this same time
                    period, however, Stephens and her colleagues began to investigate these experiments, and then to
                    agitate for publicity about them. Her frustration with what she regards as the inattention paid to
                    their findings shines through her writing. She uses a colleague's statement to open chapter five:
                    "In my own mind, this project borders on what happened at Auschwitz."
                Some of us of a certain age can recall the irradiated dimes we received when the Atomic Energy
                    Exhibit came to town to tout what the later Eisenhower administration would term "Atoms for Peace."
                    We were told that radioactive tracers in the blood would improve medical diagnostics; that food
                    preservation through irradiation would prevent world hunger and starvation; and that new products
                    would flow from the cornucopia of physics and chemistry. Humans became commodities in the process.
                In theory, massive radiation therapies might have proven useful in combating cancer. During the cold
                    war period, when so many other threats loomed over the nation, nuclear tests, militarization of most
                    sciences, and concern for national security research goals led to a cavalier attitude towards
                    research involving human subjects. When some of the affected families finally had their day in
                    court, in the 1990s, their internal squabbling prevented definitive closure. For some families money
                    was important; most wanted an apology from the doctors for the wrongs done.
                In 1994 President Bill Clinton appointed an Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments
                    (ACHRE). The final report, which offers a broad look at the studies and the rationale behind them,
                    was issued in the hope that the legacy of distrust would disappear. But the secrecy lives on-some
                    sections of that final report have recently been reclassified and are unavailable.

                In 1789 Thomas Coke opened the Methodist Book Concern, "the first publishing house in America to
                    initiate the systematic printing and distribution of evangelical books" (p. 46). Nearly one hundred
                    years later Harper & Brothers, a trade press with Methodist roots, published Indiana native
                    General Lew Wallace's bestselling novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. These two
                    events bracket a century of publishing in the 
                        United States
                     that firmly established the evangelical presence in the world of print. Candy Gunther 
                        Brown
                     documents this phenomenon and demonstrates the importance of evangelical publishing in
                    American Christianity.
                
                    
                        Brown
                     defines nineteenth-century evangelicals as Christians who rejected both sacramental
                    theology and liberal rationalistic theology in favor of a theology centered on "the Word," that is,
                    the Bible. Thus, words became a powerful tool in fulfilling the evangelicals’ mission of purifying
                    the world and made their entrance into the publishing profession a natural step.
                
                    
                        Brown
                     posits the existence of an "evangelical textual community" (p. 9) based on a network of
                    nationally distributed books that promoted evangelical cultural values and connected geographically
                    scattered Christians. She examines the composition and function of this "textual community,"
                    highlighting both the success of evangelicals in disseminating their ideas and the tensions inherent
                    in their efforts. She closes by linking nineteenth-century evangelical publishing to its modern
                    counterpart, the vibrant media culture of twenty-first-century Christianity.
                Two tensions 
                        Brown
                     documents illustrate especially well the evangelical dilemma of striving for purity and
                    unity in a fallen world. One conflict involved the pull between loyalty to a denomination and
                    loyalty to a "universal church" of like-minded believers. Evangelical publishers contributed to this
                    tension. On the one hand, denominational presses strengthened church ties by publishing
                    controversial doctrinal work that was compatible with their particular set of beliefs but which
                    heightened sectarian divisions. On the other hand, nondenominational publishing houses and
                    evangelical trade publishers unified their audience by marketing books acceptable to most
                    evangelicals: Bibles, devotionals, biblical commentaries, hymnals, history, memoirs, and eventually
                    fiction. Over time, a core group of these texts evolved into a distinctive "evangelical canon."
                
                Readers embraced this evangelical canon, evidenced by the number of books they bought, and this
                    market success led to a second important tension within the evangelical world. Some publishers
                    eschewed the "commercialization" of evangelical literature, fearing that financial success
                    undermined their ability to influence the world. Most, however, saw that bigger sales meant a wider
                    exposure for evangelical ideas, and they adopted secular business principles as a way to help them
                    spread their message.
                
                    
                        Brown
                    's research is thorough, and her conclusions are an important corrective to the
                    stereotypical portrayal of evangelicals as anti-intellectual and otherworldly. Indeed, evangelicals
                    were not afraid to engage popular culture to reach the "masses" and purify society. They maintained
                    a holistic approach to life in which every action-including reading, writing, and publishing-served
                    a godly purpose. Thus, concludes 
                        Brown
                    , evangelicals’ experience of religion went beyond altar calls and tent revivals to a
                    lifelong commitment to changing the world through the power of words.

                Constantine Samuel Rafinesque was arguably the oddest naturalist of his time. In the early nineteenth
                    century he knew as much botany, zoology, and history as most men in those fields, and he published
                    works on archaeology, linguistics, medicine, and banking as well. So how did this gifted man, a kind
                    of walking curiosity museum, manage to outrage so many of his scientific contemporaries? Leonard 
                        Warren
                    's biography of Rafinesque seeks to answer this question, and to further rehabilitate
                    his scientific reputation. 
                        Warren
                     does a fine job of illuminating Rafinesque and his obsessive drive to find and
                    catalogue new species; what is more, the author examines in depth the troubling aspects of
                    Rafinesque's character and work.
                A great part of the book re-creates Rafinesque's world in the early nineteenth century, particularly
                    the world  of science. Rafinesque, a European immigrant to the 
                        United States
                    , trekked through the eastern portion of his adopted country hoping to make scientific
                    discoveries, build a reputation, and gain a professorship. In botany and zoology, as 
                        Warren
                     shows, Rafinesque did much sound work (acknowledged later by both Louis Agassiz and
                    Charles Darwin). Yet as a collector in the field, his tendency was to create new species rather than
                    lump them together under existing ones, thus often bringing taxonomic chaos to these sciences. A
                    certain amount of controversy is to be expected in any field flooded with new specimens, and 
                        Warren
                     argues that Rafinesque often behaved no worse than other investigators of his time, but
                    what infuriated many powerful scientists of the day was his harsh criticism of anyone who disagreed
                    with him. Rafinesque made enemies, then seemed completely baffled when so many scientists disparaged
                    him or refused to publish his work. He thus often sabotaged his own efforts, and 
                        Warren
                    , an M.D., offers a modern-day medical opinion of why this might have been so:
                    Rafinesque probably suffered from chronic hypomania. As a result, he took criticism poorly, and
                    often let his imagination outstrip the evidence of his observations, in one case even producing
                    fraudulent work. Thus for his contemporaries, Rafinesque was troublesome, wrong-headed, infuriating,
                    unreliable, and a nuisance to science. He particularly irked Thomas Say, who several times had to
                    retract some of the "new" species found on the Long Expedition because Rafinesque previously, if
                    hastily, had described them. No doubt this animosity was one reason Rafinesque refused to join Say
                    and other scientists at 
                        New Harmony
                    , Indiana, when William Maclure invited him to live in that Utopian community in the
                    late 1820s.
                Despite his failings, Rafinesque was in some ways ahead of his time. He invented and promoted an
                    enlightened banking system aimed at helping the working man. He opposed slavery in all its forms,
                    and he championed Native Americans. And although not a trained physician, he dispensed reasonable
                    medical advice and sold botanical cures that certainly were safer (if not more effective) than most
                    of the harsh chemical medicines then in standard use. When Rafinesque taught for seven years at
                    Transylvania University in 
                        Lexington, Kentucky
                    , one of his few safe havens, he impressed many students with his knowledge and lively
                    lecturing. Little wonder that over the last century some scientists have reevaluated his work in
                    their specialties and have come to appreciate its merit.
                This biography's greatest strength, however, lies in 
                        Warren
                    's reappraisal of not just some specialties but all of Rafinesque's
                    endeavors, as wide and varied as they were. 
                        Warren
                     writes crisp, clear prose, which serves him well in tackling many unconnected,  diverse topics. Indeed, this diversity leads to one of the few
                    drawbacks in the work-by covering so much background for so many subjects 
                        Warren
                     often disrupts the narrative flow, leaving one hungrier for more of Rafinesque and less
                    of his times. Still, the reader comes away from this work satisfied that Rafinesque at last has
                    found the biographer he deserves, one with sympathy for his subject, yet able to evaluate his
                    shortcomings fairly and judiciously.

                    Women at the Front Hospital Workers in Civil War America By Jane E. Schultz (

                In Women at the Front Jane E. Schultz significantly enriches the scholarship
                    surrounding women nurses of the Civil War. Her ambitious study of Union and Confederate caregivers
                    dispels traditional myths that portray these women as superhuman, selfsacrificing embodiments of
                    white middle-class morality. In the first part of her work, Schultz establishes the broad panorama
                    of women's experiences as hospital workers. In the second, she examines how wartime experiences
                    affected women in the aftermath of the conflict. Schultz traces women's adjustments to peacetime
                    society, their struggles for pensions, and finally, the vast array of their narratives.
                The author's investigation of the implications of social class, race, and region sheds new light on
                    these women who have largely escaped historians’ notice. Analyzing Union hospital records collected
                    in 1890 for some 21,000 female workers, Schultz develops a general nursing profile: assignments as
                    nurses and matrons were given primarily to white middle-class women, while workingclass, immigrant,
                    and black women (both free and slave) often performed duties more like those of domestic service
                    workers. Social class thus helped to exclude all but about 6,000 out of 21,000 women workers in
                    Union hospitals from eligibility for the 1892 Army Nurses Pension Act.  Race was an even stronger factor, for among the 2,000 women identified
                    by hospital records, only one black woman is known to have received a nurse's pension. Racial
                    tensions in Union hospitals and camps were high, and contraband runaway slave women were especially
                    subject to abuse.
                Confederate nurses were legally ineligible for the federal plan. During the war, social class
                    differences had been the primary factor in work assignments in Confederate hospitals. A few socially
                    privileged leaders like Mary Livermore felt empowered by their Civil War experiences, but Schultz
                    demonstrates that after the war the vast majority of women nurses, North and South, struggled with
                    the realities of poverty and race.
                In the last section of the book, Schultz's comprehensive survey of women's written accounts of their
                    nursing experiences raises intriguing questions about narrative voice, sectional bitterness, and
                    changing gender roles. In a study so comprehensive and vast, however, omissions and occasional
                    overstatements seem inevitable. Schultz's discussion of how women received nursing appointments
                    gives little attention to the conflicting roles of state sanitary commissions, the U. S. Sanitary
                    Commission, and the Christian Commission. Given the popularity of Florence Nightingale's textbook on
                    nursing and the practice of home nursing that included knowledge of homeopathic medicine, perhaps
                    she too quickly concludes that few women had useful training. While few statistics identify the
                    number of women who died as a result of their service, the author might give more attention to the
                    women who sacrificed their lives.
                For students of Indiana history, Schultz's omission of the role played by the state sanitary
                    commission, one of the most active in the Union, is disappointing. Future studies could also include
                    the work of Dr. Chloe Annette Buckel, nurse trainer at the gigantic Jefferson General Hospital in 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , Indiana, the medical training of the Sisters of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods in 
                        Terre Haute
                    , and a discussion, from rich archival sources, of 
                        Indianapolis
                     nurses. Finally, Schultz fails to acknowledge two of Indiana's best known Civil War
                    nurses, pioneer physician and women's rights leader Dr. Mary Frame Thomas of 
                        Richmond
                     and the intrepid Eliza George of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . Honored by the local soldiers’ aid society and by the Indiana State Sanitary
                    Commission, and given a full military burial, Eliza George and her now-deteriorating monument in
                    Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's Lindenwood Cemetary remind us of the many talented and dedicated women who too often
                    remain invisible.
                Jane Schultz is to be commended nevertheless for an excellent study of the women who played crucial
                    roles in a war that still has continuing legacies. While not detracting from the heroic efforts of
                    thousands of Civil War nurses, Women at the Front is a  reminder of the social and racial stratification of American society
                    and of bitter sectional divisions that have continued to fester into the twentyfirst century.
                    Schultz's comprehensive study is essential reading for an understanding of women's contributions to
                    the Civil War and to our nation.

                    The Civil War Soldier A Historical Reader, Edited by Michael Barton and Larry M.
                    Logue, (

                One of Michael Barton's and Larry Logue's primary goals in assembling these twenty-seven articles and
                    chapters is to introduce the non-professional reader to the past twenty-five years of Civil War
                    research. Some earlier writings are also included by way of points of departure or foils for the
                    newer scholarship. The focus is entirely on the ordinary soldier, and rarely are generals or
                    politicians mentioned. The editors summarize their five-fold organization of the volume under the
                    headings: "Who the soldiers were, how they lived, how they fought, how they felt, and what they
                    believed" (p. 2).
                In the introduction, the editors articulate their own scholarly predisposition. "In our own research
                    we have been deeply interested in one overarching question: What were the essential social,
                    cultural, and even psychological differences between Union and Confederate soldiers?" (p. 3). To
                    bring out some of these differences, they include Logue's own contribution on the efforts to recruit
                    young men in 
                        Mississippi
                    . Unlike Northerners, these Mississippians were overwhelmingly preoccupied with
                    "society's racial equilibrium: the fear of life with the bottom rail on top echoes through soldiers’
                    explanations of why they were in the army" (p. 44). Logue also makes us aware of the reluctance of
                    Southern youth who lived in the counties along the 
                        Mississippi
                     River to sign up for military service. As often as not, they would disappear west of
                    the River.
                Reinforcing the notion of distinctiveness within the Confederate Army is an older (1957) but most
                    welcome article by David Donald. "The distinctive thing about the Confederate army," he writes, "is
                    that Southern soldiers never truly accepted  the idea that
                    discipline is necessary to the effective functioning of a fighting force" (p. 176). Donald describes
                    the prewar lives of many young Southern farmers, craftsmen, and gentry who were set in their ways,
                    acted independently, and were ardent individualists.
                In contrast to these articles which stress distinctions between Union and Confederate soldiers,
                    however, there are as many pieces in this collection which argue the opposite point: that Northern
                    and Southern troops had much in common. This approach is contained in several items by Bell Irvin
                    Wiley. Although writing about the life of the common soldier in the North, what Fred A. Shannon says
                    could equally be applied to the South: "The soldier, especially in the first year of the war, was
                    the victim of ignorant officers, of swindling contractors, and of unscrupulous Federal inspectors of
                    provisions" (p. 93). Time and again, within the various articles, the shared plight of soldiers is
                    brought out. They had to slog through mud, become soaked with rain, witness their ill-made uniforms
                    fall apart, and experience chronic hunger, to mention only a few common hardships.
                Union and Confederate troops also shared common reactions to combat. Fear often overcame them, but
                    many still managed to keep fighting. They continued to ask themselves why they joined the army, and
                    in their more thoughtful moments fell back on traditional values of patriotism, love of home and
                    family, and religious fervor. As content analysis is applied to soldiers’ diaries and letters to see
                    the emerging patterns, readers are exposed here, as elsewhere in this volume, to recent quantitative
                    approaches to the war.
                This is a fine collection which lends itself to classroom use and to the edification of
                    non-specialists. Somewhat puzzling is why the editors included all the notes from each article, thus
                    lengthening an already long book by many pages. Only two articles deal with the experience of black
                    soldiers, and though these are valuable, one might have wished for a few more. The clandestine
                    military service of women is nicely incorporated, but perhaps the many roles of women near the
                    battlefield and at home might have found a place. To be sure, the focus is on soldiers and battles,
                    but many men went on furlough whenever they could, and some of them just faded away. With an
                    estimated 200,000 deserters from the Union Army and a substantial number from the Confederate, the
                    editors might have paid more attention to the multiplicity of reasons why this phenomenon occurred.

                    , By Robert W. P. Cutler, (

                On the last day of February 1905, elderly dowager Jane 
                        Stanford
                     cried out in the night, "This is a horrible death to die!" Linking her words to the
                    agonies of strychnine poisoning, Dr. Robert Cutler, once neurologist and pharmacologist at 
                        Stanford
                     University (now, most regrettably, deceased) reopened a one-hundred-year-old murder
                    investigation. The book has caused quite a stir, not only because of Cutler's conviction that 
                        Stanford
                     was a victim of foul play, but because of his accompanying accusation of a cover-up
                    orchestrated by 
                        Stanford
                     University's famous early president, David Starr 
                        Jordan
                    . 
                        Jordan
                    , of course, had been plucked by Jane and Leland 
                        Stanford
                     from the presidency of Indiana University to build and expand the university that the
                    couple created to memorialize their only son.
                The story of Jane 
                        Stanford
                    's demise has all the makings of a blockbuster popular history, for at each section of
                    each brief chapter there lies the opportunity to expand upon some observation or story. Cutler's
                    endnotes show his own instinct to follow from newspaper to archive each new twist in the drama, and
                    his judicious reservations about the stories that his main suspect, 
                        Stanford
                    's longtime handmaid and companion, Miss Bertha Berner, provided. Cutler nonetheless
                    finds proof of murder in the medical descriptions of 
                        Stanford
                    's last moments and her early postmortem appearance, descriptions provided by a group of
                    Honolulu physicians who were involved with the alarm, the inquest, and the autopsy. In particular,
                    medical testimony pointed to her tightly clenched fists, her turned, arched feet, and arms so rigid
                    that the undertaker had to reduce the contraction forcibly in order to disrobe the corpse. Further
                    clues of the distinctive progression of strychnine poisoning lie in Jane 
                        Stanford
                    's words of agony to her female companions. An author dedicated to a larger audience
                    might have lingered longer over the frenzy in which medical and legal witnesses were assembled
                    through the early hours of March 1, how the private dining rooms of the hotel were used for the inquisition post mortem, or indeed offered the reader more descriptive detail of
                    the way such investigations and declarations of unnatural death were made a century ago. Readers of
                    a longer version would want more of the fascinating toxicological and pharmacological detail pulled
                    from the notes to the text.
                Cutler's dedication to proving the crime reflects more a mission of delayed justice than it does
                    expose or sensationalism. He became convinced that Starr 
                        Jordan
                    's efforts to suppress a possibly extensive, expensive murder investigation involved  unwarranted and nearly libelous characterization of the medical
                    and public health personnel in 
                        Hawaii
                     who handled 
                        Stanford
                    's body. Thus it is Cutler's secondary purpose in this slender book to rehabilitate the
                    reputations of these men. His principal critique of 
                        Jordan
                     stems from the way the 
                        Stanford
                     University president used his power and position: insinuating the incompetence of the
                    Honolulu medical community in private correspondence, denying his agency when necessary, and
                    allowing newspaper reporters to do the dirty work. Cutler's profiles of the elite Honolulu medical
                    community form a composite picture of the range of medical careers attractive to this transitional
                    generation, when the promises of scientific medicine were far greater than its curative or
                    diagnostic successes.
                I found most convincing the repair work Cutler offered to these reputations, but I reserve skepticism
                    for the sketchy motivations offered to explain 
                        Jordan
                    's private campaigns to suppress the story and impugn the evidence of murder most foul.
                    Moreover, Cutler's conclusion that 
                        Stanford
                     could only have been poisoned is still more possible than likely. Medical records to
                    lend any clinical surety to the author's conviction that 
                        Stanford
                     was, before the poisonings, in robust good health have long since disappeared, if they
                    ever existed. (The routine modern measures of wellness, illness, and aging were not yet part of
                    health maintenance or monitoring.) The toxicological evidence from chemical analysis of 
                        Stanford
                    's body was far more ambivalent than Cutler wished it to be. The insecurity, even
                    near-chaos, of the crime scene presents a further difficulty that Cutler chose not to address
                    systematically. The 
                        San Francisco
                     earthquake and fire, the suppression of unhelpful 
                        Stanford
                     family memorabilia by 
                        Jordan
                     and others: these are the accidents that Cutler points to when the murder trail goes
                    cold. Too much of what would truly convince the reader cannot be wrested from all these silences.
                    But this engaging little book does make us want to know more and to mourn the death of its author.
                    He writes with flair and honesty and above all tells a good story.

                    A Community Built on Words: The Constitution in History and Politics, By H.
                    Jefferson Powell, (
                        Chicago
                    : University of 
                        Chicago
                     Press, 2002. Pp. x, 251. Notes, index. $35.00.)
                What explains the success of the 
                        United States
                     from uncertain beginnings through more than two centuries of challenges and change: our
                    people, our values, our culture, our natural resources, our faiths? All plausible, and partial,
                    answers. Legal scholar H. Jefferson Powell suggests another: our words, particularly the words of
                    our Constitution.
                Powell's rich and ambitious book covers impressive ground, twenty-one chapters devoted to a series of
                    constitutional controversies that span the years 1790 to 1944. Some controversies are relatively
                    familiar: the M'Culloch v. 
                            Maryland
                        
                     (1819) decision that upheld Congress's authority to establish a national bank and found
                    expansive congressional power to enact federal legislation, and the infamous Korematsu (1944) decision that upheld the wartime internment of more than one hundred thousand
                    Japanese Americans. In other chapters, Powell introduces readers to little-known constitutional
                    events of substantial import, such as an obscure period in 1808-1809 that he describes as "one of
                    the most important in the entire history of American constitutional law," in which a Supreme Court
                    Justice, a federal district court judge, and a President each made decisions that were politically
                    unpopular and contrary to personal preferences for the sake of fidelity to the law (p. 110).
                Whatever his subject, Powell provides fresh insights and perspectives, as when he compares successive
                    drafts of State v. Mann (1829), an important judicial decision regarding slavery.
                    Powell's choice of subjects is notable for its appreciation of the complexity of how we as a nation
                    resolve the meaning of the Constitution's words. He goes beyond the typical Supreme Court focus to
                    include interpretations by other actors, including state court judges and elected and appointed
                    government officials. Each section concludes with valuable contemporary lessons that follow from his
                    analysis of historical events.
                Powell presents a strong case for what he terms an "historicist" approach that recognizes
                    constitutional law as "thoroughly historical, dependent throughout on the contingencies of time and
                    political circumstances" (p. 7). He explodes the mythical ideas of law divorced from politics and a
                    bygone age of apolitical constitutional virtue. He establishes that American constitutionalism
                    always has been wracked with sharp, fundamental disagreement shaped by the politics of the time, an
                    especially timely analysis given current views that decry the politicization of the law and
                    misleadingly call forjudges who will not "legislate from the bench."
                
                Powell contends that our twohundred-year tradition of constitutional controversy should be celebrated
                    and appreciated as a source of national strength. American constitutional law, while in some senses
                    inextricably political, also is deeply principled, as evidenced by the author's descriptions of
                    judges and political actors who adopted constitutional positions at odds with their personal
                    preferences and partisan interests. Constitutional law's "coherent tradition of argument" offers
                    "the means by which people of fundamentally different views, beliefs, origins, and visions can
                    become and remain a political community" (pp. 7, 213).
                The concluding chapter deserves a particularly careful read and close reflection. Drawing upon his
                    historicist analysis, Powell develops twenty "shared constitutional first principles" that have
                    gained wide acceptance over time as common ground for debate over less settled constitutional issues
                    (p. 205). While the author may be overly optimistic in his evaluation of the consensus behind one or
                    two of these principles, his approach is normatively attractive and provides a useful summary of
                    fundamental constitutional principles.
                Powell's A Community Built on Words is a masterful work of constitutional history
                    and theory with profound current relevance. Serious students of constitutional law should consider
                    it essential reading. Anyone with a basic understanding of the subject will come away enriched by
                    the gems of information and wisdom that densely pack this slim volume. All participants in our
                    constitutional democracy, from judges to citizens, should heed Powell's lessons and protect,
                    embrace, and cherish our legacy of reliance on constitutional principles to order political
                    controversy and build community.

                This year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of one of Indiana's cultural jewels, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Symphony Orchestra. Thomas Akins, long-time principal timpanist for the orchestra, is
                    now its archivist and the author of this interesting history. Generously illustrated and
                    well-produced, the volume structures the orchestra's history by conductor, beginning with Ferdinand
                    Schaefer, who personally selected a group of area musicians and sent them invitations to join the
                    new orchestra. The history concludes with the current maestro, Swiss-born Mario Venzago, before
                    moving topically through the orchestra's educational programs, its volunteers, biographies of
                    current musicians, a history of the orchestra's current home (the Circle Theater), and a complete
                    roster of all the musicians and staff from the seventy-five-year history. The book concludes with a
                    comprehensive discography. Anyone who has enjoyed ISO concerts over the years will love this volume;
                    historians will learn a great deal about the orchestra's cultural and economic contributions to

                McCulloch (1808-1895) was born in 
                        Maine
                     and moved to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     in 1833. He trained as an attorney but spent his career in banking, becoming president
                    of the Bank of the State of Indiana in 1855. President Abraham Lincoln asked McCulloch to become
                    Comptroller of the Currency and later appointed him as Secretary of the Treasury. McCulloch stayed
                    on as Treasury Secretary until 1870, served in the post briefly again in 1884, and died on his farm
                    outside

                This is a memoir written by Russell J. Milne, Sr., edited by his son, and inspired by long
                    conversations between the two. The senior Milne (1904-1981) was born in 
                        Monon
                    , Indiana, became an orphan at the age of 5, and was passed between relatives for the
                    next seven years. At the age of 12, he struck out on his own and went to work. Milne moved back to
                    Indiana when he was 18 and lived there until 1951, when he moved to 
                        Florida
                    , where he spent the remainder of his life. The book contains pictures of the author
                    from childhood through adulthood.

                    addresses, it will be a handy primary source for historians of Indiana's judiciary system.

                A professional river guide for more than forty-five years, Huser discusses each of the rivers
                    traveled by the Corps of Discovery, details the currents and wind patterns of the rivers, and
                    outlines the benefits and hazards of river travel. He also devotes space to each of the water craft
                    used by the explorers. When this volume is read as a complement to the expedition journals, it
                    brings the Corps’ river experiences to life.

                        Kentucky
                     resident and poet, Walker read the Lewis and  Clark
                    journals in the evening, dreamed about the experiences, and awoke to compose poetic "fictitious
                    observations, thoughts, feelings, dreams, visions, and words of York," William Clark's black slave
                    (p. xiv). The volume reprints some diary excerpts, and the poetry is written in subtle dialect.
                    Walker's York comments on Lewis (a swooning scribbler), Clark (companionable and considerate), and
                    revisionist history ("by and by I seem to disappear … as if I had never been there" [p. 61]).

                Author, filmmaker, and collaborator with Ken Burns, Duncan collects into this volume several essays
                    given on a variety of occasions. He tends either to expound upon discrete events, such as purchasing
                    supplies in 
                        Philadelphia
                    , and quilt-making family members at home; or upon repeated occurrences, such as
                    snoring, encountering bears, and sitting by a fire. Duncan concludes with ten rules for modern
                    leaders ("never give up," "be lucky," and so on) as well as tips for modern trail tracers.

                    Jr., and Barbara Mason, (Carbondale: Southern

                Hoosier native Silas Trowbridge was a schoolteacher in 1840s Indiana, after which he moved to 
                        Illinois
                     and took up the study of medicine. His 1872 memoir, here in a reprint of the original,
                    begins with the doctor's early education and practice but focuses mostly on the period from April
                    1861 through August 1864, when Trowbridge was a surgeon for the 8th 
                        Illinois
                     Volunteer Infantry. Trowbridge gives details of important battles (including Fort
                    Donelson, 
                        Shiloh
                    , Corinth, and Vicksburg); offers frank assessments of several Union commanding officers
                    (he deems Gen. Lew Wallace's conduct at 
                        Shiloh
                     "cowardly and jealous"); and provides a detailed look at the blood-soaked life of a
                    Civil War surgeon. Readers interested in antebellum and Civil War medicine will want to read this
                    memoir; anyone interested in the larger history of the war will find the 
                        Illinois
                     doctor's observations well worthwhile.

                    , come alive for the reader. As in most other Civil War battle narratives, there are
                    detailed maps and discussions of troop movements and individual skirmishes. McDonough's narrative is
                    made more readable, however, by his inclusion of the experiences and opinions of individuals. This
                    volume will be of interest to the many readers who like detailed profiles of individual battles, but
                    it will also appeal to those who are interested in the western theater and in the last major battles
                    of the war.

                These articles are anthologized from the journal Columbiad (1997-1999), a journal which sought to
                    bridge the gap between academic and popular scholarship on the Civil War, and to combine rigorous
                    research with lively prose. The essays include treatments of this very divide amongst academics and
                    non-academics; and revisionary work on Henry W. Halleck, George B. McClellan, 
                        Franklin
                     Pierce, and Sherman's campaign against Meridian, 
                        Mississippi
                    . There are also essays on the shaping of popular memory of the Civil War in the
                    twentieth century, the logisticians at 
                        Gettysburg
