            <head>The Nomination of the Democratic Candidate in 1924</head>

            </byline>
            <p>One of the strangest among the phenomena of American party history is the Democratic National
                    Convention of 1924, in which all the elements that tend to divide the Democratic party combined to
                    produce a bitterness such as had never been seen in a political convention before and to send the
                    number of ballots required to name a candidate to the record figure of 103.</p>
            <p>Historians are familiar with the problems that caused the <hi rend="i">impasse</hi> and have
                    frequently analyzed their significance. Students of politics find in the convention a demonstration
                    of how diverse are the interests represented in the Democratic party. There is one question
                    regarding the convention, however, that has largely gone unanswered, and frequently unasked. That is
                    the question of how it happened that John W. Davis became the nominee of the party. This is an
                    important question, for it represents the first time since 1860 that the party had gone south of the
                    Mason-Dixon line for its candidate, unless Woodrow Wilson, born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, but nominated from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>, be considered an exception. The nomination indicates also the triumph of the
                    metropolitan element in the party that was to lead it to defeat in 1928. John W. Davis was the
                    second choice, not of the forces which had kept William G. McAdoo in the lead during most of the
                    convention, but of the forces of Al Smith—the urban, Catholic, and financial interests in
                    the party. Mr. Davis was not a Catholic,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> but if the convention is to be

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> The writer is under the necessity of using the term <hi rend="i">Catholic</hi> in connection with this study of the convention of 1924. All readers
                            should understand that it is not used as a term of disrespect. The student of history cannot
                            shun the fact that prejudice existing in different parts of the country has resulted in a
                            defensive political alliance which includes a large portion of the adherents of the Catholic
                            Church.</item>

                    victory for the Catholic forces, for they threw their support to him. Certainly he represented the
                    urban and financial interests of the party. His southern residence was an advantage in gaining the
                    nomination, but had contributed little to his political philosophy.</p>
            <p>The failure to analyze the conditions that produced his nomination resulted from the suddenness of
                    the outcome. The convention, after balloting uselessly for one hundred ballots, finally and suddenly
                    threw its whole strength behind the banner of John W. Davis. In the rush to dig out of their
                    "morgues" biographies of John W. Davis and to interview him upon the campaign, the
                    journalists forgot to investigate or report the causes of the stampede. Historians, because of an
                    overshadowing interest in the deadlock itself, have contented themselves with the explanation that
                    the delegates were tired, but, as a matter of fact, the background of the nomination is one of the
                    most thrilling chapters of the convention story.</p>
            <p>There are, as every student knows, two opposing factions in the Democratic party.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> These divisions lie generally to the north and to the south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Democrats in the Old South are members of the
                    ruling class, whose one fear and general campaign issue is the Negro. They look back upon the
                    Reconstruction era and forward to the possibilities of assimilation with the same feelings.
                    Aggressively Protestant, essentially rural, inherently aristocratic, they have never made
                    proscriptive organizations of the type of the Ku Klux Klan unwelcome among them. In the spring of
                    1924, the Klan and William Jennings Bryan combined to repudiate the outstanding political figure of
                    the South, Oscar W. Underwood, because he was opposed to the ideals of the Klan and to the legal
                    theories underlying the Eighteenth Amendment. They decided to support William G. McAdoo, son-in-law
                    of the canonized Woodrow Wilson, whom they sought to make the political heir of the war-time
                    President.</p>

                    generations are its elements removed from Europe, and their one political voice cries for the
                    enlargement of the opportunities of the common man. The victims of Ku Klux Klan attacks from the
                    standpoint both of their national origins and their Roman Catholic religion—for a large
                    part of them were Catholic in 1924—they were determined to defeat the candidate of the
                    Klan and the Anti-Saloon League. They found support in the fact that the business interests of the
                    East were suspicious of McAdoo, among other reasons, because he had been a party to the government
                    control of the railways during the Wilson administration. They rallied for the fight around the
                    standards of Alfred E. Smith (whom they called "Al", the tremendously popular
                    governor of the state within whose borders the convention was to be held), able administrator and
                    brilliant personality.</p>
            <p>The battle lines were tightly drawn, and the newspapermen at the rim of the battlefield early
                    predicted the breaking of the record for the duration of the convention,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> when
                    William R. Pattangall of <placeName>

                    </placeName> sallied forth from the Eastern ranks with a gage of battle. He offered a resolution
                    condemning by name the Ku Klux Klan.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The battle was bitterly fought by the most
                    brilliant speakers on both sides, including William Jennings Bryan himself. His closing address
                    turned the tide and the amendment was lost by less than half a vote. But the religious issue was
                    clearly before the convention, and nothing now could keep it out of the minds of the delegates.
                    There could be no compromise. Race and religion were chief among the issues and both sides stood
                    firm on their ground long after the fifty-nine ballots it had required to nominate Franklin Pierce
                    in 1852 had been exceeded.</p>

                    were taken, the totals were very nearly the same on each test—more than five hundred
                    votes for McAdoo, more than three hundred for Smith, but more than seven hundred necessary to
                    nominate. Neither side would yield. Compromise after compromise was proposed. John W. Davis, Samuel

            <p>Then up rose William Jennings Bryan, thrice the nominee of his party for the Presidency, loved by
                    many, and respected by most of the citizens of the nation he had served and sought to serve. He
                    began to speak, but his speech of a few days before had marked the end of his influence in the party
                    he had once ruled. No longer was his voice able to soothe the fires. He spoke in the same sonorous
                    voice that had excoriated August Belmont a dozen years before, but when he spat upon Wall Street
                    now, all <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> spat back at him. The Bronx-filled galleries heckled the old leader unmercifully. A <placeName>

                    times but was now genuinely sorry. A voice from the gallery hoped this would be Bryan's
                    last convention appearance.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>.</p>
            <p>Governor Smith, who had possibly never expected to win the nomination, offered to withdraw from the
                    race if McAdoo would do the same, but the ex-Secretary of the Treasury, whose acceptance of the
                    offer would have allowed him practically to name the convention's choice, refused to
                    consider such a proposal or to release his delegates. On and on the battle raged.</p>
            <p>The leaders of the contesting forces both had tremendous personal followings. The McAdoo celebrations
                    of each Sunday took on the aspect of revival meetings.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The Smith loyalty was

                    it was a convention beyond the control of the bosses that usually dominated the choice of the
                    presidential candidate. Delegates voted, in larger proportion than usual, for the men they sincerely
                    respected or whose principles they upheld. Hundreds of them faithfully obeyed the instructions of
                    the voters <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Wiliest of all the bosses was Thomas Taggart, who had been an important factor in Democratic

                    candidate. He was a Protestant, perhaps a little tinged by the Klan, yet beloved by the Catholic
                    Democracy of the state he had long served. He possessed many of the same Victorian virtues that made
                    President Coolidge popular. He said little, made very few opponents, and no enemies. Two years
                    before he had succeeded in defeating a famous man, who had earlier served Indiana in the Senate for
                    twelve years, Albert J. Beveridge. Ralston had endeared himself to the conservative members of his
                    party in the East by this victory. At the same time, his record had been liberal enough that Bryan
                    could look upon him with friendly interest.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                    second choice of the Smith followers, Ralston's success seemed to observers in the press
                    gallery to be a matter of a few ballots only.</p>
            <p>But Tom Taggart was more experienced in convention manipulation than were the newspapermen. As he
                    looked around him, he was worried because he sensed that the boom had come too early. For a while he
                    gave the tide toward Ralston his support, but after a few more ballots he became confirmed in his
                    belief that there was still so much strength in the two battling armies that his candidate would be
                    crushed between them and definitely eliminated when the first evidence that support for him was
                    fading should become apparent.</p>
            <p>While Ralston was still gaining, Mr. Taggart drew from his pocket the letter that the Senator had
                    written him two days before. He strode to the platform and read it, asking Ralston's
                    following to allow his withdrawal in the interest of harmony. He then split the thirty Indiana votes
                    between McAdoo and Smith and sat back to wait. He frowned upon the votes that were cast here and
                    there for his candidate.</p>
            <p>On the eighty-seventh ballot, Taggart felt that the time had come for a move. Both factions would now
                    welcome a flank movement that offered relief from exhaustion. Indiana's return to Ralston
                    on that ballot was the signal for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> to follow, and before the ballot was completed, the Hoosier Senator had gathered

                        <region type="county">Union</region>
                    </placeName>. Steadily he climbed almost to the two hundred mark by the time adjournment came.
                    Reports became prevalent over the convention that on the next morning McAdoo would withdraw in favor
                    of Ralston, assuring him four hundred and fifty additional votes.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    division of the spoils were already under way.</p>
            <p>At this important moment came a phone call from <placeName>

                    </placeName> for Mr. Taggart. The champion told the Senator of the day's events in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> City and spoke in glowing terms of the advance of the Ralston vote to nearly two
                    hundred. The Senator failed to become equally excited. "Yes," he said, "I
                    know all about it; listened to it on the radio; audibility perfect and clear."</p>
            <p>He would be nominated beyond doubt in a very few more ballots, Taggart informed him. All the
                    delegates were now so near exhaustion that they would ask few questions once the boom was started.
                    Everyone would be fighting to get on the band-wagon while there was still patronage left.</p>
            <p>The group surrounding Mr. Taggart sensed a difficulty and interrupted their conversation to catch the
                    reply. They puffed carefully at Mr. Taggart's cigars, but only that gentleman heard the
                    calm voice of the man in <placeName>

                    within his reach.</p>
            <p>"My family does not wish me to take it," the Senator said deliberately,
                    "and my own views coincide with theirs." His doctors, too, had told him it would
                    be unwise for him to accept.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Mr. Taggart was amazed was not surprising, despite the warnings he had been given. He protested
                    volubly. But his friend was sincere and remained stubborn. Nothing could budge him from the belief
                    that a man of sixty-eight years was too old for the presidency.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Finally Mr.

                    Governor Smith and his campaign manager, Franklin D. Roosevelt, were at the Biltmore. Along with
                    them were George Brennan, Democratic boss of Ilinois whose adherence to Smith had lost him the
                    long-time friendship of Taggart, Wilbur Marsh, and a number of others. All were talking John W.

            <p>On the morrow, July 9, the convention, which had first assembled almost three weeks before, heard Mr.
                    Taggart, now heart-broken, for the second time withdraw the Indiana Senator's name. On the
                    one hundred third ballot, the convention zestfully nominated John W. Davis of West <placeName>

                    was proposed by Thomas Taggart.</p>
            <p>There is a type of mind that is forever seeking the occult and refusing to accept explanations that
                    are either simple or complimentary to the actors in any political drama. This type of mind is
                    especially prone to deal with politics. Hence there is a legend around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and elsewhere that makes Ralston refuse the nomination because it would have entailed
                    an obligation to provide for friends of Governor Smith. It is nothing less than absurd.</p>
            <p>Senator Ralston was mentioned throughout the convention as an ideal compromise candidate. If there
                    had been any enmity at all between him and the Smith faction, there could have been no such mention.
                    It was the enmity of Bryan towards John W. Davis, of course, that kept him from being the nominee
                    much earlier. Senator Ralston, moreover, as we have seen, had at least twice before, when no bargain
                    with Smith was in view, asked that his name be not presented. Though the statement before the <placeName>

                    were given, in the light of the final refusal, they must be considered sincere. Finally, since

                            Pat Harrison corrobrates the whole of Michelson's story (A copy of the account had
                            been sent to him) and adds: "I haven't the slightest doubt that if Senator

                            that the doctors had told him that he could not, that Ralston would have been nominated
                            within the next twenty-four hours. At the time of the telephonic communication there were
                            groups of delegates in Taggart's room from many states—delegates who had
                            been voting for other candidates, but who were voluntarily coming in and assuring the
                            Ralston managers that they were ready at the appropriate time to swing over to Ralston. If
                            Ralston had only given his word and permitted Taggart and the Ralston managers to proceed,

            <p>At some time, presumably after 1876, the remaining New Londoners seem to have moved away from the
                    town. There are two legends which developed through attempts to explain this desertion of the
                    village. A romantic and highly fantastic tradition is that river pirates made it unsafe for
                    habitation. It is true that previous to the Civil War points along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> were the scenes of pirate activities, but there is no evidence to prove that New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> was disturbed by such outlaws. Captain Leander Gordon, now living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was a pilot on the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> for sixty-five years, has a
                    slight remembrance of the town. He recalls the fact that his parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Dean Gordon,
                    were married in New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but he thinks that they did not live there after marriage.</p>
            <p>The other tradition, the one which Mr. Baylor felt very sure about, was that New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the seat of one of a chain of counterfeiting gangs with the main branch at Saint
                    Louis. It was not far from, possibly on, the "Old National Road," as it was called
                    by the villagers, which ran through <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
               </placeName>, and Saint Louis. It is thought
                    that government officials broke up this gang or that the members scattered to avoid arrest.</p>
            <p>A different reason for the depopulation of the settlement was offered by Captain Gordon. His
                    explanation seems more credible than the two presented above. High waters, a prelude to the final
                    destruction, flooded the town at various times. The natural result was that the people moved out
                    from time to time to protect themselves and their personal property. After one of these floods, it
                    was found that the land on which the vacated town had been located had been literally washed away.
                    Mrs. Baylor remembered hearing her sister tell of seeing some undermined houses fall into the river.
                    Professor Grant T. Wickwire, head of the department of Geology at Hanover College, agrees that such
                    a thing as that described by Captain Gordon could easily have happened, since New <placeName>

                    likelier to enjoy permanency than fair or indifferent fiction or mediocre verse." No county

                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> which has had several men of more than ordinary ability who devoted themselves to that
                    branch of literature. Foremost among them was the Hon. David Rohrer Leeper, one of the most
                    conspicuous figures in the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> for many years and who is still remembered by all of its older citizens.</p>
            <p>David R. Leeper was born on January 12, 1832, in a log cabin some distance northwest of what was then
                    the little village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The place has been located a few rods north of the point where the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> road crosses McCartney Creek. That part of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> road is now <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> avenue and the city extends miles beyond the birthplace of Mr. Leeper, which is not a
                    great distance from the business district. The cabin in which he was born was built of round logs,
                    had a puncheon floor, stick chimney and greased paper windows. It had been hastily built by his
                    father, Samuel Leeper, upon arriving in Indiana from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. In the year 1834, the family moved to a heavily wooded tract three miles southwest of
                    the village, but now almost within the city limits. Then began the arduous work of clearing up a
                    farm in which labor, as soon as he was old enough, the boy David had his share. The first
                    schoolhouse in that section of the country was built on this farm and David Leeper attended that
                    school during the short winter terms, working on the farm or in the woods the remainder of the year.
                    When he had mastered the branches of learning taught in that school, he attended the county seminary
                    several terms. Alternate school attendance and farming continued until he was seventeen years old.
                    While he was attending the seminary, news came that gold had been discovered in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. In a very short time nearly everybody had the gold fever, <pb n="15" id="VAA4025-031-1-021"/> young Leeper being among those infected. His father finally consented
                    to let him go to the new land of promise, and, along with several young men of the neighborhood, he
                    started on February 22, 1849. The company had two ox teams with enough money and other necessaries
                    to see them through the long, tedious and perilous journey.</p>
            <p>The difficulties which the seventeen year old boy and his companions encountered were enough to
                    discourage any but the stoutest hearts. The roads were wholly unimproved, those in the timbered
                    regions merely cut through. There were few bridges over the streams. To add to their troubles there
                    had been a February thaw causing the streams to be swollen and all the prairie roads to be deep with
                    mud and slush. At LaSalle, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, they were delayed a week by high waters. Half the town of Peru a few miles farther on
                    was submerged by floods of the <geogName>Illinois River</geogName>. At Burlington, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> was so far out of its banks that the
                    distance across was seven miles and they had to make the crossing on a rickety horse-ferry boat.
                    From Burlington they traveled through sparsely settled territory to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>, <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
               </placeName>. With the
                    exception of small groups of huts at Fort Kearney and Fort Laramie, they did not see the home of a
                    white man until they reached the Sacramento valley, a distance of two thousand miles by the route
                    traversed. They reached their destination on October 11, seven months and nineteen days after they
                    started from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Years afterwards Mr. Leeper described his travels and adventures in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> in a fascinating book, <hi rend="i">The Argonauta of '49</hi>, which
                    unfortunately is out of print.</p>
            <p>The party stopped at Redding's Diggings, but they did not like the place and moved on. The
                    rainy season had set in and by some means Mr. Leeper got separated from his companions on the way to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sacramento City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and never saw them again. He went on alone, reaching the city after traveling
                    thirty-six hours on foot without food or money. His first work there was the making of several
                    coffins from rough boards for miners who had died and had been laid out in their red shirts and blue
                    overalls on boards in the rear of the hotel. From Sacramento he wandered to Coloma where <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marshall</region>
                    </placeName> had made the discovery of gold. He mined until the following fall when he went to
                    Humboldt where the lumbering industry <pb n="16" id="VAA4025-031-1-022"/> was just beginning to be
                    developed. There he engaged in the logging business which he continued until 1854, when he started
                    for home, coming by way of the Nicaragua route. At Greytown he sailed for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the steamer <hi rend="i">Star of the West</hi>, the vessel that seven years later
                    was sent to relieve the garrison at Fort Sumter and was fired upon by Confederate troops.</p>
            <p>After his return he finished his schooling at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName> Institute, but not his studying, for he was a student all his life. His reading covered
                    a wide range and included history, science, political economy and questions relating to government.
                    For years he was recognized as one of the most scholarly men in the circle with which he was
                    associated. He taught several terms in the rural schools of his neighborhood and as a teacher
                    displayed the energy and thoroughness which characterized him throughout his life.</p>
            <p>In 1864 he went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName>, where he remained four years. In 1866 he was nominated for a seat in the territorial
                    legislature and, although he was not elected, he received the highest number of votes of any
                    candidate on the ticket of his party. As his ancestors were Whigs, he early identified himself with
                    that party. When the Republican party arose he became a member, and it was as a Republican that he
                    made the race for representative in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName>. However, through an extensive study of history and governmental problems, he found
                    himself out of harmony with the Republican party by 1872. Along with men like Lyman Trumbull, Gov.
                    Andrew G. Curtin, George W. Julian and many other former Republican leaders, he became a Liberal
                    Republican and then a Democrat. In 1872 a coalition of Democrats and Liberal Republicans nominated
                    him for representative from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> county, but he declined. In 1876 he received the democratic nomination for the same
                    office and accepted. He was elected and served acceptably in the legislative session of 1877. In the
                    same legislature was a young member from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermillion</region>
                    </placeName> county who was destined in later years to have a conspicuous part in the
                    state's activities. This was Claude Matthews, afterward Secretary of State and Governor of
                    Indiana. Having much in common in the way of scholarship, literary tastes and political convictions,
                    Leeper and Matthews became closely <pb n="17" id="VAA4025-031-1-023"/> associated and the friendship
                    then formed continued until death laid its icy hands upon Gov. Matthews.</p>
            <p>In 1878 Leeper was elected to the state senate from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Starke</region>
                    </placeName> counties. He served the four year term and at each session was assigned to several of
                    the most important committees. In 1882 he declined the Democratic nomination for congress in the old
                    thirteenth district. While he was ready at all times to uphold the principles of his party, he had
                    no taste for office holding. However, he did finally consent in 1882 to become a candidate for
                    auditor of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> county, a position which he was admirably qualified to fill. He was defeated along with
                    all the other Democratic candidates in the county, although he made a splendid race. His successful
                    opponent in that campaign was Aaron Jones, a prominent member of the Grange and one of the most
                    astute politicians of his day and generation. In 1892 Leeper received the unanimous nomination of
                    his party for mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The nomination came to him entirely unsolicited and was reluctantly accepted. The
                    Democrats were anything but hopeful of winning in the city election that year but believed that if
                    anybody could be elected it was Leeper. He was elected but most of the other candidates on the
                    ticket were defeated. At the end of his term, he declined a renomination. In January, 1895, his
                    friend, Gov. Matthews appointed him to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> police commission upon which he served until March, 1897. The legislature of 1897
                    passed a law providing for the reorganization of the metropolitan police boards in the state. In
                    January, 1899, Mr. Leeper was again appointed as a member of the board, this time by a Republican
                    governor, James A. Mount, and served until his death. He was also vice president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> National Bank. In all of these positions his incumbency was marked by faithful,
                    painstaking, conscientious service. In 1892 Mr. Leeper and the writer of this article were appointed
                    as delegates to the Farmers' National Congress which met in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>, <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
               </placeName>.
                    Fraternally, Mr. Leeper was a thirty-second degree Mason, an Odd Fellow and a Knight of Pythias.</p>
            <p>David R. Leeper was best known during the last years of his life as a writer. In fact, it is as a
                    writer that he is remembered by those still living who knew him, and as such his name will be handed
                    down to future generations of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> citizens. <pb n="18" id="VAA4025-031-1-024"/> His writings were principally on local
                    history and no man in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> county was better equipped for that line of work than he. Born and reared amid pioneer
                    surroundings, he knew many of the early citizens of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> county. He saw <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> grow from a small hamlet to a city with a population of over 75,000 at the time of his
                    death. He was an eye witness of the changes that took place and the progress that was made by both
                    city and surrounding country through more than three-score years. His wide circle of acquaintances
                    enabled him to obtain information from many sources and he made the best use of his opportunities.
                    Besides, he spent a great deal of time delving into the old musty records of both city and county
                    digging up many items of importance which nobody but a painstaking man like him could have found.
                    The old files of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi>, as well as of the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>, contain many contributions
                    from his versatile pen. If they could be gathered together they would make a volume of no mean
                    proportions and of almost priceless value.</p>
            <p>As a writer, Mr. Leeper was careful almost to a fault. No matter what subject he chose to discuss he
                    was not satisfied until he had examined it from every point of view. When writing local history, he
                    consulted every available, authority. When writing about men of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was known to have spent days in the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> cemetery in order to ascertain or verify a single date or the spelling of a name. He
                    was careful also to have his diction as pure as he could make it. He wrote and re-wrote until every
                    sentence was perfect. In fact, the same thoroughness was characteristic of everything he did. As a
                    result every article that bore his signature could be accepted as absolutely correct.</p>
            <p>When the Northern Indiana Historical Society was organized, he became one of the charter members and
                    to the end of his life was one of its active promoters. He was a regular attendant at its meetings
                    and prepared and read many papers at its sessions. These papers which cover nearly every phase of
                    the pioneer history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> County are treasured in its archives and are counted among its valuable possessions.</p>
            <p>He was fortunate in being associated in his mature years with many of the men and women who were
                    among the early residents of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> county. He neglected no opportunity <pb n="19" id="VAA4025-031-1-025"/> to gather from
                    them all of the information which they could give him and his long acquaintance with them enabled
                    him to distinguish between those who were reliable and those who were not. He never was satisfied
                    with interviewing one individual concerning any circumstance or fact, but consulted every one whom
                    he thought might have information that he wanted. He also knew the value of old letters and old
                    documents of every kind and availed himself of their use whenever they were obtainable.</p>
            <p>Not only did he become thoroughly acquainted with pioneer life both through his own experience and
                    that of others, but he also obtained a vast fund of information concerning the Indians. In his
                    boyhood days Indians still roamed over <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> County. Those individuals who were able to furnish him pioneer history and traditions
                    were also versed in Indian lore. From them he learned to know the sites of the most important Indian
                    villages as well as the trails over which they traveled. He also learned much concerning their
                    habits, customs and manner of living. One of his papers read before the Historical Society bore the
                    title, "Our Savage Predecessors—their ancient haunts about the great bend of the
                        <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName>." In this paper he dealt with several topics
                    under the sub-headings: "Indian Dress," "Indian Burying Grounds"
                    and "An Indian Funeral Cortege." In the course of the paper he described and gave
                    the locations of a number of Indian, villages. Another of his papers was entitled, "The
                        <geogName>Notre Dame Lakes</geogName>—Some Footprints of the Pioneers on their
                    Picturesque Shores." Both of these papers were published in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> and future historians no doubt will make use of the valuable data which they
                    contain.</p>
            <p>In addition to his other accomplishments, Mr. Leeper was a fine musician. The first time the writer
                    ever saw him he was playing in an orchestra at a farmers' institute in the old Price
                    Theater in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Leeper died on December 27, 1900, and it may be said that the death of no citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> was ever more sincerely mourned. Previous to the brief illness which terminated his
                    life, he appeared to be the picture of health and gave promise of many years of life and usefulness.
                    Quoting one of the city papers: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Like a bolt from a clear sky came the sad news this morning that <pb n="20" id="VAA4025-031-1-026"/> David E. Leeper had died at an early hour. None were prepared
                            for such mournful tidings. On every side was entertained a sorrow akin to personal
                            bereavement and on every hand were heard encomiums upon the dead and expressions of sincere
                            sorrow over his demise.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>In an editorial written on the day of his death his intimate friend, John B. Stoll, thus summed up
                    the traits and qualities of his character: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>David R. Leeper was a typical American gentleman. Singularly free of prejudice, thoroughly
                            familiar with the history and traditions of nations, and slow but sure to formulate opinions
                            regarding men and affairs, he was enabled to be just and impartial whenever he had occasion
                            to pass judgment. Only those who for years had come in close contact with him could have a
                            fair understanding of his wonderful store of information on almost every subject concerning
                            the human race and the affairs of man. When talking on religious topics it was never a task
                            for him to state with amazing accuracy the tenets of the various religious bodies that
                            constitute the greater part of the civilized world. When the affairs of nations were under
                            consideration the utmost familiarity with their origin, history and characteristics would be
                            revealed. Of our own governmental institutions and their inception and development his
                            delineations were masterpieces of research and completeness. If music chanced to be the
                            subject of conversation, Mr. Leeper displayed as much familiarity with the productions of
                            the masters as if he had made music the exclusive study of his life. It has been the good
                            fortune of the writer to come in contact with many men of genius and rare ability, but among
                            them all he has recollections of no one whose fund of general information covered so large a
                            scope as that of David R. Leeper. As the writer on more than one occasion said to him:
                            "Some up-to-date college ought to have secured your services to disseminate general
                            intelligence among its students. You might have been of incalculable benefit to at least
                            some of the young men of this country."</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>As a citizen Mr. Leeper was public spirited and was always ready to give his aid to any worthy
                    enterprise. He took a deep interest in all matters that tended to help his home city and to advance
                    the best interests of its people. He did not look with favor on all the projects which were
                    proposed, but did consider each one fairly and when convinced that it was meritorious gave it his
                    hearty support. When a movement had his approval, its projectors usually had no difficulty in
                    securing for it the support of the general public.</p>
            <p>At its first meeting after the death of Mr. Leeper, the Northern Indiana Historical Society adopted a
                    fitting testimonial in memory of the man which deserves a place here: <quote rend="blockquotes">

                        <p>His was indeed a kindly nature. It attracted to him all who came within the subtle influence
                            of his radiance. He was a gentleman of what is known as the old school—polished,
                            refined, kind hearted and broad minded. He loved labor and its results for the comforts it
                            brought humanity.</p>
                        <p>Few men have passed away from the circles of local social and industrial life who will be so

                            dealings with the world he made no distinction of caste or class. He practiced the golden
                            rule in private and public as few men do. Those who knew him intimately were better for his
                            acquaintance, and his friends will mourn for him as deeply as a beloved brother.</p>
                        <p>For his untiring efforts to obtain and place on record reliable local history reciting the
                            stirring events of the early settlement and development of this part of Indiana, this
                            society and the community at large owe him a lasting debt of gratitude. His was truly a
                            labor of love. Without the hope or expectation of material reward he devoted much valuable
                            time, in the latter part of his earthly career, to the gathering and compiling of authentic
                            information that has been imperishably incorporated into history and that will be readily
                            accepted as such by generations to come. History written by David Leeper bears the impress
                            of truth and impartiality and will be prized accordingly by all who remember him as a
                            companion of lovable qualities, as a man of inflexible integrity, as a citizen of exalted
                            character and as an author of exceptional resources and scholarly attainments.</p>

            <p>United Presbyterianism officially began in Indiana with, the union of the Associate Reformed
                    Presbyterian Church and the Associate Presbyterian Church in 1858.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> At that time
                    four Associate Presbyterian congregations,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and twelve Associate Reformed

                    congregations organized later,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> the present Presbytery of Indiana (United
                    Presbyterian) owes its origin.</p>
            <p>In great measure the United Presbyterian congregations that developed in Indiana were descendants of
                    Scotch and Scotch-Irish who in the times of the Stuarts migrated to the American colonies to find
                    peace and religious toleration. In 1883, Dr. James A. Woodburn wrote of these: "For their
                    religion's sake they left their native land, and in their migration to this country by the
                    shiploads, by hundreds and by thousands they brought their religion with them."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> These Scotch-Irish along with German sects from the Rhine provinces settled in

            <p>Fundamental to the Presbyterian system of government is the grouping of congregations into
                    presbyteries. The number of congregations constituting a presbytery varies, never being less than
                    two and seldom more than two score, depending of course on geographical location and accessibility
                    to the congregations included. Prior to the union of 1858, there were two presbyteries, one in each
                    denomination: the Presbytery of Southern Indiana in the Seceder (Associate Presbyterian) church; and
                    the Presbytery of Indiana in the Associate Reformed Presbyterian denomination.</p>

                    Behind the names and dates there are many notable accomplishments which cannot be discussed in
                    detail. It seems proper to mention one. During the pastorate of forty-four years filled by N. C.
                    McDill at Richland, the Richland Academy flourished for a decade (1858–1868). The Academy
                    was established by Rev. A. S. Montgomery who was preaching for an Associate Reformed congregation at

                    families of his faith. The school was opened and stock to the amount of two thousand dollars
                    subscribed in 1855. Until the building was completed the following year classes met in the Old
                    School Presbyterian Church. The attendance rose from thirty-nine the first year to sixty-nine in
                    1859–60. An unusual number of young men entered the ministry from this congregation.
                    Probably the Academy and the influence of the church combined were responsible. Following are the
                    names of those who entered the service of the church from this congregation: R. E. Stewart, J. P.
                    Cowan, John C. Stewart, Thomas B. Stewart, Robert E. Stewart, David E. Stewart, Elmer B. Stewart,
                    William M. Butler, Samuel H. McDill, Clarence Pinkerton, Mary E. Logan (missionary to <placeName>

                    Indiana Presbytery have had their part in the nurture of men high in the educational world and in
                    the political, industrial and business life of their respective communities.</p>

                    </placeName> County's inherent poverty and its topographical relation to the most
                    prosperous part of the state paved the way for its present publicity. Lying at the northern boundary
                    of the broken country that distinguishes certain areas of southern Indiana from the level lands up
                    state, it thrusts itself into the central plain as if offering its wild and picturesque surface as a
                    play-ground to the plainsmen of the North who are less favored with romantic surroundings. In the
                    heart of it lies the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, some forty miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>—an easy journey in this auto age.</p>
            <p>A succession of developments has placed <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County in the limelight. After long years in which no railroad touched the County at
                    any point, one of those harbingers of civilization cut across a corner of the region, but missed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> by six miles, so there had to be a connecting bus. By reason of some mysterious
                    atmospheric richness, the hills and dales and wild, woodsy landscapes are bathed in a beauty of
                    tints all their own, and this, coupled with an abundance of log cabins and the quaint living
                    conditions, survivals of the pioneer period, made <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County a wonderful find for those persons who are searching for the unusual in human
                    life and nature. Consequently the painter folk, Gypsies of American life, came drifting thitherward
                    till by and by a full fledged artists' colony was established.</p>
            <p>Not a few members of the artist gild manifested their faith in the permanency of the wild country by
                    buying property and building homes there. A natural result has been that other people of idyllic
                    tastes with leanings towards the idea of a lodge in the wilds began to look about for cabins where
                    they might flee the madding world on occasion. In time, came Kin Hubbard, the creator of that most
                    popular of rural characters, <hi rend="i">Abe Martin</hi>, whose sayings were for a score of years
                    household words far and wide. The gifted humorist made <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County his habitat, which helped not a little to keep that natural beauty spot in the
                    public eye. More recently the state Department of Conservation has added to its system of public
                    holdings an extensive forest and game preserve near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The highest hill crest, Weedpatch <pb n="31" id="VAA4025-031-1-037"/> Knob, has been
                    crowned with a steel observation tower, from the top of which what seems the most of Indiana can be
                    seen at one glance. Last, but not least as factors in the changes that have taken place in the
                    County during a half century are the improved roads and the ever present automobile for these have
                    made the region easily accessible.</p>
            <p>Fifty years ago <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County was famous in a small way as an isolated region, difficult of access, peopled by
                    hill folk who lived in log cabins, the conservers of primitive customs rapidly passing in other
                    parts of the state. That wild country borrowed romance, also, from the tradition that it was a land
                    of gold. As early as 1850, as a local offset to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> excitement of that period, newspapers began to spread tidings about findings of the
                    precious metal in this little known <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Indiana</region>
                    </placeName> county. For years there persisted dreams of great wealth hidden there. Along with the
                    gold, in the tradition, went precious stones of divers kinds, from diamonds down, all of which were
                    to be found. Then there were the fruits, particularly peaches, which abounded in season.</p>
            <p>Among the country boys of my acquaintance, it was considered quite an outing to drive "down
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName>" in the latter part of summer, with a camping outfit, to return with a load of
                    its choicest peaches. Thus there were multiplied incentives to the adventure of exploring the
                    county, made more intriguing by the difficulty of getting there.</p>
            <p>That is why I, a farmer youth, with a disposition to extend the horizon of my little world, made my
                    first trip into this fascinating land of hills, afoot and alone, prepared to live like an Indian if
                    need be. The nearest railway point to my Ultima Thule was the village of Morgantown, northward of
                    the county line. This I reached from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> over an obscure "jerk-water" road on a mixed train which conveyed a
                    miscellaneous burden of freight and passengers all at the same time, the passengers riding in an
                    ancient coach appended like a tail to the freight cars. When the train was moving, people, live
                    stock and merchandise went rocking and jolting gayly along the right-of-way at a fifteen mile clip,
                    but when the train stopped to leave consignments of freight at wayside platforms, many of the
                    travellers would leave the coach to <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-031-1-038"/> stretch their legs and look
                    about. At one of these stops, the conductor invited us all over to a nearby orchard to enjoy some
                    apples, and while there the owner and his wife came from an adjacent house to have a social chat
                    with the visitors. The good woman brought with her some samples of dry goods which she gave to our
                    conductor with the request that he do a little shopping for her when at Martinsville and leave the
                    purchases on his way back. A feature that added further variety to the journey was a load of
                    squealing hogs, that were going to market in a car immediately in front of the passenger coach.</p>
            <p>When this happy assortment of swine, people, farming implements, dry goods, and what-not reached
                    Morgantown it still lacked an hour or so of dark. Not far to the south of us the visible hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County beckoned, and, as I had with me rations for a cold supper, I tarried not but
                    struck out on foot trusting to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> for a bed a little later on. The rude dirt road which I followed led into regions that
                    grew wilder and more broken, and the humble houses along the wayside became farther and farther
                    apart till they seemed to cease altogether. The prospect for a bed grew correspondingly slim, and
                    finally, as the dusk deepened into night, a strawstack just over the fence at the side of the road,
                    suddenly loomed up in the darkness. What better refuge than this did a husky young man out for
                    adventure need? Investigation proved it to be a new stack with an abundance of clean soft straw out
                    of which to make a nest on the leeward side. To abbreviate this part of the narrative, there I spent
                    the night, sleeping the sleep of the weary, on a couch that seemed of feathers.</p>
            <p>This was my introduction to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> county. To tell anything like the complete story of my haphazard wanderings there for
                    several days—of the diverse characters I met and the interesting things that befell me
                    would be to swell this article beyond proper limits. I can only give the high lights as they linger
                    in my memory. First, I recall the wildness of the place. If you read the records of Indiana in the
                    Civil War, you will find, that draft-dodgers and deserters from the army at that period came from
                    afar to lose themselves in the quiet and remote hills of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County. I can see why they did so, for I got lost there so often that it ceased to be a
                    novelty. <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-031-1-039"/> Since I was headed for no place in particular and
                    rather enjoyed not knowing where I was, I journeyed by the winding paths as often as by the
                    primitive public roads.</p>
            <p>The crude by-ways took me into the very heart of the fastnesses, and as they always led somewhere,
                    being for the most part short cuts from place to place, they not infrequently brought me to a
                    log-cabin home where the family lived in real seclusion. To these people the unexpected advent of a
                    stranger with a haversack on his shoulder was no commonplace event and it needed only a friendly
                    advance on my part to encourage social reciprocity. One instance stands out conspicuously. That was
                    when I came upon a veritable "cabin in the clearing," buried in the woods, miles,
                    as it seemed to me, from anywhere. A man and a boy were plowing among the stumps with a yoke of oxen
                    to the accompaniment of vociferous "gees" and "haws," while in
                    and about the cabin were the rest of the family—wife, children, dogs, pigs and chickens.
                    The prospect of a morning call caused all other business to be suspended and I became the center of
                    interest. The man was as curious about my manner of living as I was about his. When I told him how I
                    happened to be there, he could not quite comprehend why anybody should come so far just to see a
                    wild, hill country. However, he "reckoned" it took all sorts of people to make a
                    world. As for himself, there seemed a reason why one should spend money and sweat to visit a big
                    town to see the sights. "Or a cir-cuss," added his young scion, the ox driver,
                    "I'd walk clear to Injenapolis to see a cir-cuss, if pap 'ud let
                    me."</p>
            <p>Our little confab was broken up when an unruly member of this backwoods family, a long-legged shoat,
                    came familiarly nosing about its master's feet. A long-eared hound resented the intrusion
                    by sharply nipping the young porker. The latter, galvanized into sudden activity, got entangled in
                    the man's underpinning and the biped came down in a heap, wildly clawing the air with all
                    four limbs. Up he came again with a club in his hand and fury in his eye, but, as both shoat and dog
                    had vamoosed to a safe distance, he shied the club at the son who stood by shrieking in irreverent
                    mirth. Next, the good-wife appeared in the doorway with the query: "What's all the
                    furse? What's the matter, Pa?" The hillman was in no mood to explain, and I,
                    bidding the family a hasty farewell, <pb n="34" id="VAA4025-031-1-040"/> disappeared in the brush
                    where I was no longer obliged to repress my laughter.</p>
            <p>Among the interesting characters that I ran across was an inventor living in the northern part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County. His name I have now forgotten, but the man was evidently a student and a
                    thinker, as well as a skillful mechanic. The proof of this was the numerous ingenious contrivances
                    that cluttered up his workshop. One was a novelty in the form of a table with certain parts movable
                    so that one sitting at it could bring within reach of his hand whatever was on any part of it.
                    Another was a washing machine, which he was then working on with the intention of showing it at the
                    next Indiana State Fair. I have often wondered what became of this man and if any of his creations
                    were successes.</p>
            <p>As one of the few definite objects of my trip was to hunt up the "gold region," I
                    enquired my way to the likeliest place to satisfy my curiosity on that point. This turned me in the
                    direction of Bear Creek, which flows through the west part of the County. I brought up at
                    Richard's Postoffice, which was, I believe, about where Trevlac now stands. Bear Creek, I
                    was told, ranked as the best gold-bearing stream in the County. With every freshet the tiny flecks
                    of yellow mixed with black sand would be washed down the Creek and lodged in the hollows or cracks
                    of the bed rock. For more than a generation, men had been prospecting up and down that creek with
                    their pans, washing for gold. An expert could count on making ordinary wages at the business, and,
                    as the lure of bigger returns was ever before the gold-seeker, not a few followed the business of
                    panning for the precious metal in preference to that more ordinary form of exercise known as work.</p>
            <p>Richard's Postoffice took its name from a pioneer, old Johnny Richards, who had lived there
                    since 1830, and who now, as he expressed it, owned more fine scenery than any other man in Indiana,
                    his holdings amounting to upwards of a thousand acres of hills and hollows with small valleys. I
                    spent a night at his house and was entertained in good old country fashion. There was good eating to
                    surfeit which was supplemented by many reminiscences. One story was to the effect that, soon after
                    accounts of gold in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County began to spread, a group from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, hot on the scent of wealth, leased of Richards a stretch of Bear Creek and constructed
                    a <pb n="35" id="VAA4025-031-1-041"/> long flume of picked oak timber for gold washing. Just as they
                    completed it, however, one of the typical hill freshets came along and carried the whole structure
                    away. What became of the "syndicate" of gold miners, Johnny Richards never
                    learned.</p>
            <p>Richard's home, I found, housed a vanishing art—that of the pioneer hand-loom,
                    and an artist-weaver, of a type that was then growing scarce, in the person of old Mrs. Richards.
                    The big loom, with its piece of unfinished fabric, stood in a little room adjoining the kitchen and
                    the weaver worked at it zealously whenever able to get away from her domestic duties. When she saw
                    that I was interested in her handiwork, she proudly showed me the wealth of products that she had
                    accumulated—counterpanes, table covers and what not, including genuine linsey-woolsey
                    cloth, out of which she still made her husband's clothes. Of the garments that he had worn
                    in past years, she had thriftily manufactured patchwork quilts, also artistically fashioned as to
                    colors and needlework. She was innocent of the knowledge that she was a natural artist and a
                    faithful exponent of that first art in our state which has never been credited as it deserves.</p>
            <p>I might tell other interesting experiences among these na'ive and friendly hill folk as they
                    were fifty years ago before they knew so much about visiting tourists. There was the goldsmith at
                    Georgetown who manufactured frames for spectacles, furnishing a market for the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County gold, but his name I have forgotten. Also, there was Dr. A. J. Ralphy of
                    Belleville, a country practitioner. On the side he was a naturalist, taxidermist, collector and
                    all-round scientist. His office looked like an aviary with its hundred or more <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> County birds, all of his own mounting. He also had a cabinet of insects indigenous to
                    the region, and quite a surprising collection of precious stones—small, but genuine, such
                    as opals, garnets, rubies and one diamond. All of them, he told me, had been gathered from the creek
                    beds of the County. He seemed delighted to have a visitor who was interested in his hobbies and we
                    spent a cordial and animated hour together, parting, finally, with the reluctance of old friends.</p>
            <p>I made a note at the time in regard to the last meal I ate before crossing the county-line on my way
                    homeward. The <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-031-1-042"/> bill of fare as I recorded it follows:
                    "Ham and eggs, beans, bread, potatoes, peach-butter, two kinds of jelly, peaches and cream,
                    cake, pie, coffee and milk." The price was twenty-five cents.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>Hearken, ye women of America! Has any of you ever been a <hi rend="i">Goddess of Liberty?</hi> I am
                    planning to organize a society of Goddesses of Liberty, and then another, "Daughters of
                    Goddesses of Liberty," "D. G. L." The first clause of the constitution on
                    which I am now working provides that only those shall be eligible who have been Goddesses or whose
                    blood relations have been Goddesses—no in-laws will be allowed to join. Our country needs
                    now another society with dues, a president, and gavel.</p>
            <p>The translation of a commonplace little Hoosier schoolgirl into a Goddess came about something like
                    this. When the late Admiral George Dewey was in the sixth grade, or thereabouts, with Manila Bay
                    undreamed of, his uncle, Joel Dewey was an active citizen in the small Indiana village of Delphi in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Carroll</region>
                    </placeName> County. He was planning what was to be a most sensational Republican (then "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> party") rally. These Deweys were of a strong-brained breed with strong
                    names—George, Joel, Noah, Jerusha—not an Algernon or Lucile among them.</p>
            <p>This rally was to close the second <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> presidential campaign in the County. It was to be held early in October. Joel Dewey was
                    born a chairman. He had filled every station where there was a chair to be occupied by a presiding
                    officer from his infancy. This great rally was to be the peak of many brilliant chairmanships. Joel
                    had a good committee, but the members were not enthusiastic enough. "Go ahead, Joel, do
                    anything you want—we'll get the money." An editor, a banker, the
                    Methodist minister, and a merchant made up this committee. The members approved the
                    chairman's plans at the very first meeting. But the minister was reading Uncle
                    Tom's Cabin, the editor read Horace Greeley, and the other two played checkers every night
                    after they had put on their comfortable double-gowns and slippers. Even Joel's charge that
                    they lacked patriotism could not lure them to the stuffy back room of his general store.</p>
            <p>Already his plans, approved by the Committee, had been printed in large type and blazoned forth from
                    fence-posts, telegraph poles and on the sides of big barns. These advertisemerits <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-031-1-044"/> stated the wonders of the rally to be held at one o'clock in
                    the Court-House yard. Governor Morton had been invited to grace the occasion and might even appear.
                    Farmers were urged to bring their families and their dinners, the latter to be eaten under the trees
                    in the Court-house yard, where free coffee was to be served. Joel's activities were always
                    marked by a generous hospitality.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Weekly Journal</hi> described this red, white and blue day soon to arrive in several
                    columns of superlative language: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Processions of school children who are already drilling with flags—monster
                            bonfires—already merchants are collecting their big pine boxes which make such
                            crackling, leaping flames—Drum corps—Lathrop's
                            Band—Township delegations assigned to proper places—Citizens in
                            carriages and on foot—our patriotic farm citizens. Every patriotic citizen on the
                            line of march is urged to have all the windows illuminated with candles—one in
                            every pane.</p>
                    </quote> Probably every window in every residence had exactly twelve panes of glass, so canny
                    grocerymen were laying in supplies of red and white candles; blue ones were not made then. At night,
                    too, there would be Roman candles and sky rockets.</p>
            <p>An arch was placed over Main Street at a corner of the Court-house yard, under which the procession
                    would pass. This arch, trimmed with evergreen, was surmounted by a large picture of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> which was also encircled with greenery. On each side of the arch was a small platform.
                    The purpose to be served by these was not known, but it was the general opinion that Joel Dewey
                    would have something there.</p>
            <p>Of course, all these glories had been seen at former rallies. Chairman Dewey therefore cogitated
                    silently at home and aloud on the street. "We have just got to have something different
                    this time," he said to himself again and again. Whether he fasted or prayed, or how
                    inspiration came, is not known, but two days before the rally, set for October 6, 1864, Mr. Dewey
                    came to our home very early, ringing the old tinkling door-bell with a vigorous clang. Feeling that
                    something unusual was going on, I decided to postpone going to school for a while in order to listen
                    outside. Joel closed the door and spoke in a low tone, but with a voice perfectly audable to the
                    key-hole listener.</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Smith," he said, "I've got a splendid idea for the rally.
                    What do you think of a Goddess of Liberty?"</p>
            <p>"It's fine, but there's no time."</p>
            <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-031-1-045"/>
            <p>"There's time if you'll help."</p>
            <p>"Of course I will, but how?"</p>
            <p>I could now hear the Chairman walking the floor.</p>
            <p>"I want your daughter Sally for the Goddess and I want you to make her costume."</p>
            <p>My mother laughed: "Why, Mr. Dewey, that slim little thing as a Goddess would be ridiculous.
                    Ask Belle Burr or
                    some______."</p>
            <p>"They couldn't get ready. Sally will look a lot bigger with draperies and things.
                    You know how to do things and you can get all the stuff at my store."</p>
            <p>"The trouble is to find the costume," explained my mother, "but I think
                    our big Webster's Dictionary will show a goddess—it has everything."
                    When the listener stole away, the dictionary was lying open at a small figure of a goddess.</p>
            <p>On the way home from school I was greeted with the surprising news, that I, Sally Smith, was going to
                    be the Goddess of Liberty in the rally. My Mother glowingly described how I would look on a pedestal
                    drawn by four white horses and patriotism flared.</p>
            <p>Two days of exciting pleasure followed. I remained away from school to be fitted. For the costume,
                    there were delicate fairy-like fabrics heaped on the sewing table—nainsook, mozambique,
                    mull, organdy—whatever it was, Joel had been lavish.</p>
            <p>A pair of white clocked stockings hung over a chair. These were made of what was then called
                    sea-island cotton, now sometimes known as Philippine, I believe. Red, white and blue strips of
                    ribbon for the Liberty shield were being overcast by my Grandmother. By the evening before the
                    rally, the costume was complete and the family came upstairs to see the rehearsal. Fat Nora panted
                    up the back stairs carefully holding the gown which she had just pressed. The sandals, made from old
                    congress gaiters and then covered with white, lay on the table. My father picked up one on the tip
                    of his little finger and held it out admiringly, saying to my Mother: "Catharine, you can
                    do anything with a needle."</p>
            <p>One of my brothers was pasting thirty-four small white stars on the blue <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the shield, while another was prancing around singing, "Oh the brother of a
                    Goddess am I." Mother put the finishing touches on the Liberty Cap which <pb n="40" id="VAA4025-031-1-046"/> was a masterpiece. Then she gave a sigh of satisfaction, and said to my
                    Grandmother, "Now, Mother, you and Nora dress her."</p>
            <p>Never since the day I was born had I been dressed with such care and interest. The fine thin clocked
                    stockings were drawn on carefully, the sandals adjusted, the gown put over the head, my heart
                    beating with fervor at each step. Something the Greeks called a himation arid which Hoosiers call a
                    scarf fell across my shoulders, hiding somewhat my too slender arms and elbows. At last the cap was
                    settled firmly.</p>
            <p>"It must be pretty well down on your head, Sally, it might blow off if there's any
                    wind. That's right now. Go in, Sally." So Sally went in to be greeted with
                    rapturous admiration.</p>
            <p>"Turn round, let's see how the scarf looks."</p>
            <p>"I don't think her hair looks very Goddessy," came from a younger brother.
                    A strange silence fell.</p>
            <p>Father: "It lacks something."</p>
            <p>Nora: "Have her wear a veil."</p>
            <p>Mother: "Oh, a veil would never do with a Liberty cap."</p>
            <p>Brother: "Think of Minerva or Juno with shingled hair."</p>
            <p>Mother spoke quickly: "I know. We will get Belle Straw-bridge to lend us her <hi rend="i">chignon.</hi> I noticed her hair when she was giving Sally a music lesson last Friday. It is
                    exactly the color of Sally's. Frank, you go over and ask her for it."</p>
            <p>Frank: "But suppose Belle wants to go to the Rally. She couldn't go without her <hi rend="i">chignon.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Mother: "She has one of those blue veils. She could put it over the back of her
                    hat—I just know she will lend it."</p>
            <p>And Belle did make the loan though it was an act of great unselfishness. The <hi rend="i">chignon</hi> was the fashionable hair mode of young ladies. It was a piece of net covered with
                    small curls. When pinned over the back hair with a ribbon tied on to hide the connecting line, the
                    delicate ringlets played round the temples and ears—a very fetching style. It may be
                    guessed what intense patriotism it showed in Belle to give up her <hi rend="i">chignon</hi> on a day
                    when she would doubtless have been among the citizens to ride in carriages.</p>
            <p>Dressing to be a bride is nothing compared to dressing to be a Goddess. The <hi rend="i">chignon</hi>, borrowed while the owner was still in bed, was sewed firmly to the back of the
                    Liberty cap. The final pats were given as the shrill peal of "The Girl I <pb n="41" id="VAA4025-031-1-047"/> Left Behind Me" gave warning of the approach of the car which
                    was to carry the Goddess. A long cooper's wagon swathed with the colors stopped at our
                    door. A bevy of white-clad girls sat on the floor and in the middle was the pedestal for Divinity. A
                    young soldier in uniform approached, saying, "I am to stand behind and support her, Mrs.
                    Smith. I will take care of her."</p>
            <p>"Remember, Sally, don't smile or bow or wave to anyone," warned Mother.</p>
            <p>That October day in 1864 was a mellow one and as the pageant slowly proceeded, it seemed that the
                    whole population was out. The wide, unpaved streets, bordered with their summer crop of dog-fennel,
                    were rough, but the strong arm behand me was a good shock absorber. Up <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Street, across to Main, and on down that street we went. But what are ruts and jostles
                    to a Goddess of Liberty? A most joyful procession that was. The maidens chattered and sang, the
                    horses flaunted flags on their heads. Fifes pealed and drums boomed, while the brass band played
                    "Bonnie Eloise"—a change from the wartime melodies that had been for
                    too long a time so common.</p>
            <p>As we neared the terminus of the line of march, there was a great sound of cheering from
                    farmers' families who had come too late to get into the parades. Every hitching-post around
                    the public square was in use, and anxious patriots were driving about seeking places for their
                    teams.</p>
            <p>The cheers and hurrahs of this bucolic crowd increased as the long line drew near. The throng drew
                    back from the arch to let the procession pass under. Pillars on each side of the arch supported
                    small platforms whose purpose now became apparent. Each one bore a large new clothes basket and in
                    each basket stood a living statue. These statues (one of whom was the Chairman's daughter)
                    were to represent that accumulated virtue to be found solely within the fold of the Republican
                    party. The cheering we had heard was a tribute to these statues as they climbed up the stepladders
                    and into their protecting baskets. The directions, given so quietly that they were heard only by the
                    girls standing in the assigned positions, were: "Fold your arms and don't move or
                    speak. You will only have to stand there a little while till the procession passes."
                    Obedient to instructions, the statues stood rigid with <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-031-1-048"/> folded
                    arms till the Chariot of the Goddess drew near when one of them leaned toward the other and
                    exclaimed: "Oh, Anna, don't the girls look lovely?"</p>
            <p>There was loud laughing and hand-clapping from the crowd, ending in cheers. The procession passed
                    under the arch and came to a halt. As we were passing along the streets several women had leaned
                    over gates very loudly exchanging bold remarks about our appearance. Our driver leaned back and
                    whispered: "Don't notice them—they want to get up a fight."
                    One woman seemed to be urging a little boy to say something to us. "Run out and say
                    it," she told him and, with the impetus of a push, the youngster ran into the street and
                    shouted at me: "You ain't nobody but Sally Smith."</p>
            <p>The bevy of maidens stirred slightly while our mentor again warned the Goddess not to move. I knew
                    that small boy spoke the truth. At least I had been the person mentioned that very morning, and I
                    might be again that night, but now I was Joan of Arc, Moll Pitcher, or Julia Ward Howe. I was the
                    Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the American Flag. A transcendent glow of
                    patriotism was kindling in my palpitating heart on that eventful day, and I did not smile. As well
                    expect the statue of Liberty that looks out from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> Harbor to give heed to some childish gibe.</p>
            <p>The whistle of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> passenger train coming in from the southwest over Deer Creek bridge was the signal, and
                    the fife and drum started, only to be overwhelmed a minute later by the full band and the cheers of
                    the crowd as the speakers stepped off the train. Came then important Marshal Sims, the tassels of
                    his red sash flying as he waved his sword. Citizens on foot were now crowding into the Courthouse
                    yard. Those in carriages who could not find hitching-places, remained as near as possible. School
                    children were everywhere. The triumphal car of the speaker being too wide to pass through the arch
                    paused near it.</p>
            <p>The band played as the speakers and glee club mounted the stand. A great crowd greeted His
                    Excellency, the Governor of Indiana, that day. Veterans in old army overcoats, women nursing babies,
                    women holding little children out of the crowd, boys on fence posts and in trees, every window
                    filled—it was a thrilling sight.</p>
            <p>The celebrities sat toward the front of the platform. The <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-031-1-049"/> pitcher
                    of water and two goblets were ready. The male chorus occupied the rear of the stand. Chairman Dewey
                    arose and waved his arms. The crowd gradually quieted. He announced: "Your distinguished
                    fellow citizen, sitting at my right, will address you after a song from the Glee Club. All join in
                    the chorus."</p>
            <p>Finally after a long time of standing full of weary emotion, the Goddess received a message from her
                    mother that she was to come on home and change her clothes. "Mrs. Case will send her
                    carriage for you," the message concluded. The Goddess thought, "I will just stay
                    for this one song."</p>
            <p>The Glee Club rose, Mr. Graham struck his tuning fork and sounded a deep base sonorous <hi rend="i">DO-O-O.</hi> It was echoed by the club, and the singers then broke into song. Abram was no
                    longer calling for volunteers, but they were still singing the first famous war song: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Six hundred thousand is the cry Come listen to the call For Abram says we must have them Or
                            else the Union'll fall. Then surely, boys, we'll onward march To meet the
                            rebel band, Six hundred thousand is the cry Throughout our native land.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>After this with patriotic uproar thrilling her, the Goddess was driven home and became Sally Smith
                    again.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">

            </byline>
            <p>Any type of training of children or young people for civic and political responsibilities must be
                    based on the psychological and racial realities of our civilization. In other words, we must take
                    these people as they are, possessed of certain points of strength and of weakness, and not attempt
                    to arrange for them a curriculum of citizenship training which presupposes either an idealized
                    personality in the student or the possession by him of characteristics or abilities which he really
                    does not have. If we thus build upon the mental equipment of the student as he is, we should be able
                    to lead him through a course of instruction which really functions in improving his outlook upon
                    civic and political affairs.</p>
            <p>It must be realized at the outset that desirable ends of instruction in civic matters are not
                    fundamentally different from those which are legitimate aims in other social relationships. The man
                    who has a certain civic part to play, if affairs are to run smoothly, is the same who has economic
                    and social relationships. All these contacts are aspects of man's life in groups. They are
                    all aspects of the same thing—organized community life—and not separate and
                    distinct things. Groups are formed to accomplish certain objects which are deemed necessary or at
                    least desirable by individuals. Government is merely one of these groups. It is conceivable that man
                    might go it alone. All that would be biologically necessary, perhaps, is the care of the young
                    during their helpless years by one or both parents. Aside from this, man might satisfy his wants
                    alone—fight his own battles, procure his own food, make his own clothing, tools, and
                    weapons, and worship his god in solitude. That, however, is not how man has done, nor is he doing
                    things that way now. He is a social being, turning constantly to collective methods for the means of
                    satisfying his wants. He bands together to fight his enemies, he works out a system of division of
                    labor to supply himself with food and other needful articles and in divine worship he seeks the
                    comradeship of others who feel the same <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-031-1-051"/> religious urges as
                    himself. He uses the group method at every turn to achieve satisfaction of his wants.</p>
            <p>Now in the march of civilization, these fundamental considerations are too often lost sight of. Man
                    has traveled far in his collective arrangements. These forms are artificial excrescences upon the
                    original nature of man. They were not a part of his original mode of life in all probability. The
                    mistake now too often made, therefore, is to forget the origin of these forms and methods of group
                    living and to regard the forms as the starting points of civic instruction instead of teaching them
                    as the flowering of man's experience over centuries of trial and error. Briefly stated,
                    civic instruction should proceed from the needs of man to the means of satisfying those needs, and
                    should not begin with a study of the institutions man has set up. Failure to act upon this principle
                    is the reason for the ineffectiveness of much of our civic instruction. We should teach the need for
                    the political, economic, and social forms which are considered a part of our civilization and
                    through a knowledge of this need develop an appreciation of the social form which has grown up to
                    meet it. Such civic instruction is sure to be effective for it grounds the civic knowledges,
                    attitudes, and appreciations of the student upon the basic requirements of civilized life with which
                    few would ever have a desire to quarrel.</p>
            <p>The first step, therefore, in training for civic and political responsibilities, as well as for
                    economic and social responsibilities, is to teach the basic need of the restriction on liberty or
                    the officer or institution making up our political structure. The traffic lights at the street
                    corner are seen in this way as the means society has adopted to make life safe for people instead of
                    as a tyrannical restriction upon individual liberty imposed by arbitrary authority. Taxes are
                    appreciated under this teaching as the constructive assistance which the members of a group give in
                    order that group purposes may be carried out, and not as sums arbitrarily wrung for unknown purposes
                    from unwilling contributors. Frequently those most loud in the denunciation of high taxes would be
                    the least willing to go back to the days of dirt roads, contaminated water supplies, one-room school
                    houses, and bucket brigades. Frequently also, they know the least about the purposes for which tax
                    money is actually spent.</p>
            <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-031-1-052"/>
            <p>Teaching the need of social institutions thus gives <hi rend="i">understanding</hi> of their purposes
                    and their place in modern society. This understanding begets <hi rend="i">respect</hi> for them. We
                    cannot have a regard for our laws and political forms unless we understand them and know why they
                    exist. We cannot be good citizens unless we respect our country and its institutions. Anyone can
                    understand needs. Anyone can also understand methods of procedure, at least in their fundamentals,
                    if he knows the needs which prompted the inauguration of the methods. The respect which results
                    arises from the rational character of the development. The hungry man looks for something to eat.
                    There is nothing about that fact to make a social iconoclast. But becloud the connection between the
                    hunger and the satisfaction, between the need and the political form, or neglect consideration of
                    the need, and an institution stands out in the minds of such a person as an instrument of tyranny.
                    This type of situation <hi rend="i">will</hi> breed the social iconoclast.</p>
            <p>Another result of making instruction proceed from need to agency is that there is less condemnation
                    of imperfections. No human institution is perfect or ever has been; but if we make clear to students
                    that the political form which exists now is the product of long development in which for ages man
                    has struggled to make himself more free, more prosperous and more happy, we will engender a new
                    respect in the mind of the student for the political form. He venerates the age-old tree which
                    towers above him, although it may be crooked or decayed in spots. He reveres in like manner the
                    Constitution or other political or economic or social form into which the highest aspirations of
                    mankind have entered and under which the advancement humanity has enjoyed has been in large measure
                    achieved, even though it has imperfections in its structure or operation.</p>
            <p>Out of this understanding and respect, will arise in the mind of any normal person a feeling of <hi rend="i">responsibility</hi> for the detection and elimination of imperfections in the political
                    or social form. From a knowledge that political development has been in the direction of bettering
                    the condition of the individual and that the finest flowering of the genius of our race is in that
                    democracy in which every person has a chance, there comes a feeling that the individual in his
                    social relationships <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-031-1-053"/> is not a receiver of the favors of others
                    nor a disinterested onlooker, but a partner in an enterprise. In this feeling each recognizes his
                    responsibility. He sees that this government is a cooperative enterprise. He appreciates that growth
                    requires change, that no institution is the best for all periods to come, no matter how well at some
                    past age it has fulfilled its purpose. Therefore he sees the necessity, and he feels the desire, of
                    participating in the diagnosis and treatment of those imperfections, which, due to the passage of
                    time or to the shortcomings of individuals in authority, have made themselves apparent. His civic
                    responsibility, therefore, arises from his consciousness of membership in his group and of his
                    respect for the efforts of his race to build worthy institutions. He is not deterred by political
                    shortcomings because he sees an underlying purpose. His civic education functions properly because
                    it has given meaning to political life.</p>
            <p>This method of organizing civic teaching is the more necessary now because of the growing complexity
                    of our political institutions. Man's intelligence in the direction of ordering his social
                    life in the interest of the highest well-being is rapidly expanding, but in the growing complexity
                    of the institutions which have resulted from this knowledge there is a challenge to civic teaching.
                    The thread of relationship between complex form and basic needs must be traced by the student while
                    acquiring his education, or, like the hero of the myth, he will be lost in the labyrinth.</p>

            <p>Having exausted the material available to him, Mr. Sherman has not yet obtained certain desired
                    information, and adds the following: "I wish I knew just when the band left Indiana. If you
                    run across anything on the subject, I wish you would let me know." Possibly some reader of
                    the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> can furnish the missing knowledge or indicate
                    where it may be found.</p>
            <p>The next forthcoming Indiana Historical Society <hi rend="i">Publication</hi> is to be a translation
                    of an exceedingly rare little book published in 1837 in Saaz, Bohemia (now Zatec, Czechoslovakia).
                    The body of the book is composed of the letter written by Jacob Schramm, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hancock</region>
                    </placeName> County, to his friends and relatives in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, describing the voyage of Schramm and his family from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> to America and the trip to the land <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-031-1-055"/> which he had
                    acquired in Indiana. The writer of this interesting letter dwelt on the hardships encountered in
                    getting to this land and those of the first months of residence there. An introduction by the
                    publisher seems to disclose the motive of the publication—a deterrent to immigration to
                    America. Jacob Schramm was a man of parts and education and his letter gives an unusually reliable
                    and interesting account of travel in the 1830's, and of conditions in central Indiana in
                    that early period. Publication is expected during the early summer.</p>
            <p>A recent acquisition of the Smith Library is a set of Maximilian's <hi rend="i">Travels in
                        the Interior of North America</hi> with English text and atlas of eighty-one plates made from
                    the paintings from life by Charles Bodmer and colored by hand. Maximilian's was one of the
                    scientific expeditions and he spent two years (1832–34) in this country, wintering at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1832–33 and at Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1833–34. The account of the journey was first published in German in
                    1839–41 and the English translation appeared in 1843. This translation was made readily
                    available some years ago by the Thwaites reprint so that the present interest centers in the atlas.
                    Bodmer, who accompanied the expedition, was not only a capable artist but a patient and interested
                    observer and the forty-nine plates which represent individual Indians and scenes of Indian life have
                    decided ethnological and historical interest. Commemorative of the winter at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> are three plates, two of which show swamp scenes in the neighborhood. The third is the
                    familiar one in which the town is seen at a little distance through a foreground of trees.</p>
            <p>Sets in which all the eighty-one plates are in full color do not often appear for sale, but one was
                    recently offered in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. It is this set which the Smith Library was fortunate enough to be able to secure.</p>

                    Seven of the letters were from a brother, Alexander Pollock, who came to Indiana in 1839. He was at
                    first very unfavorably impressed with conditions in the Hoosier state, and expected to leave at the
                    first opportunity. However, for one reason and another, his stay was prolonged. After several years,
                    he became reconciled to the conditions that surrounded him, married and settled down. His last
                    letter in the collection was written on July 4, 1847, a few months after his marriage.</p>
            <p>Another brother of Charles Pollock, wrote two of the letters. This was James Pollock who migrated to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and located in the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, near which he acquired a farm. One of his letters was written to a sister, Isabel
                    Pollock. A third brother, William Pollock, wrote one letter from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> in 1855 while he was employed by a contractor who was completing the wings of the
                    national capitol. The three remaining letters were written by friends. One was from a Dr. L. G.
                    Schwagen who was living and practicing medicine at Denbeigh Place, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, for a time. Another was from a Mr. John Baird, and a third from a Mr. Thomas B.
                    Fawcett. The last two persons were pioneers who had migrated from <placeName>

                                            depression which followed the panic of 1837. The hardest times were in
                                            1840–41, not in 1837. The first suspension of specie payment came
                                            in 1837. There was a partial recovery in 1838 with resumption, but a second
                                            suspension of specie payment came in 1839 which affected most of the banks

                                            the provisions of the "Mammoth Bill" of 1836. The
                                            construction of this system was only well started when the business boom
                                            collapsed. The stoppage of construction work by the end of 1889, added to
                                            the economic troubles of the people of the state. Conditions in Indiana were
                                            not very different from those prevailing over the entire country.</item>

                        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                        <p>Having an opportunity of sending directly to you, I with pleasure Embrace it, and am
                                    happy to be enabled to say to you that my health was never better than at present my
                                    health has been gradually improving since my first visit south and I am bound to
                                    believe that there are hundreds yea thousands of persons at the north annually
                                    falling victims to the severity of those chilling blasts who were they to enjoy the
                                    mild and bland atmosphere of the South would have tolerable good health even to old
                                    age, and when I reflect upon the change evidently wrought in my physical
                                    constitution I cannot but be surprised that thousands do not avail themselves of the
                                    blessing of health which may be attained in many cases (if not in mine) at a
                                    trifling, if any, sacrifice and so important do I consider it that aside from self
                                    gratification I could wish that my particular friends could be made sensible of the
                                    benefits derived by way of supporting a frail and perhaps crushed constitution, but
                                    enough of this. you would probably like to know the contrast in your climate and
                                    this with regard to weather. well the season is this year unusually late. vegetation
                                    is backward. we have had a late, cold, dry, spring and many persons have not planted
                                    their corn. you will learn by John that our prospects for fruit were flattering in
                                    the extreme untill your northerners sent us that hard frost which in one fatal night
                                    destroyed every hope of peach and prune. I think you must still have some snow and
                                    ice with you. I yesterday saw one of the many who are coming from your state to view
                                    land, who told me that two weeks ago at Madison Co. N. Y. there was much snow and
                                    that farmers had not commenced ploughing. There is perhaps a greater tide of
                                    immigration flowing here at present from the north than has been known Any year
                                    previous. and still there is room, and I know of more than a few excellent bargains,
                                    some one of which you might consider yourself fortunate in securing. With regard to
                                    my professional business you will be informed that although there is no prevailing
                                    sickness, my business, by reason of my location is very good. Much better even than
                                    I had reason to suppose it could be and my health and strength seem to be in
                                    proportion to the exigencies of the undertaking I mostly ride on horse-back and
                                    usually every day and the rout being extensive is often arduous. I did not for many
                                    reasons commence business much before Janry and since that time have been quite
                                    engaged. as the neglected condition of my garden plainly shows. You will learn by
                                        John<hi rend="sup">11</hi> that I last fall took another lesson in my long
                                    chapter of misfortunes. but I thank God that I am enabled to not only bear the
                                    frowns of dame fortune but can do so with a tolerable degree of composure. tuning my
                                    pipes and pleasing myself with the scotch adage
                                    "Johnny-o-band-and-you" which in plain English simply is (as I was
                                    taught) "A clear conscience." You will learn my prospects from

                                    those who would feel the reverse. How I thank my friends for their sympathy and my
                                    stars for the ineffectual shafts of my enemies. Your accustomed generosity will I

                                    the receipt of a letter or letters from you, but that really did not deter me from
                                    writing. neither did any one thing but a general mass of all things has during this
                                    winter prevented my usual extensive correspondence with my friends. I have received
                                    some seventy letters since my arrival here. and my otherwise idle moments have been
                                    employed in answering them and I should not be accused (under all the circumstances)
                                    of neglect to friends. I would gladly hear from you and yours and hope you are
                                    enjoying a full share of prosperity and happiness. I often send my wandering
                                    thoughts to join you in your family circle where I have had many a pleasant and
                                    social chat and can assure you that their reality has not been among the least of my
                                    former enjoyments but those days are past, and with them all the cares and
                                    perplexities with which they are usually accompanied. But away with soliloquising

                                    of May or June but finding it difficult to leave my business and thinking I may
                                    require rest and change of Climate during the warmest weather I have concluded to
                                    defer my return to a later period, but without any definite time. I shall probably
                                    stay North some 4 or 5 weeks and anticipate a first rate visit with you and others
                                    of my friends in that vicinity. I need not tell you as you will be informed by John
                                    that Wm and his family enjoy uninterrupted health and are satisfied with their
                                    change. Esther is cheerful and as neat as ever and Mary is as pretty as a doll as
                                    sweet as a rose, and as talkative as a Parrot. I enjoy her society much. And now to
                                    business. When we parted in Schenectody you thought you could induce McCormick to
                                    take some notes which you held. I hope you was successfull in that or that you
                                    received the money on the notes as my last fall's misfortune renders an
                                    adjustment of that kind more desirable than before. My <hi rend="i">available</hi>
                                    means were previously limited and a loss of a few hundred of dollars causes me to
                                    feel sensibly the want of money. the expense attending the recovery of my remnant of
                                    property prevented the possibility of discharging any obligations to Wm until I
                                    receive money which I have vainly looked for from the North. Tis true I have been
                                    much engaged in business but have received little or no remuneration. I still hope
                                    to receive money from the north but fear a further delay. you will do me a great
                                    favour if you can arrange the McCormick affair with those notes before I go north.
                                    Perhaps Mr. Young has done something in the matter he wrote me that he confidently
                                    hoped to do so he has abundant means in his hands for that use or any other though I
                                    know not that I am otherwise indebted in that northern region with the exception of
                                    our obligation <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-031-1-065"/> which has in my honest opinion
                                    been liquidated many times over and so believing shall endeavour to avoid further
                                    trouble about it. You will find enclosed an old note by Reuben <placeName>

                                    will overlook this long silence I have not herd from any of you since Isabel wrote
                                    and that is so long ago I have entirely forgot when it was I was in hopes that you
                                    would have continued to write notwithstanding my silence as it is quite a job for me
                                    to write and seldom have opportunity I still remain in <placeName>

                                    looked so unfavorable last spring was the reason and it was almost a total failure
                                    in this section which makes rather hard times and the comeing crop looks pretty hard
                                    the insects have pretty much destroyed the early sowed spring crops abundant corn

                                    generation, but they think if they keep 3 months in winter they are doing something
                                    great. The Hoosiers are a good plain kind &amp; obliging set of people so far as

                                    seem to think it is of much use to educate their children a great deal, some wanted

                                    far as they go, and if a few of the inhabitants want a summer school they have to
                                    hire a teacher at their own expense "so much for Indiana" If they
                                    were obliged to keep 6 months school it would be a good deal better for the state,
                                    but I suppose it would be hard arguing to make them think so.</p>

            <p>John Adams appointed William Clark to a judgeship in Indiana Territory. His appointment was confirmed

            </p>
            <p>The volume under review deals especially with navigation on the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and is an attempt to present a connected story of what the author rightly calls
                    "one of the most picturesque chapters of American economic history." The prospect
                    of a renascence of this navigation is offered as a reason for the publication of such a work at the
                    present time.</p>
            <p>Beginning with an account of the discovery and exploration of the River, the writer passes quickly to
                    flatboat days; then to the appearance of the steamboat; to the "Golden Age" of the
                    forties; to the fifties, when "the steamboat ruled the river and the river ruled the
                    Valley;" to the critical years of the sixties; to the decadence of the river traffic; and
                    finally to recent efforts at revival.</p>
            <p>As the drama, which it really is, unfolds, we witness the characters famous in river lore cross the
                    stage: Marquette and Joliet; LaSalle; the French voyageurs; Mike Fink, King of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Keelboatmen; Henry M. Shreve, the steamboat builder; Mark Twain, the pilot; and
                    numerous other figures connected with traffic on the Father of Waters.
                    "Steamboating," declares the author, "was not merely a business to a
                    river man: it was his life. … To be on the river was the goal of his ambition from the
                    time when, as a small and eager boy, he began to haunt the river front. The river was a part of him;
                    it was almost as though river water ran in his veins instead of mere blood. The river man was there
                    because his heart was there … there alone he felt at home."</p>
            <p>There are also interesting chapters on early river towns, the men and their boats and steamboating as
                    a business. <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-031-1-074"/> The "seeds of decay" in the river
                    traffic, the author affirms, were present before the Civil War. In earlier times practically all the
                    surplus produce of the Northwest had gone down stream to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. But a shift was noticeable from west to east in the fifties. The canals and the
                        <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName> provided a competitive route. More disastrous still for the
                    down river trade were the East-West trunk-line railroads which were constructed in the decade before
                    the War. The result was a relative falling off of river transportation. The Civil War hastened the
                    process. While there was some recovery after the close of the conflict, the interior rivers never
                    regained their old dominance. The rafting business furnishes the only exception. This reached its
                    height on the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> about 1890.</p>
            <p>"Can the River Come Back?" is the title of one of the later chapters. The author
                    believes there is a possibility of this taking place. European markets will not be so important in
                    the future. The most promising areas of America's foreign trade lie in South America and
                    the Orient. Therefore, cheap water transportation <hi rend="i">via</hi>, the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">via</hi> the Drainage Canal and the <geogName>Illinois River</geogName>. Then the
                    Federal Barge Lines were extended to this route. At the present time the Federal government is
                    engaged in constructing a series of dams on the upper <placeName>

                    conclusions, will find this admirable volume of great interest. A very complete bibliography for
                    each chapter is given in the back part of the book.</p>

                    Edited with introduction and notes by Arthur J. Larsen. The <placeName>

            <p>The Swisshelm Letters were published in the St. Cloud <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi> from time to time
                    during a period of seven years. The author of these editorial letters was a pioneer in the editorial
                    field. Through her determination and tireless efforts she succeeded in establishing her newspaper in
                    St. Cloud, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. In its columns she used the influence of her pen for Abolition and Woman's
                    Rights, and also wrote on other timely topics. In the first letter, that of November 25, 1858, she
                    said: "The destruction of our press here brought the revelation we dreaded; for we found
                    that we had no more hesitancy in talking to as many people as could get within hearing distance than
                    in talking to one. …"</p>
            <p>While her press was being reconstructed, Mrs. Swiss-helm gave her messages orally and found that she
                    possessed "some talent for public speaking" which she felt called upon to improve.
                    "It is therefore probable that in the future," she ventured, "we may use
                    the voice of speech as well as the voice of the pen … as by that means we may hope to
                    reach many that would otherwise be inaccessible."</p>
            <p>The Letters appear under fourteen chapter titles. They are well written, entertaining and
                    instructive. Of the public lectures mentioned in these chapters, the author says: "I find
                    people much more willing to hear me on subjects connected with Woman's Rights than on the
                    rights of slaves. I regret this, for women, as such, have few wrongs compared to those of the slave
                    …"</p>
            <p>The description of highways and modes of travel are of historic value. Old fashioned customs are
                    revealed in the author's stories of her entertainment in the towns in which lectures were
                    delivered. Women readers were favored by word-pictures of scenery, comments on homely arts, bits of
                    gossip, notes on fashions, and accounts of social functions which the author attended.</p>

                    </placeName> Volunteer Infantry stationed at Ft. Snelling, the camp and camp life were described for
                    the benefit of those whose sons were there. While in the hospital service at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, D.C., Mrs. Swisshelm <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-031-1-076"/> wrote of her experiences in
                    order to show the kind of service that was being rendered to the soldiers and to suggest possible
                    opportunities to "enquiring friends" for supplying comforts needed by the men in
                    the wards.</p>
            <p>The Readers of the St. Cloud <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi> were made acquainted with laborers and
                    editors, ministers and lecturers, legislators and governors, army officers and soldiers, congressmen
                    and cabinet officers, and President and Mrs. Lincoln. The author attended one of President
                    Lincoln's public receptions. When the President clasped her hand she told him that she
                    "hoped the Lord would have mercy on him, as the people had none." She reported
                    that "in the midst of his drudgery he laughed a great hearty, honest laugh." She
                    derived pleasure from seeing the President and characterized him as "a man whose honesty
                    had never been questioned by friend or foe."</p>
            <p>Some of the rumors heard and believed of Mrs. Lincoln by Mrs. Swisshelm were shattered by the
                    friendly smile and cordial greeting. She wondered why Mrs. Lincoln, surrounded by so many admiring
                    friends, should recognize her and "give one of the brightest smiles of the evening to a
                    little, old woman, noted for nothing but Abolitionism." The editor then added: "I
                    intend to publish all the evidence I have and all I can get of her loyalty and good feeling

            <p>This work is a study of the success of the more extreme elements North and South in preventing the
                    triumph of Stephen A. Douglas. <hi rend="i">"Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi>,
                    'Bleeding Kansas', 'Bully Brooks' assault on Sumner, the Dred
                    Scott case, Buchanan's hate for Douglas, Harper's Ferry—but for these
                    there might have been no Civil War." Such is the statement of the author (p. 237), as he
                    weighs the evidence. In what way could the great civil conflict have been prevented? By accepting
                    the point of view of Douglas who rejected both the northern and southern plans for congressional
                    intervention in the Territories. Believing in the "operation of economic laws,"
                    the Little Giant "felt that climate, soil and other natural characteristics of the western
                    Territories would make them free. He thought the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Compromise repeal would not extend slavery, but would reduce southern opposition to the
                    formation of new Territories. A series of new free Territories would be established; finally the
                    South would find competition too unprofitable and severe, and slavery would die a natural death. But
                    the South would have no legitimate complaint, for its honor would have been respected and its
                    constitutional rights scrupulously offered and maintained. This, to Douglas, was national
                    ground" (p. 183).</p>
            <p>Why did not a majority of the people North and South rally around the standard of Douglas? A major
                    disaster was the break-up of the Democratic party at Charleston. "As late as March,
                    1860," <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> declares, "there was a good chance to avert Cecession" (p. 370).
                    Because the party machinery <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-031-1-078"/> did not permit the people of the
                    South to select delegates who really represented the Douglas sentiment of that section, the southern
                    Ultras aided by President Buchanan were able to stage a bolt that was effective, and really start
                    the war at Charleston in the spring of 1860. In spite of the "irrepressible
                    conflict" theory held by Lincoln, Seward and other leaders, the author of the volume under
                    review believes that, "prior to the disruption of the Democracy, civil war was not
                    inevitable" (p. 519).</p>
            <p>Whether his contention that the Civil War was needless has been demonstrated or not, the courage,
                    consistency and vision of Douglas have been more clearly portrayed than ever before. However narrow
                    the margin, the great statesman of the Northwest who would have saved the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> without war, was not sustained. The sword was drawn, and not Douglas but <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> is acclaimed the great savior of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is clear that there were certain powerful factors that operated to produce the
                    Republican party and to promote a spirit of southern nationalism in the fifties. These great forces
                    must be considered as well as the errors and personal animosities of leaders that helped to bring on
                    the armed conflict. Conditions being what they were in both sections, a resort to war was easier
                    than the acceptance of the policy of Douglas which required an understanding of the slow operation
                    of economic laws based on geography. What happened in 1861 had happened before, has happened since,
                    and may happen again.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Eve of Conflict</hi> is well written. The author has had access to a great deal of
                    new source matter. He challenges views that are held by many people. His book is stimulating. It

               <hi rend="i">Robert Tyler: Southern Rights Champion.</hi> By Philip Gerald Auchampaugh. Hinman
                    Stein, Printer, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duluth</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1934. Pp. xi, 387.</head>
            <p>The author and editor of this volume (it is rather a collection of letters than a biography) has for
                    some years been a student of James Buchanan. He has now brought together and published many letters
                    of Robert Tyler, a few written <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-031-1-079"/> by his brother John Tyler, Jr.,
                    several written by Henry A. Wise, and a number written by James Buchanan, with occasional letters
                    from others. There is a "Foreword" contributed by Lyon Gardiner Tyler,
                    distinguished son of President John Tyler, who was born in 1853 when his father was sixty-three
                    years of age and who died only a few weeks ago. Robert and John Tyler were two of the older sons of
                    John Tyler. The ex-President contributes some letters to the collection, those written at the time
                    of the secession movement and the Peace Conference being of especial interest. Nearly all of the
                    correspondence falls within the years from 1851 to 1861. There are six letters that were written in
                    the years before 1851 and five that fall in 1865–1866.</p>
            <p>The correspondence is tied together by intervening comment of Dr. Auchampaugh, which turns the book
                    into a sort of monograph on the relations existing between James Buchanan, Henry A. Wise and Robert
                    Tyler in the critical years preceding the Civil War. In the midst of the matter contributed by
                    himself, the author frequently quotes from correspondence which is not published in the volume, and
                    there are also quite a number of instances where letters are only partially printed.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt whatever of the great value of the correspondence in the collection. It was
                    gathered from the Tyler manuscripts in the possession of Lyon Gardiner Tyler, from the archives of
                    the Historical Society of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName>, from the Manuscripts Division of the Congressional Library, and from various printed
                    sources. The author has studied with care the events and men of the period covered, and his
                    conclusions are thoughtful and stimulating. His characterizations of Robert Tyler, Henry Wise, R. M.
                    T. Hunter and Buchanan are very interesting. In general he is in sympathy with Buchanan, but he
                    makes a real effort to treat him impartially. In regard to the role that Buchanan attempted to play
                    during the last weeks of his presidency, Dr. Auchampaugh says: <quote rend="blockquote">But it was
                        not 1833. There were new men of strong passions and hardened hearts who knew not and cared not
                        for the ways of the fathers. Webster, Clay, and Calhoun were dead. Buchanan still lived, but his
                        long and friendly association with Southern leaders had been used against him by Republican
                        newspapers of the North. Then malicious <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-031-1-080"/> propaganda had
                        greatly injured his influence in his own section at a time when it would have been well to have
                        taken heed to his earnest and experienced counsel.</quote>
            </p>
            <p>One of the most interesting contentions of Robert Tyler (Tyler to Wise, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, June 9, 1856) is that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> really nominated Buchanan in 1856. "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>," he declared, "had the credit of making the nomination and you
                    [Henry A. Wise] are the hero of the fight." In a letter to Buchanan (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, November 30, 1856), Wise wrote: "I am responsible for your nomination and
                    election. … " In his new work, <hi rend="i">The Eve of Conflict: Stephen A.
                        Douglas and the Needless War</hi> (pp. 226–228), George Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> gives the credit mainly to Jesse D. Bright and the Indiana delegation.</p>
            <p>A few points in regard to the editing of the correspondence require mention. Where explanatory words
                    or phrases are inserted in the text of a letter by the editor they are invariably enclosed in
                    parentheses instead of brackets. This is confusing as there appear a number of words and expressions
                    that were enclosed in parentheses by the writers of the letters. In most cases a reader can
                    correctly judge the authorship of the enclosed matter but not always (pp. 205, 287, 347). The
                    printer has not done a good job, and sometimes it is hard to know where a letter ends. It is often
                    not possible to tell whether omission marks indicate the deletion of matter by the editor or that
                    something has been omitted because not legible. There are not a sufficient number of explanations to
                    guide a reader not thoroughly familiar with the history of the times.</p>
            <p>Robert Tyler, whose letters make up a large part of the volume, lived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> for years before the opening of the Civil War. Because he believed that the seceding
                    states should be allowed to go in peace, though he was "not in fact a
                    disunionist," this son of a former President was driven from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> after the beginning of hostilities. He served the Confederacy throughout the conflict,

                    in the volume: <quote rend="blockquote">You must know that I have become the most <hi rend="i">economical</hi> person of your acquaintance—neither drink, smoke, or

            <head>Comment</head>
            <p>Will liberals always disagree so fully as to hinder progress? They surely show strong tendencies to
                    do just that. A liberal leader with insight, courage and power will always have a most difficult
                    task to frame a program of such a nature that each feature included will not be attacked with
                    extreme vigor by one liberal element or another. When a liberal does not approve of some part of a
                    program, he is prone to assault the leader who sponsors the program with appalling fury. Another
                    liberal who is opposed to another part of the program performs in a like manner, while still others
                    attempt to block additional features of the general scheme. Thus a strong progressive leader is in
                    danger of seeing his plans frustrated not by reactionaries but by those from whom he has naturally
                    expected the most powerful support.</p>
            <p>There is no lesson that history teaches more thoroughly than this, that unwelcome ideas can not be
                    eradicated by suppression. This must be the method natural to human beings, however, since it is
                    almost invariably resorted to by those who wish to stop the spread of some <hi rend="i">ism</hi> or
                    destroy the influence of some element out of harmony with the existing order. Attempts at
                    suppression are usually quite effective in promoting a rapid increase of the very ideas or
                    influences believed to merit obliteration.</p>
            <p>Multitudes of Americans seem to be happy that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is not to be linked up with the World Court on the ground that we should avoid all
                    foreign entanglements. Peoples have, and will again, become involved in the worst of entanglements
                    and even wars because of prejudices and misunderstandings created by ignorance or by false
                    propaganda. A World Court functioning ever so poorly at least represents an intelligent effort to
                    prevent clashes between nations through giving them some chance to settle disputes according to
                    right and reason before plunging into wars. Any man who has acquired an influence over a vast number
                    of people assumes a gigantic responsibility when he turns them all against an important proposal by
                    merely waving a magic wand of eloquence or humor.</p>

            <p>Lincoln's birthday always brings a new crop of speeches and a new mass of comment on the
                    great emancipator in the columns of newspapers. This would be all to the good were it not for the
                    fact that so much erroneous information is furnished to unsuspecting citizens of the country. It is
                    not fair to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> to portray him as a man who was so great from an early period of his life that he had
                    no chance to grow in character, strength, and wisdom. It does not enhance his fame to paint strong
                    competitors as if they were weaklings.</p>
            <p>It is an open question whether Lincoln's vision was equal to that of Douglas in the
                    important years from 1854 to 1861. The man who realized the importance of preserving the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> after the formation of the Confederacy was more of a statesman than the party leader
                    who advocated the Wilmot Proviso principle regardless of the consequences. When in the midst of the
                    passions and hysteria created by the War, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> originated a generous plan of restoring self-government to the people of the states of
                    the South as they were brought under control by invading armies, he proved himself to be more than a
                    statesman—he then became a great man.</p>
            <p>The power to declare federal laws invalid which belongs to the Supreme Court of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> only through the reasoning of its own members is a power of doubtful value and always
                    has been. Without such a power, all laws which the Court has sustained would have remained valid as
                    the sanction of the Court would have been unnecessary. In regard to laws declared to be
                    unconstitutional by the Court, more harm than good has been done in the course of the
                    country's history. In any event, the same simple rule which Thomas Jefferson suggested to
                    President Washington when he was wrestling with the problem whether to approve or veto the Bank Bill
                    of 1791, would seem to be a wholesome guide for the Justices of the highest Court in the land
                    whenever they are in doubt. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName>, then the Secretary of State, concluded an opinion which he prepared at the request of <placeName>

                    </placeName> with this generous (He had argued against the Bank Bill) and statesmanlike advice:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">It must be added, however, that unless the President's mind on
                        a view of everything which is urged for and against this bill, is tolerably clear that it is
