            <p>In recent years there has been a growing interest among historians in the experiences of women during
                    the American Civil War. A number of works on southern women have examined the impact of the war upon
                    the daily lives of planter- and yeoman-class women and the roles played by them in both supporting
                    and undermining the Confederate war effort. Most of the studies of northern women have focused on
                    those who served in hospitals or in various relief agencies.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This article seeks to add to this growing branch of Civil War and women's history by
                    analyzing the experiences of Hoosier women who remained at home. Through a study of the fifteen
                    west-central Indiana counties that constituted the Seventh and Eighth congressional districts, this
                    article addresses two key questions: to what degree did the war force married women into
                    traditionally male roles; and why did women venture so far into the public sphere during the war and
                    then retreat from it after <placeName>

            <p>The vast majority of women in antebellum west-central Indiana lived rural lives. In 1860, the region
                    contained only two cities, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> (population 9,387) and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> (population 8,594), and two towns, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, that were large enough to be defined as cities during the war. These places combined
                    contained only 9.1 percent of the region's population in 1860. Even <list type="footnotes">

                    between 18 and 30. Most were married, and most lived in a household headed either by their husbands
                    or their fathers. Most female-headed households either contained an adult male or were located near
                    adult male relatives. Men also rarely lived in a household without women. Even most young, single
                    males lived either at home, with an employer, or with a married brother.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very few women were involved in any kind of occupation outside the home. Most of the women who were
                    employed worked in domestic fields such as sewing or as house servants. In the townships surveyed,
                    only thirteen women worked at occupations not closely associated with housework; one worked in a
                    factory and twelve in teaching. All but one of the women listing an occupation were single or
                    widowed. The women who were occupied outside their homes made up 2.5 percent of adult females.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Female literacy rates suggest that most women in west-central Indiana had some education. Although
                    most of the women surveyed were listed as being literate, female literacy varied widely from
                    township to township and appears to be associated with political affiliations. In Penn Township (<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke County</region>
                    </placeName>), in which more than nine of ten voters were Republicans, all of the adult women were
                    literate. In Jackson, the county's banner Democratic township, 44.3 percent of the women
                    were illiterate, the highest rate in the county. While Jackson's figure is unusually high,
                    some other heavily Democratic townships in the region also exhibited high female illiteracy. In

            <p>Civil War letters provide much information about the routines of everyday rural life in Indiana. Much
                    of that rhythm was set by the seasons and the agricultural events that punctuated them. The labor of
                    most farm men and women was divided by gender. Men handled the cash crops, larger farm animals,
                    construction of buildings and fences, and important market transactions. Women handled cooking,
                    gardening, sewing, washing clothes, nursing the sick, and food processing. Mothers did most of the
                    day-to-day child care, while fathers often helped establish the rules and values by which the
                    children were raised.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A sense of how immutable gender roles seemed to be can be found in some of the letters soldiers wrote
                    home. It is clear that many had never engaged in "women's work" before.
                    They sometimes expressed surprise when they learned how to sew, wash clothes, and cook. Typical of
                    such comments were those of Samuel Mattox of rural <placeName>

            <p>Women also played their conventional roles in urban areas as well. The region's cities had
                    significant numbers of men living outside of a household. Most women with occupations provided
                    services normally done by wives. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for instance, the most common kinds of women's occupations were seamstress,
                    boarding house operator, laundress, domestic, cook, and prostitute. There were only a few women
                    pursuing other occupations, such as manufacturing and teaching. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the manuscript manufacturing census lists some 617 male manufacturing workers, but
                    only 11 female workers. Of the 11, 9 worked in three small boot and shoe manufactures, and 2 were
                    part of a small clothing concern that employed 4 males. Similarly, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there were 360 male manufacturing employees, but only 2 female workers, one working
                    for a blacksmith, the other for a small wheat milling operation.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>One of the reasons women lived with adult males seems to have been that men thought that women needed
                    to be protected. The view that women lacked the will, strength, aggression, and rationality that men
                    were believed to possess and thus were unsuited for the rough and tumble world was conveyed to women
                    in many ways, both subtle and otherwise. It was imbedded in the language of male orators such as
                    Congressman Godlove Orth, who asked, "Will it be said that in the midst of our present
                    troubles we are too weak to assert our rights, or too effeminate to maintain them?"
                    Soldiers wrote home about the practice in the army of forcing men who deserted to wear dresses and
                    parade in front of their fellow soldiers. Stereotypes were also expressed and reinforced in numerous
                    short items that appeared in the region's newspapers. This material routinely pushed the
                    view that women were silly, gullible, irrational, and weak, as in the following typical sample:
                    "'Do try and talk a little common sense,' said a young lady to her
                    visitor. ‘Oh! but wouldn't that be taking an unfair advantage of
                    you?’ was the reply."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fathers shielded their daughters from the public world and advised them on how to act in a proper,
                    ladylike manner. Judge Elisha Huntington's letters to his college-aged daughter and son are
                    an excellent example of this. The letters to the son are filled with discussions of politics, war,
                    current events, and admonitions to pursue sobriety, thrift, and other standard Victorian values for
                    men. These elements are almost entirely absent from the letters he wrote to his daughter. Instead,
                    they are filled with affectionate passages and advice on how to become what was seen as an ideal
                    woman. In one letter he told Marie, "never volunteer your opinions about matters which

            <p>While for most of the region's women daily tasks left little time for leisure, especially
                    outside the home, the wives and single adult daughters of elite families lived in a very different
                    world. They had much more leisure time, were much more likely to have a substantial education, had
                    much more access to literature, newspapers, national magazines, and other sources of information
                    about the outside world, and were much more likely to travel to major cities. They were also the
                    ones who had time and opportunity to attend lyceums, society balls, and other social functions.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>In fact, there were growing educational opportunities for the daughters of the region's
                    wealthy in the years before the Civil War. Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, a Catholic college for

            </p>
            <p>Elite women were more likely than others to enter the public sphere as officers in temperance and
                    other reform organizations. They were also more likely to organize and attend plays, pageants,
                    parties, lyceums, and other social and educational events in the region's cities and larger
                    towns.</p>

            <p>Despite the number of volunteers from Penn, very few married men enlisted. Only 9 out of 104 married
                    men who were of military age enlisted before the first draft. Of the married men over the age of 45,
                    one enlisted before the first draft. Even with the draft few married men joined. Four more men under
                    45, and none over 45, enlisted after the advent of the draft. In total 12.5 percent (13 of 104) of
                    Penn's married men 45 and under served in the military.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Biographies appearing in county histories also suggest that most of the men who served were single.
                    Of some 1,185 men of prime military age (born between 1826 and 1846) living in the region, 608 were
                    married and 577 single. Of the married men, only 25.5 percent served in the military at any time
                    during the conflict, while 51.6 percent of the single males served. Although some of the married men
                    who served joined early in the war and spent three or more years in the military, many others joined
                    for shorter periods, such as three months. Not only did relatively few married men serve, but many
                    of those who did were at home for most of the war. While men in local histories are not a
                    cross-section of the community, the numbers are significant.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt economic factors played a large role in discouraging married men from volunteering. Most
                    married men were farmers who could not go to war without putting their families through economic
                    hardship and risking the loss of their farms.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Political affiliation, however,
                    was another major factor in determining whether married men volunteered. The enlistment of a few
                    highly visible Democratic leaders and the large number of volunteers in the first year of the war
                    gives the impression that there was substantial bipartisan support at first. However, relatively few
                    of the Democrats of the region joined the army, while large numbers of Republicans enlisted.</p>
            <p>Among the married men who appear in county histories, 162 were Democrats and 282 were Republicans.

            <p>How was it possible for so many men to avoid military service even after drafts were implemented,
                    especially when standard works estimate that two-thirds of military-aged males served? Few drafts
                    were held in west-central Indiana, because most counties, cities, and townships raised bounties to
                    pay men to fill their quotas. Even when a draft was held, most of those drafted did not serve
                    because they hired a substitute, paid a commutation fee, or, most commonly, failed the physical.
                    Even a man of modest means could find ways of obtaining the $300 for a commutation fee or
                    the larger sums often paid for a substitute. In <placeName>

                    the member out of the army. Also, many estimates of how many men served are too large because they
                    are based on static population figures that do not account for growth.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>These findings suggest that the vast majority of married women in this region had their husbands at
                    home throughout the war, and that the families most likely to be disrupted by absences were
                    Republican. Doggy's complaint about the area's manlessness refers to the young men
                    in her pro-Union circle of friends, not to the general conditions of her county. Obviously, some
                    Democrats did serve, but for the region's Democratic population the hardships women and
                    families suffered were not nearly so great as those of Republicans.</p>
            <p>Still the fact remains that some husbands and possibly a majority of single males did serve for some
                    time in the military. Did the absence of so many men lead to women conducting farm work and other
                    traditionally male tasks? The available literary evidence suggests that for the women of
                    west-central Indiana the answer is no. It appears to have been rare for a woman to do male tasks on
                    the farm or leave their gender-defined economic roles.</p>

                    </placeName> faced a harvest time with two of his sons gone, he and his remaining son cooperated
                    with a neighbor and his son to bring the harvests in. While Basil Jewell was in the army, his wife
                    did not have to handle major marketplace transactions because his father took care of them. Many
                    soldiers, such as Samuel Mattox of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo County</region>
                    </placeName> and Isaiah Hutchison of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, virtually micromanaged their farms from the front, sending a steady flow of letters to
                    their wives with specific instructions on various matters. Some fathers, such as Jewell, issued
                    advice and rules from the front to both their wives and children on how their children were to
                    behave and be taught. Even when a soldier was killed, kin and neighbors rallied to support the widow
                    until she remarried. When Sarah A. Dooley's son died in the army, she told another of her
                    children that her son's widow had the resources and friends necessary to get along without
                    undue hardship.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite the war's demands, male farm laborers were still available to harvest cash crops.
                    Jewell, for example, hired men to harvest the wheat crop he had planted before leaving home. Since
                    wheat was a cash crop, his wife either could pay the workers out of the money the commodity
                    generated or she could give them a percentage of the crop. Another alternative for a soldier was to
                    rent out part or all of his farm and use the rent revenue to support his wife and children. Other
                    activities, such as chopping firewood for the home, could be hired out and paid for either by the
                    military allotment the husband sent home or by the support payments local government supplied in
                    some areas. Samuel Mattox, for instance, had a neighborhood boy move in with his family during the
                    winter in order to attend to cutting firewood and other typically male tasks.</p>
            <p>Labor was available not only because a number of young men did not serve but also because not all
                    young men who enlisted were gone for the duration. Barton Dooley, for example, joined short-term
                    enlistment units three different times, served in the local Home Guard unit, provided farm labor on
                    three different farms, and worked in a sorghum factory in <placeName>

            <p>How well urban women fared during the war is more difficult to determine. Many of the surviving
                    letters written by city women are from wives of army officers who had been well-to-do lawyers,

                    filled with romantic passages, gossip about the local social scene, and politics. Rarely did they
                    mention either economic difficulties or the disruption of normal gender routines. As with rural
                    families, husbands sent home a range of instructions and often had male kinfolk available to handle
                    special problems. Bernard Schermerhorn, for instance, sent instructions to his wife about running
                    the household, rearing the children, supporting his widowed mother, and educating his college-aged
                    sister. His uncle and a male friend also performed various tasks for his family in his absence. Aden
                    Cavins sent detailed instructions to his wife on the rearing of their children. Some elite men
                    relied on banking and business associates to attend to many of the economic needs of their wives and
                    families, as did Mahlon Manson of Crawfordsville. An officer's wife, such as
                    Cavin's wife, Matilda, also had the advantage of visiting her husband at the front and
                    living with him for some time during winter quarters.</p>
            <p>Although there is very little information about the wives of poorer, unskilled urban workers,
                    circumstantial evidence suggests that the war was particularly hard on this small part of the
                    region's female population. These women often did not have the same kind of networks
                    available to them as did rural and more prosperous women. Instead they relied upon the public
                    welfare provided to dependents of soldiers by local governments and by acts of private charity. One
                    of the most common forms of supporting them in many large towns and cities was a grand parade of
                    farm wagons coming into town loaded with firewood and food items for poor urban soldiers'
                    families. In one instance in 1864, some fifty-two loaded wagons paraded through the streets of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Such relief efforts were necessary, in part, because even town-dwelling women had few opportunities
                    for employment outside the home. The region's small manufacturing sector overwhelmingly
                    employed men. Even in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the largest business and banking concerns were small-scale affairs often operated by
                    two partners and maybe a few male clerks. When a few women were hired as printers in <placeName>

                    in washing, but few women sought employment outside the home. Most poorer town-dwelling wives stayed
                    home and lived on money sent by their husbands, charity, and local government welfare.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    arena very much like the one John Mack Faragher finds in mid-nineteenth-century central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> This public sphere included such activities as voting,
                    officeholding and adjudicating, serving on juries, participating in political conventions and
                    rallies, conducting formal market exchanges, serving in the military, taking vigilante action,
                    public fighting, participating in reform organizations, engaging in political debates, making
                    political speeches, and writing political essays and editorials. Before the war, women's
                    minor forays into these areas were sanctioned by the belief of many that women were morally superior
                    to men. Women's moral acumen seemed to justify their organizing, speechmaking, and other
                    activities associated with moral reforms such as temperance and organized charity.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> During the war these female realms in the public sphere were significantly expanded as
                    women engaged in a variety of activities that aided the Union cause and provided for the material
                    needs of soldiers and their families.</p>
            <p>The most common women's activities on the home front were the Ladies' Aid
                    Societies. After Governor Oliver P. Morton requested the creation of these societies in October
                    1861, the counties of west-central Indiana responded with varying degrees of enthusiasm. In some
                    counties, such as Sullivan, more than a year passed before an organization was created. Other
                    counties, such as Parke and Warren, quickly created a county-level society and many township and
                    community societies. In some counties all of the officers of the Ladies' Aid organizations
                    were women, while in others both men and women held leadership positions.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>The main task of these societies was to provide bandages, clothing, food items, and anything else
                    that might be of use to Hoosier soldiers. These items were usually shipped either to the troops or
                    to military hospitals through the state sanitary commission. Newspapers in the region published
                    lists of the donations the local societies were sending to the front. Many of the goods shipped by
                    the societies were the same things being sent by individual women to their loved ones. In fact, the
                    societies provided clothing and food for those young, single transient men who had no relatives and
                    no long-term ties.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to sending needed materials, women conducted a wide variety of fundraising activities for
                    the soldiers and their families. Sanitary fairs are the most well-known, but women found other
                    inventive ways to raise money as well. In many towns before the war, the women of leading families
                    had produced plays, pageants, and other public entertainments and did the same during the war to
                    raise money for the soldiers. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for instance, women mounted an elaborate play in which some eighty children were
                    dressed as famous historical figures and some twenty young women portrayed various countries. The
                    young ladies explained to the goddess of liberty why the nation they symbolized was a free
                        country.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Women also engaged in activities designed to encourage both enlistments and the resolve of those who
                    had already joined. Women often provided patriotic songs, speeches, and poems at rallies to
                    encourage recruitment and public support for the war. They attended ceremonies marking the departure
                    of their men for the front and often presented a flag made by local women to the troops. They also
                    welcomed home returning troops and provided food for such ceremonies.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>West-central Indiana did not have any large, permanent hospital facilities in which local women could

                    military medical emergencies arose, the region's women were ready to act. Both Terre Haute
                    and Lafayette became the temporary homes of Confederate prisoners in 1862 while prison facilities in <placeName>

            <p>The participation of women in public political activities expanded dramatically during the war.

                    Democratic women posed on floats in political parades and wore party symbols, such as the wartime

            <p>During the war the public roles of Republican women expanded significantly, while those of Democratic
                    women remained virtually nonexistent. A number of local women made public speeches and published
                    prose and poetry on the war and other issues of the day. In 1862 three young <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Parke County</region>
                    </placeName> women gave speeches on the war, the texts of which were then published in the local
                    newspaper. Lizzie Boynton of <placeName>

            <p>By providing women with a forum, the Republican party allowed them to go beyond accepted limits and
                    to participate in the political dialogue over the war. In mid-nineteenth-century Indiana, political
                    speakers and writers did a great deal to mold the attitudes of voters. Public speakers made
                    connections between the cultural values of the audience and the party's positions on the
                    issues of the day. Thus allowing women to publish or speak in public gave them a role in forming the
                    opinions of male voters.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>Public charitable and political activities by women were only the visible tip of a large iceberg of
                    similar activities being carried on in private life by thousands of Hoosier women. Civil War letters
                    reveal that virtually all women, whether Democratic or Republican, whether rich or of modest means,
                    were engaged in sewing and knitting clothes for their soldier relatives and friends and in preparing
                    and sending all kinds of food, writing paper, and other needs to them. From Matilda Cavins, wife of
                    a well-to-do lawyer, to Sarah Dooley, a Republican farmer's wife, to the wife and grown
                    daughter of Democrat J. W. Smith, women attempted to help their men.</p>
            <p>In addition to sending provisions, Republican women sought to encourage enlistments and boost the
                    morale of their soldier husbands and sons in private just as some of them did in their public
                    speeches. Many young women refused to associate with men eligible for ser- <list type="footnotes">

                    often deluged with letters from female relatives and friends encouraging him to maintain a high
                    standard of personal morality. Rufus Dooley received a steady flow of such letters from his mother

                    maintain his moral standards. Her letters were reinforced by those of an array of young female
                    relatives and neighborhood friends. In addition, at least one young woman who was not a relative or
                    friend wrote to Dooley to propose a correspondence. This patriotic woman, who was already

            <p>The different levels of women's participation in public debates reflected the political
                    ideologies of the two parties, which in turn embodied many of the cultural views and values shared
                    by each party's constituencies.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Most of the area's Democrats
                    believed that all citizens were equal but that only those who possessed the attributes of a free man
                    should be admitted to citizenship. For Democrats a free man had to have the will to fight to defend
                    his freedoms. Democrats believed that neither women nor male blacks possessed the masculine
                    characteristics that were necessary for citizenship. Democratic males would not countenance any kind
                    of half-citizenship status: a person either had the will of a free man, or he did not; a person was
                    either a complete and equal citizen, or he was not a citizen at all.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>In contrast, Republican males thought that women had some limited public roles to play. Republicans
                    thought that a free man had obtained self-control through a long process of character building aided
                    by religion, formal education, and other forms of discipline. Although Republicans shared some
                    Democratic ideas of feminine weakness, they also saw women as particularly strong in ways that fit

                    nurturing. The strengths Republicans attributed to women along with their definition of free men
                    made it easy for them to sanction political roles for women, including public roles in reform
                    societies and moral campaigns and private roles developing the character of husbands and sons.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Republican men readily admitted the importance of women to moral development. Republican editors in
                    the region ran a number of stories and editorials emphasizing the importance of the moral impact
                    women had on society. Individual Republican men also noted the personal influence of their wives.
                    William H. Crowder, a Republican from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName>, wrote in one of his many letters to his wife that much of what was good in him was
                    "owing to the teachings and controlling influences of his ‘Angel in
                    Calico’ Juliet."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Thus different ideologies of manhood and
                    liberty led the members of the two parties to have different views on women's roles in the
                    public sphere and resulted in differing wartime experiences for Hoosier women.</p>
            <p>For Republican women, entering the political arena to support the war effort was simply an extension
                    of their peacetime reform activities, just as helping soldiers and their families was an extension
                    of the help they had given to kinfolk and neighbors before the war. Urging men to save the Union by
                    doing their patriotic duty replicated prewar efforts to encourage better, more moral male citizens.
                    While their wartime activities were similar to prewar ones, they were, nevertheless, on a much
                    larger scale. Did their wartime experiences awaken a desire in women to have an even larger and more
                    permanent part to play in public life? An answer to this question can be found in the beliefs and
                    attitudes of two west-central Indiana women who left a significant literary record.</p>
            <p>The war made a substantial intrusion into Sarah Dooley's life. Three of her four sons served
                    in the army; one was killed. Her husband, Silas, and two sons also served in Home Guard units, at
                    least two of which held drills at her home. She attended various public rallies and celebrations,
                    was involved in charitable activities, and provided a steady stream of letters to her soldier sons,
                    which provide a good sense of what she did during the conflict.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>

            <p>The military and Home Guard service of the Dooley males did not force Sarah Dooley into traditionally
                    male work. Her daily routine remained much the same as it had always been. What did expand, however,
                    was her part in molding the character of her sons. While her husband occasionally wrote moral and
                    patriotic instructions, it was Sarah who did most of the teaching and preaching. She was very well
                    informed on the issues involved in the war. Her letters reveal that she regularly read the local
                    newspaper accounts of the war and attended Republican rallies and other public events. They also
                    show that she was well informed on what people in her neighborhood thought and that she talked to
                    returned military officers to learn their views. She betrayed no hesitancy in speaking her mind on
                    political and religious subjects, even when her views were different from those of her husband.</p>
            <p>Sarah's letters reflect a Republican point of view. She expressed maternal affection for her
                    sons, but this, as was often the case in male Republican letters as well, was almost invariably
                    linked to demands that they exercise Christian self-control and do their duty to the nation. In
                    1861, for instance, she wrote to her son Rufus: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Sarah Dooley's letters include numerous passages in which she comments on the war
                    ("this glorious cause of justice and liberty"), its meaning, and its importance.
                    She comments on a range of political issues including what she saw as the disloyalty of Daniel W.
                    Voorhees, the Democratic congressman from the Seventh district, and his followers ("the
                    rebels in the north"), and the fairness of offering bounties to encourage enlistments. On
                    bounties she stated, "no honest man will vote for it, it is too injust when a man has done
                    as much as your pap and various others then be taxed to hire men to fight for these cowards of a

                    which, in their minds, was the guarantor of freedom. To Dooley and many others, secession was caused
                    by men who had not developed sufficient character to restrain their passions. Secession was a wild
                    revolt against laws, majority rule, and governmental orders, all of which were necessary for true
                    freedom. Dooley continually preached in her letters that one must submit to God's laws and
                    to the laws of the government; rebellion only leads to self-destruction.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In her view, west-central Indiana Democrats were, like the secessionists, passionate men whose
                    rebellion against Morton and Lincoln could lead to the destruction of themselves and the state. In
                    her fear and dislike of local Democrats she chronicled their acts of violence in Parke, denounced
                    their positions, and angrily complained about how they would not join the army. Just as Confederates
                    were a threat to the nation and its freedoms, so too were Democrats.</p>
            <p>Because Dooley blamed secession and disloyalty on the failure of individual men to develop
                    self-control, character, and Christian morals, she combatted these flaws within the members of her
                    family. It was not enough for her sons to fight the Confederates; they must fight their own passions
                    as well. She, like most Republican women, had a great fear of the evils of camp life: gambling,
                    drunkenness, and fornication. Her exhortations to her sons to live moral lives in the army were
                    relentless and, ultimately, successful. After drinking for a while, Rufus and Atelus joined a unit
                    temperance society. The society's resolutions and roster were published in the <placeName>

                    neighborhood girls who preached the same message in numerous letters to Rufus. These women felt that
                    they were in a great contest for order and freedom that would effect the course of history. So
                    important was the cause that Dooley often repeated to her son that "I would rather
                    … hear my son was slain in battle than to have him return to my armes a
                    diserter[.]" When she talked of sending her boys to war and possible death, she drew upon
                    religious imagery, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In west-central Indiana most Republican women believed that if the great American experiment in
                    democracy was to be saved, they would have to fight on multiple levels: on the battlefield against
                    the Confederacy, at the ballot box against the Democrats, and in the hearts and minds of their men
                    against uncontrolled passions. On each of these fronts Republican women's efforts had to be
                    mediated through men, but this did nothing to lessen the fervency with which women pursued their
                    goals. Republican ideology helped motivate women to take action because while it provided them with
                    opportunities to speak in public and to play roles in reform, it also instilled within women the
                    self-confidence that allowed them to believe that they could perform public roles.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Understanding Hoosier women's sources of self-confidence during and after the Civil War is
                    important. Sarah Dooley and other Republican women could pursue their wartime roles with such
                    boldness because of the cultural and religious values of Republican ideology. This same ideology,
                    however, also limited most Republican women by defining the boundaries of their authority. They were
                    restrained not only by legal impediments and social conventions, but also by the source of their
                    self-confidence. This point helps to explain why most women who had done so much during the war had
                    no public role after it ended. The war, if anything, made women even more committed to the cultural
                    and ideological values they shared with their men, including the ones that defined gender roles.
                    Most Republican women wanted to save what had existed before the war, not challenge the gender
                    status quo.</p>
            <p>Although the majority of the region's women relinquished their wartime roles, there was a
                    very small group of women in west-central Indiana who, after the war, began to push for greater
                    women's rights, especially the right to vote. Most of these women were Republican, but they
                    differed from other Republican women by having a different source of self-confidence; a source
                    similar to the one used by prewar suffragists of the Northeast. One such woman was Lizzie Boynton of <placeName>

            <p>If Boynton's writings and actions show great self-assurance, her private letters show
                    another aspect of this young Hoosier. A major theme in her wartime letters to William Harbert, the
                    man she would eventually marry, is her uncertainty about whether she was living up to the standards
                    of a "true woman."<hi rend="sup">61</hi> On the one hand, she felt that she must
                    write cheerful, reassuring letters to her man at the front. But on the other hand, she cannot help
                    pouring out her angst about her own identity, whether Harbert really loves her, and whether she is
                    loyal enough to the Union cause.</p>
            <p>Boynton's writings demonstrate an unusual degree of self-awareness and an acute appreciation
                    of the fact that her substantial intellectual talents could be exercised in very few ways. Whatever

                    engendered, she was certain of her intellectual abilities and their parity with those of the men she
                    knew. Like other suffrage leaders both before and after the war, her confidence came from a sense of
                    intellectual equality rather than from Republican ideology.</p>
            <p>Although Boynton was vehemently in favor of the Union cause, she defined it differently than did
                    Sarah Dooley and most other Hoosier women, who saw the war primarily as a crisis of order. For
                    Boynton slavery was of central importance. Although she did occasionally comment on order, she wrote
                    her most impassioned political passages on the necessity for emancipation. Only when the
                    "terrible evil" of slavery was ended, she wrote, "may an american feel
                    that he lives in a free country. God speed that day."<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Boynton occupied herself by supporting abolitionism and the Union cause, she continued to look
                    for more permanent outlets for her talents. After the war she became an enthusiastic supporter of
                    the national women's rights movement because it held that women were the equals of men and
                    should have the right to do whatever their abilities permitted them to do. Boynton's
                    desires for education are spelled out in her 1871 novel, <hi rend="i">Beyond Her Sphere.</hi> The
                    book's heroine, modeled on the author, is a talented young girl who, frustrated by the
                    limits society has put upon her, comes to see women's rights as the means to change the
                    world to accommodate women like her. Indeed, Boynton repeatedly interrupts the flow of her story to
                    preach to her readers on the need to abandon old beliefs.</p>
            <p>By 1869 Boynton was one of the few suffrage leaders from west-central Indiana. In that year, with the
                    aid and counsel of women's rights crusader Mary Livermore, she organized a women's
                    rights convention at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although the local Republican newspaper was supportive, most other Republican papers
                    in the region did not back the idea of woman suffrage. The local Democratic newspaper blasted the
                    proceedings as "a ridiculous affair," Livermore as a "he woman,"
                    and the men who participated as "male fools." It proclaimed that
                    Livermore's teachings "would destroy all that is beautiful, pure and virtuous in
                    women." Boynton and her fellow suffragists were a distinct minority in a state (and nation)
                    where most were either hostile or apathetic to their cause.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

                    </placeName> woman wrote to a female friend in Attica of the sacrifices endured by many Hoosier
                    women. "The <hi rend="i">horrors</hi> of war can never be depicted—the broken
                    hearted, insane mothers and wives can never come in the pages of history and in the columns of
                    newspapers when the ‘list of killed and wounded’ is made up for the
                        public."<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Of Indiana's volunteers 25,028 died during the
                    war, and many thousands more were wounded. Even the families of those who returned alive suffered
                    many anxious days, especially in the period between the newspaper reports of a major battle and the
                    arrival of letters from the front. Despite the emotional disruption created by the war, the conflict
                    did not seriously disrupt gender routines. The war presented no significant opportunity for
                    Democratic women to enter the public sphere. A substantial number of Republican women participated
                    in the public sphere to an unprecedented degree, but they seem to have done so out of patriotic
                    zeal, not rebellion against their conventional roles. With the exception of a very small minority of
                    women who engaged in the suffrage movement, most Republican women returned to the kinds of public
                    roles they had played before the war.</p>
            <p>John Mack Faragher finds that, in mid-nineteenth-century <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, what incipient feminist consciousness existed was confined to a small number of urban
                    women, and that widespread "women's self-assertion" only began with the
                    dramatic economic changes of the late nineteenth century. The same appears to have been true of
                    women in Indiana. The Civil War was not a watershed for the women of west-central Indiana. The kind
                    of male-female economic interdependency that existed in the region before the war continued to
                    reinforce gender roles until the end of the nineteenth century. The socioeconomic transformations
                    created by turn-of-the-century industrialization and urbanization allowed major changes to take
                    place in the everyday lives and routines of large numbers of Hoosier women. These changes, in turn,
                    set the stage for an expansion of women's civil rights.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>

            <p>Scholars have long chronicled the unsuccessful attempts of local governments to address the
                    devastating social problems brought on by the Depression. Local relief projects proliferated after
                    the stock market crash in October 1929, but they quickly depleted local resources, and most folded
                    soon after they were begun. By the summer of 1931 local governments and charities could no longer
                    shoulder the responsibility for the unemployed.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Cities with high unemployment
                    and limited funding sought state and federal intervention. Most often, historians have concentrated
                    on the largest cities, where in 1930 fewer than 19 percent of the nation lived but where demands for
                    relief were the heaviest. Scholarly studies have rarely focused on local projects in medium-sized

                    themselves and their families. Citizens consistently supported politicians and plans that emphasized
                    a moderate course of action.</p>
            <p>Reginald Sullivan, who served as the Democratic mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> during much of the Depression, illustrates the moderate, businesslike character of the
                    city's politics and people. Elected in 1929, he captured almost every election district,
                    many of which had, four years earlier, voted Republican. Sullivan garnered high praise from the
                    Republican-leaning <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Star</hi>, and many prominent Republicans later supported him for a second term.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Sullivan balanced the city's budget and did not challenge its social
                    arrangements, such as segregation in public education. During the Depression, like the Republican
                    governor, he refused to authorize bonds for relief. Elected twice to office, his popularity
                    reflected, in part, the general values of city residents.</p>
            <p>The mayor was not the only one to subscribe to a pro-business philosophy. All of the city's
                    major newspapers approved of a general business approach to government and society, as did many
                    citizens. In the late 1920s, residents desired increased efficiency and less political influence in
                    government decision-making. Voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum adopting a city-manager style
                    of government, widely regarded at the time as more efficient, less political, and more businesslike
                    than a mayor/city council structure.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Although the Indiana Supreme Court struck
                    down the measure in 1930, the referendum made clear that residents wanted a government run on
                    business principles.</p>

            <p>Despite good economic times, wages were insufficient to provide for savings. A 1929 Brookings

            <p>For over a century political and civic leaders had built a structure of private philanthropy and
                    public charity to aid those who were in need, both black and white. Before Indiana was granted
                    statehood, structured public charity existed in the form of an overseer of the poor.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> As a territory, Indiana adopted Elizabethan poor laws so that those not covered by
                    private charity would not starve. After statehood, the township trustee, an elected official of the
                    county, was responsible for administering public aid. Trustees, in conjunction with advisory
                    committees, gave out public aid to the needy. They managed budgets, oversaw social work, and were
                    the county's primary public welfare officers. The trustee for Center Township of <placeName>

                    houses. Almost every private group was controlled by a board of directors and managed by a paid
                    executive, who was usually a trained social worker. Many Protestant churches handed out charity
                    through a deacons board, while the Catholic Archdiocese of <placeName>

                    created new organizations to solve new ailments. Grants were not given to individuals; instead,
                    money was allocated to groups for experimentation and education or given to agencies that needed
                    additional money to make up deficits in their budgets. Created in 1916, the Foundation was one of
                    the nation's few community trusts in 1929. Three banks held funds donated by individuals to

                    Settlement houses, such as Flanner House, dispensed relief and sponsored similar programs. Relief
                    was increasingly seen as a responsibility of the public sector. The FWS dispensed most of the relief
                    given to families, while Wheeler Mission, the Salvation Army, and Volunteers of America took care of
                    the largest number of transients and vagrants.</p>

                    over $700,000, with most receiving close to what they requested. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> Community Fund mirrored national trends as both the number of community organizations
                    and donations to them increased throughout the 1920s.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Since its inception in
                    1921, the Fund had become more popular with the public and more beneficial for its member agencies.
                    From 1922 to 1928 overall contributions increased from $445,000 to $762,000,
                    while the number of donors increased from 16,000 to 52,000.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The Fund awarded
                    nonrelief agencies 53 percent of the 1929 Community Fund budget, a percentage that had been

            </p>
            <p>The 1920s had not prepared the Fund for any catastrophe. The Community Fund did not envision the
                    possibility of an economic calamity and therefore did not give attention to the capacity of relief
                    organizations. While the Fund successfully provided its member agencies with money, it did not
                    seriously try to use its economic power to coerce agencies to streamline their operations or
                    consolidate their functions. Many "character-building" agencies still had sizable
                    "relief departments. Efficiency remained a goal of the Fund but not one that it was willing
                    to enforce.</p>
            <p>Some agencies, including several church-based organizations, created relief-giving community centers
                    that were not part of the Community Fund. Mayer Chapel, a southside mission of the Second
                    Presbyterian Church, provided both relief and character-building programs. Religious organizations
                    of all stripes tended to give only short-term relief, relying on the other agencies for persisting
                        needs.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>Philanthropic organizations expressed concern for problems facing African Americans by promoting
                    self-help organizations. Several philanthropic organizations worked in the black community giving
                    both relief and advice. Local philanthropist Frank Flanner and the COS created Flanner House to
                    allow African Americans to help themselves to a better economic position. Interracial committees

                    ties of friendship, mutual interests, or religious affiliation. Board members often enjoyed long
                    tenures and could therefore establish contacts over a long period of time, but this did not lead to
                    a centralized controlling mechanism. The agency that came nearest to being a centralizing force by
                    gathering information on all others was the Council on Social Agencies. It only collected
                    information, however, and never directed philanthropic endeavors.</p>

                    $250 or more, accounted for 74 percent of funds raised for use in 1930. Perhaps more
                    revealing is that those giving $10,000 or more accounted for 22 percent of all gifts.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                    <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-097-2-042"/> An analysis of seventy-nine board members from the most
                    prominent boards reveals a very dense network. The average board member interacted on a regular
                    basis with sixty-four other board members from approximately two other agencies. In 1929 there was a
                    single network in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Most everyone in leadership positions knew and interacted with everyone else, and a
                    core group of powerful people, which included pharmaceutical manufacturer J. K. Lilly, Sr.,
                    dominated most boards. Since organizations were centralized and many people were active in at least
                    two agencies together, information gathered by one board was easily transferred to other groups.
                    From this tightly-knit network stemmed a large degree of information and resource sharing with
                    little friction. In addition, because of the cohesiveness of the network, a consensus emerged among
                        philanthropists.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Philanthropic leaders were strikingly similar in their backgrounds and activities. Of the

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s most prominent philanthropic agencies, most were born either in Indiana or
                    the surrounding states.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> All were white and more than three-quarters were men.
                    More than a third belonged to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Club, the Athletic Club, or the Woodstock Country Club, with most belonging to at least
                    two of the three. Almost half of the seventy-nine were Masons; more than half were members of the
                    Chamber of Commerce. At a time when fewer than 15 percent of the population attended college, more
                    than two-thirds of the board members had graduated and many had earned higher academic honors. The
                    average age of the leaders in 1930 was 52, almost a decade older than the city's average.
                    In addition most were Republicans and lived among the city's wealthiest citizens in its
                    most prestigious real estate districts.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

                    businessmen. Rather than coordinating agencies, they placed an emphasis on the elimination of
                    competing agencies to achieve optimum efficiency. Throughout the late 1920s and into the early 1930s

                    </placeName> social workers and the board members who hired them continued to speak of
                    "unemployables" and those of "low character." While work relief
                    allowed an individual to keep his dignity and strengthen moral reserve, a lack of will to work and a
                    flawed character marked one as "unworthy" of relief and
                    "unemployable" by industry. Board members and social work executives praised
                    self-sufficiency, thrift, and hard work. Further, they believed that case work and character
                    building could instill these virtues in others. In a 1929 letter to Foster, the <placeName>

            <p>Frequent remarks made by both social work professionals and board members contended that private
                    social work was superior to work in the public sector. In March 1928, the Service and Relief
                    Committee of the FWS was concerned about both the low number of social workers in the public
                    township trustee offices and the inadequate training they received. Ten years later, the general
                    secretary of the society still questioned the "rigid" policies and
                    "inadequate" relief being given by the township offices.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

                    philanthropy to meet the needs of the populace during an economic emergency. He believed in private
                    philanthropy but realized that public funding for emergencies and basic aid were necessary and even
                    obligatory. A local social work executive confidentially described Rappaport as a man who
                    "realized the part which social problems play in the breakdown of individual families in a

                    the board of directors for the Community Fund and Circle Theatre and served as president of the FWS.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the executives chosen to manage the daily operations of philanthropic groups interacted
                    with one another and shared similar backgrounds. Their close involvement with one another was due to
                    both professional and personal interests. Several prominent social workers organized a local chapter
                    of the American Association of Social Workers in 1923.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> They met monthly to
                    hear speakers on the future of social work and to discuss common problems and concerns. They could

                    </placeName> Foundation. He supported socially liberal programs such as publicly funded old-age
                    pensions and unemployment insurance. Like Foster, Gill actively participated in his church, the
                    Downey Avenue Christian Church. He did not serve on any prestigious boards, but did belong to the
                    Service Club, the American Legion, and was a Mason. Gill graduated from Indiana University and <placeName>

            <p>A sense of moderation generally guided the dialogue between businessmen and social workers.
                    Conservative and prominent men such as Lilly and William Fortune agreed with Rappaport and Gill that
                    relief should be publicly funded. Rhoda Morrow, executive secretary of the FWS, argued that the best
                    social work was done by private groups, giving voice to the thoughts of Foster and Brown.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> All the men discussed above accepted the necessity for local public relief,
                    but several viewed private philanthropy as superior to public relief.</p>
            <p>Men dominated the boards of philanthropic groups in the late 1920s, but women oversaw most of the
                    day-to-day operations of charities and had done so for quite some time. During the Progressive Era,
                    women's groups embraced issues of child welfare, the health and safety of families, and
                    poverty. A board of women managers, for example, ran the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Asylum for Friendless Colored Children. Likewise Anna Stover and Edith Surbey founded
                    Christamore House in 1905. Black women joined together to fight tuberculosis in their community. As
                    with nursing and teaching, social work was seen as an acceptable expansion of the woman's
                    "natural" responsibilities during the Progressive Era.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

                    </placeName> Benevolent Society and the COS, frequently loaned social workers to the Center Township
                    Trustee, who carried the heaviest relief burden. Social workers in private agencies normally worked
                    closely with the public township trustee's office. Public agencies also used the
                    FWS's registration service, a registry containing the names of all past relief recipients.
                    The officers of each agency knew one another well, and contact between agencies was frequent as
                    employees shared information concerning clients and attended the same social work conferences.</p>
            <p>Board members and social workers alike had good reason to be ebullient in the fall of 1929.

                    supported both the Phyllis Wheatley YWCA and the Wheeler Mission, seeing them as social investments
                    in the community. Other allocations included scholarships to high school, college, and graduate

                    relief organizations an extra year relatively free of hardship compared to several cities throughout
                    the nation. There were more potential donors for the 1930 Community Fund campaign and fewer people

                    and 1933. The city had a clear philanthropic tradition that reminded civic leaders of past
                    achievements and present responsibilities. Strong and consistent leadership provided by the economic
                    and social elite of the city alleviated the problems of unemployment. The network of elites
                    positioned in the city's philanthropic sector was ready to strengthen the public-private
                    partnership. Individual leaders were in contact with almost every other philanthropic agency and
                    with local government officials. In the next several years the partnership would lead to more
                    formal, centralized ties than those of the 1920s.</p>

            <p>Michael A. Peake presents an intriguing portrait of the early history of the First German,
                    Thirty-Second Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. In August 1861, the state of Indiana charged
                    August von Willich, a former Prussian officer who had left Europe following the defeat of the 1848
                    uprisings, with the task of creating a regiment of German immigrants. Demonstrating their commitment
                    to fighting for their new country, over four hundred German-American men joined this regiment on the
                    first day of enlistment, and eventually this group attracted recruits from several midwestern states
                    and even <placeName>
                        <country reg="tnu">Tennessee</country>
                    </placeName>. In this work, Peake traces the activities of this regiment from its founding through
                    its deployment in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and the first major engagement at the Battle of Rowlett's Station.</p>
            <p>Peake's discussion of the regiment provides insight into the experiences of immigrant
                    soldiers in the Civil War. Peake emphasizes the unit's European military training, which
                    helped to make it one of the most highly disciplined Indiana regiments from the war's
                    outset. The unit demonstrated its military prowess and bravery during the Battle of
                    Rowlett's Station when it triumphed despite being greatly outnumbered. Perhaps the most
                    admirable aspect of this study is Peake's investigations of how the German-American culture
                    of this regiment affected the soldiers' experiences of military life. For example, when the
                    regiment traveled to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, the German-American community
                    ecstatically welcomed them with banquets and the presentation of gifts such as a regimental flag.
                    Peake's description of the regiment during 1861 shows that, in camp and on the field of
                    battle, the unit's ethnic identity significantly distinguished it from other Union
                    regiments.</p>
            <p>In the foreword, Peake notes that this volume is an initial contribution to a more comprehensive
                    study of the Thirty-Second Indiana that he plans to write. Many authors have written regimental
                    histories and books about Civil War battles and campaigns. However, in this work Peake reveals the
                    rich and unique opportunities this regiment offers for studies of Indiana's participation
                    in the Civil War in general and the experiences of German-American Union soldiers in particular.</p>

            <p>This first full-length biography of Albion Fellows Bacon (1865–1933) is a compelling
                    account of one of Indiana's, and the nation's, foremost advocates of housing
                    regulation and reform in the early twentieth century. Drawing on thorough research, Robert G.
                    Barrows brings this relatively unknown public figure into focus and demonstrates her significance
                    not just for the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Indiana but also for the history of American reform and American women.</p>
            <p>Barrows follows Bacon's path to civic participation in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and later throughout Indiana. He describes her discontent with a <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-097-2-052"/> life of private domesticity, her awakening to the problem of poverty
                    and poor housing in one of Indiana's principal industrial cities, and her impressive
                    legislative lobbying and public policy making. Bacon grew up in rural McCutchanville, Indiana, and
                    graduated from high school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Limited family funds prevented her from attending college, so Bacon worked as a legal
                    secretary and a court stenographer. After marrying Hilary Edwin Bacon, an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> dry goods merchant, in 1888, Bacon, like most women of her class, occupied herself in
                    the domestic sphere and devoted herself to her husband and children. But Bacon was not content and
                    suffered in the 1890s from "nervous prostration" or neurasthenia. Barrows
                    concludes that the disease was "a psychosomatic response to frustrated ambition"
                    (p. 30).</p>
            <p>Like other women in the Progressive era, Bacon found an outlet for her talents, intelligence, and
                    ambition in social reform. She began as a friendly visitor to the poor and helped found a Visiting
                    Nurse's Circle, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Flower Mission, the Working Girls' Association, and a local chapter of the
                    Young Women's Christian Association. Her concern over housing conditions propelled her onto
                    the state and national stage. Barrows details Bacon's crusade for statewide housing reform,
                    which in 1909, 1913, and 1917 resulted in legislation regulating tenement construction and
                    operation. Calling for the "protection of the homes of Indiana," Bacon forged an
                    effective coalition of organizations and political leaders to campaign for laws that would make
                    Indiana into a model of housing reform. Bacon also deployed her expertise and energy in behalf of
                    child welfare (especially Indiana's juvenile justice system) during and after World War I
                    and for urban planning in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the 1920s.</p>
            <p>With this thoughtful and well-written biography, Barrows demonstrates the significance of small
                    cities at the turn of the twentieth century as places where women pushed against the boundaries of
                    separate spheres and became important actors in shaping public policy and practice. Barrows clearly
                    admires Bacon, portraying her—as Bacon did herself—as an independent,
                    nonpartisan municipal housekeeper and a moderate who occupied the high moral ground of housing
                    reform. Barrows is not uncritical, commenting, for example, on Bacon's racism. He carefully
                    considers how other factors accounted for her successes, and thus mitigates the tendency of
                    biographers to claim all credit for their subjects. Barrows acknowledges that reform gave
                    middle-class women like Bacon a sense of purpose and that it was inspired by self-interest as much
                    as altruism. Bacon, he also observes, demonstrated "that reform efforts were not only
                    philanthropic but also defensive" (p. 140). Barrows, however, does not sustain his analysis
                    of Bacon and does not examine the tensions her efforts generated between social justice and social
                    control. We do not learn how poor tenants or parents regarded Bacon's efforts, what Bacon
                    thought of the success of the eugenics movement in Indiana, <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-097-2-053"/> or
                    her response to the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. Nevertheless, Barrows effectively describes the
                    process by which Bacon achieved success and fame, assesses her contributions to progressivism,
                    situates Indiana in the national scene, and weighs Bacon's commitments to gender equality.
                    One of a mere handful of books on Indiana women's history, Barrows's fine
                    biography of Bacon should serve as a model and an inspiration for more work in this area.</p>

            <p>Timothy R. Mahoney offers his history of the antebellum upper <geogName>Mississippi valley</geogName>
                    as an example of "regional history." In a previous book, <hi rend="i">
                  <geogName>River Towns</geogName> in the Great West</hi> (1990), Mahoney described the
                    transportation and economic structure of the region, and in this latest book he studies the social
                    life based on that structure. His premise is that people lived in a regional, not a local, context.</p>
            <p>Mahoney's study centers on three families: Elihu Washburne, a Yankee from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> who lived in Galena, <placeName>

                    </placeName> who lived in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Dubuque</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
               </placeName>; and Orville Browning, a Kentuckian who
                    settled in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>. All lived in the "near" frontier around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the steamboat era. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, however, gradually became the center of the region during the railroad era of the
                    1850s and 1860s. The region therefore became more northern in economic, political, and cultural
                    orientation.</p>
            <p>The three families embraced a "gentility," or middle-class culture, based upon
                    evangelical Christianity (usually Presbyterianism), capitalism, and republicanism which contrasted
                    with the male subculture of "ruffians" prevalent on the frontier. Such gentility
                    was displayed by residence in a Greek Revival house, support of the Whig party, and social
                    reciprocity with other genteel folk by participation in balls and dinner parties.</p>
            <p>Washburne and Browning were both prominent lawyers. Through their experiences Mahoney studies the
                    "social geography of law" in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, including circuit riding in order to enhance revenue and political connections and the
                    genteel culture of the law library staff at the supreme court sessions in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Lawyers also became adept at railroad law in the 1850s and, using prior extralocal
                    connections, were movers in creating regional railroad companies.</p>
            <p>Mahoney's study rests on meticulous archival research of localities, families, the legal
                    profession, and railroads in his region. It will <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-097-2-054"/> appeal to
                    specialists in the field, but it may not engage the general reader. Also, his concept of region,
                    which is based upon transport and social networks, does not deal with the issue of cultural
                    uniqueness. Was the upper <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> culturally simply a western
                    extension of the antebellum Northeast, just as the greater Midwest is presented in Andrew Cayton and
                    Peter Onuf s, <hi rend="i">The Midwest and the Nation</hi> (1990)? Or did the Midwest possess a
                    regional identity different from the East? This is an important question that Mahoney might have
                    explored more thoroughly.</p>

                    the late 1820s and early 1830s, they settled in areas where land was inexpensive and situated close
                    enough to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> settlements to provide them with a sense of security. Although their migration to the
                    Old Northwest "led to markedly improved opportunities," they still faced
                    "disadvantages associated with their status as free people of color" (p. 47).</p>
            <p>Stephen A. Vincent shows that landownership as a "form of power and control" (p.
                    xvi) was central to the experience of Beech and Roberts residents well before freedmen pressed for
                    "forty acres and a mule" after the Civil War. For the people of Beech and Roberts,
                    landownership not only became a source of material improvement, it also helped create a buffer zone
                    that put African Americans at a distance from hostile whites. Community institutions like churches
                    and schools were symbols of autonomy and success. Built away from racial violence and
                    discrimination, these institutions contributed to an identity that set their members apart from most
                    other African Americans.</p>
            <p>The children and grandchildren of the Beech and Roberts pioneers confronted marginal prospects in the
                    area, especially after the Civil War when changes in the nation's economy increased farm
                    debts. Yet, life in the rural Midwest was better than that offered blacks living in increasing
                    numbers in the region's urban centers before the Great Migration. Those who did emigrate
                    from Beech and <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-097-2-055"/> Roberts settlements benefited from "an
                    upbringing that enhanced their chances of success in the world" (p. 149) and that helped
                    many climb into the urban middle class as teachers and ministers.</p>
            <p>This is an important book for Midwest, Indiana, black, and social history. By presenting the
                    experience of black pioneers in the Midwest, Vincent invites historians to think again about the
                    frontier's impact on democracy, the rural experience of the antebellum northern black
                    population, and the southern planters' insistence during Reconstruction that freedmen
                    needed supervision as farmers. <hi rend="i">Southern Seed, Northern Soil</hi> is especially useful
                    for historians of the Great Migration. The study of black migration patterns from the South has
                    seldom been done so skillfully. The author's effort to link together primary sources such
                    as census manuscript schedules, land deeds, and probate records—to name a
                    few—has proven that this tour de force is very much worth the trouble. Those who study
                    the migration of African Americans from the bottom up in the twentieth century will want to borrow
                    some of his methodology.</p>

                  <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, from its beginnings as a haven for fugitive slaves
                    to its emergence as a labor market for neighboring industries. Like other predominantly black towns
                    that arose in the South and Midwest, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a product of black desires for autonomy and self-determination, as well as white
                    racism and social exclusion. Sundiata Keita Cha-Jua argues that this small village was bypassed by
                    businesses that might have allowed it to develop into a thriving city in its own right. Due to this
                    neglect, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>

            <p>The black community of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName> was founded in 1829 with the arrival of eleven families from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. The town's proximity to the slaveholding South ensured it a steady influx of
                    fugitive slaves but also guaranteed that runaways would be particularly susceptible to capture.
                    Throughout the antebellum period, the rights and opportunities available to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName> African Americans were circumscribed by Black Codes, political disfranchisement, and
                    penury. Though situated in a nominally free state, life in antebellum <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName> was lived along the color line, as reflected in segregated public education, housing
                    arrangements, and occupations. After the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, African
                    Americans came to dominate municipal offices, including mayor. Unfortunately, polit- <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-097-2-056"/> ical power did not bring economic clout to black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Illustratively, though the town, which incorporated in 1873, was surrounded by coal
                    mines, no major industries were founded there. Most adult males had to seek employment in riverine
                    industries, farming, or as common laborers in surrounding white settlements. Social life centered on
                    churches, fraternal organizations, and family networks softened the town's precarious
                    fiscal condition. However, according to Cha-Jua, demographic shifts occasioned by industrializing
                    East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and migratory patterns often destabilized these communal structures.</p>
            <p>The increasing proletarianization of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName> African Americans who found employment in neighboring industries was a help to people
                    who had previously been landless agricultural workers. Nonetheless, racism exposed them to the worst
                    vagaries of industrial capitalism, such as exploitation, or the systematic, racially discriminatory
                    underpayment of black workers. Constantly threatened with annexation, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brooklyn</settlement>
                    </placeName> endured political corruption, racial violence, and further economic decline as it
                    entered the twentieth century. Though it continued to survive as a black enclave, the proliferation
                    of boarding-houses, saloons, and dens of vice testified to its hollow economy and uncertain future.</p>
            <p>Drawing liberally on census records, period newspapers, and other sources, <hi rend="i">America's First Black Town</hi> is well researched, cogently argued, and brings an

            <p>Although the overall death rate dropped with the widespread use of sewer and water filtration systems
                    during the last half of the nineteenth century, infant mortality did not. Concerned public health
                    officials consequently tapped mothers as the frontline soldiers in the battle against dirt and
                    disease. In her engaging and thorough book, <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-097-2-057"/> Lynne Curry tells
                    the story of this national movement to create "modern mothers" and healthier
                    babies by focusing on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Her study of an entire state examines this topic in a way few historians have, for the
                    early twentieth-century infant welfare movement was really two campaigns—one urban, one
                    rural—and two vastly different stories.</p>
            <p>In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> an army of philanthropists, volunteers, physicians, nurses, and public health workers
                    mobilized to lower infant mortality with a host of organizations and activities. Medical
                    dispensaries, visiting nurses, settlement houses, pure milk depots, infant welfare stations, and
                    portable hospitals known as "baby tents" brought health services and advice
                    directly to immigrant mothers. Because the medical profession associated poor health and unsanitary
                    conditions with the foreign born pouring into American cities, they initially ignored urban African
                    Americans and native-born rural residents needing similar services.</p>
            <p>By 1910, in the wake of the public health offensive in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, infant mortality rates had begun a steady decline. The rest of the state was a
                    different story. As late as 1920, only 11 percent of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> farm families enjoyed indoor plumbing and, since farmers commonly located wells only
                    yards from outdoor privies and stables, contaminated drinking water was common. Notorious for its
                    hot, humid summers, swamps, and frequent flooding, downstate <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> continued to host numerous epidemics, such as yellow fever, dysentery, and typhoid,
                    that had long since been eradicated in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Not until World War I, when a higher percentage of draftees from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> farms than from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> were rejected as unfit, did public health officials turn their attention to preventive
                    health among farm families. Agricultural extension services, farm magazines, traveling exhibits, and
                    state and county fairs soon bombarded rural mothers with health tips. Among the most popular events
                    were better baby contests that modeled hygienic behavior by displaying tiny contestants in sanitized
                    nurseries and judges outfitted in surgical garb and emphasized the concerns of the new medical
                    specialty of pediatrics.</p>
            <p>Curry argues that while the movement to lower infant mortality had clearly succeeded by the late
                    1920s, that achievement came without any acknowledgment from government or medicine that mothers
                    were "special agents of modernity" (p. 152). Rather than become the progressive
                    advocates for change that the 1921 Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act had signaled
                    that they might, women instead became preventive-health consumers, purchasing everything from
                    vitamins to disinfectants.</p>
            <p>Curry covers a remarkable range of relevant topics including the Grange, the quality of soil in
                    assorted <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> counties, the machinations of better baby contests, the migration of former slaves to

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, the politics and activities of the U.S. Children's Bureau, and the successes
                    and failures of the federal government's Sheppard-Towner Act. It is little wonder that
                    Curry's book contains <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-097-2-058"/> a few errors. Most notably, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was not "the first municipality in the world" to offer universally
                    pasteurized milk to its citizens (p. 25), although the city might have boasted of that at the time.
                    Rather, the 1908 Evans Pasteurization Ordinance proved an immediate failure, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> did not have pasteurized milk until eight long years had passed and many more babies
                    had died. But a few minor errors do not diminish Curry's vivid portrait. Her readable and
                    informative book will contribute to many a lively discussion in women's studies, medical
                    history, and public health classes.</p>

                    neighborhood in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware County</region>
                    </placeName>—his study is clearly relevant to other states in which rural school
                    consolidation was an issue, including Indiana. Reynolds attends to at least three distinct, if
                    interrelated, subjects. First, he engages in a highly theoretical discussion in which he attempts to
                    distinguish the class identity and class consciousness of farm families from their economic status,
                    narrowly defined. While this discussion will be of interest to theorists, it has a tendency to reify
                    ideal types and to understate the dynamics of change in rural areas.</p>
            <p>Reynolds's second major subject is the Country Life Movement, the reform endeavor early in
                    the twentieth century that sought to revitalize rural society and improve the performance of the
                    agricultural economy. Reynolds's explanation of the Country Life Movement's
                    educational dimension is generally good, if somewhat negative and ungenerous, and his placement of
                    school reform in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> within the larger context of national reform is first-rate. Both nationally and locally
                    school consolidation was considered a necessary step in the improvement of rural education and its
                    elevation to the level of quality supposedly attained by urban schools.</p>
            <p>The heart of the book, and its strongest portion, deals with the progress of consolidation in the
                    Buck Creek neighborhood Reynolds uses as a case study. School consolidation and other reform ideas,
                    such as agricultural improvement, county extension agents, and expanded church activities, were
                    advanced there by Gilbert Chalice, <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-097-2-059"/> an energetic Methodist
                    minister who put Buck Creek on the Country Life reform map. Local Catholics believed that the reform
                    efforts of Chalice and his successors were as much about Methodist cultural domination and
                    aggrandizement as they were about enhanced education, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan locally and
                    its strength within the Buck Creek church indicated their belief was well-grounded. Consolidation
                    was eventually achieved, but only after a bitter struggle and at the price of mutual distrust and
                    neighborhood disintegration.</p>
            <p>This is local history at its best, and Reynolds deserves high praise for his ability to tease an
                    interesting story out of sparse sources. Unfortunately, he is forced at times to make assumptions
                    and draw inferences that are not backed by the available evidence. While these are usually
                    reasonable, so are some alternative interpretations. Reynolds concludes with an epilogue suggesting
                    that school consolidation harmed many rural neighborhoods both socially and economically without
                    improving education.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">There Goes the Neighborhood</hi> is not a well-integrated book—indeed, there
                    are parts of at least three different books here—but it will pay dividends to readers who
                    invest their time in it. Reynolds's case study of Buck Creek, and his efforts to connect
                    the local with the global, are especially commendable.</p>

            <p>Lisa Woolley envisions the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Renaissance as a literary stream divided by gender and race. The better-known branch
                    features names that appear in the standard histories—Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson,
                    Edgar Lee Masters, and Floyd Dell. Although they make only cameo appearances in these pages, these
                    white and male mid-westerners are acknowledged for their creation of an urban vernacular in writing
                    that from the outset was praised for its "virility." The other half of the stream,
                    which is the subject of this study, contains the marginalized women and black novelists, poets,
                    editors, and social reformers. It includes, among others, Jane Addams, Ida B. Wells, Marita Banner,
                    Elia Pettie, Edith Wyatt, Marjorie Allen Seiffert, Alice Corbin, Mary Aldis, <placeName>

                    </placeName> Johnson, Eunice Tietjens, and Florence Kiper Frank.</p>
            <p>Woolley argues that women and minority authors found themselves in a cultural bind. They both
                    emulated and resisted the models established by the major realists and naturalists. The book is most
                    original when exploring this dual influence as a by-product of <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-097-2-060"/>
                    the imperative to write poetry and fiction in what was then called the "American
                    Language." For example when "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s voice … came to be perceived as male" (p. 75), women,
                    who were held to genteel standards of language, had to find indirect narrative strategies to
                    represent the rough lower-class "masculine vernacular" dialect that had become the
                    touchstone of serious writing. Black writers of both sexes struggled with the racist stereotypes
                    implicit in the dialect writing and primitivism that was popularly used to characterize ethnic
                    groups.</p>
            <p>Implicit in Woolley's presentation of these dilemmas is a broader issue in literary history,
                    the struggle to achieve artistic authenticity in the face of marginalizing cultural ideals. She does
                    a splendid job of identifying the voices that challenged these ideals: the oratory of women
                    reformers and the labor movement, the "conversational" manner cultivated by
                    editors like Margaret Anderson <hi rend="i">(Little Review)</hi> and Harriet <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">(Poetry)</hi>, the musical and religious rhetoric in black tradition, the liberation of
                    language by the new journalism, and the idiosyncratic oral poetry of Carl Sandburg and Vachel
                    Lindsay. Woolley's approach is to explore these topics in chapters that mix biography,
                    literary history, and close readings of individual texts.</p>
            <p>Because this is a well-researched book, small omissions are glaring. Can one write about the American
                    Language in the years between 1900 and 1930 without mentioning H. L. Mencken's influential
                    masterwork of the same name or Richard Bridgeman's seminal study of the colloquial style in
                    America? Also, in a study of literary voices in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> (which Woolley intelligently treats as a synecdoche for the Midwest), it is a
                    distraction to have to puzzle out what an extended analysis of E. D. Hirsch's ideas about
                    cultural literacy have to do with, say, the issue of a "<placeName>

                    </placeName> aesthetic" (p. 133). In the end, however, these are minor blemishes in a work
                    that should be praised for discovering new strands in the familiar fabric of the <placeName>

                    of the Midwest are still poorly paid and exposed to hazards similar to those faced by their urban
                    predecessors. Despite both a greater public awareness of the underside of entrepreneurial endeavors
                    and a greater willingness to accept the role of the state as a watchdog, those who daily toil in
                    modern food-processing factories have received few benefits. They are stuck in dead-end jobs, taking
                    major risks with their health. Yet many still believe they are on the ladder of upward mobility. By
                    their standards they may be correct. Many workers are materially better off than their unemployed
                    rural American or Third World counterparts. Yet this may not be the correct measure to judge working
                    standards even in an increasingly conservative Midwest.</p>
            <p>Meatpacking workers, like many blue-collar workers, enjoyed a decent standard of living in the
                    postwar years when unions were strong enough to bargain for their rights. Even in the 1960s when the
                    major corporations moved their operations from cities to rural areas to take advantage of cheaper
                    labor and proximity to supplies, wages, if not conditions, remained good. But in the 1980s when the
                    Super Three, ConAgra, <placeName>

                    Mayer, conditions deteriorated. Falling wages were typical of factory work in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> because of capital flight to cheap labor in the U.S. Southwest, <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, or East Asia. Meatpacking, however, stayed in the Midwest. In this industry there was
                    a substitution of female for male labor. This has been cleverly disguised as conformity to equal
                    opportunity laws, but in reality lower wages have been introduced by reclassifying jobs in an age in
                    which technology has lessened the need for both physical strength and specialized skills.
                    Euro-American males retain the better-paid work in meatpacking, where ethnic divisions like gender
                    divisions allow them to feel physically, socially, and financially superior. In reality, however,
                    the industry has become a site for the ghettoization of a growing rural working class where everyone
                    suffers.</p>

                    Fink has created a record of working-class labor in the 1990s. It is a middle-class perspective,
                    written in retrospect since her shop-floor experience was too painful to relate at the time. It is
                    carefully reconstructed with an awareness of gender and ethnic issues and a respect for
                    working-class mores. As such it is an anthropological rather than an historical record, but it is
                    one that will offset the official narrative of cooperation between state and private enterprise to
                    secure jobs in a rural environment. It is also an antidote to the official testimony of those few
                    factory inspectors that still remain in position after years of deregulation.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture.</hi> By Michael L. Bellesiles. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>: Alfred A. Knopf, 2000. Pp. 444. Appendices, notes, index. $30.00.)</head>
            <p>Many Americans have long assumed that they are heirs to the traditions of colonial and Revolutionary
                    riflemen. They believe that most early American males owned their own weapons and were excellent
                    marksmen because they hunted game and engaged in militia and regular army warfare. In <hi rend="i">Arming America</hi>, Michael L. Bellesiles turns this notion on its head. The idea that
                    American "arms ownership has always been nearly universal" and that
                    "American liberty was won and maintained" by a well-armed citizenry is, Bellesiles
                    states, a national "myth" (pp. 9, 12). This myth has been spread by inaccurate
                    historians and seized upon by the National Rifle Association and other progun activists to support
                    their (purportedly) misguided advocacy of the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.</p>
            <p>Bellesiles has examined "Legal, probate, military, and business records, travel accounts,
                    personal letters, fiction, hunting magazines, legislation, and the guns themselves" (p.
                    14), and concludes that "America's gun culture is an invented tradition"
                    (p. 13). Colonial and early national Americans owned surprisingly few weapons and assigned little
                    importance to them in their daily lives. Gunsmiths were few and far between, and existing weapons
                    were unreliable and in disrepair. Militiamen were either ill-armed or unarmed. Thus, there was no
                    "heavily armed American public" (p. 9) in the colonial and early national periods.
                    America's true "gun culture" emerged after the Civil War, not before it,
                    according to Bellesiles. Only then did both Union and Confederate veterans return home with the
                    hundreds of thousands of weapons their governments (and the industrial revolution) provided them.</p>
            <p>Bellesiles's work evinces the narrative power and methodological weakness of a historian who
                    has settled on his thesis before conducting his research. As his critics have shown, Bellesiles
                    methodically exaggerates and manipulates the evidence. Other specialists counter that records show
                    many more colonial and Revolutionary guns and gunsmiths than Bellesiles has counted and that many,
                    but not all, militia muster records verify abundant or ample arms. Critics conclude that, contrary
                    to Bellesiles's assertion, many early Americans undoubtedly killed game with guns on a
                    daily basis in order to feed themselves. Bellesiles ignores hundreds of accounts written by early
                    European travelers who were surprised and appalled (as their descendants are today) at the extent of
                    American weaponry. Although Bellesiles's sampling of 1,100 wills in government probate
                    courts reveals his hard work and ingenious method, those wills are nevertheless sparse,
                    unrepresentative (only propertied classes filed them), and do not enumerate items such as weapons
                    that were given away or sold by the decedent's family at the time of death. In his list of
                    scholars <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-097-2-063"/> who have supposedly spread the myth that early
                    Americans had lots of guns, Bellesiles pays short shrift to Edmund S. Morgan, author of <hi rend="i">American Slavery, American Freedom</hi> (1975). Bellesiles should think more deeply about how
                    many guns it took to subjugate millions of human beings for two hundred and fifty years.</p>

                    Unfortunately, it has also produced Michael Bellesiles's tale of Americans without weapons.

            <p>The notorious convict-lease system buttressed the repressive racial order of the post-Civil War
                    South. Vital to the construction of the "New South," the lease achieved the
                    multiple purposes of social and economic control of African Americans, tax relief for white property
                    holders, cash revenue for local governments, and cheap labor for industrial capitalists. This was
                    certainly the case in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, where state and county officials rented prisoners to major mining companies. Mary
                    Ellen Curtin's crisply paced and readable work, <hi rend="i">Black Prisoners and Their
                        World</hi>, argues that Alabama had one of the most profitable, and brutal, prison systems in
                    the nation during the late nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Curtin draws on the field of black history to expand scholars' perceptions of those who fell
                    captive to this system of forced labor for profit. Most studies of the subject ignore the agency of
                    black prisoners, emphasizing instead the leasing system's economic functions and the
                    activities of administrators. In contrast, the author draws on correspondence from prisoners and
                    their families to help portray black lives before, during, and after incarceration. This challenges
                    assumptions of absolute white hegemony over black inmates, though it does not make the workings of
                    the lease system any less nightmarish.</p>
            <p>As the author elaborates, most <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> inmates were part of a new generation of former slaves who had believed the promises of
                    Reconstruction-era Republicanism. In many cases, their "crimes" had to do only
                    with exercising their political rights and economic independence. This self-assertive spirit did not
                    die, even after white <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-097-2-064"/> Democrats undercut social advances in the
                    South. As convict laborers, African Americans influenced daily mining operations and administrative
                    policy through strikes, arson, and other forms of resistance. They used prison reforms to gain early
                    release, expose contractors' abuses, and maintain communication with their families.
                    Moreover, through their experiences in the prison mines, they became strongly class conscious. Many
                    black ex-convicts in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> subsequently joined the local Knights of Labor and United Mine Workers, where they
                    helped build a tradition of labor militancy in the region, though they often faced racial
                    discrimination within the movement.</p>
            <p>Curtin discusses the black leadership's opposition to the lease system and the predicaments
                    of men and women caught in the southern legal system. She engages the literature on resistance in
                    contemporary black history, though, inexplicably, she does not draw on work of Robin D. G. Kelley,
                    who brought James C. Scott's "hidden transcripts" thesis to the field.
                    Curtin draws parallels between the convict-lease system of the nineteenth century and the
                    "prison-industrial complex" of today. Both involve the linking of race and
                    criminality and the use of inmates to generate private profit. In light of the legacies of the past,
                    she concludes, current incarceration policies raise the question of "whether a highly
                    disproportionate number of African Americans in prison indicates deep social inequities"
                    (p. 216). Well-researched and -argued, Curtin's work is appropriate for both upper-level
                    undergraduate and graduate-level courses.</p>

            <p>Linda Gordon's book focuses on the placement of forty Irish-Catholic orphans with Mexican
                    copper-mining families in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="azu">Arizona</region>
                    </placeName>. Protestant Anglos in Morcenci-Clifton seized the children and refused to return them
                    to either the Mexican families or the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Foundling Hospital. The episode provides Gordon with an opportunity to explore numerous
                    variables such as whiteness, race, religion, and gender. Anglo women who saw the arrival of the
                    "orphan train" expected the children to be available to them for adoption. When
                    they were not allowed to adopt the children they launched a crusade to take them from the Mexicans.
                    While under other circumstances, Catholic children being given to Catholics would have been seen as
                    appropriate, white Protestants framed the issue not as kidnaping, but rather as saving the children
                    from the "abuse" of Mexican homes, which by their definition were unfit
                    environments for white children. <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-097-2-065"/> Tracing the events to the U.S.
                    Supreme Court case, Gordon explores the dynamics of the border culture by race, class, ethnicity,
                    religion, occupation, and gender. She studies the changing group dynamics following the expulsion of
                    Chinese miners and the strike of 1903 and argues that skilled better-paid Mexicans, who had achieved
                    some acceptance, were redefined as "other" and excluded from whiteness. Whether
                    the strike, the kidnaping, or economic transformation was the key factor is unclear, since other
                    mining towns underwent similar changes.</p>
            <p>Gordon demonstrates that women, whether Foundling Hospital nuns, Anglos, or Mexicans, were not as
                    passive in the public sphere as is sometimes assumed. Mexican women had a role in adopting the
                    orphans, as did Anglo women in the kidnaping and mob activity. Labor, benefit societies, and child
                    welfare policies also constitute elements of Gordon's narrative and analysis.</p>
            <p>Her discussion of whiteness, while not original, as Gordon's extensive footnotes
                    acknowledge, is a fine example of current literature that wrestles with the multifaceted nature of
                    how people define themselves and others. Considering the paucity of documentation, Gordon does a
                    fine job piecing together the Mexicans' role.</p>
            <p>There are problems, many of which could have been eliminated by good editing. Lists of characters,
                    chapters without numbers, and maps that reverse the normal way of showing geographical areas annoy
                    the reader. There are also many typos. Gordon has, at times, an awkward style and an odd vocabulary.
                    But her end notes are helpful and easy to use.</p>
            <p>The book is well worth reading, as she uses the narrative of the orphans' kidnaping to
                    examine the complex issues of definition of self in two mining camps that were changing from the
                    fluidity of the frontier into settled communities.</p>

                    </placeName> was one of the most important events in the Cold War. The events on this peninsula
                    helped to define the nature of international conflict during the long period of the
                    U.S.—Soviet confrontation. Yet, despite this significance, the level of attention

                    "bad" one that followed. A good measure of this historical amnesia is that readers
                    can easily count the number of surveys of the fighting in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> deigned for classroom use with their fingers.</p>
            <p>Stanley Sandier has produced a text that is a contender for the distinction of being the best work in
                    this narrow field. Sandier has the credentials to write this book. He served as a historian for the
                    U.S. Army and has written on a number of military topics, including a large reference work on this
                    conflict. It is no surprise then that Sandier chooses to focus primarily on combat operations.
                    "The course of the Korean War was, hardly surprisingly, more affected by events on the
                    battlefield than by any other factor" (p. i). He contends that both the Americans and the
                    Chinese learned from this experience. "It is a tribute to both armies that they came out of
                    the Korean War as considerably better forces than when they went in" (p. 264). The biggest
                    impact of the fighting, however, was political. "In the long-range view, the Korean War,
                    for all of its destruction, waste and human costs, was not fought in vain. Whatever the failings of
                    the Rhee regime and its immediate successors, South <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> was spared the worst of the Stalinist regimes and eventually emerged with something far
                    better" (p. 270).</p>
            <p>The text starts with a short chapter on <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> up to 1950 that provides one of the most concise yet informative descriptions of the
                    political divisions on the peninsula and the origins of the conflict available in English. The next
                    six chapters account for slightly over a third of the text and take the reader through the first
                    year of the war as communist and United Nations armies march up and down the entire length of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Most surveys on this conflict move to a thematic format after covering the ebb and flow period, and
                    this work is no different. Chapters on the air war, naval engagements, and the truce talks follow
                    those chronicling the first year. Although this approach is standard for the genre, two of these
                    chapters, one on allied involvement in the fighting and another on rear echelon units, draw
                    attention to topics that might easily be overlooked in a chronological format. Sandier clearly shows
                    that other UN members made an appreciable addition to U.S. combat strength. In most cases these
                    contributions were small, but taken together they were significant. Given the focus of this study,
                    the chapter on the home fronts seems out of place, and there is less discussion of logistical issues
                    in the chapter entitled "Behind the Lines" than one might reasonably expect.</p>
            <p>Nice bonus features include a concise chronology of the war, which oddly starts with the formation of
                    the Chosun kingdom circa 2000 B.C., and a topically organized bibliography that gives the reader an
                    introduction to the major works on the field as well as some of the most important scholarship from
                    the post-Cold War era. The lack of detailed maps is a shortcoming, particularly for the chapters on
                    the first year of the war. One final, if minor, note worth mentioning: <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-097-2-067"/> British spelling and punctuation appear throughout the text. This
                    style, coming as it does from American author and publisher, is just plain annoying.</p>

            <p>Until very recently, very few historians have chosen, in the words of Robert Frost, to "take
                    the road less traveled" when studying Richard Nixon by scrutinizing the domestic policies
                    of his administration. Instead, scholars have accepted the interpretation that Nixon's
                    administration revolutionized foreign affairs, was brought down by Watergate, and did little of
                    substance in domestic affairs largely because Nixon himself was uninterested in such trivialities.
                    My own <hi rend="i">The Limits of Power, The Nixon and Ford Administrations</hi> (1992) challenged
                    this assertion; Joan Hoff s <hi rend="i">Nixon Reconsidered</hi> (1994) shattered it. Now,
                    particularly in journal articles, Nixon's domestic policies are receiving the detailed
                    analysis they deserve. In this vein, J. Brooks Flippen's worthy study, <hi rend="i">Nixon
                        and the Environment</hi>, offers the first solid study of a long-neglected aspect of
                    Nixon's tenure.</p>
            <p>To Nixon watchers, Nixon has received grudging (if that) credit for forming the Environmental
                    Protection Agency and little else in the field of environmental policy. Flippen fleshes out the
                    picture in all its interesting detail. He does not stoop to hyperbolic revisionism by painting Nixon
                    as a plaid-shirt wearing forest ranger. Rather, he skillfully weaves Nixon's desire to
                    capture the environmental movement with what was always for Nixon the major goal, political gain.
                    Flippen paints Nixon's environmental policy as largely a reactive one created to parry the
                    thrusts of Edmund Muskie and Henry "Scoop" Jackson, two card-carrying
                    environmentalists who were readying their own challenge for the 1972 Democratic presidential
                    nomination. But Flippen also succeeds in showing how the environmental policy clashed with other
                    goals of the administration and surprisingly often emerged as the victor. The intra-administration
                    battles led by John Whitaker and Russell Train are told by the author with some grace; the story of
                    Walter Hickel, the peripatetic Secretary of the Interior who found himself shut out of the inner
                    circle, is finally told in detail, providing perhaps the greatest contribution of the book for Nixon
                    scholars.</p>
            <p>Flippen's facts and conclusions are well supported. He is conversant not just with the
                    specialty literature, but also with the wideranging <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-097-2-068"/> Nixon
                    bibliography. He has also made strong use of the materials at the Nixon Presidential Materials
                    Project at the National Archives, which have been well-mined for studies on Watergate but are only
                    beginning to be used for domestic policy analyses. Flippen has also widely interviewed the alumni of
                    the Nixon administration and has an eye for the good quote.</p>
            <p>Although the book uses a chronological approach, it would have been more fulfilling to read a chapter
                    on EPA, a chapter on the Clean Air Act, and so on. But let this not deter the reader. This is an
                    important book that sheds light for the first time on an area of policies for which the author
                    argues convincingly that Nixon has received too little credit. It is also a good read.</p>
