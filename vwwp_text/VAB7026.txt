                        Prelude.
                        
                            WHAT a twitter! what a tumult! what a whirr of wheeling
                                wings!
                            Birds of Passage hear the message which the Equinoctial brings.
                        
                        
                            Birds of Passage hear the message and beneath the flying clouds,
                            Mid the falling leaves of autumn, congregate in clamorous crowds.
                        
                        
                            Shall they venture on the voyage? are the nestlings fledged for
                                flight;
                            Fit to face the fluctuant storm?winds and the elemental night?
                        
                        
                        
                            What a twitter! what a tumult! to the wild wind’s marching song
                            Multitudinous Birds of Passage round the cliffs of England
                                throng.
                        
                        
                            And o’er tempest?trodden Ocean, cloud?entangled day and night,
                            Birds on birds, in corporate motion, wing a commonwealth in
                                flight.
                        
                        
                            Waves, like hollow graves beneath them, hoarsely howling, yawn for
                                prey;
                            And the welkin glooms above them shifting formless, grey in grey.
                        
                        
                            And across the Bay of Biscay on undaunted wing they flee,
                            Where mild seas move musically murmuring of the Odyssey;
                        
                        
                        
                            Where the gurgling whirlpools glitter and by soft Circean
                                Straits,
                            Fell Charybdis lies in ambush, and the ravenous Scylla waits;
                        
                        
                            Where a large Homeric laughter lingers in the echoing caves,
                            And in playful exultation Dolphins leap from dimpling waves;
                        
                        
                            Where, above the fair Sicilian, flock?browsed, flower?pranked
                                meadows, looms
                            Ætna—hoariest of Volcanoes—ominously veiled in fumes;
                        
                        
                            Where the seas roll blue and bluer, high and higher arch the
                                skies,
                            And as measureless as ocean new horizons meet the eyes;
                        
                        
                        
                            Where at night the ancient heavens bend above the ancient earth,
                            With the young?eyed Stars enkindled fresh as at their hour of
                                birth;
                        
                        
                            Where old Egypt’s desert, stretching leagues on leagues of level
                                land,
                            Gleams with threads of channelled waters, green with palms on either
                                hand;
                        
                        
                            Where the Fellah strides majestic through the glimmering dourah
                                plain,
                            And in rosy flames flamingoes rise from rustling sugar?cane;—
                        
                        
                            On and on, along old Nilus, seeking still an ampler light,
                            O’er its monumental mountains, Birds of Passage take their
                                flight.
                        
                        
                        
                            Where the sacred Isle of Philæ, twinned within the sacred stream,
                            Floats, like some rapt Opium?eater’s labyrinthine lotos dream,
                        
                        
                            Birds on birds take up their quarters in each creviced capital,
                            In each crack of frieze and cornice, in each cleft of roof and
                                wall.
                        
                        
                            And within those twilight?litten, holy halls of Death and Birth,
                            Even the gaily twittering swallows, even the swallows, hush their
                                breath.
                        
                        
                            And they cast the passing shadows of their palpitating wings
                            O’er the fallen gods of Egypt and the prostrate heads of Kings.
                        
                        
                        
                            Even as shadows Birds of Passage cast upon their onward flight
                            Have men’s generations vanished, waned and vanished into night.
                        
                    
                
            
                
                    Songs of the Orient.
                    
                    
                        Welcome to Egypt.
                        
                            THE Palms stood motionless as Pyramids
                            Against the golden halo of the sky;
                            Interminable crops of wheat and rye
                            Mantled the plain with downy coverlids
                            Of silken green, where little freckled kids
                            Frolicked beneath the staid maternal eye;
                            And babe?led buffaloes plashed trampling by,
                            Sprinkling cool water on their dusty lids.
                        
                        
                            Spake the grave Arab, as his flashing glance
                            Swept the large, luminous verdure’s dewy sheen,
                            Sedately, with a bronze?like countenance:
                            “Nehârak Saîd! Lo, this happy
                                day,
                            My country decks herself in sumptuous green,
                            And smiling welcome, Lady, bids you stay.”
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Sphinx.
                        
                            WANDERER, behold Life’s riddle writ in stone,
                            Fronting Eternity with lidless eyes;
                            Of all that is beneath the changing skies,
                            Immutably abiding and alone.
                            The handiwork of hands unseen, unknown,
                            When Pharaohs of immortal dynasties
                            Built Pyramids to brave the centuries,
                            Cheating Annihilation of her own.
                        
                        
                            The heart grows hushed before it. Nay, methinks
                            That Man, and all on which Man wastes his breath,
                            The World, and all the World inheriteth,
                            With infinite, inexorable links
                            Grappling the soul; that love, hate, birth and death
                            Dwindle to nothingness before thee—Sphinx.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Sphinx?Money.
                        
                            WHERE Pyramids and temple?wrecks are piled
                            Confusedly on camel?coloured sands,
                            And the mute Arab motionlessly stands,
                            Like some swart god who never wept or smiled,—
                            I picked up mummy relics of the wild
                            (And sea?shells once with clutching baby hands),
                            And felt a wafture from old Motherlands,
                            And all the morning wonder of a Child
                        
                        
                            To find Sphinx?money. So the Beduin calls
                            Small fossils of the waste. Nay, poet’s gold;
                            ’Twill give thee entrance to those rites of old,
                            When hundred?gated Thebes, with storied walls,
                            Gleamed o’er her Plain, and vast processions rolled
                            To Amon?Ra through Karnak’s pillared halls.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Tombs of the Kings.
                        
                            WHERE the mummied Kings of Egypt, wrapped in linen fold on
                                fold,
                            Couched for ages in their coffins, crowned with crowns of dusky
                                gold,
                        
                        
                            Lie in subterranean chambers, biding to the day of doom,
                            Counterfeit life’s hollow semblance in each mazy mountain tomb,
                        
                        
                            Grisly in their gilded coffins, mocking masks of skin and bone,
                            Yet remain in change unchanging, balking Nature of her own;
                        
                        
                        
                            Mured in mighty Mausoleums, walled in from the night and day,
                            Lo, the mortal Kings of Egypt hold immortal Death at bay.
                        
                        
                            For—so spake the Kings of Egypt—those colossal ones whose hand
                            Held the peoples from Pitasa to the Kheta’s conquered land;
                        
                        
                            Who, with flash and clash of lances and war?chariots, stormed and
                                won
                            Many a town of stiff?necked Syria to high?towering Askalon:
                        
                        
                            “We have been the faithful stewards of the deathless gods on
                                high;
                            We have built them starry temples underneath the starry sky.
                        
                        
                        
                            “We have smitten rebel nations, as a child is whipped with rods:
                            We the living incarnation of imperishable gods.
                        
                        
                            “Shall we suffer Death to trample us to nothingness? and must
                            We be scattered, as the whirlwind blows about the desert dust?
                        
                        
                            “No! Death shall not dare come near us, nor Corruption shall not

                            Hands upon our sacred bodies, incorruptible as day.
                        
                        
                            “Let us put a bit and bridle, and rein in Time’s headlong course;
                            Let us ride him through the ages as a master rides his horse.
                        
                        
                        
                            “On the changing earth unchanging let us bide till Time shall
                                end,
                            Till, reborn in blest Osiris, mortal with Immortal blend.”
                        
                        
                            Yea, so spake the Kings of Egypt, they whose lightest word was
                                law,
                            At whose nod the far?off nations cowered, stricken dumb with awe.
                        
                        
                            And Fate left the haughty rulers to work out their monstrous
                                doom;
                            And, embalmed with myrrh and ointments, they were carried to the
                                tomb;
                        
                        
                            Through the gate of Bab?el?Molouk, where
                                the sulphur hills lie bare,
                            Where no green thing casts a shadow in the noon’s tremendous
                                glare;
                        
                        
                        
                            Where the unveiled Blue of heaven in its bare intensity
                            Weighs upon the awe?struck spirit with the world’s immensity;
                        
                        
                            Through the Vale of Desolation, where no beast or bird draws
                                breath,
                            To the Coffin?Hills of Tuat—the Metropolis
                                of Death.
                        
                        
                            Down—down—down into the darkness, where, on either hand, dread
                                Fate,
                            In the semblance of a serpent, watches by the dolorous gate;
                        
                        
                            Down—down—down into the darkness, where no gleam of sun or star
                            Sheds its purifying radiance from the living world afar;
                        
                        
                        
                            Where in labyrinthine windings, darkly hidden, down and down,—
                            Proudly on his marble pillow, with old Egypt’s double crown,
                        
                        
                            And his mien of cold commandment, grasping still his staff of
                                state,
                            Rests the mightiest of the Pharaohs, whom the world surnamed the
                                Great.
                        
                        
                            Swathed in fine Sidonian linen, crossed hands folded on the
                                breast,
                            There the mummied Kings of Egypt lie within each painted chest.
                        
                        
                            And upon their dusky foreheads Pleiades of flaming gems,
                            Glowing through the nether darkness, flash from luminous diadems.
                        
                        
                        
                            Where is Memphis? Like a Mirage, melted into empty air:
                            But these royal gems yet sparkle richly on their raven hair.
                        
                        
                            Where is Thebes in all her glory, with her gates of beaten gold?
                            Where Syenê, or that marvel, Heliopolis of old?
                        
                        
                            Where is Edfu? Where Abydos? Where those pillared towns of yore
                            Whose auroral temples glittered by the Nile’s thick?peopled
                                shore?
                        
                        
                            Gone as evanescent cloudlands, Alplike in the afterglow;
                            But these Kings hold fast their bodies of four thousand years
                                ago.
                        
                        
                        
                            Sealed up in their Mausoleums, in the bowels of the hills,
                            There they hide from dissolution and Death’s swiftly grinding
                                mills.
                        
                        
                            Scattering fire, Uræus serpents guard the Tombs’ tremendous gate;
                            
                                While Troth holds the trembling balance, weighs
                                    the heart and seals its fate.
                            
                        
                        
                            And a multitude of mummies in the swaddling clothes of death,
                            Ferried o’er the sullen river, on and on still hasteneth.
                        
                        
                            And around them and above them, blazoned on the rocky walls,
                            Crowned with stars, enlaced by serpents, in divine processionals,
                        
                        
                        
                            Ibis?headed, jackal?featured, vulture?hooded, pass on high,
                            Gods on gods through Time’s perspectives—pilgrims of Eternity.
                        
                        
                            There, revealed by fitful flashes, in a gloom that may be felt,
                            Wild Chimæras flash from darkness, glittering like Orion’s belt.
                        
                        
                            And on high, o’er shining waters, in their barks the gods sail
                                by,
                            In the Sunboat and the Moonboat, rowed
                                across the rose?hued sky.
                        
                        
                            Night, that was before Creation, watches sphinx?like, starred with
                                eyes,
                            And the hours and days are passing, and the years and centuries.
                        
                        
                        
                            But these mummied Kings of Egypt, pictures of a perished race,
                            Lie, of Death forgotten, face by immemorial face.
                        
                        
                            Though the glorious sun above them, burning on the naked plain,
                            Clothes the empty wilderness with the golden, glowing grain;
                        
                        
                            Though the balmy Moon above them, floating in the milky Blue,
                            Fills the empty wildernesses with a silver fall of dew;
                        
                        
                            Though life comes and flies unresting, like the shadow which a
                                dove
                            Casts upon the Sphinx, in passing, for a moment from above;—
                        
                        
                        
                            Still these mummied Kings of Egypt, wrapped in linen, fold on
                                fold,
                            Bide through the ages in their coffins, crowned with crowns of dusky
                                gold.
                        
                        
                            Had the sun once brushed them lightly, or a breath of air, they
                                must
                            Instantaneously have crumbled into evanescent dust.
                        
                        
                            Pale and passive in their prisons, they have conquered, chained to
                                death;
                            And their lineaments look living now as when they last drew
                                breath!
                        
                        
                            Have they conquered? Oh the pity of those Kings within their
                                tombs,
                            Locked in stony isolation in those petrifying glooms!
                        
                        
                        
                            Motionless where all is motion in a rolling Universe,
                            Heaven, by answering their prayer, turned it to a deadly curse.
                        
                        
                            Left them fixed where all is fluid in a world of star?winged
                                skies;
                            Where, in myriad transformations, all things pass and nothing
                                dies;
                        
                        
                            Nothing dies but what is tethered, kept when Time would set it
                                free,
                            To fulfil Thought’s yearning tension upward through Eternity.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Hymn to Horus.
                        
                            HAIL, God revived in glory!
                            The night is over and done;
                            Far mountains wrinkled and hoary,
                            Fair cities great in story,
                            Flash in the rising sun.
                        
                        
                            Behold the Dawn uncloses
                            The shutters of the night;
                            The Waste and her oases
                            Blossoms a rose of roses
                            Beneath thy rose?red light.
                        
                        
                            Hail, golden House of Horus,
                            Lap of heaven’s holiest God!
                            
                            From lotos?banks before us
                            Birds in ecstatic chorus
                            Fly, singing, from the sod.
                        
                        
                            Up, up, into the shining,
                            Translucent morning sky,
                            No longer dull and pining,
                            With drooping plumes declining,
                            The storks and eagles fly.
                        
                        
                            The Nile amid his rushes
                            Reflects thy risen disk;
                            A light of gladness gushes
                            Through kindling halls, and flushes
                            Each flaming Obelisk.
                        
                        
                            Vast Temples catch thy splendour;
                            Vistas of columns shine
                            Celestial, with a tender
                            Rose?bloom on every slender
                            Papyrus?pillared shrine.
                        
                        
                        
                            In manifold disguises,
                            And under many names,
                            Thrice?holy son of Isis,
                            We worship him who rises
                            A child?god fledged in flames.
                        
                        
                            Hail, sacred Hawk, who, winging,
                            Crossest the heavenly sea!
                            With harp?playing, with singing,
                            With linen robes, white clinging,
                            We come, fair God, to thee.
                        
                        
                            Thou whom our soul espouses,
                            When weary of the way,
                            Enter our golden houses,
                            And, with thy mystic spouses,
                            Rest from the long, long way.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Nuit.
                        
                            THE all upholding,
                            The all enfolding, 
                            The all beholding,
                            Most secret Night;
                            From whose abysses,
                            With wordless blisses,
                            The Sun’s first kisses,
                            Called gods to light.
                        
                        
                            One god undying,
                            But multiplying,
                            Restlessly trying,
                            Doing: undone.
                            
                            Through myriad changes,
                            He sweeps and ranges;
                            But life estranges
                            Many in one.
                        
                        
                            In wild commotion,
                            Out of the ocean,
                            With moan and motion,
                            Wave upon waves,
                            Mingling in thunder,
                            Rise and go under:
                            Break, life, asunder;
                            Night has her graves.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Egyptian Theosophy.
                        
                            FAR in the introspective East
                            A meditative Memphian Priest
                        
                        
                            Would solve—such is the Sage’s curse—
                            The riddle of the Universe.
                        
                        
                            Thought, turning round itself, revolved,
                            How was this puzzling World evolved?
                        
                        
                            How came the starry sky to be,
                            The sun, the earth, the Nile, the sea?
                        
                        
                            And Man, most tragi?comic Man,
                            Whence came he here, and where began?
                        
                        
                        
                            Communing with the baffling sky,
                            Who twinkled, but made no reply,
                        
                        
                            He brooded, till his heated brain
                            Grew fairly addled with the strain.
                        
                        
                            For in that dim, benighted age
                            Philosopher and hoary sage
                        
                        
                            Had not yet had the saving grace
                            To teach the Schools that Time and Space,
                        
                        
                            And all the marvels they contain,
                            Are but the phantoms of the brain.
                        
                        
                            But that profound Egyptian Seer
                            Maybe—who knows?—came pretty near;
                        
                        
                            When, after days of strenuous fast,
                            He hit the startling truth at last;
                        
                        
                        
                            And on select, mysterious nights,
                            Veiled in occult, symbolic rites:
                        
                        
                            He taught—that once upon a time—
                            To disbelieve it were a crime—
                        
                        
                            The World’s great egg—refute who can,
                            That meditates on Life and Man—
                        
                        
                            While deafening cacklings spread the news—
                            Was laid by an Almighty Goose.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                            The sunset melts upon the Nile,
                            The stony desert glows,
                            Beneath heaven’s universal smile,
                            One burning damask rose;
                            And like a Peri’s pearly boat,
                            No longer than a span,
                            Look, faint on fiery sky afloat,
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                            Our boat drifts idly with the Stream,
                            Our boatmen ship the oar;
                            Vistas of endless temples gleam
                            On either topaz shore;
                            
                            And swimming over groves of Palm,
                            A crescent weak and wan,
                            There steals into the perfect calm
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                            All nature seems to bask in peace
                            And hush her lowest sigh;
                            Above the river’s golden fleece
                            The happy Halcyons fly.
                            And lost in some old lotos dream,
                            The pensive Pelican
                            Sees mirrored in the mazy stream
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                            Black outlined on the golden air
                            A turbaned Silhouette,
                            The Mueddin invites to prayer
                            From many a Minaret.
                            Our dusky boatmen hear the call,
                            And prostrate, man on man,
                            
                            They bow, adoring, one and all,
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                            Where Luxor’s rose?flushed columns shine
                            Above the river’s brim,
                            The priests with incense once, and wine,
                            Made sacrifice to Him,
                            The highest god of Thebes, and head
                            Of all the heavenly clan;
                            But now the Moslem hails instead
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                            The gods have come, the gods have gone,
                            Yet wedded to their walls,
                            Winged with the serpent of the Sun
                            In mute processionals,
                            They stride from door to massy door,
                            Bound nations in their van,
                            Though Amon’s Sun has waned before
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                        
                            Yea, even proud Egypt’s proudest king,
                            Who chastised rebel lands,
                            
                                And brought his gods for offering
                            
                            
                                Mountains of severed hands;
                            
                            Who singly, like a god of War,
                            Smote hosts that swerved and ran,
                            Lies low ’neath Allah’s scimetar—
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                            And Isis, Queen, whose sacred disk’s
                            Horned splendour crowned her brow,
                            While fires of flashing Obelisks
                            Flamed in the Afterglow;
                            And white?robed priests who served her shrine
                            Have turned Mahommedan,
                            And worship Him who wears for sign
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                            The rosy lotos, flower and leaf,
                            Which wreathed each sacred lake,
                            
                            With Nature’s loveliest bas?relief,
                            Has followed in their wake;
                            Yea, with the last true Pharaoh’s death,
                            The lotos leaves, grown wan,
                            Have changed to lily white beneath
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                            The gods may come, the gods may go,
                            And royal realms change hands;
                            But the most ancient Nile will flow,
                            And flood the desert sands;
                            And nightly will he glass the stars’
                            Unearthly caravan,
                            Nor care if it be Rome’s red Mars
                            Or Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                        
                            The sunset fades upon the Nile;
                            The desert’s stony gloom,
                            Receding blankly mile on mile,
                            Grows silent as a tomb.
                            
                            All weary wanderers, man and beast,
                            Hie, fasting, to the Khan,
                            While shines above their nightly feast
                            The Moon of Ramadân.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Beautiful Beeshareen Boy.
                        
                            BEAUTIFUL, black?eyed boy,
                            O lithe?limbed Beeshareen!
                            Face that finds no maid coy,
                            Page for some peerless queen:
                            Some Orient queen of old,
                            Sumptuous in woven gold,
                            Close?clinging fold on fold,
                            Lightning, with gems between.
                        
                        
                            Bred in the desert, where
                            Only to breathe and be
                            Alive in living air
                            Is finest ecstasy;
                            
                            Where just to ride or rove,
                            With sun or stars above,
                            Intoxicates like love,
                            When love shall come to thee.
                        
                        
                            Thy lovely limbs are bare;
                            Only a rag, in haste,
                            Draped with a princely air,
                            Girdles they slender waist.
                            And gaudy beads and charms,
                            Dangling from neck and arms,
                            Ward off dread spells and harms
                            Of Efreets of the waste.
                        
                        
                            Caressed of wind and sun,
                            Across the white?walled town
                            Fawnlike we saw thee run,
                            Light Love in Mocha brown!
                            
                            Wild Cupid, without wings,
                            Twanging thy viol strings;
                            With crocodiles and rings
                            Bartered for half a crown.
                        
                        
                            Spoilt darling of our bark,
                            Smiling with teeth as white
                            As when across the dark
                            There breaks a flash of light.
                            And what a careless grace
                            Showed in thy gait and pace;
                            Eyes starlike in a face
                            Sweet as a Nubian night!
                        
                        
                            Better than Felt or Fez,
                            High on thy forehead set,
                            Countless in lock and tress,
                            Waved a wild mane of jet.
                            
                            Kings well might envy thee
                            What courts but rarely see,
                            Curls of rich ebony
                            Coiled in a coronet.
                        
                        
                            Lo—in dim days long since—
                            The strolling Almehs tell,
                            Thou shouldst have been a prince,
                            Boy of the ebon fell!
                            If truth the poet sings,
                            Thy tribe, oh Beduin, springs
                            From those lost tribes of Kings,
                            Once Kings in Israel.
                        
                        
                            Ah me! the camp?fires gleam
                            Out yonder, where the sands
                            Fade like a lotos dream
                            In hollow twilight lands.
                            
                            Our sail swells to the blast,
                            Our boat speeds far and fast,
                            Farewell! And to the last
                            Smile, waving friendly hands.
                        
                        
                            * * * * * *
                            From England’s storm?girt isle,
                            O’er seas where seagulls wail,
                            Rocked on the rippling Nile,
                            We drift with drooping sail.
                            On waters hushed at night,
                            Where stars of Egypt write
                            In hieroglyphs of light
                            Their undeciphered tale.
                        
                        
                            Forlorn sits Assouan;
                            Where is her boy, her pride?—
                            Now in the lamplit Khan,
                            Now by the riverside,
                            
                            Or where the Soudanese,
                            Under mimosa trees,
                            Chaunt mournful melodies,
                            We’ve sought him far and wide.
                        
                        
                            Oh, desert?nurtured Child,
                            How dared they carry thee,
                            Far from thy native Wild,
                            Across the Western Sea?
                            Packed off, poor boy, at last,
                            With many a plaster cast
                            Of plinth and pillar vast,
                            And waxen mummies piled!
                        
                        
                            Ah! just like other ware,
                            For a lump sum or so
                            Shipped to the World’s great Fair—
                            To big Chicago Show!
                            
                            With mythic beasts and things,
                            Beetles and bulls with wings,
                            And imitation Sphinx,
                            Ranged row on curious row!
                        
                        
                            Beautiful, black?eyed boy;
                            Ah me! how strange it is
                            That thou, the desert’s joy,
                            Whom heavenly winds would kiss,
                            With Ching and Chang?hwa ware,
                            Blue pots and bronzes rare,
                            Shouldst now be over there
                            Shown at Porkopolis.
                        
                        
                            Gone like a lovely dream,
                            Child of the starry smile;
                            Gone from the glowing stream
                            Glassing its greenest isle!
                            
                            We’ve sought, but sought in vain;
                            Thou wilt not come again,
                            Never for bliss or pain,
                            Home to thy orphaned Nile.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Dying Dragoman.
                        
                            FAR in the fiery wilderness,
                            Beyond the town of Assouan,
                            Left languishing in sore distress,
                            There lay a dying Dragoman.
                            Alone amid the waste, alone,
                            The hot sand burnt him to the bone;
                            And on his breast, like heated stone,
                            The burden of the air did press.
                        
                        
                            His head was pillowed on a tomb,
                            Reared to some holy Sheik of old;
                            The irresistible Simoom
                            Whirled drifts of sand that rose and rolled
                            
                            Around him, and the panting air
                            Was one sulphureous spectral glare,
                            Shot with such gleams as lights the lair
                            Of tigers in a jungle’s gloom.
                        
                        
                            Groaning, he closed his bloodshot eyes,
                            As if to shut out all he feared;
                            And greedily a swarm of flies
                            Fell on his face and tangled beard.
                            He lay like one who ne’er would lift
                            His head above that ashy drift;
                            When lo, there gleamed across a rift
                            The blue oasis of the skies.
                        
                        
                            Like smoke dispersing far and wide,
                            The draggled sands were blown away;
                            The wild clouds in a refluent tide
                            Receded from the face of day.
                            
                            The lingering airs yet lightly blew
                            Till the last speck cleared out of view,
                            And left the hushed Eternal Blue,
                            And nothing else beside.
                        
                        
                            Then once again, with change of moods,
                            A mighty shadow, broadening, fell
                            Across those shadeless solitudes,
                            Without a Palm, without a Well.
                            Wing wedged in wing, an ordered mass
                            Unnumbered numbers pass and pass,
                            As if one Will, one only, was
                            In all those moving multitudes.
                        
                        
                            A chord thrilled in the sick man’s brain;
                            He raised his heavy?lidded eyes,
                            He raised his heavy head with pain,
                            And caught a glimpse of netted skies,
                            
                            Meshed in ten thousand wings in flight
                            That cleft the air. Oh wondrous sight!
                            He gasped, he shrieked in sheer delight:
                            “The Storks! The Storks fly home again!
                        
                        
                            “I too, O Storks, I too, even I,
                            Would see my native land again.
                            Oh, had I wings that I might fly
                            With you, wild birds, across the main!
                            Take, take me to the land, I pray,
                            The land where nests are full in May,
                            The land where my young children play:
                            Oh, take me with you, or I die.
                        
                        
                            “My lonely heart blooms like a flower,
                            My children, when I think of you,
                            My love is like an April shower,
                            And fills my heart with drops of dew.
                            
                            Along their unknown tracks, ah me!
                            The Storks will fly across the sea;
                            My children soon will hail with glee
                            Their red bills on the rain?washed tower.”
                        
                        
                            Home?sickness seized him for the herds
                            That browse upon the fresh green leas;
                            Home?sickness for the cuckoo birds
                            That shout afar in feathery trees;
                            For running stream and rippling rill
                            That, racing, turning his woodland mill:
                            And tears on tears began to fill
                            His eyes, confusing all he sees.
                        
                        
                            Again he doats on rosy cheeks
                            Of children rolling in the grass;
                            Again the busy days and weeks,
                            The months and years serenely pass.
                            
                            Black forest clocks tick day and night,
                            His board and bed are snowy white,
                            His humble house is just as bright
                            As if it were a house of glass.
                        
                        
                            Again, beneath the high?peaked roof,
                            His wife’s unresting shuttle flies
                            Across the even warp and woof;
                            Again his thrifty mother plies
                            Her wheel, that hums like noontide bees;
                            And lint?locked babes about her knees
                            Hark to strange tales of talking trees,
                            And Storks deep versed in sage replies.
                        
                        
                            Again the ring of swinging chimes
                            Calls all the pious folk to church,
                            With shining Sunday face, betimes,
                            Through rustling woods of beech and birch
                            
                            Full of moist glimmering hollows where
                            The pines bow murmuring as in prayer,
                            And musically through the air
                            The forest’s mighty Choral swells.
                        
                        
                            Again, O Lord, again he sees
                            The place where Heaven came down one day;
                            Where, in a space of bloom and bees,
                            He won his wife one morn of May.
                            Warm pulses shook and thrilled his blood,
                            Wild birds were singing in the wood,
                            The flowering world in bridal mood
                            Joined in the Pinewood’s symphonies.
                        
                        
                            Again, O Lord, in grief and fear,
                            He bids good?bye to all he loves;
                            The waters swell, the woods are sere,
                            The Storks are gone, and hushed the doves.
                            
                            He goes with them; he goes to heal
                            The sickness whose insidious seal
                            Is set on him. Ah, tears will steal
                            And blur the Storks that disappear.
                        
                        
                            A furnace fire behind the hill,
                            The sun has burnt itself away;
                            The ghost of light, transparent, chill,
                            Yet floats upon the edge of day.
                            And all the desert holds its breath
                            As if it felt and crouched beneath
                            The filmy, flying bat of death
                            About a heart for ever still.
                        
                        
                            And one by one, seraphic, bland,
                            The bright stars open in the skies;
                            The large above the Shadow land
                            The white?faced moon begins to rise.
                            
                            And all the wilderness grows wan
                            Beneath the stars, that one by one
                            Look down upon the lifeless man
                            As if they were his children’s eyes.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A Fantasy.
                        
                            I was an Arab,
                            I loved my horse;
                            Swift as an arrow
                            He swept the course.
                        
                        
                            Sweet as a lamb
                            He came to hand;
                            He was the flower
                            Of all the land.
                        
                        
                            Through lonely nights
                            I rode afar;
                            God lit His lights—
                            Star upon star.
                        
                        
                        
                            God’s in the desert;
                            His breath the air:
                            Beautiful desert,
                            Boundless and bare!
                        
                        
                            Free as the wild wind,
                            Light as a foal;
                            Ah, there is room there
                            To stretch one’s soul.
                        
                        
                            Far reached my thought,
                            Scant were my needs:
                            A few bananas
                            And lotus seeds.
                        
                        
                            Sparkling as water
                            Cool in the shade,
                            Ibrahim’s daughter,
                            Beautiful maid.
                        
                        
                        
                            Out of thy Kulleh,
                            Fairest and first,
                            Give me to drink
                            Quencher of thirst.
                        
                        
                            I am athirst, girl;
                            Parched with desire,
                            Love in my bosom
                            Burns as a fire.
                        
                        
                            Green thy oasis,
                            Waving with Palms;
                            Oh, be no niggard,
                            Maid, with thy alms.
                        
                        
                            Kiss me with kisses,
                            Buds of thy mouth,
                            Sweeter than Cassia
                            Fresh from the South.
                        
                        
                        
                            Bind me with tresses,
                            Clasp with a curl;
                            And in caresses
                            Stifle me, girl.
                        
                        
                            I was an Arab
                            Ages ago!
                            Hence this home?sickness
                            And all my woe.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Desert.
                        
                            UNCIRCUMSCRIBED, unmeasured, vast,
                            Eternal as the Sea;
                            What lacks the tidal sea thou hast—
                            Profound stability.
                        
                        
                            Beneath the sun that burns and brands
                            In hushed Noon’s halting breath,
                            Calm as the Sphinx upon thy sands
                            Thou art—nay, calm as death.
                        
                        
                            The desert foxes hide in holes,
                            The jackal seeks his lair;
                            The sombre rocks, like reddening coals,
                            Glow lurid in the glare.
                        
                        
                        
                            Only some vulture far away,
                            Bald?headed, harpy?eyed,
                            Flaps down on lazy wing to prey
                            On what has lately died.
                        
                        
                            No palm tree lifts a lonely shade,
                            No dove is on the wing;
                            It seems a land which Nature made
                            Without a living thing,
                        
                        
                            Or wreckage of some older world,
                            Ere children grew, or flowers,
                            When rocks and hissing stones were hurled
                            In hot, volcanic showers.
                        
                        
                            The solemn Blue bends over all;
                            Far as winged thought may flee
                            Roll ridges of black mountain wall,
                            And flat sands like the sea.
                        
                        
                        
                            No trace of footsteps to be seen,
                            No tent, no smoking roof;
                            Nay, even the vagrant Beeshareen
                            Keeps warily aloof.
                        
                        
                            But yon, mid tumbled hillocks prone,
                            Some human form I scan—
                            
                                A human form, indeed, but stone:
                            
                            
                                A cold, colossal Man!
                            
                        
                        
                            How came he here mid piling sands,
                            Like some huge cliff enisled,
                            Osiris?wise, with folded hands,
                            Mute spirit of the Wild?
                        
                        
                            Ages ago the hands that hewed,
                            And in the living rock
                            Carved this Colossus, granite?thewed
                            And curled each crispy lock:
                        
                        
                        
                            Ages ago have dropped to rest
                            And left him passive, prone,
                            Forgotten on earth’s barren breast,
                            Half statue and half stone.
                        
                        
                            And Persia ruled and Palestine;
                            And o’er her violet seas
                            Arose, with marble gods divine,
                            The grace of god?like Greece.
                        
                        
                            And Rome, the Mistress of the World,
                            Amid her diadem
                            Of Eastern Empires set impearled
                            The Scarab’s mystic gem.
                        
                        
                            Perchance he has been lying here
                            Since first the world began,
                            Poor Titan of some earlier sphere
                            Of prehistoric Man!
                        
                        
                        
                            To whom we are as idle flies,
                            That fuss and buzz their day;
                            While still immutable he lies,
                            As long ago he lay.
                        
                        
                            Empurpled in the Afterglow,
                            Thou, with the Sun alone,
                            Of all the stormy waste below,
                            Art King, but king of stone!
                        
                        
                            Uncircumscribed, unmeasured, vast,
                            Eternal as the Sea,
                            The present here becomes the past,
                            For all futurity.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Scarabæus Sisyphus.
                        
                            I’VE watched thee, Scarab! Yea, an hour in vain
                            I’ve watched thee, slowly toiling up the hill,
                            Pushing thy lump of mud before thee still
                            With patience infinite and stubborn strain.
                            Strive as thou mayst, spare neither time nor pain,
                            To screen thy burden from all chance of ill;
                            Push, push, with all a beetle’s force of will,
                            Thy ball, alas! rolls ever down again.
                        
                        
                            Toil without end! And why? That after thee
                            Dim hosts of groping Scarabs too shall climb
                            This self?same height? Accursèd progeny
                            Of Sisyphus, what antenatal crime
                            Has doomed us too to roll incessantly
                            Life’s Stone, recoiling from the Alps of time?
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Colossi of the Plain.
                        
                            ANCIENT of Days! Before the Trojan Wars
                            You towered as now in your colossal prime,
                            Watching the rosy footed morning climb
                            O’er far Arabia’s flushing mountain bars.
                            Despite your weird disfigurement and scars
                            You dwarf all other monuments. Sublime
                            Survivors of old Thebes! you baffle Time,
                            And sit in silent conclave with the Stars.
                        
                        
                            Ah, once below you through the glittering plain
                            Stretched avenues of Sphinxes to the Nile;
                            And, flanked with towers, each consecrated fane
                            Enshrined its god. The broken gods lie prone
                            In roofless halls, their hallowed terrors gone,
                            Helpless beneath Heaven’s penetrating smile.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Mourning Women.
                        
                            ALL veiled in black, with faces hid from sight,
                            Crouching together in the jolting cart,
                            What forms are these that pass alone, apart,
                            In abject apathy to life’s delight?
                            The motley crowd, fantastically bright,
                            Shifts gorgeous through each dazzling street and
                                mart;
                            Only these sisters of the suffering heart
                            Strike discords in this symphony of light.
                        
                        
                            Most wretched women! whom your prophet dooms
                            To take love’s penalties without its prize!
                            Yes; you shall bear the unborn in your wombs,
                            And water dusty death with streaming eyes,
                            And, wailing, beat your breasts among the tombs;
                            But souls ye have none fit for Paradise.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Sâkiyeh.
                        
                            “HOW long shall Man be Nature’s fool?” Man cries;
                            “Be like those great, gaunt oxen, drilled and bound,
                            Inexorably driven round and round
                            To turn the water?wheel with bandaged eyes?
                            And as they trudge beneath Egyptian skies,
                            Watering the wrinkled desert’s beggared ground,
                            The hoarse Sâkiyeh’s lamentable sound
                            Fills all the land as with a people’s sighs?”
                        
                        
                            Poor Brutes! Who in unconsciousness sublime,
                            Replenishing the ever?empty jars,
                            Endow the waste with palms and harvest gold:
                            And men, who move in rhythm with moving stars,
                            Should shrink to give the borrowed lives they hold:
                            Bound blindfold to the groaning wheel of Time.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Internal Firesides.
                        
                            BEWILDERINGLY, from wildly shaken cloud,
                            Invisible hands, deft moving everywhere,
                            Have woven a winding sheet of velvet air,
                            And laid the dead earth in her downy shroud.
                            And more and more, in white confusion, crowd
                            Wan, whirling flakes, while o’er the icy glare
                            Blue heaven that was glooms blackening o’er the bare
                            Tree skeletons, to ruthless tempest bowed.
                        
                        
                            Nay, let the outer world be winter?locked;
                            Beside the hearth of glowing memories
                            I warm my life. Once more our boat is rocked,
                            As on a cradle by the palm?fringed Nile;
                            And, sharp?cut silhouettes, in single file,
                            Lank camels lounge against transparent skies.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        On Reading the “Rubáiyát” of Omar Khayyám
                        In a Kentish Rose Garden.
                        
                            BESIDE a Dial in the leafy close,
                            Where every bush was burning with the Rose,
                            With million roses falling flake by flake
                            Upon the lawn in fading summer snows:
                        
                        
                            I read the Persian Poet’s rhyme of old,
                            Each thought a ruby in a ring of gold—
                            Old thoughts so young, that, after all these years,
                            They’re writ on every rose?leaf yet unrolled.
                        
                        
                            You may not know the secret tongue aright
                            The Sunbeams on their rosy tablets write;
                            Only a poet may perchance translate
                            Those ruby?tinted hieroglyphs of light.
                        
                    
                
            
                
                    
                    Songs of the Occident.
                    
                    
                        Roman Anemones.
                        
                            THE maiden meadows softly blush
                            Beneath the enamoured breeze,
                            And break into one purple flush
                            Of frail anemones.
                        
                        
                            Violet and rose and vermeil white,
                            Woven of sun and showers,
                            They seem to be embodied light
                            Transfigured into flowers.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Ave Maria in Rome.
                        
                            FAR away dim violet mountains
                            Fade away from sight;
                            Flashing from fantastic fountains,
                            Jets the liquid light,
                            Where from Nymph’s or Triton’s lip
                            Bubbling waters drip and drip,
                            Bubbling day and night.
                        
                        
                            Pealed from tower to answering tower,
                            O’er the city swells,
                            Ringing in the hallowed hour,
                            Rhythm of bells on bells;
                            And on wings of Choral Song,
                            Confluent hearts to Mary throng,
                            From low, cloistered cells.
                        
                        
                        
                            On the golden ground of even,
                            Like a half?way home,
                            On the pilgrim to heaven
                            Floats St. Peter’s Dome;
                            High, high, in the air alone,
                            Man’s dread Thought transformed to stone,
                            Pinnacled o’er Rome.

                            WHERE, countless as the stars of night,
                            The daisies made a milky way
                            Across fresh lawns, and flecked with light,
                            Old Ilex groves walled round with bay,—
                        
                        
                            I saw thee stoop, oh lady sweet,
                            And with those pale, frail hands of thine
                            Gather the spring flowers at our feet,
                            Fair as some late?born Proserpine.
                        
                        
                            Yea, gathering flowers, thou might’st have been
                            That goddess of the ethereal brow,
                            Revisiting this radiant scene
                            From realm of dolorous shades below.
                        
                        
                        
                            Thou might’st have been that Queen of Sighs,
                            Love?bound by Hades’ dreadful spell;
                            For veiled within thy heaven?blue eyes,
                            There lay the Memory of Hell.

                            I LET my soul drift with the thistledown
                            Afloat upon the honeymooning breeze;
                            My thoughts about the swelling buds are blown,
                            Blown with the golden dust of flowering trees.
                        
                        
                            On fleeting gusts of desultory song,
                            I let my soul drift out into the Spring;
                            The Psyche flies and palpitates among
                            The palpitating creatures on the wing.
                        
                        
                            Go, happy Soul! run fluid in the wave,
                            Vibrate in light, escape thy natal curse;
                            Go forth no longer as my body?slave,
                            But as the heir of all the Universe.

                            Purple anemones
                            In garden closes!
                            Lost in the limpid sky,
                            Shrills a gay lark on high;
                            Lost in the covert’s hush,
                            Gurgles a wooing thrush.
                        
                        
                            Look, where the ivy weaves,
                            Closely embracing,
                            Tendrils of clinging leaves
                            Round him enlacing,

                            Clothing the marble of
                            This poor, dismembered love.
                        
                        
                            Gone are the hands whose skill
                            Aimed the light arrow,
                            Strong once to cure or kill,
                            Pierce to the marrow;
                            Gone are the lips whose kiss
                            Held hives of honeyed bliss;
                            Gone too the little feet,
                            Overfond, overfleet.
                        
                        
                            O helpless god of old,
                            Maimed mid the tender
                            Blossoming white and gold
                            Of April splendour!
                            
                            Shall we not make thy grave
                            Where the long grasses wave;
                            Hide thee, O headless god,
                            Deep in the daisied sod?
                        
                        
                            Here thou mayst rest at last
                            After life’s fever;
                            After love’s fret is past
                            Rest thee for ever.
                            Nay, broken God of Love,
                            Still must thou bide above
                            While, left for woe or weal,
                            Thou has a heart to feel.

                            Her immemorial mirror fills
                            With light, as of a Virgin’s eyes
                            When, love a?tremble in their blue,
                            They glow twin violets dipped in dew.
                        
                        
                            Mild as a metaphor of Sleep,

                            Beholds her image in the deep:
                            As if a?gaze she beams above
                            Lake Nemi’s magic glass of love.
                        
                        
                        
                            White rose, white lily of the vale,
                            Perfume the even breath of night;
                            In many a burst of sweet delight
                            The love throb of the nightingale
                            Swells through lush flowering woods and fills
                            The circle of the listening hills.

                            The nightingale for her fair sake
                            With hopeless love’s impassioned cries
                            Seems fain to sing till song must kill
                            Himself with one tumultuous trill.
                        
                        
                            And all the songs and all the scents,
                            The light of glowworms and the fires
                            Of fire?flies in the cypress spires;

                            Of pine and ilex as the breeze
                            Sweeps out their mystic harmonies;—

                            To that white orb of maiden fire
                            Who fills the moth with mad desire
                            To die enamoured in her ray,
                            And turns each dewdrop in the grass
                            Into a fairy looking?glass.

                            Far, far above life’s narrow pale,
                            O Unattainable! O Love!
                            Even as the nightingale we cry
                            For some Ideal set on high.
                        
                        
                            Haunting the deep reflective mind,

                            Glassed like the Moon within her mere,
                            Who at a puff of alien wind
                            Melts in innumerable rings,
                            Elusive in the flux of things.

                            GLORIOUS, in saffron robes and veil unfurled,
                            Borne on the wind of her ecstatic flight,
                            Aurora floats before the Lord of Light,
                            And showers her roses on a jubilant world.
                            Lo, where he beams, ambrosial, yellow curled,
                            The God of Day, with unapparent might,
                            Checking his fiery steeds, that plunge and bite
                            As if from heaven his Chariot should be hurled.
                        
                        
                            And on the Clouds a many?tinted band
                            Of Hours dance round their Leader, grave or gay
                            As glowing near or in his wake they sway;
                            While poised above the sun?awakened land
                            The Morning Star, fair herald of the day,
                            Hovers, a Cupid, back?blown torch in hand.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Spring in the Alps.
                        
                            THE flowers are at their Bacchanals
                            Among the lusty green;
                            Wild Orchis and Narcissus waltz
                            With Marguerite for queen.
                            Birds join in glees and madrigals
                            To little loves unseen;
                            And unimprisoned Waterfalls
                            Flash laughing in between.
                        
                        
                            The Sunlight, leaping from the Heights,
                            Flames o’er the fields of May,
                            Winged with unnumbered swallow?flights
                            Fresh from the long sea way;
                            
                            And butterflies and insect mites,
                            Born with the new?blown day,
                            Cross fires in shifting opal lights
                            From spray to beckoning spray.
                        
                        
                            The dandelion puffs her balls,
                            Free spinsters of the air,
                            Who scorn to wait for beetle calls
                            Or bees to find them fair;
                            But breaking through the painted walls
                            Their sisters tamely bear,
                            Fly off in dancing down, which falls
                            And sprouts up everywhere.
                        
                        
                            And far above Earth’s flower?filled lap
                            And rosy revelry,
                            The mountain mothers feed her sap
                            From herded clouds on high—
                            
                            Each pinnacle and frozen pap
                            Whose life has long gone by,
                            A bridge which spans the mighty gap
                            Between the earth and sky.
                            
                                St. Gotthardt.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Agnostic.
                        
                            NOT in the hour of peril, thronged with foes,
                            Panting to set their heel upon my head,—
                            Or when alone from many wounds I bled
                            Unflinching beneath Fortune’s random blows;
                            Not when my shuddering hands were doomed to close
                            The unshrinking eyelids of the stony dead;—
                            Not then I missed my God, not then—but said:
                            “Let me not burden God with all man’s woes!”
                        
                        
                            But when resurgent from the womb of night
                            Spring’s Oriflamme of flowers waves from the Sod;
                            When peak on flashing Alpine peak is trod
                            
                            By sunbeams on their missionary flight;
                            When heaven?kissed Earth laughs, garmented in light;—
                            That is the hour in which I miss my God.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A Bridal in the Bois de Boulogne.
                        
                            HOW the lilacs, the lilacs are glowing and blowing!
                            And white through the delicate verdure of May
                            The blossoming boughs of the hawthorn are showing,
                            Like beautiful brides in their bridal array;
                            With cobwebs for laces, and dewdrops for pearls,
                            Fine as a queen’s dowry for workaday girls.
                        
                        
                            In an aisle of Acacias enlaced and enlacing,
                            Where the silvery sunlight tunnels the shade,
                            Where snowflakes of butterflies airily chasing
                            Each other in trios flash down the arcade:
                            
                            Arrayed in white muslin the wedded bride
                            Looks fresh as a daisy, the groom by her side.
                        
                        
                            The guests flitted round her with light?hearted laughter;
                            They hunted the slipper, they kissed the ring;
                            Of days gone before and of days coming after
                            They thought of no more than the bird on the wing.
                            Were the loves and the laughter and lilacs of May,
                            With the sunshine above, not enough for the day?
                        
                        
                            And the lilacs, the lilacs are blowing and glowing!
                            They pluck them by handfuls and pile them in a mass;
                            And the sap of the Springtide is rising and flowing
                            Through the veins of the greenwood, the blades of the
                                grass;
                            Up, up to the last leaf a dance on the tree,
                            It leaps like a fountain abundant and free.
                        
                        
                        
                            The blackbirds are building their nests in the bushes,
                            And whistle at work, as the workpeople do;
                            The trees swing their censers, the wind comes in gushes
                            Of delicate scent mixed of honey and dew.
                            Now loud and now loud through the garrulous trees
                            A burst of gay music is blown with the breeze.
                        
                        
                            And the girls and the boys from the faubourgs of Paris,
                            The premature gamins as wise as fourscore;
                            The vain little Margots and the wide?awake Harrys,
                            Surprised into childhood, grew simple once more,
                            And vied with the cuckoo as, shouting at play,
                            They dashed through the thickets and darted away.
                        
                        
                            Ah, fair is the forest’s green glimmering splendour,
                            The leaves of the lime tree a network of light;
                            
                            And fringing long aisles of acacia, a tender
                            And delicate veiling of virginal white,
                            Where, framed in the gladdening flowers of May,
                            The bride and her bridesmaids beam gladder than they.
                        
                        
                            They have crowned her brown tresses with hawthorn in blossom,
                            They have made her a necklace of daisies for pearls;
                            They have set the white lily against her white bosom,
                            Enthroned on the grass mid a garland of girls;
                            With the earth for a footstool, the sky?roof above,
                            She is queen of the Springtide and Lady of Love.
                        
                        
                            Oh, the lilacs, the lilacs are glowing and blowing!
                            They pluck them by bushels as blithely they go
                            
                            Through the green, scented dusk where the hawthorn is showing
                            A luminous whiteness of blossoming snow.
                            And the Sun ere he goes gives the Moon half his
                                light,
                            As a lamp to lead Love on the bridal night.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A White Night.
                        
                            THE land lay deluged by the Moon;
                            The molten silver of the lake
                            Shimmered in many a broad lagoon
                            Between grey isles, whose copse and brake
                            Lay folded on the water’s breast
                            Like halcyons in a floating nest.
                        
                        
                            And like a child who trusts in God
                            When in the dark it lies alone,
                            Stretched on the aromatic sod
                            My heart was laid against your own,
                            Against your heart, which seemed to be
                            Mine own to all Eternity.
                        
                        
                        
                            Lapped in illimitable light,
                            The woods and waters seemed to swoon,
                            And clouds like angels?winged the night
                            And slipped away into the Moon,
                            Lost in that radiant flame above
                            As we were lapped and lost in love.
                        
                        
                            Achensee.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Forest Pool.
                        
                            LOST amid gloom and solitude,
                            A pool lies hidden in the wood,
                            A pool the autumn rain has made
                            Where flowers with their fair shadows played.
                        
                        
                            Bare as a beggar’s board, the trees
                            Stand in the water to their knees;
                            The birds are mute, but far away
                            I hear a bloodhound’s sullen bay.
                        
                        
                            Blue?eyed forget?me?nots that shook,
                            Kissed by a little laughing brook,
                            Kissed too by you with lips so red,
                            Float in the water drowned and dead.
                        
                        
                        
                            And dead and drowned ’mid leaves that rot,
                            Our angel?eyed Forget?me?not,
                            The love of unforgotten years,
                            Floats corpse?like in a pool of tears
                        
                        
                            Delamore Forest.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Noonday Rest.
                        
                            THE willows whisper very, very low
                            Unto the listening breeze;
                            Sometimes they lose a leaf which, flickering slow,
                            Faints on the sunburnt leas.
                        
                        
                            Beneath the whispering boughs and simmering skies,
                            On the hot ground at rest,
                            Still as a stone, a ragged woman lies,
                            Her baby at the breast.
                        
                        
                            Nibbling around her browse monotonous sheep,
                            Flies buzz about her head;
                            Her heavy eyes are shuttered by a sleep
                            As of the slumbering dead.
                        
                        
                        
                            The happy birds that live to love and sing,
                            Flitting from bough to bough,
                            Peer softly at this ghastly human thing
                            With grizzled hair and brow.
                        
                        
                            O’er what strange ways may not these feet have trod
                            That match the cracking clay?
                            Man had no pity on her—no, nor God—
                            A nameless castaway!
                        
                        
                            But Mother Earth now hugs her to her breast,
                            Defiled or undefiled;
                            And willows rock the weary soul to rest,
                            As she, even she, her child.
                        
                        
                            Hampstead Heath.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Cross?Roads.
                        
                            THE rain beat in our faces,
                            And shrill the wild airs grew;
                            The long?maned clouds in races
                            Coursed o’er heaven’s windy blue.
                        
                        
                            The tortured trees were lashing
                            Each other in their wrath,
                            Their wet leaves wildly dashing
                            Across the forest path.
                        
                        
                            We did not heed the sweeping
                            Of storm?bewildered rain;
                            Our cheeks were wet with weeping,
                            Our hearts were wrung with pain.
                        
                        
                        
                            For where the cross?roads sever,
                            Parting to East and West,
                            We bade good?bye for ever,
                            To what we each loved best.

                            AROUND this lichened home of hoary peace,
                            Invulnerable in its glassy moat,
                            A breath of ghostly summers seems to float
                            And murmur mid the immemorial trees.
                            The tender slopes, where cattle browse at ease,
                            Swell softly, like a pigeon’s emerald throat;
                            And, self?oblivious, Time forgets to note
                            The flight of velvet?footed centuries.
                        
                        
                            The very sunlight hushed within the close,
                            Sleeps indolently by the Yew’s slow shade;
                            Still as a relic some old Master made
                            The jewelled peacock’s rich enamel glows;
                            And on yon mossy wall that youthful rose
                            Blooms like a rose that never means to fade.

                            IS this the Cottage, ivy?girt and crowned,
                            And this the path down which our Shakespeare ran,
                            When, in the April of his love, sweet Anne
                            Made all his mighty pulses throb and bound;
                            Where, mid coy buds and winking flowers around,
                            She blushed a rarer rose than roses can,
                            To greet her Will—even Him, fair Avon’s Swan—
                            Whose name has turned this plot to holy ground!
                        
                        
                        
                            To these dear walls, once dear to Shakespeare’s eyes,
                            Time’s Vandal hand itself has done no wrong;
                            This nestling lattice opened to his song,
                            When, with the lark, he bade his love arise
                            In words whose strong enchantment never dies—
                            Old as these flowers, and, like them, ever young.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Anne Hathaway.
                        
                            HIS Eve of Women! She, whose mortal lot
                            Was linked to an Immortal’s unaware,
                            With Love’s lost Eden in her blissful air,
                            Perchance would greet him in this blessed spot.
                            No shadow of the coming days durst blot,
                            The flower?like face, so innocently fair,
                            As lip met lip, and lily arms, all bare,
                            Clung round him in a perfect lover’s knot.
                        
                        
                            Was not this Anne the flame?like daffodil
                            Of Shakespeare’s March, whose maiden beauty took
                            His senses captive? Thus the stripling brook
                            Mirrors a wild flower nodding by the mill,
                            Then grows a river in which proud cities look,
                            And with a land’s load widens seaward still
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Cleve Woods.
                        
                            SWEET Avon glides where clinging rushes seem
                            To stay his course, and, in his flattering glass,
                            Meadows and hills and mellow woodlands pass,
                            A fairer world as imaged in a dream.
                            And sometimes, in a visionary gleam,
                            From out the secret covert’s tangled mass,
                            The fisher?bird starts from the rustling grass,
                            A jewelled shuttle shot along the stream.
                        
                        
                            Even here, methinks, when moon?lapped shallows smiled
                            Round isles no bigger than a baby cot,
                            Titania found a glowworm?lighted child,
                            Led far astray, and, with anointing hand
                            Sprinkling clear dew from a forget?me?not,
                            Hailed him the Laureate of her Fairyland.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Lost Treasure.
                        
                            THE autumn day steals, pallid as a ghost,
                            Along these fields and man?forsaken ways;
                            And o’er the hedgerows bramble?knotted maze
                            The whitening locks of Old Man’s Beard are tost.
                            Here, shrunk by centuries of fire and frost,
                            A crab tree stands where—lingering gossip says—
                            In ocean?moated England’s golden days,
                            Great treasure, in a frolic, once was lost.
                        
                        
                            Here—fresh from fumes of some Falstaffian bout,
                            When famous champions, fired by many a bet,
                            Had drained huge bumpers while the stars would set—
                            Beneath its reeling branches by the way,
                            Till twice twelve hours of April bloom were out—
                            Locked in oblivion—Shakespeare lost a day.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        The Avon.
                        
                            WHAT are the Willows whispering in a row,
                            Nodding their old heads o’er the river’s edge?
                            What does the West wind whisper to the sedge
                            And to the shame?faced purples drooping low?
                            Why sobs the water, in its broken flow
                            Lapping against the grey weir’s ruined ledge?
                            And, in the thorny shelter of the hedge,
                            What bird unloads his heart of woe?
                        
                        
                            Green Avon’s haunted! Look, from yonder bank
                            The willow leans, that hath not ceased to weep,
                            Whence, hanging garlands, fair Ophelia sank;
                            Since Jacques moped here the trees have had a tongue;
                            And all these streams and whispering willows keep
                            The moan of Desdemona’s dying song.

                            THE hectic autumn’s dilatory fire
                            Has turned this lime tree to a sevenfold brand,
                            Which, self consuming, lights the sunless land,
                            A death to which all poet souls aspire.
                            Above the graves, where all men’s vain desire
                            Is hushed at last as by a Mother’s hand,
                            And, Time confounded, Love’s blank records stand,
                            The Evensong swells from the pulsing choir.
                        
                        
                            What incommunicable presence clings
                            To this grey church and willowy twilight stream?
                            Am I the dupe of some delusive dream?
                            Or, like faint fluid phosphorent rings
                            On refluent seas, doth Shakespeare’s spirit gleam
                            Pervasive round these old familiar things?

                            Once wrought the Mind which she had groped for still,
                            And she beheld herself as in a glass.

                            CEDARS of Lebanon! Labyrinths of Shade,
                            Making a mystery of open day;
                            With layers of gloom keeping the Sun at bay,
                            And solemn boughs which never bloom or fade.
                            Contemporaries of that great Crusade,
                            When militant Christendom leaped up one day,
                            Fired by the Cross, and rushing to the fray,
                            Poured Eastward as oracular Peter bade.
                        
                        
                            Borne hither when Christ’s Sepulchre was won,
                            And planted by hoar Warwick’s feudal walls,
                            You grew, o’ershadowing every rival stem.
                            When English woods don May’s fresh coronals,
                            Say,—Mourn ye still lost Jerusalem,
                            Funeral trees—beloved of Lebanon?
                        
                    
                
            
                
                    
                    Miscellaneous Pieces.
                    
                    
                        Pastiche.
                        
                            I.
                            LOVE, oh, Love’s a dainty sweeting,
                            Wooing now, and now retreating;
                            Brightest joy and blackest care,
                            Swift as light, and light as air.
                        
                        
                            II.
                            Would you seize and fix and capture
                            All his evanescent rapture?
                            Bind him fast with golden curls,
                            Fetter with a chain of pearls?
                        
                        
                            III.
                            Would you catch him in a net,
                            Like a white moth prankt with jet?
                            
                            Clutch him, and his bloomy wing
                            Turns a dead, discoloured thing!
                        
                        
                            IV.
                            Pluck him like a rosebud red,
                            And he leaves a thorn instead;
                            Let him go without a care,
                            And he follows unaware.
                        
                        
                            V.
                            Love, oh Love’s a dainty sweeting,
                            Wooing now, and now retreating;
                            Lightly come, and lightly gone,
                            Lost when most securely won!
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Marriage.
                        
                            LOVE springs as lightly from the human heart
                            As springs the lovely rose upon the brier,
                            Which turns the common hedge to floral fire,
                            As Love wings Time with rosy?feathered dart.
                            But marriage is the subtlest work of art
                            Of all the arts which lift the spirit higher;
                            The incarnation of the heart’s desire—
                            Which masters Time—set on Man’s will apart.
                        
                        
                            The Many try, but oh! how few are they
                            To whom that finest of the arts is given
                            Which shall teach Love, the rosy runaway,
                            To bide from bridal Morn to brooding Even.
                            Yet this—this only—is the narrow way
                            By which, while yet on earth, we enter heaven.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Once We Played.
                        
                            ONCE we played at love together—
                            Played it smartly, if you please;
                            Lightly, as a windblown feather,
                            Did we stake a heart apiece.
                        
                        
                            Oh, it was delicious fooling!
                            In the hottest of the game,
                            Without thought of future cooling,
                            All too quickly burned Life’s flame.
                        
                        
                            In this give?and?take of glances,
                            Kisses sweet as honey dews,
                            When we played with equal chances,
                            Did you win, or did I lose?
                        
                        
                        
                            Was your heart then hurt to bleeding,
                            In the ardour of the throw?
                            Was it then I lost, unheeding,
                            Lost my heart so long ago?
                        
                        
                            Who shall say? The game is over.
                            Of us two who loved in fun,
                            One lies low beneath the clover,
                            One lies lonely in the sun.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Affinities.
                        
                            I.
                            
                                I will take your thoughts to my heart;
                                I will keep and garner them there
                                Locked in a casket apart.
                                Far above rubies or rare
                                Pearls from the prodigal deep,
                                Which men stake their lives on to find,
                                And women their beauty to keep,
                                I will treasure the pearls of your mind.
                            
                            
                                How long has it taken the earth
                                To crystallize gems in a mine?
                                How long was the sea giving birth
                                To her pearls, washed in bitterest brine?
                                
                                What sorrows, what struggles, what fierce
                                Endeavour of lives in the past,
                                Hearts tempered by fire and tears,
                                To fashion your manhood at last!
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            II.
                            
                                TAKE me to thy heart, and let me
                                Rest my head a little while;
                                Rest my heart from griefs that fret me
                                In the mercy of thy smile.
                            
                            
                                In a twilight pause of feeling,
                                Time to say a moment’s grace,
                                Put thy hands, whose touch is healing,
                                Put them gently on my face.
                            
                            
                                Found too late in Life’s wild welter,
                                All I ask, for weal and woe,
                                Friend, a moment’s friendly shelter,
                                And thy blessing ere I go.
                            
                        
                        
                        
                            III.
                            
                                FULL many loves and friendships dear
                                Have blossomed brightly in my path;
                                And some were like the primrose rathe,
                                And withered with the vernal year.
                            
                            
                                And some were like the joyous rose,
                                Most prodigal with scent and hue,
                                That glows while yet the sky is blue,
                                And falls with every wind that blows—
                            
                            
                                Mere guests and annuals of the heart;
                                But you are that perennial bay,
                                Greenest when greener leaves decay,
                                Whom only death shall bid depart.
                            
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        To a Friend.
                        With a Volume of Verses.
                        
                            TO you who dwell withdrawn, above
                            The world’s tumultuous strife,
                            And, in an atmosphere of love,
                            Have triumphed over life;
                        
                        
                            To you whose heart has kept so young
                            Beneath the weight of years,
                            I give these passion flowers of song,
                            Still wet with undried tears.
                        
                        
                            You too have trod that stony path
                            Which steeply winds afar,
                            And seen, through nights of storm and wrath,
                            The bright and Morning Star;
                        
                        
                        
                            Where, shining o’er the Alps of time
                            On valleys full of mist,
                            It beckons us to peaks sublime,
                            Oh, brave Idealist.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        As Many Stars.
                        
                            AS many stars as are aglow
                            Deep in the hollows of the night
                            As many as the flowers that blow
                            Beneath the kindling light;
                        
                        
                            As many as the birds that fly
                            Unpiloted across the deep;
                            As many as the clouds on high,
                            And all the drops they weep;
                        
                        
                            As many as the leaves that fall
                            In autumn, on the withering lea,
                            When wind to thundering wind doth call,
                            And sea calls unto sea;
                        
                        
                        
                            As many as the multitude
                            Of quiet graves, where mutely bide
                            The wicked people and the good,
                            Laid softly side by side;—
                        
                        
                            So many thoughts, so many tears,
                            Such hosts of prayers, are sent on high,
                            Seeking, through all Man’s perished years,
                            A love that will not die.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Love’s Vision.
                        
                            TRANSPORTED out of self by Youth’s sweet madness,
                            Emulous of love, to Love’s empyrean height,
                            Where I beheld you aureoled in light,
                            My soul upsprang on wings of angel?gladness.
                            Far, far below, the earth and all earth’s badness—
                            A speck of dust—slipped darkling into night,
                            As suns of fairer planets flamed in sight,
                            Pure orbs or bliss unstained by gloom or sadness.
                        
                        
                            Lo, as I soared etherially on high,
                            You vanished, from my swimming eyes aloof,
                            Alone, alone, within the empty sky,
                            I reached out giddily, and reeling fell
                            From starriest heaven, to plunge in lowest hell,
                            My proud heart broken on Earth’s humblest roof.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        A Parable.
                        
                            BETWEEN the sandhills and the sea
                            A narrow strip of silver sand,
                            Whereon a little maid doth stand,
                            Who picks up shells continually
                            Between the sandhills and the sea.
                        
                        
                            Far as her wondering eyes can reach
                            A Vastness, heaving grey in grey
                            To the frayed edges where the day
                            Furls his red standard on the breach,
                            Between the skyline and the beach.
                        
                        
                            The waters of the flowing tide
                            Cast up the seapink shells and weed;
                            She toys with shells, and doth not heed
                            The ocean, which on every side
                            Is closing round her vast and wide.
                        
                        
                        
                            It creeps her way as if in play,
                            Pink shells at her pink feet to cast;
                            But now the wild waves hold her fast,
                            And bear her off and melt away
                            A Vastness heaving gray in gray.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Between Sleep and Waking.
                        
                            SOFTLY in a dream I heard,
                            Ere the day was breaking,
                            Softly call a cuckoo bird
                            Between sleep and waking.
                        
                        
                            Calling through the rippling rain
                            And red orchard blossom;
                            Calling up old love again,
                            Buried in my bosom;
                        
                        
                            Calling till he brought you too
                            From some magic region;
                            And the whole spring followed you,
                            Birds on birds in legion.
                        
                        
                        
                            Youth was in your beaming glance,
                            Love a rainbow round you;
                            Blushing trees began to dance,
                            Wreaths of roses crowned you.
                        
                        
                            And I called your name, and woke
                            To the cuckoo’s calling;
                            And you waned in waning smoke,
                            As the rain was falling.
                        
                        
                            Had the cuckoo called “Adieu,”
                            Ere the day was breaking?
                            All the old wounds bled anew
                            Between sleep and waking.
                        
                    
                    
                    
                        Rest.
                        
                            WE are so tired, my heart and I.
                            Of all things here beneath the sky
                            One only thing would please us best—
                            Endless, unfathomable rest.
                        
                        
                            We are so tired; we ask no more
                            Than just to slip out by Life’s door;
                            And leave behind the noisy rout
                            And everlasting turn about.
                        
                        
                            Once it seemed well to run on too
                            With her importunate, fevered crew,
                            And snatch amid the frantic strife
                            Some morsel from the board of life.
                        
                        
                        
                            But we are tired. At Life’s crude hands
                            We ask no gift she understands;
                            But kneel to him she hates to crave
                            The absolution of the grave.

                            BEFORE the abyss of the unanswering grave
                            Each mortal stands at last aloof, alone,
                            With his beloved one turned as deaf as stone,
                            However rebel love may storm and rave.
                            No will, however strong, avails to save
                            The wrecked identity knit to our own;
                            We may not hoard one treasured look or tone,
                            Dissolved in foam on Death’s dissolving wave.
                        
                        
                            Is this the End? This handful of brown earth
                            For all releasing elements to take
                            And free for ever from the bonds of birth?
                            Or will true life from Life’s disguises break,
                            Called to that vast confederacy of minds
                            Which casts all flesh as chaff to all the winds?

                    Page 21, line 7. “While Thoth holds the
                        trembling balance, weighs the heart and seals its fate.” Perhaps of all
                        Egyptian beliefs, none is so widely known as “The Judgment of the Dead.” It
                        is frequently represented on tombs and temples, and there is a remarkable
                        wall?painting of it in the beautiful little temple of Dêr?el?Medîneh. After
                        Osiris, Judge of the under world, Thoth plays the chief part in this
                        impressive ceremony. He is the Moon?god, generally represented as an Ibis or
                        Baboon. “The soul first advanced to the foot of the throne, carrying on its
                        outstretched hands the image of its heart or of its eyes, agents and
                        accomplices of its vices and virtues. It humbly ‘smelt the earth,’ then
                        arose, and with uplifted hands recited its profession of faith. In the
                        middle of the hall its acts were weighed by the assessors. Like all objects
                        belonging to the gods, the balance is magic. Truth squats upon one of the
                            scales; Thoth places the heart upon
                        the other, and, always merciful, bears upon the side of Truth, that judgment
                        may be favourably inclined. He affirms that the heart is light of offence,
                        inscribes the results of the proceeding upon a wooden tablet, and pronounces
                        the verdict aloud.”—“The Dawn of Civilization” by G.

                        Moonboat.”: The chief barks of Râ, the Sun?god, were called Saktît and
                        Mazît. He entered one on his rising in the East, which carried him along the
                        celestial river; and the other about the middle of his course, which bore
                        him to the land of Manû, which is at the entrance of Hades.

                        chiefly associated with the victoriously rising sun, and a slayer of the
                        Serpent, like all Sun?gods. He is generally depicted with the side?lock of
                        infancy, or as hawk?headed, or simply as a great golden Sparrow?Hawk, who
                        puts all other birds to flight.

                        primæval night of Egyptian mythology. She is described as follows in an
                        inscription cut on the floor of the mummy?case of Mykerinos, the builder of
                        the third great Pyramid: “Thy Mother Nuit has spread herself out over thee
                        in her name of Mystery of the Heavens.”
                    Page 31. “Egyptian Theosophy.” The
                        Egyptian imagination was extremely fertile in inventing myths of the
                        creation. “One amongst many was that Sibû was concealed under the form of a
                        colossal gander, whose mate once laid the Sun?Egg, and perhaps still laid it
                        daily. From the piercing cries wherewith he congratulated her, and announced
                        the good news to all who cared to hear it—after the manner of his kind—he had received the
                        flattering epithet of Ngagu?oirû, the Great Cackler. Other versions
                        repudiated the goose in favour of a vigorous bull, the father of gods and
                        men, whose companion was a cow, a large?eyed Hâthor, of beautiful
                            countenance.”—“The Dawn of Civilization” by G. Maspero.

                        of Ramadân is the month of fasting, which begins as soon as a Muslim
                        declares that he has seen the new moon. From daybreak to sunset, throughout
                        the month, eating and drinking are absolutely prohibited, but the faithful
                        indemnify themselves by feasting and smoking throughout a great part of the
                        night.

                         The Pharaohs used to cut off the hands of their conquered enemies, and
                        make them an offering to their gods. The subject is depicted in a striking
                        wall?painting of the Temple at Medinet Haboo.

                        The Beeshareens are a wandering desert tribe of Upper Egypt, reminding one
                        of our Gypsies. Many of them are remarkably handsome, more particularly in
                        childhood. The grace of their movements and charm of manner must strike all
                        travellers on the Nile. The children haunt the shore where boats land, and
                        set up an incessant cry for “backsheesh,” and there are few who can resist
                        the winning smiles with which they sweeten their importunities. Conspicuous
                        among the crowd was a lovely boy of sixteen, who attracted the attention of
                        artists and photographers two or three winters ago. He had the elegant
                        proportions of a Tanagra statuette, and was so constantly asked to sit for his portrait that he must have thought
                        that that was the end and aim of all tourists. Finally, he was carried off
                        to the World’s Fair with other curiosities of Egypt. When the Beeshareens
                        returned to Assouan he was not amongst them, and rumour says that he got as
                        far as Marseilles, where he utterly vanished. This tribe dress their profuse
                        black hair in quite an extraordinary fashion. It is worn in countless little
                        plaits, with a high, fuzzy bunch in the centre. I have heard it said that
                        they wear it thus in memory of their descent from one of the lost tribes of
                        Israel.

                            A cold, colossal Man!”
                         This unfinished Colossus of red granite was discovered by two English
                        officers while riding in the desert round Assouan. The scene is one of
                        extraordinary desolation. The ash?coloured sand, broken by blue?black
                        ridges, is a chaos of scattered stones and boulders which might be part of a
                        landscape in the moon. The statue is believed to be that of Amenhotep III.,
                        to whom we owe the two Colossi of the Plain, of which one is the famous
                        “Vocal Memnon.” He was also the Egyptian Nimrod, and on one of his
                        lion?hunting expeditions to the South is said to have met a beautiful young
                        maiden, whom he married, though she was neither Egyptian nor of royal race.
                        She was that famous Queen Thi who introduced the worship of the Sun’s disk
                        into Egypt.

                        under such manifold forms. It was supposed to have no female, and to roll
                        the eggs which produce its offspring into a kind of ball, sparing no effort
                        to place them in safety.

                        “There is perhaps no phase of our history more capable of poetic
                            treatment than the sainted lives of the Irish monks who first spread the
                            Christian faith over the western shores of Scotland, and yet it would be
                            difficult to point to a single representative poem having Saint Columba
                            and the devoted band of his disciples for its heroes. An attempt at
                            filling up this gap has recently been made by Miss Blind in a narrative
                            poem devoted to the fate of St. Oran, the friend and disciple of St.
                            Columba.... Apart from the sonorous beauty of her lines, there is in her
                            diction a straightforwardness and simplicity, and an entire absence of
                            affectation and false sentiment, which, combined with considerable power
                            of characterization, make her volume a remarkable contribution to
                            English literature.”

                        “To disturb the motif of a legend is
                            always a bold, and mostly a rash proceeding.... And yet so skilfully is
                            the story handled that the main incidents of the legend do not lose, but
                            gain by this disturbance of the motif,
                            and the character of Oran, which with the old motif could only have presented the single side of the
                            religious enthusiast, becomes a character exhibiting that complexity
                            which modern taste demands.... Directness of style and lucidity of
                            narrative are the characteristic excellences of the poem. There are few
                            contemporary poets who could have done so much dramatic business in so
                            few lines.... In each of the sonnets there is a thought that is well
                            expressed, and worth expressing.”

                        “It is in the domain of character that the poem is distinguished by its
                            highest excellence. There is an ideal statuesqueness embodied in the
                            person of St. Columba such as is felt to possess a powerful appeal to
                            the imagination. The poem embraces many passions, of which the most
                            tender and beautiful finds expression in the exquisite creation of the
                            radiant golden?haired girl for whose love St. Oran breaks his vow of
                            chastity. But the really powerful contribution to our knowledge of
                            character which this book contains is fittingly centred in St. Oran
                            himself. A dramatic instinct of high order finds utterance in his
                            struggles between opposing passions. Nor are the metrical excellences of
                            the poem less conspicuous.... If one were in need of some single phrase
                            by which to denote the ultimate effect produced by this book, one might
                            say that it seems the most mature of all recent first
                            efforts, even of established rank.”

                        “In the choice of a subject for her chief poem she has been singularly
                            fortunate.... That a story such as this is full of poetical
                            suggestiveness is obvious, and Miss Blind has proved herself equal to
                            the occasion. She has avoided writing anything approaching to a
                            ‘tendency poem.’ She metes out justice with an equal hand to all her
                            characters. The genuine enthusiasm and religious zeal of the monks are
                            set forth in language as inspired as is the final protest of St. Oran
                            against their narrow fanaticism; and one of the best passages in the
                            book is indeed the Sermon in which St. Columba announces the Gospel of
                            love and redemption to the islanders.”

                            character; and in the management of singularly difficult positions,
                            there is visible a firm and practised hand, a bold and unmistakable
                            power. ‘The Street Children’s Dance’ not unworthily ranks with some of
                            the touching pieces of Hood, Mrs. Barrett Browning, and others.”

                            is the touching plea for public toleration which is embodied in Miss
                            Mathilde Blind’s poem, wherein the spectacle of poor children dancing
                            round an organ is as pathetically moralized and as tender and full of
                            loving pity as Mrs. Browning’s ‘Cry of the Children.’”

                            glows in sympathy with the deeper feelings which stir humanity. There
                            has been published no poem of such creative suggestiveness as this for
                            many a day, and we hope and believe that it is the precursor of other
                            work by the same unfaltering hand. This poem is a true work of art,
                            complete and beautiful. There is in the volume other work which shows a
                            master’s touch.... ”

                        “Miss Blind has produced one of the most noticeable and moving poems
                            which recent years have added to our shelves.... As a singer with a
                            message her attempt is praiseworthy, and her performance is fairly
                            self?consistent. It is eminently homogeneous; the passion once felt, the
                            inspiration once obeyed, the well?head pours forth its stream in a
                            strong and uniform current, which knows no pause until its impulse
                            ceases.... The story is pathetic at once in its simplicity and in its
                            terror.... We congratulate the author upon her boldness in choosing a
                            subject of our own time, fertile in what is pathetic, and free from any
                            taint of the vulgar and conventional. Poetry of late years has tended
                            too much towards motives of a merely fanciful and abstruse, sometimes a
                            plainly artificial, character; and we have had much of lyrical energy or
                            attraction, with little of the real marrow of human life, the flesh and
                            blood of man and woman. Positive subject?matter, the emotion which
                            inheres in actual life, the very smile and the very tear and heart?pang,
                            are, after all, precious to poetry, and we have them here. ‘The Heather
                            on Fire’ may possibly prove to be something of a new departure, and one
                            that was certainly not superfluous.”

                            clearances which stain the history of Scotch landlordism. Though her
                            tale is a fiction it is too well founded on fact.... It may be said
                            generally of the poem that the most difficult scenes are those in which
                            Miss Blind succeeds best; and on the whole we are inclined to think that
                            its greatest and most surprising success is the picture of the poor old
                            soldier Rory driven mad by the burning of his wife. In his frenzy he
                            mixes up his old battles with the French and the descent of the

                            human sympathy.”

                            entitled ‘The Heather on Fire,’ treated with characteristic power by
                            Miss Mathilde Blind. Irish evictions
                            have offered so convenient a theme to party strife, that the sufferings

                            many bid an eternal farewell. Both as a narrative and descriptive poem

                        “We are happy in being able to extend to the present poem a welcome
                            equally sincere and equally hearty; for it is a poem that is rich not
                            only in power and beauty but in that ‘enthusiasm of humanity’ which
                            stirs and moves us, and of which so much contemporary verse is almost
                            painfully deficient. Miss Blind does not possess her theme; she is
                            possessed by it, as was Mrs. Browning when she wrote‘Aurora Leigh.’...
                            We can best describe the kind of her success by noting the fact that
                            while engaged in the perusal of her book we do not say, ‘What a fine
                            poem!’ but ‘What a terrible story!’ or, more probably still, say nothing
                            at all, but read on and on under the spell of a great horror and an
                            over?powering pity. Poetry of which this can be said needs no other
                            recommendation, and, therefore, we need not unduly lengthen our review
                            of ‘The Heather on Fire’”

                            the Highlands of Scotland. It is a strange fact that the general reader
                            knows more about the siege of Troy, the Norman Conquest, and the Wars of
                            the Roses than about such matters in the very history of our own days as
                            the depopulation of the Highlands of Scotland by the landlords. The old
                            story comes to the front just now by reason of the crofter agitation. In
                            the preface to her fine and touching epic, and in the notes at the end,
                            Miss Blind passes in review some of the facts of the eviction of the
                            Glen Sannox people by the Duke of Hamilton in 1832, where, as she
                                says,‘the progress of civilization, which has redeemed many a
                                wilderness and gladdened the solitary places of the world, has come
                                with a curse to these Highland glens, and turned green pastures and
                                golden harvest fields once more into a desert.’ The ‘Heather on
                            Fire’ is a poem in four cantos—or ‘Duans’—comprising about two hundred
                            stanzas.”

                            eminently poetical, both in thought and rhythm.”

                                récit (as we have called it) of
                            the musician, Emanuel Sturm, nearly all the interest of the book is
                            concentrated. The violinist, poor and unknown, finds himself at Capri.
                            Accident brings him, one evening, to a frightened group of women, one of
                            whom has just been bitten by the tarantula, and, according to the
                            popular superstition, he is implored to play, in order to drive the
                            poison out of her. He refuses at first, but afterwards consents, and
                            finding himself almost supernaturally inspired, plays an improvised
                            ‘Tarantella’ throughout a whole stormy night, finally curing the girl.
                            The tune thus strangely hit on spreads, and ultimately makes him famous,
                            but the love he has conceived for his Antonella brings him almost as
                            much misery as his music brings him fame.”

                            the very opposite kind of charm of which ‘Tarantella’ is full. Entirely
                            poetical in conception (save that it is not written in metre),
                            ‘Tarantella’ is more essentially a poem than many a narrative written in
                            smooth and elegant verse.... ‘Tarantella’ is indeed full of strange
                            originality and scenic effects of uncommon powers. The dance among the
                            ruins is not likely to be soon forgotten by the most unimaginative of
                            readers, and it is rarely, we think, that in an English novel the
                            psychology of the poetic temperament has been touched by a hand so
                            delicate and at the same time so strong.”

                            from German life, which are evidently written with intimate
                            knowledge.... This is distinctly a novel to read.”

                            many a day.... Her (Miss Blind’s) word?pictures glow with rich local
                            colours; she is a complete mistress of the art of dramatic cause and
                            effect. When once fairly under weigh, she never allows the interest to
                            flag for a single moment. Thus it is only when we have laid down the

                            care and art which have contributed to this triumphant result; to turn
                            back... and dwell on the author’s extraordinary knowledge of the human
                            heart—extraordinary alike for its depth and its range. As for the wit
                            and humour with which the book is freely sprinkled, the poetic and
                            artistic spirit which pervades it throughout, they can only be

                            improbability, we follow the strange fortunes of Antonella, Countess

                            innocent girl, her friend, is well delineated, and Emanuel Sturm, the

                            the highest conception of human life we can hope to reach. It is a
                            brave, sad, glorious story, told with inimitable skill, and as only a
                            poet who knows man’s heart, with its hopes, doubts, fears, aspirations,
                            could possibly tell it.... The other poems in the volume are as
                            excellent in their kind as those which give a title to it. The only
                            difference between them is that one series is rich with human
                            experience, and with the results of knowledge and of high thinking,
                            while the other is all aglow with the fresh delights of the outdoor
                            world. These delights find an almost perfect expression.... A reviewer
                            who is so fortunate as to light on a book like this, lays it down with
                            regret, and fears that he has not said of it all that it deserves should
                            be said. That is my feeling; and, lest I should have omitted any note of
                            praise that ought to be sounded, I should like to add, by way of
                            suggestion to all lovers of poetry—and I hope they are still many—that
                            here is truly a book that is worth the loving.”

                            From Chaos to Kosmos she hurries her reader along, breathless and
                            perspiring perhaps, but never anxious to stop. We have known her book to
                            be read on the Underground Railway, and the reader to be so absorbed in
                            its contents as to be carried unawares several stations past his
                            destination.... Miss Blind’s gift of song is genuine, and her
                            imagination powerful.... When all is said and done, ‘The Ascent of Man’
                            remains a remarkable poem, and cannot fail to increase its author’s
                            reputation as a brilliant and original writer.”

                            scorn of luxurious vice.”

                            high pitched in tone—they are human.... Every line comes from a heart

                            monitions.”

                            bold and comprehensive scale. ‘The Ascent of Man’ is a really remarkable
                            poem. Its main conception is even noble, its manner of execution is
                            brilliant and vigorous, and it abounds in passages which prove Miss
                            Blind to possess the true poetic faculty.”

                            philosophical poem, challenging comparison by its subject with the great
                            work of Lucretius, and inevitably suggesting some of the finest passages
