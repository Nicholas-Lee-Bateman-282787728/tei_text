            <p>Scholarly and popular writers alike have steadfastly maintained for half a century that the Ku Klux
                    Klan "ran" Indiana in the 1920s. Textbooks, essays, and monographs spin much the
                    same tale: racist disciples of the Lost Cause resurrected the defunct Klan in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> in 1915. The hooded horde spread from the deep South across the heartland of the nation
                    after World War I. Hundreds of thousands of earnest Hoosiers flocked to Indiana Grand Dragon David
                    C. Stephenson's bedsheet standard between 1921 and 1925, determined to save America from
                    the onslaught of aliens, bolsheviks, Catholics, and blacks. Colossal rallies at county fairgrounds
                    and parks across the state (many resembling the Nazi spectacles of the 1930s) attracted throngs of
                    spectators. Hundreds of white-robed KKK parades in cities, small towns, and villages all but
                    mesmerized the people of Indiana.</p>
            <p>The opportunistic Stephenson, the story continues, offered coveted Klan endorsements to pliant
                    political candidates, then proclaimed himself "the law in Indiana." Thereafter,
                    from his hotel suite in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "the Old Man" directed the Hoosier state's political
                    affairs according to his own low and splashy tastes. Another sort of affair finally tripped him up:
                    a murder conviction removed Stephenson to the inhospitable confines of a state prison, and the
                    suddenly rudderless Indiana Klan collapsed.</p>

            <p>The importance of these events may, like the famous early report of Mark Twain's
                    "death," be greatly exaggerated. Tantalizing bits and pieces of information
                    suggest that the Indiana Klan was more disunited than monolithic. It was in conflict from the outset
                    with the southern-controlled national Klan. Internal rivalries, corruption, and disorganization were
                    common, despite the Klan's huge, probably sincere, and certainly deluded membership. Quite
                    possibly the Indiana KKK was always the fiefdom of greedy lowbrows, men little concerned with the
                    future of white, Protestant civilization. Did Stephenson and his rival dragon, Walter Bossert,
                    really lose much sleep over those menacing hordes of foreigners, blacks, and Catholics? Two points
                    should be recalled: numbers are not necessarily synonymous with either power or coherent purpose,
                    and, equally important, the entire history of the Indiana Klan as a mass organization encompassed
                    fewer than five years. A detailed reexamination of the Indiana Klan of the 1920s would be
                    illuminating.</p>
            <p>Older Hoosiers may recall the Klan's nationally publicized scheme to buy the nearly bankrupt <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName> University in 1923 and build a National Klan University on the carcass. A confused tale
                    of "how the Klan bought Valpo" still circulates in northern Indiana. A close look
                    at that unconsummated purchase provides valuable insights into the Klan's leadership and
                    organizational effectiveness. Most Klan records have disappeared, but newspapers, Klan journals, the
                    excellent archives of <placeName>

                    Division of the Indiana Commission on Public Records housed in the Indiana State Library permit a
                    surprisingly close look at a vain foray into the world of higher education by an organization sadly
                    in need of some.</p>

                    managed an exceptionally utilitarian school on a shoestring budget and taught over 140,000
                    "useful" students from elementary level to graduate and professional school. Forty
                    percent of them became teachers, but most of those who attended "Old Valpo" were
                    more interested in acquiring commercial and industrial job skills than in earning a degree. Their
                    open-admission "People's University" was dominated by a philosophy of
                    "work, not wealth." <placeName>

                    the present century, including open admissions; coeducation; preparatory, remedial, and work-study
                    programs; education for the handicapped; and, above all, practical industrial-technical training,

                    until 1920. The two men owned and operated one of the nation's largest private universities
                    for half a century without trustees, endowment, fraternities and sororities, dances, or even
                    football. The school's Latin motto translated as "Where Theory Squares With
                    Practice," and under that rubric over two hundred faculty members trained and educated some
                    five thousand students around 1910. An admiring <placeName>

            <p>Valparaiso was, in fact, considerably more. The brick buildings on College Hill housed a remarkable

                            vice-president from 1880 to 1917, and acting president after Brown suffered a stroke in
                            1912. His direction of the university's dormitories and food service set high
                            standards of quality and economy and allowed thousands of "ambitious and
                            slim-pocketed" young people to attend Old Valpo. His policies attracted
                            considerable national attention around the turn of the century. Described as a
                            "picturesque character," Kinsey was also a popular lecturer. A public
                            advocate of temperance and women's suffrage over the years, Kinsey served as
                            president after Brown's passing until his wife's declining health forced

                    workaday reality, perhaps at the expense of traditional academic education. Moreover, a
                    "democratic" ethic prevailed, at least ideally, permitting faculty and students to
                    escape from the "silly claims of prerogative and superiority" so common in the
                    private colleges of the day.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    marvelously low. A careful selection of locally produced foodstuffs helped provide three wholesome
                    meals a day for twenty cents in 1913. Tuition, room, and board cost only $231.00 in 1919.
                    The student newspaper reported that "roast beef, tender and juicy," was available
                    in the dining hall for fourteen cents. "A generous cut" of pie was seven cents,
                    olives, two cents, and doughnuts, a penny.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    1900, and proprietorial universities either changed or disappeared. The North Central Association of
                    Colleges and Universities denied accreditation to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which retarded public acceptance of the college's programs and prevented
                    transfer of its academic credits. A 1919 state requirement that private colleges and universities
                    maintain a half-million-dollar endowment seemed insurmountable. An otherwise laudable rise in public
                    day and night school attendance eroded <placeName>

                    competed with growing, fully accredited, and even more economical state colleges and

                            bachelor's degree from Bates College and a string of phony graduate degrees.
                            Reputedly the author of two science texts, he had little understanding of the
                            school's traditions and problems. He inherited an empty treasury and a simmering
                            feud with the alumni. Hodgdon's "degrees," problems, and
                            high-handed administration caused his early dismissal. Before leaving, Hodgdon publicly
                            described staid "Old Valpo" as a hotbed of "bolshevist
                            rowdies" and accused the faculty of fostering "sinister inside
                            influences." The press, well-conditioned by the "Red Scare," made
                            far too much of Hodgdon's sour grapes, and as he departed, alumni purses
                        closed.</p>

                    physician Gerald H. Stoner. The board was enlarged to twenty-one in 1923, and local men were joined

               </placeName>, and elsewhere. During the struggle to save the
                    university between 1920 and 1925, most important decisions were made by a nine-member executive
                    board, chaired by the university president and vice-president.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the board's first years were dominated by a parade of presidents. H.K. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s immediate successor was Daniel R. Hodgdon, an ill-tempered autocrat with a
                    genuine bachelor's degree from Bates College buried under a collection of phony diplomas
                    (M.A., M.S., Sc.D., LL.D., Ph.D.). Ignoring <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s rapidly declining enrollment, President Hodgdon continued <placeName>

                    institutional advertising, and traveling varsity teams. "Mr. Hodgdon distinguished
                    himself," said a successor, "by showing the most complete and amazing ignorance of
                    schools in general and of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName> University in particular." His "reign of incompetence,"
                    particularly after the failure of his booster-style fund-raising campaign, started a war among
                    faculty, students, and trustees that ended with his resignation. How much of this was chargeable to
                    existing and probably unavoidable tensions among old and new faculty, town and gown, boosters and
                    knockers, and increasingly desperate trustees is anyone's guess half a century later.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before leaving, the sour Hodgdon publicly described the staid old school as a "hotbed of
                    bolshevism, communism, and other cults." His silly charges were given credibility by the
                    Red Scare of the day and were duly echoed in the national press. Campus commotions between boosters
                    and knockers or insurgents and loyalists, depending on who told the tale, filled the city jail with
                    three students and newspapers with even more lurid headlines. Hodgdon's sensational
                    nonsense further alienated the alumni and brought collapse nearer. John E. Roessler and Milo J.

            <p>Remarkably little was accomplished by the four presidents. A federally sponsored veterans vocational

                    </placeName>'s normal school and still unaccredited college program barely limped along.
                    The high school survived as "one of the few places today where mature persons can get this
                    education without embarrassment," and the Preparatory Department continued to help
                    "foreigners." Useful as these programs were, most were hardly university matters,
                    and the rudderless school gradually sank in a sea of overdue bills.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Despite these financial and administrative crises, daily campus life seemed normal enough.
                    Undergraduates taught English and civics to eight hundred adults, mostly recent immigrants, at the
                    Gary YMCA in 1921. The Rehabilitation Club presented a successful minstrel show, featuring an olio
                    of the palace of King Herod, in the same season. Eighteen hundred students registered for classes in
                    1922, mostly in the high school. Athletic Director William Shadoan, former assistant coach of Centre

                    hands with the devil for his desperate school, and he very nearly did. During his brief presidency
                    Evans fought bankers, realtors, judges, and a medical equipment factory; wooed governors,
                    legislatures, and the Ku Klux Klan; and finally placed his school in the responsible hands of a

                    mother, and an unnamed sum for retired president Oliver Kinsey. The school's formal

                    blamed too many of their troubles on the Brown family (and perhaps more on Neva than HK) after 1920.

                    would assume responsibility for the university and its debts and provide the promised million

            <p>The second attempt to capitalize on the limping school's difficulties came from an

                    </placeName> had resigned his university bursarship in 1921 to resume his business career. The

                    justification, terminated the university's lease on the campus and announced a vague
                    "new educational plan." Then, as the trustees' still-private negotiations

            <p>The trustees resisted manfully. With thirty thousand dollars in insurance money from the burned Old
                    College Building and donations from alumni and local citizens, they squared their account with <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> proposed to share the campus. Cook Laboratories would use the substantial new science

                    arrangement. Fortunately, the Cook Laboratories crisis eased in late July. Judge H.H. Loring denied <placeName>

                    </placeName> knew nothing of the Klan-university negotiations when he moved to transform the campus
                    into a syringe factory. "If you men can continue to operate the university you have my best

                    $1,000,000 to take Over V.U." The word had come by telephone from Elrod and the

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>The tale grew even longer on August 16, as Mavity assured his readers that Elrod had made the escrow

                    that the sale would formally take place on August 28. But Editor Elrod's National
                    University of the Ku Klux Klan had no cash, and apparently no final papers had been signed. One

            </p>
            <p>September brought cool weather and hot, face-saving recriminations. Trustee Charles Jeffrey insisted
                    that excessive publicity—on which the Klan usually doted—had scuttled the

                    and other penniless publicists. <list type="footnotes">

                    Gizzard" Evans and Stephenson cause to reconsider, but Judge Robert I. Marsh, the Indiana
                    Klan's attorney, readily admitted that his organization had no money either to buy or to

                    concluded that the Klan had persevered in the face of mountains of adverse publicity but argued that
                    "the plan which took on such vast proportions in the minds of the members of the
                    organization, was never more than [an] extravagant day-dream."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>Power relationships within the Klan during the much-reported Klan-university talks remain obscure.
                    Few records of the Invisible Empire have survived, if indeed any existed in the first place. Was
                    Editor Elrod only an enthusiast, hypnotized by a grand dream in white? Perhaps he was an honest
                    broker, torpedoed at the last moment by his principals. Did he ever have a solid cash commitment
                    from either Imperial Wizard Evans or Grand Dragon Stephenson, two men who openly detested one
                    another? Every question about this aspect of the incident seems to prompt two others.</p>
            <p>Elrod's public role in the negotiations can be traced through the pages of his <hi rend="i">Fiery Cross,</hi> which first mentioned the university in the issue of May 11, 1923. Elrod then
                    reported that "the 300 students of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and would "produce a thrill of their own." His recapitulation of the
                    events of the rally ignored the school, however, and his chief effusion in the next issue was a
                    mangled pseudobiblical account of "Samson and Delilah." By early June the editor
                    of the <hi rend="i">Fiery Cross</hi> had apparently forgotten <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>

                    Old employees, said Elrod magnanimously, would be retained. An old mill on the campus,
                    "rich in historical lore," would be restored, and the shores of nearby
                        <geogName>Sager Lake</geogName> would be dotted with cottages for visiting parents. A
                    "wonderful bathing beach" and "golf links" would complete this
                    academic resort. Bit in his teeth, Elrod warned "un-American and alien forces"
                    against disrupting the talks, for "whatever the Ku Klux Klan starts out to do, it always
                    does." With "remarkable enthusiasm" from "all parts of

            <p>Doubt crept in less than a week later. The August 31 issue of the <hi rend="i">Fiery Cross</hi>
                    admitted that details would take time but asserted that Klan lawyers had the matter in hand.
                    Fortunately, Valpo's football schedule would proceed without interruption. By September 7
                    Elrod was describing the "Indiana Klansmen" of the university's new Board
                    of Trustees, while conceding that prospects for the purchase—because of the
                    charter—had become "gloomy." By October all mention of the university
                    had disappeared from the pages of the <hi rend="i">Fiery Cross.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>How credible was Elrod's charge that the sale was blocked by "a tangled snarled

                    insistence to the contrary, the charter was no problem. Vice-President Bowman, in fact, insisted
                    that the trustees would willingly and immediately make whatever adjustments the Klan desired. The <placeName>

                    directly to Bossert. The booster-editor was thus thoroughly grounded, perhaps a victim of his own

            <p>What part did Stephenson and the Realm of Indiana play in the almost certainly vaporous university
                    purchase talks? Did the Grand Dragon at any point promise <hi rend="i">anything</hi> to Elrod, or
                    did he merely allow his editor to travel as far as his jawbone could carry him? Stephenson later
                    testified that the national Klan had raised over eighty million dollars while he held office. Of
                    that sum, $4.5 million was collected in Indiana, from which $2.5 million
                    flowed into Imperial Wizard Hiram Evans's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> coffers. Yet in March, 1923, the only date for which figures exist, only fifty thousand
                    dollars rested in the state Klan's bank account. No national Klan money ever arrived in the
                    Hoosier state for "charitable" or any other worthwhile purposes during the 1920s.
                    Where did it all go? Stephenson squandered his personal share, admittedly a million dollars, on
                    liquor, parties, women, fast automobiles, and his ninety-eight-foot twin screw mahogany and teak
                    yacht, <hi rend="i">Reomas II.</hi> Such high patriotic duties clearly precluded wasting cash on

                            speeches against Catholics, blacks, Jews, and foreigners. He sold fear wholesale and by 1923
                            was the head of the Hoosier Klan, owned a yacht and an airplane emblazoned with three

                    Indiana Klan in general. For example, could the hyperbole, disunity, and personal rivalries that

                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName> University episode be typical of the Klan's management of its everyday
                    internal affairs? Were those carefully managed Klan rallies and parades, those grand images of unity
                    and patriotism, created only to attract membership fees? Did they mask, if not hood, an
                    opportunistic, venal, and incompetent organization? The frictions among Imperial Wizard Evans, Grand
                    Dragon Stephenson, Editor Elrod, and the rank and file may be a more accurate indicator of Klan
                    reality. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>
                    </placeName> klansmen who coordinated their city's attempt to save its leading
                    "business" were solid, bourgeois doctors and lawyers, businessmen and boosters.
                    Were they, rather than uncouth "good ol' boys," more typical klansmen? If
                    so, historians need to reexamine some widely held assumptions.</p>
            <p>Living ex-Klan members are understandably closemouthed; rueful kleagles, klaliffs, and kludds sent
                    most Klan documents up a hundred chimneys after the 1920s. It is thus difficult for the historian to
                    appraise the impact of the Klan on society at large. How important, really, were Klan endorsements
                    of Republican candidates for state and local offices in a Republican era? Did local klaverns
                    maintain stable memberships, or did klansmen come and go? Who joined in which community, and why?
                    Were many, as the well-polished shoes beneath their white gowns often suggested, middle-class men
                    and women? What percentage were workers? How many were farmers? Were they racists, nativists,
                    haters—simple bigots in a racist age—or honestly concerned citizens, joiners
                    in an age of joiners of an organization that promised to solve apparent problems? Even if more
                    klavern rosters are discovered, such questions may remain unanswerable, <list type="footnotes">

                    from them it is possible to glean a picture of the nurse's role in two crucial phases of
                    military operations during World War I, the army's base and evacuation hospitals.</p>
            <p>There were five levels of care for American soldiers wounded in battle in Europe during World War I.
                    Women were involved in only two of them. The system was designed for the type of war being fought,
                    the distance from hospitals in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and the kind of transportation available. In the field itself members of the
                    regimental medical detachment applied first-aid dressings and carried or assisted the wounded to <hi rend="i">aid stations.</hi> Here other regimental medical officers applied dressings and splints
                    and prepared the wounded for transport. Enlisted men and litter bearers took them to collecting
                    stations and ambulances. The field hospitals, about five miles back of the front lines, were similar
                    to present-day Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) units. They received the wounded from ambulances
                    and triaged them, performed emergency surgery, redressed wounds, relieved pain, provided
                    nourishment, and treated shock. <hi rend="i">Evacuation hospitals</hi> were set up from twelve to
                    twenty miles or more back of the lines on railroad sidings. Women army nurses worked in these
                    evacuation units. Here patients received more thorough care before they were taken by train to the
                        <hi rend="i">base hospitals.</hi> Gathered hurriedly but carefully by government and civilian
                    effort, the base hospitals were sent in thousands of pieces to be assembled in Europe to care for
                    American wounded. With them, also hurriedly assembled, went groups of civilian doctors, nurses,
                    technicians, and supporting staff, who, for the war's duration, were absorbed under the
                    aegis and direction of the military.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Base Hospital 32 contributed toward the medical progress that is one of the small compensations for
                    the suffering of war. There, as in all hospitals, research was done on wound inflammation, the use
                    of x-ray and fluoroscopy in locating foreign bodies, and the treatment of shock. Sixty percent of
                    the patients who reached Lilly Base Hospital were gas cases. The most severely affected died
                    immediately or en route to the hospital. Exposure to mustard and phosgene gas caused severe damage
                    to the respiratory system and pulmonary edema. Burned membranes in the throat, bronchi, and lungs
                    necrosed and caused obstruction and respiratory failure. Even hospital attendants were frequently
                    burned by contact with clothing and blankets which had been exposed to the gas.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No satisfactory treatment had been developed for gas inhalation, so the hospital was free to use
                    whatever seemed to provide relief. The English treated these cases with oxygen and benzoin steam
                    inhalations, but an otolaryngologist at Base Hospital 32, Major <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> Page, rejected this treatment. He believed that the oxygen was unnecessary and that the
                    steam merely soaked the tissues. He realized that in order for recovery and healing to take place it
                    was necessary for the injured tissue debris to be removed from the lungs, primarily through the
                    natural cough reflex. He therefore devised a mixture of guiacol, camphor, menthol, and oil of thyme
                    and eucalyptus that was introduced into the trachea through a syringe. When it reached the bronchi,
                    it caused coughing to expel the products of inflammation and suppuration. The patient received
                    immediate relief, breathing was facilitated, pain reduced, and healing begun. This treatment was
                    widely copied in other American as well as English hospitals and became the standard treatment for
                    this injury. Of the six thousand gas cases treated at Base Hospital 32, only two died of <list type="footnotes">

                    Byrnes, an ophthalmologist at the hospital, showed that the open treatment of eyes exposed to poison
                    gas was more beneficial than the common practice of bandaging.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Essig noted:
                    "It is remarkable to see how the burned eyes respond to treatment."</p>
            <p>Base Hospital 32 also made other medical advances during the war. A combination of ether and
                    chloroform under a closed hood reduced induction time for anesthesia from twenty minutes to one to
                    two minutes. Another innovation was the use of a nasopharyngeal tube for anesthesia, particularly
                    for head surgery. Because the hospital staff recognized that spinal injuries, especially those
                    resulting in severed cords, had a poor prognosis, patients with these injuries were sent home as
                    soon as possible in an attempt to secure the best care for them. And a warning was issued against
                    eating the "beautiful blue grapes" that grew in the French mountains when it was
                    discovered that a particular type of "mania" was the result of belladonna berry
                        poisoning.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Essig comments infrequently concerning the nursing treatments that were administered to patients at
                    Base Hospital 32. She focuses instead on the day-to-day lives of the nurses, who often worked
                    impossible hours under nearly impossible conditions. Essig and her colleagues among the volunteer
                    base hospital nursing staff bore their trials not without complaint but with determination and pride
                    in their obvious importance to the war effort and to other Americans.</p>
            <p>Like Essig, the great majority of nurses who served in the war were recruited by the American Red
                    Cross. At first they were assigned directly to the base hospitals, as Essig was, later directly to
                    the army or navy. Need for medical and nursing care soon became great in the army camps within the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Thousands of men died of pneumonia and meningitis without ever leaving the country.
                    Many of the nurses waiting to be assigned to hospitals overseas were sent instead to the camps to
                    work, and several lost their own lives as a result. In the fall of 1918, while Allied forces were
                    gaining victories in <placeName>

            <p>During the war the Red Cross also sent nurses to French army hospitals to help care for American
                    wounded. A famous recruiting slogan for the Red Cross was "American nurses for American
                    men." The importance of this practice becomes clear from the many letters written home by
                    soldiers describing their relief at waking up in a hospital and hearing an American nurse speaking
                        English.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Essig saw the problem in reverse. She dealt with Hindu, German,
                    English, and French patients as well as American wounded and found it difficult to communicate with
                    them.</p>
            <p>Despite the dangers that Essig must have realized were involved in wartime nursing,<hi rend="sup">12</hi> she records in her diary no period of hesitation, no qualms, no obstacles to her decision
                    to accept Florence Martin's invitation to join the staff of Base Hospital 32. She
                    considered it an honor. A somewhat proper but very human young woman, she did not disdain creature
                    comforts, but her personal and professional ideals enabled her to forego them for a cause in which
                    she believed. In July, 1917, she "reported in person to Miss Martin for personal
                    interview," then returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName> to await her summons. The telegram arrived on September 6 with directions to

                                            grammatically correct. In a number of instances decisions concerning initial
                                            capitalization were arbitrary. Misspellings have been retained, as has
                                            Essig's practice of using dashes instead of other forms of
                                            punctuation, even at the ends of sentences. If no punctuation was placed at
                                            the end of a sentence, a double space is used to indicate a break in
                                            thought. Explanatory material, complete names of individuals, omitted
                                            letters, or correct spellings of places have sometimes been inserted in

                    friends at Overlook Hospital in Summit, <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Activities were somewhat constrained by the fact that no one had yet been paid.</p>
            <p>On October 19 Essig's group left Hoboken and was "nicely deposited on <hi rend="i">Ellis Island</hi>—one step nearer ‘Over-There’
                    "—with the rest of the personnel from Base Hospital 32. Essig reported:
                    "This is a beautiful spot The air is grand—a wonderful view of the Statue of
                    Liberty It is a view worth fighting for—" More visiting, dining, and
                    sightseeing, with much partying and sharing of boxes of food from home, resulted in the lament,
                    "Beautiful weather, good eats and I am getting <hi rend="i">Fat</hi>—"
                    The monotony was somewhat relieved by daily French classes, which Essig described on November 3 as
                    "progressing and leaving me in the rear." Later she wrote: "For class,
                    two of the nurses hid under their beds—two staid in the bath room and others just
                    disappeared—Out of a class of 19,8 were present—Class is more unpopular than
                    scrubbing—" On November 5 she commented: "Fine weather but we are sick
                    of all this waiting and of being of no use to any one—and broke—I have just
                    24c The pay master's money ran out before he reached our unit—which means we
                    will have to sign another pay roll—"</p>
            <p>By the end of November, 1917, Christmas boxes from home began to arrive, and "In trying to
                    eat everything, I broke off a front tooth, which means I must see a dentist—I look a
                    sight—" Another period of Thanksgiving and birthday feasting, as well as several
                    dental appointments, ended abruptly with orders for departure on December 3. Baggage space was
                    limited, so extra clothing was hurriedly given away, mailed home, or worn in layers. "One
                    of the nurses dumped a lot of nuts sent to me in her umbrella and we were glad to have them later
                    when food was at a premium—"</p>

                    Bay of Biscay and encountered a tremendous storm. Several lifeboats and crew members were reportedly
                    washed overboard, and everyone was confined to cabins. Captain Carleton B. McCulloch, M.D., adjutant
                    of the unit, later wrote a nine-stanza poem entitled "Lines Dedicated to the Bay of
                    Biscay." His general sentiments were summed up in the last stanza: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>When the struggle is concluded and the victory is sure, The foe must take some punishment

                    with twenty-five cents to get her a sour pickle. "It was what I craved and needed and worth
                    a dollar—" Her electrolyte balance was undoubtedly at least partially restored!
                    The coast of Brittany was sighted on December 20, and the ship anchored in the Bay of Brest.
                    Hospital personnel remained on board until December 24 while the thousands of troops disembarked.</p>
            <p>An afternoon of sightseeing—at an old chateau in Brest—was followed by a
                    two-day rail trip across northern <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. Four nurses were locked into each compartment and given rations for the trip.
                    "Attending to nature's wants was a serious problem—Jam and Tomato Cans
                    served our need—" Christmas Day brought a stop in a town where sandwiches could
                    be purchased to supplement rations. Members of Base Hospital 32 communicated with each other
                    "by sticking our heads out of the little window in our little doors—"
                    The train ride ended in Contrexéville la Vosges at 3:00 a.m. on December 26. An unheated
                    building recently vacated by French soldiers, with all toilets frozen, was the group's
                    lodging for the next two days. Essig wrote: "I slept all night in my sleeping-bag under my
                    down comforter which had been brought all the way from home (not such a crazy idea as some had
                    thought—)."</p>
            <p>On December 28 the group moved up the hill to the buildings which would house Base Hospital 32. The
                    town of Contrexéville, about forty miles southwest of Nancy, was a summer resort with a
                    spa whose healing waters were shipped in bottles <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>. The resort had three parks, tennis courts, and a casino with a theater, gaming rooms,
                    and a salon. Hotels, villas, and small hostelries, as well as a location fifty miles behind the
                    front lines and near a railway, made the town suitable for a military hospital site. The French had
                    been using some of the larger buildings as hospitals but had recently evacuated them for American
                    use. Five of the buildings were assigned to Base Hospital 32. Two hotels were designated as surgical
                    units and three as medical. Their planned capacity of five hundred was eventually increased to 1,250
                    beds. Some of the other buildings were assigned to Base Hospital 31 from Youngstown, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. It took until March to organize and equip the buildings. Certain sections of the
                    buildings and cellars were sealed for storage of what were believed to be art objects, wines, and
                    other items for future peacetime use.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Hospital equipment had <hi rend="i">arrived prior</hi> to personnel and was stored at a medical
                    supply depot. The first task for the unit attached to Base Hospital 32 was to clean the buildings,
                    recently abandoned by the French "in an extremely unsanitary condition." Refuse
                    had to be removed; floors, windows, and woodwork washed; and plumbing, electrical work, and
                    carpentry done before the buildings could be used as hospitals. Special lighting and wiring were
                    needed for surgery and x-ray, and sterilizing equipment, as well as additional sinks and drains, had
                    to be installed. This work was done during January by the enlisted men.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>Essig and three other nurses were assigned to a room on the eighth floor of a hotel at the top of a
                    hill. She wrote: "In peace time I am sure we would pay a handsome price for our
                    room—especially the view—" Having once more unpacked, she and a small
                    group were notified at 3:00 p.m. on December 29 that they would form a temporary relief detachment
                    to go to Base Hospital 15, the Roosevelt Hospital unit from <placeName>

            <p>At 4:30 the next morning, the group of thirty repacked their belongings and left by truck for the
                    train. Chief Nurse Florence Martin gave Essig the travel orders and placed her in charge of the

                    feel would enjoy having…." Work began the next morning, December 31. The
                    hospital was overcrowded and had little equipment, and the new nurses were assigned to various
                    pavilions to relieve and do cleaning. Essig commented: <text>

                    nurses, and keep the group functioning. On January 8 Essig wrote: "Snowing and much colder.
                    Everyone sick and complaining I feel disgusted and discouraged—We are surely not much
                    Help to anyone here. I want to go on duty but Miss Francis insists I am her assistant and in charge
                    of B.H. 32 nurses The nurses do not agree with her…." On January 9 she
                    continued: "I pleaded with Miss Francis to put me on regular duty—just any
                    thing—she said she would—Food not so good the cook is sick!"
                    Essig's request was granted on January 10 when she was assigned to duty in the sick
                    officers' pavilion. Several nurses had measles and one had mumps, but these were apparently
                    confined and did not spread. By January 15 more friction had developed between the Roosevelt unit
                    and the nurses from Base Hospital 32.</p>

                    with sweets and such amenities as bath soap and toothpaste. Essig was then assigned to the second
                    floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, the main surgical building, which could accommodate a total of five
                    hundred patients. The weather continued wet and cold, and she wrote: "The rain

                    were still mainly sick personnel. Finally, on March 23, she reported: "We received our
                    first real convoy—about 300 All 42nd Div.—Rainbow Div. I received 68 on my

                    chief duty was to "secure endless supplies and keep records adequately." She

                    5:45 a.m. by Easter hymns being played on four horns. "It sounded Heavenly." But
                    working conditions were still difficult: <text>

                    I should take it easier for awhile—I doubt her reason, however—"
                    Shortly after the transfer Essig herself became a patient and was isolated with erysipelas, a
                    streptococcal infection with localized inflammation of skin and subcutaneous tissues, as well as
                    systemic symptoms. Her "very <hi rend="i">sore face</hi>" was treated with
                    "Continuous Mag. Sulp [magnesium sulphate] dressing heated on Sterno—Painful

                    ear, nose, and throat specialist said that she had not had erysipelas, but "Furunculosis of

                    patients being admitted. Mother's Day, Joan of Arc Day, and opening of the resort theater
                    by the Red Cross were all celebrated. Memorial Day was the most elaborate since two American
                    soldiers had been buried in the Contrexéville cemetery.</p>

            <p>After the German drive on the Marne in the spring of 1918, wounded of all nationalities arrived in
                    trainloads. The admitting corpsmen took them to the bathhouse, a convenient conversion of the spa,
                    and scraped off the mud from the trenches. Each patient was given a Red Cross bag for his personal
                    belongings, as well as pajamas, bathrobe, slippers, towel, and washcloth. Clothes were sent to a
                    sterilizer to get rid of germs and the ever-present lice. Wounds were redressed and x-rayed for
                    shrapnel, and surgery was done if necessary. Patients were either sent back to the lines or
                    transferred to convalescent hospitals, so that beds at the base hospital could be kept open for new
                    convoys. Many stories were written home of the confusion and humorous incidents that resulted from
                    dealing with multilingual patients and their unfamiliarity with American determination to disinfect
                    everything possible.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>In early June Base Hospital 32 received two convoys of French and English wounded. Most had gunshot
                    and shrapnel wounds, but some had been gassed or were shell-shocked. Essig's difficulty in
                    communicating with the French soldiers motivated her to resume studying French. She admitted:
                    "I am not an apt pupil."</p>
            <p>When evacuation hospitals in the area became filled early in June, the designation of Base Hospital
                    32 was changed to Evacuation, which meant that the wounded were received directly from the field
                    hospitals and the dressing stations at the front lines. On June 19 a list of nurses who were
                    "to be ready to leave on one hour's notice for service at the front" was
                    posted. Essig wrote: "I wish I might be on the list but I am not." On June 25 a
                    large convoy of wounded arrived, and the German prisoners were put on Essig's floor.</p>

            <p>As a result of the fighting around Château-Thierry in June of 1918, the number of
                    seriously wounded soldiers arriving directly from the front steadily increased, and some busy weeks
                    ensued. Many were evacuated after treatment, but many required surgery and intensive care before
                    being moved. On July 24 Essig wrote: <text>

            <p>September was quiet and cold. Essig relieved a night supervisor on leave and was in charge of the

                    Encephalitis was common, as was trench fever, a viral infection transmitted by lice, and trench foot
                    which brought pain, burning, redness, and then cyanosis of the feet and was caused by prolonged

            <p>The press of patients continued, with rumors of peace to encourage everyone. Near the end of October
                    Essig herself was feeling "rotten" but took quinine and aspirin, did not tell
                    anyone, and kept working. "I am not satisfied with any of the care we are able to
                    give—but everyone is doing his best and the patients are grand—Weather is cold
                    and rainy—" On November 10 she saw a soldier from home: "Frank
                    Anderson—an <placeName>

            <p>The Armistice ending the war was signed in November, but the work, the cold, the frozen pipes, and
                    the eight-flight climb continued. Sick and wounded from what was now called the Army of Occupation
                    kept the patient count steady. On December 6 the remaining forty patients were discharged, and the
                    floor prepared for closing. On December 8, 103 new patients were admitted. "None of the
                    patients is very sick but all had to have beds, pajamas, bath robes, towels, blankets and all had to
                    be fed—as usual they were straved [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]—I had one nurse to
                    help me—I did the ordering and dressed wounds as necessary." The cold, the rain,
                    and the mud also continued; but Christmas boxes arrived, and festivities of the season began. The
                    prisoners were still in residence. "The German patients—now on 2nd Floor had a
                    big celebration—Beautiful decorations—a créche and
                    everything—The[y] sang carols and seemed happier than anyone else!—The nurses
                    gave them Amer Cigarettes and they were delighted—"</p>
            <p>By the middle of January, 1919, all patients had been discharged, and another period of waiting, of
                    rumors, and of moving in bits and pieces began. On February 6, 1919, Essig wrote: "The
                    Hospitals have all been closed and equipment has been shipped. There are only the various details,
                    ie; coal, ashes, water and food to supply our needs—The days seem so very long

                        were refused military rank. Not until 1947, after World War II, was permanent commissioned

            <p>In the last decades of the nineteenth century American knowledge of and interest in Russia were
                    virtually nonexistent. Formal studies of Russian literature and history had not yet made their way
                    into the curricula of American colleges and universities, and American books and articles about
                    Russia were few.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> During these years, however, Russian expansionism and
                    increasing American involvement in world affairs gradually produced more information in books and
                    periodicals. Those who wrote about Russia in this period were generally not academics but were
                    instead individuals who either had come in direct contact with or who, for a variety of reasons, had
                    developed an interest in the country. George Kennan, well-known author, journalist, and lecturer,
                    was the foremost American authority on Russia although others such as Isabel F. Hapgood, Julian
                    Ralph, and Stephan Bonsai were also beginning to increase American awareness of Russia.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    only resulted in perceptive and widely read publications about the country but that also led to his
                    involvement in a number of causes which promoted freedom in Russia. This aspect of Foulke's
                    career, however, has been overshadowed by his lifelong dedication to civil service reform and the

                    their residence in Indiana. Foulke entered into a law partnership with Jesse P. Siddall, an attorney
                    for the Pan Handle Railroad Company.</p>

                    </placeName>, the Foulkes purchased three acres of land and an old brick house on the outskirts of
                    the city on <geogName>Linden Hill</geogName>. They subsequently constructed a large addition to the
                    original structure, and the Foulke home soon became one of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s landmarks. Over the years many distinguished guests were entertained there,
                    including Julia Ward Howe, Richard H. Dana, Felix Adler, Albert J. Beveridge, George W. Julian,
                    Lucian B. Swift, and David Starr <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>, the president of Indiana University. The Foulkes also played a prominent role in the
                    establishment of many of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s literary, musical, and artistic organizations. Foulke served on the board of
                    trustees of the Morrisson-Reeves Library and frequently delivered lectures on a variety of subjects
                    at Earlham College.</p>
            <p>For a while Foulke was also involved in state politics. In 1882 he was elected on the Republican
                    ticket to a term in the Indiana Senate where he championed such issues as equal rights for married
                    women, women's suffrage, and civil service reform. Foulke was one of the founders and the
                    first president of the Indiana Civil Service Reform Association and conducted a series of highly
                    publicized investigations into the management of the Indiana State Insane Hospital, where many
                    abuses were discovered.</p>
            <p>Foulke also achieved prominence in a number of progressive national organizations. In 1885 he joined
                    the National Civil Service Reform League, and in 1889–1890 he was the chairman of its
                    special committee investigating congressional patronage and the administration of the Patent Office,
                    Census Bureau, and the Post Office Department. It was during the course of these investigations that
                    a close friendship developed between Foulke and Theodore Roosevelt, which association led, in 1901,
                    to Foulke's appointment to the National Civil Service Commission on which he served until
                    1903. From the early 1880s Foulke also worked actively for the cause of women's suffrage,
                    serving as president of the American Woman Suffrage Association from 1885 to 1890. He was active, as
                    well, in the municipal reform movement and was president of the National Municipal League from 1910
                    to 1915. In 1915 he was an organizer of the League <pb n="[74]" id="VAA4025-082-1-080"/>

            <p>Exactly when Foulke's interest in Russia began to develop cannot be ascertained. His
                    autobiography contains little revealing information. Foulke only notes: "I became
                    interested in the history of Russia, especially in the events showing the encroachments of that
                    empire in the Balkan Peninsula, in Central Asia, and in the Far East."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    As early as 1883 frequent references to Russia were appearing in Foulke's speeches, and by
                    1887 Foulke was publishing lengthy letters to many newspapers on various aspects of Russian
                        civilization.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In the same year he published a history of Russia entitled
                        <hi rend="i">Slav or Saxon.</hi> It was intended, Foulke wrote later, to demonstrate
                    "what then seemed the menace of autocracy to free institutions."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The title of this study expressed Foulke's overriding concern—that a
                    struggle for supremacy in the world was developing between Russia and Great Britain, which conflict
                    would, unless major changes occurred, result in Russian global mastery and the imposition of Russian
                    despotism worldwide. According to Foulke, "No geographical nor ethnographical limits have
                    been broad enough to confine Russian ambition."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

               <p>Foulke's history of Russia was published in a very popular series dealing primarily with
                        public policy issues. It went through three editions by 1904.</p>
            </figure>
            <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-082-1-083"/>
            <p>Foulke had initiated his study of Russian history in order to understand the wellsprings of Russian
                    behavior. In <hi rend="i">Slav or Saxon</hi> he conceived of Russian history as a "backward
                    movement from freedom to autocracy."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The original pacific,
                    liberty-loving Slavic peoples of Russia had over the course of centuries been subordinated to the
                    military power of the tsars of Muscovy. Democratic institutions, in the process, had been ruthlessly
                    destroyed and all political power concentrated in the hands of the tsar. According to Foulke, the
                    result was the creation of a despotism that exercised absolute control over the people and denied
                    them their basic liberties. Because there was no significant internal opposition to the absolutism
                    of the Russian autocracy, Foulke believed that it could pursue an expansionist policy with a
                    determination and consistency denied parliamentary states. Russia's physical size also
                    contributed to its strength and served the aims of the government: "The fact that Russia,
                    as a whole can never be conquered gives her practical impunity, so long as her aim remains constant,
                    and the great mass of the people continue to be utterly subservient to the will of their
                        master."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only when the Russian masses were admitted to a share in the governance of the Russian state, Foulke
                    thought, would the expansionist policies be abandoned and the impending collision between Slav and
                    Saxon be avoided. To Foulke there was only one way to achieve this end: "The hope of coming
                    times lies in the overthrow of centralized despotism, in the establishment of civil liberty in
                    Russia, and in the substitution of industrial methods for its present military system."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Foulke believed that there was only one group in Russia capable of effecting
                    the necessary changes—the current generation of revolutionaries, sometimes known as
                    nihilists, who were struggling against the despotism of the tsarist system. The struggle for freedom
                    and constitutional government justified the extreme measures that they were forced to use to promote
                    a cause which, Foulke thought, Americans should support. Foulke reminded his readers: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The Russian revolutionist does not represent the lowest type of society in that Empire. It is
                            the men who are largely favored by the existing order of things who have espoused the cause
                            of the revolution, and they do it, not so much for themselves, as for the sake of the fifty
                            millions of poor ignorant peasants whose wrongs would otherwise remain without a voice. They
                            represent, like John Brown, that type of manhood which seeks by questionable means, not its
                            own advantage, but the liberation of oppressed humanity.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                    Russia. Despite the lack of a formal treaty, the traditional practice had been to permit the
                    extradition of common criminals but not of individuals accused of political
                    offenses—including the assassination of heads of state. However, as a wave of repression
                    mounted in Russia in the 1880s, increasing numbers of Russian revolutionaries fled to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and the Russian government then attempted to secure an extradition treaty in which
                    assassinations or attempted assassinations of heads of state or their families would be regarded as
                    nonpolitical crimes. The proposed 1887 treaty contained such a provision, and it became the focal
                    point of opposition. Article 3 of the treaty, which was first published by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">World</hi> on March 26, 1887, read: "The murder or manslaughter comprising the
                    willful or negligent killing of the sovereign or chief magistrate of the State or of any member of
                    his family, as well as an attempt to commit or participate in the said crimes, shall not be
                    considered an offense of a political character."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Opponents of the treaty used a variety of arguments against its ratification. Some objected to the
                    veil of secrecy that surrounded the ratification process in the Senate. Others emphasized the
                    radical departure from tradition and the one-sidedness of the treaty—only the Russian
                    government would probably avail itself of extradition, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would never derive any tangible benefit from it. All agreed that the treaty was just a
                    cunning Russian subterfuge to recover revolutionaries who had fled abroad; the Russian government
                    could too easily accuse a refugee of complicity in an imaginary plot, procure his extradition, try
                    him in secret proceedings, and then condemn him.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>Foulke played a leading role in the widespread public protest against the treaty. In opposing it he
                    drew upon his extensive knowledge of Russian conditions to add to the persuasiveness of his
                    arguments and translated his intellectual interests in Russia into political activism. Foulke was
                    opposed to the ratification of the treaty because it would legitimize the tsarist regime and would
                    doom those who were extradited to execution or Siberian exile since justice was not available in
                    Russian courts. In a letter to the editor of the <placeName>

                        despotism."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was the nature of the system that the treaty would legitimize? It was, according to Foulke,
                    "the last great despotism on earth, the only one which has withstood the glare of modern
                    civilization, which demands the aid of the foremost champion of liberty, in forging the more
                    securely the fetters which bind its slaves." It was a system in which education was stifled
                    and totally subservient to the demands of the state. It was a system in which ethnic minorities were
                    not permitted to study and use their own languages, in which there existed arbitrary censorship of
                    the press, and in which imprisonment without trial was commonplace. Foulke concluded that the treaty
                    was directed against the only "men in Russia who dare strike a blow for liberty."
                    Comparing Russia's revolutionaries to John Brown, Foulke claimed that they worked
                    unselfishly for the "elevation of an oppressed people" and that the ratification
                    of the treaty would transform the American people into the "slave hunters of
                        Muscovy."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    vote against ratification. He distributed copies of his own articles on Russia to senators, as well

                    secrecy which attended the deliberations of these tribunals, and the absence of adequate
                    representation for those accused. Individuals surrendered to the Russian government under this
                    treaty could not expect a fair hearing in Russian courts. Foulke then reminded the senators:

                    sympathizes with their methods or theories, but by a native American citizen, who is anxious that

                            freedom and self-government." Between 1891 and 1894 the society published an

            <p>No issue comparable to that of the extradition treaty emerged to arouse American public opinion

                    Russian Freedom, which had been organized in the early 1890s in response to Russian questions, faded
                    into inactivity. Foulke in this period was deeply involved in the civil service reform and
                    women's movements but nonetheless published two new editions of <hi rend="i">Slav or

            <p>Given the unpopularity and apparent weakness of the tsarist government as revealed by the inept
                    performance of Russia's military in the initial stages of the Russo-Japanese War, a number
                    of American intellectuals hoped to capitalize on anti-Russian sentiment to revive the organization
                    that had crusaded against the extradition treaty in the 1890s—the American Society of
                    Friends of Russian Freedom. Optimism ran higher than ever before that American public opinion could
                    be marshaled to promote the cause of freedom in Russia. By early 1904 the society had been
                    regenerated—largely through the efforts of Alice Stone Blackwell, a coeditor of the <placeName>

                    organization included many members of the original one—Kennan, Julia Ward Howe, Mark
                    Twain, Lyman Abbot, and William Lloyd Garrison, to name a few—but also attracted an
                    impressive group of new members from government, business, the settlement houses, and university
                    circles. Included were Jacob Schiff, Lillian D. Wald, Jane Addams, Helena Dudley, Oswald Villard,
                    William E. Walling, Arthur Bullard, the Reverend Minot J. Savage, and many others.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Foulke, who had just recently served as a Civil Service commissioner in the Theodore

            <p>The primary objective of the Friends of Russian Freedom was "to spread in the American Press
                    correct views and information as to the evil results of Russian autocracy, and to help reformers in
                    Russia in their efforts to bring about more modern and civilized conditions." The society,
                    which Foulke described as lacking a "definite organization" and acting
                    "as the occasion offered," at first functioned as a kind of news bureau,
                    translating articles on conditions in Russia from the Russian press and extracting articles from <hi rend="i">Free Russia</hi> that were then distributed to all members of Congress and to several

            <p>The Friends also sponsored occasional mass meetings to call attention to conditions in Russia and to

                    the Russian government's policies on minorities. Letters of support from Howe and others
                    were read to the assembly. Foulke, who as president of the Friends of Russian Freedom presided over
                    the meeting, recounted the tyrannies and imperialism that had characterized Russian history.
                    Resolutions were then adopted denouncing the tsarist government's treatment of the Finns
                    and religious persecution in the Russian Empire and urging the establishment of chapters of the

                    public support, money, and munitions. The Friends became directly involved in planning and
                    organizing the American tours of a number of these revolutionaries. Because of its social and
                    political prominence, as well as the nationwide connections of its members, the society assumed a

                        born in 1844 in Vitebsk Province. She began participating in revolutionary circles in the early
                        1870s and in 1874 took part in the "To the People" movement that attempted to
                        spark a peasant rebellion against the tsarist regime. She was subsequently arrested and tried
                        for treason in the famous "Trial of 193" in 1878. She was convicted and became
                        the first woman sentenced to hard labor in the Kara salt mines. She was not allowed to return to
                        European Russia from her Siberian exile until 1896, when she resumed her revolutionary career.
                        At the time of her American tour she was a leading member of the Socialist Revolutionary party
                        that was known primarily for its advocacy of political assassinations and violent peasant
                        uprisings as means of destroying the tsarist system. On her career see Alice Stone Blackwell,

            <p>Early in 1904 two Socialist revolutionaries billed simply as "Nikolaev and
                    Rosenbaum" thrilled American audiences with their accounts of political assassinations and
                    terrorism in Russia. Their success encouraged them to attempt to arrange a similar tour for
                    Breshkovskaia whose experiences in tsarist jails and in Siberian exile might generate additional
                    sympathy and financial support for their cause. Nikolaev approached the well-known anarchist Emma
                    Goldman with the suggestion that she contact Kennan and Lyman Abbot of the <hi rend="i">Outlook</hi>
                    to enlist the assistance of the Friends of Russian Freedom in sponsoring and organizing
                    Breshkovskaia's tour. Instead, Goldman requested the help of Alice Stone Blackwell with
                    whom she had corresponded since 1902. Goldman wrote to Blackwell about her efforts to establish
                    contact with the Friends and suggested a meeting with Nikolaev, who would provide detailed
                    information about conditions in Russia. Blackwell responded immediately to Goldman's
                    request, noting that she would soon be in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and that she would bring with her William Dudley Foulke, the president of the Friends
                    of Russian Freedom, to meet Nikolaev and Goldman. Goldman's true identity, however, would
                    be concealed from Foulke who would simply be informed that he would be meeting a "Miss
                        Smith."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miss Goldman later recalled the day of the meeting. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Before long, Alice Stone Blackwell arrived, and while we were having tea, there came a knock
                            at the door. I opened it to a short, stout man all out of breath after his climb of five
                            flights. "Are you Miss Smith?" he panted. "Yes," I
                            replied brazenly; "you are Mr. Foulke, aren't you? Please come
                            in." The good Rooseveltian Republican in Emma Goldman's flat at 210 East
                            Thirteenth Street, sipping tea and discussing ways and means to undermine the Russian
                            autocracy, would certainly have made a delicious story for the press.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> The discussions evidently went well. Both Foulke and Blackwell were apparently impressed by
                    Nikolaev's account of conditions in Russia because several weeks later Blackwell informed
                    Goldman that the Friends of Russian Freedom would do everything possible to bring Breshkovskaia
                    before the American public.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

                            is quite possible that Foulke did not learn of "Miss Smith's"

                    </placeName>'s famed Faneuil Hall on the evening of December 14, 1904. A boisterous
                    assembly of over three thousand crowded into all available space. Most were Russian, Polish, and
                    Jewish immigrants. Howe, the first speaker, made a plea for constitutional government in Russia. The
                    climax to the evening's proceedings, however, came when Foulke introduced Breshkovskaia.
                    Drawing upon his knowledge of Russian history, Foulke enumerated the misdeeds of the Russian
                    autocracy and, prophesying a brighter future for Russia, he struck the optimistic note that would
                    mark all of Breshkovskaia's appearances in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. "A new day is dawning for Russia, as it has dawned for the rest of the
                    civilized world. Even her errors and injustices hasten her deliverance." Of Breshkovskaia
                    he said: "it is not for us to teach her what true liberty means, it is for her to teach
                        us."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Breshkovskaia, speaking in Russian in a voice filled with emotion, addressed the throng.
                    Avoiding any mention of the political terrorism which was then rampant in Russia and with which she
                    could not have easily disassociated herself, she compared Russia to an immense prison in which
                    progressive Russians were confined; nonetheless, she tried to convince her audience that Russians
                    were ready for freedom and that the time of their deliverance was near. Her remarks, as well as her
                    appeal for financial support, were greeted by deafening applause and by cheers, waving
                    handkerchiefs, and hats thrown into the air. Foulke remarked that he had attended many political
                    gatherings but never one so enthusiastic; he judged Breshkovskaia's speech an
                    "unqualified success."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only one aspect of the Faneuil Hall meeting disturbed Foulke. Following Breshkovskaia's
                    speech, a number of other radicals addressed the crowd in heated speeches in Polish, Russian, and
                    Yiddish. Not being able to understand these speakers, Foulke suspected that statements were made
                    that evening that were "anarchistic and sanguinary" in nature. He also feared that
                    some of the funds collected might be used to "buy bombs and other missiles."<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Several years later Foulke, who was visiting Howe in her <placeName>

                    as no Russian before her had done. Everywhere she went enthusiastic crowds welcomed her. By the time

                    within a year of Breshkovskaia's visit, American interest in, as well as sympathy for, the
                    Russian revolutionary movement had dwindled considerably. The end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905
                    removed Russian issues from the headlines; and, then, Maxim Gorky's
                    "scandalous" behavior during an American visit in 1906 undid much of the goodwill
                    for Russian revolutionaries which Bresh-kovskaia had generated.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

                    European vacation that would take him to Russia where he would observe first-hand conditions about
                    which he had only read or heard from others. While he intended to visit some of the sites where
                    major events in Russian history had occurred, it is clear that he intended primarily to study the

            <p>Foulke's tour took him to four of the empire's principal
                    cities—Helsinki, St. Petersburg, Moscow, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Very little that he saw in any of these places tempted him to revise opinions he had
                    earlier expressed about the backwardness of social and economic conditions in the Russian Empire. In
                    St. Petersburg, the modern capital of Russia built in the eighteenth century by Peter the Great,
                    Foulke remained unimpressed by the many bridges, broad streets, and imposing buildings. Behind the
                    elaborate facades provided by the Winter Palace, the Admiralty, the Peter-Paul Fortress, and other
                    structures was a shabby city totally devoid of the "picturesqueness of age" and
                    concealing unimaginable human misery behind superficial splendor. "All these I saw and
                    wondered at the splendor of the great Autocracy which had won a sixth part of the whole world for
                    its empire, but could not win the content or happiness of its own subjects."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Russia's ancient capital, Moscow, was in many ways more interesting and
                    exotic. The contrasts in colors, architectural styles, types of peoples, and dress were much more
                    vivid than in cosmopolitan St. Petersburg. Yet, this center of "Holy Russia" with
                    its impressive Kremlin also evoked memories of the countless political assassinations and barbaric
                    cruelties that had plagued Russian history, and the poor in rags whom Foulke saw everywhere only
                    reminded him of the tremendous human cost of all the monuments around him.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

            <p>Foulke had traveled to Russia with the intention of procuring information on the political situation
                    from unofficial sources as well as from official ones. He carried with him letters of introduction
                    to various political opponents of the tsarist regime, letters the existence of which—if
                    known—might have caused the bearer difficulties with the authorities. Before leaving
                    Sweden Foulke had met with Count Carl Mannerheim, a Finnish patriot who had been banished from the
                    Russian Empire by Nicholas II and who was then living in exile in Stockholm.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>

                    letter to contact a professor of Sanskrit who had been a leader of a recent Finnish rebellion
                    against Russian rule. A long conversation ensued during which the professor recounted the history of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fi">Finland</country>
                    </placeName>'s relationship to Russia, culminating in the rebellion against Russian rule
                    that had won political concessions for the Finns. The professor, in turn, introduced Foulke to
                    another leader in the revolutionary movement who provided additional details of the rebellion and
                    who gave Foulke letters to a number of other revolutionaries in St. Petersburg.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after his arrival in the capital, Foulke presented one of these letters to an assistant
                    secretary of state for <placeName>
                        <country reg="fi">Finland</country>
                    </placeName>, who secretly supported the Finnish revolutionary movement. The oppressive atmosphere
                    of suspicion that Foulke had sensed from the moment of his arrival in the Russian Empire was
                    emphasized during the course of his interview with this official, which began in a government
                    office. Before any matters of substance could be discussed, the official interposed: "We do
                    not talk of such things here but if you come to my house tomorrow morning for breakfast I will
                    introduce you to some gentlemen who will give you the information you wish." Foulke agreed,
                    and he later conjectured that, because of the matters discussed at the meeting, the
                    participants—if the meeting had been discovered by the police—would have been
                    imprisoned or exiled to Siberia.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another meeting with the assistant secretary further evidenced the uncanny atmosphere in which Foulke
                    found himself. The two men were engaged in a conversation in a private room at the Hotel
                    d'Angleterre where Foulke was staying in St. Petersburg when a waiter entered the room. The
                    official immediately changed the subject of conversation and remarked after the waiter had left:
                    "They are all spies. Every word he hears will be reported." The assistant
                    secretary also arranged for Foulke to meet with General Karl Fredrik Langhoff, the head of the
                    Department of State for <placeName>
                        <country reg="fi">Finland</country>
                    </placeName>, and called for the American at the hotel prior to the meeting. As they were about to
                    leave, Foulke noted that his escort did not call for a carriage at the door of the hotel but rather
                    walked around the corner and selected a vehicle at random. Then they drove, not to the Department of
                    State, but to an adjoining street where they alighted from the carriage and went around a corner to
                    an adjacent building. They entered and went upstairs to a mirror on the first <list type="footnotes">

                    revolved to disclose a secret entrance to the Department of State next door. After going through
                    some rear passages, Foulke was finally ushered into General Langhoff s apartment. In the discussion
                    that followed, Langhoff assured Foulke that the constitutional rights of the Finnish people were
                    secure and that there was little likelihood of major trouble in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>No secrecy attended Foulke's visit to the imperial Duma, the national parliament established
                    for Russia following the Revolution of 1905. The American ambassador in St. Petersburg provided
                    Foulke with an embassy carriage with a coachman and a footman for the ride from the hotel to the
                    Tauride Palace where the Duma was in session. Upon arrival at the palace, liveried attendants
                    greeted the visitor with great respect and conducted him to the diplomatic gallery where he could
                    observe the proceedings. The gentleman from Indiana later recalled: "I tried to look
                    haughty and princely as I passed them but I am sure the effort was a failure."<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Foulke not only observed the proceedings of the Duma but also conversed with some of its members
                    about Russia's political future. One of the most memorable meetings occurred in the
                    corridors of the Duma when Foulke was introduced to Paul Miliukov, a noted historian and leader of
                    the Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) party. During their conversations Miliukov showed Foulke a
                    mark that had been placed in his hat—a circle with a cross within it, which was a sign
                    that Miliukov had been condemned to death by the ultraconservative terroristic organization known as
                    the "Black Hundreds." When Foulke told Miliukov that he had spoken at a Faneuil
                    Hall meeting in honor of Breshkovskaia, the Russian remarked that he had been in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> at the time but would not have dared attend the meeting because, had he done so, he
                    would have been denied reentry into Russia. Then Miliukov underscored the fact that Foulke himself
                    was taking some personal risk in traveling in Russia, reminding him that if the authorities knew of
                    his role in the Faneuil Hall meeting he would probably be immediately expelled from the country.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

                    was still far from perfect. Liberal opponents of the tsarist regime, like Miliukov, lived in daily
                    fear for their lives, and the acts of political terrorism that were reported every day in the press
                    dismayed Foulke. Distrust, he observed, pervaded every aspect of Russian life and society, and the
                    administrative tyrannies of the Russian government continued unabated. Arbitrary censorship was the
                    rule. The judicial system was subject to many abuses. The tsar's powers—despite
                    the political changes brought about by the Revolution of 1905—remained unimpaired, and
                    the powers of the imperial Duma were slight. Moreover, political parties in that body were numerous
                    and polarized between the political right and the political left, creating a situation that might
                    lead to parliamentary inaction.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

            <p>Despite these problems and the everyday violence and suffering that he observed and that he believed
                    would exist for some time to come, Foulke concluded his journey with a conditional—but
                    optimistic—outlook for Russia's future. Foulke had lent his support to Russian
                    revolutionaries in the past because they had no legitimate means to effect change, and he had been
                    able to understand the desperation that forced them to adopt extreme measures although he did not
                    approve of their methods.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> As a result of his experiences in the Russian
                    Empire, he was convinced that the seeds of democracy had finally been planted on Russian soil and

                            spring of 1908 before she had had the opportunity to speak. Foulke severely criticized the
                            actions of the police and defended Goldman's right to address fellow citizens on
                            any subject. "The principles of anarchy which she represents are held by us in
                            supreme abhorrence. It seems ridiculous even to dream that orderly society can exist without
                            organized government, and when it is proposed to overthrow such government by assassination,
                            the crime we most detest, the proposal naturally arouses our execration." Then
                            Foulke referred to his recent Russian trip and drew a lesson for Americans: "I
                            could not refrain from contrasting these terrible alternatives with the happy condition of
                            our own country, where men could speak and write and convince their fellow-citizens and
                            finally secure relief by law. But the moment the police can say, ‘this man or
                            this woman shall not speak,’ the government to that extent is actually
                            Russianized. Then for the first time can the anarchist truly cry upon the heels of his
                            assassinations, ‘I had no other remedy.’ Then for the first time the
                            sympathy of really patriotic Americans will be accorded even to such as Emma Goldman, if her
                            lips are closed by arbitrary power." See also Richard Drinnon, <hi rend="i">Rebel

            <p>From the time that Foulke had begun writing on Russia in the 1880s he had expressed a belief in the
                    ability of the press and public opinion abroad to promote the cause of freedom in that country.
                    Although his direct involvement in Russian causes was sporadic, Foulke did not waver in his
                    conviction that improving the level of public understanding and arousing public opinion about
                    conditions in the empire ultimately served that end. By keeping hostile opinion trained on Russia
                    through petitions, mass meetings, and condemnations of the tsarist regime in the press,
                    Foulke—like many progressives—believed that concerned Americans could at the
                    very least provide encouragement to those Russians who were committed to democratic principles.
                    Foulke was aware enough of the complexities of Russian social and political conditions and of the
                    difficulties in sustaining American interest in Russian issues to realize that the outcome of the
                    momentous struggles that were occurring in Russia would, in the final analysis, be determined by
                    Russians themselves. Nevertheless, it did appear in the decade following the Revolution of 1905 that
                    there was slow, steady progress toward the establishment of a constitutional regime.</p>
            <p>Peaceful progress toward that goal, however, was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in 1914.
                    The fighting imposed tremendous stresses and strains on Russian society, brought all the anarchistic
                    forces in Russia to the fore, and ultimately produced the overthrow of the tsarist regime. The war
                    revealed the fragility of Russia's political and economic system and the country's
                    military ill-preparedness when it came to a protracted conflict. Popular disenchantment with the war

                    to the first of two revolutions in that year. During the course of the March Revolution, Nicholas II
                    was forced to abdicate; political power then devolved into the hands of a number of liberal Duma
                    politicians organized into a Provisional Government. The political program enunciated by the new
                    regime promised national elections to a Constituent Assembly that would determine Russia's
                    political future.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the time of the March Revolution, Foulke was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
                    League to Enforce Peace that had been established in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1915. Although taken by surprise by the swiftness of the March events, Foulke
                    responded to them for two reasons. The revolution's goal was the establishment of free
                    government in Russia—something for which he had been striving his entire life. Further,
                    the revolution made it possible to transform the conflict in which the world was still involved into
                    a democratic crusade. Ever since the outbreak of World War I the "unnatural
                    alliance" of autocratic Russia and the western democracies had troubled Foulke.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> The overthrow of the tsarist system changed the struggle into a
                    "great contest between democracy and military tyranny" and qualified Russia for
                    membership in a League of Honor.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Disillusionment soon followed. A second revolution in November led eventually to the establishment of
                    a communist regime in Russia. Foulke was outraged by this turn of events and later reflected that
                    the "real Russian revolution for the purpose of acquiring a free government" had
                    been perverted by "crazy Bolshevism."<hi rend="sup">64</hi> The November
                    Revolution also changed the character of the Muscovite menace against which he had been writing
                    since the 1880s, and in that section of his autobiography entitled "Retrospect" he
                    reflected: "today the greatest danger in that quarter is from the propagation of the
                    communist doctrines so suddenly adopted."<hi rend="sup">65</hi>

                    primarily to writing, although, until ill health forced his complete retirement, he was a frequent

                    </placeName> civic and literary groups. In 1928 Earlham College, at its eighty-first commencement,
                    recognized Foulke's life of service by conferring on him the honorary degree Doctor of
                    Laws. In his commencement address Foulke elaborated upon the theme that had concluded his
                    autobiography and that in a sense summed up his life. Entitled "The Golden Mean,"
                    it called attention to the advantages to be enjoyed from following a temperate course in life and to
                    some of the disadvantages to be found in radical stands.</p>
            <p>In his speech Foulke addressed himself to a number of concerns, but he primarily directed his remarks
                    to politics where moderation, he felt, should be the rule. "The man who would upset the
                    world and build it all anew and the man who would crystallize everything that now exists so that it
                    should last forever are equally wrong." Revealing that his opinion of the regime that had
                    come to power in Russia in November, 1917, had not changed, Foulke pointed to the Soviet government
                    as the most conspicuous example of radicalism in the world. Russia had rejected the possibility of
                    gradually reforming its old institutions in favor of a radical reorganization of society, which had
                    produced a despotism worse than that it had replaced. "The government of the Czar was the
                    most infamous in modern time, but instead of reform proceeding step by step, leading to the
                    evolution of constitutional liberty as in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the old institutions were destroyed at once and the new tyranny of the proletariat,
                    with its hundreds of thousands of judicial murders for opinions sake, was worse than the despotism
                    it supplanted."<hi rend="sup">66</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this, his last major public statement on conditions in Russia, Foulke intended to caution
                    Americans against believing that their governmental institutions were permanently fixed or that they
                    should be radically altered. Either course, he thought, was fraught with dire consequences and
                    threatened liberty. The history of Russia revealed to him the perils of extremism and how
                    precious—and fragile—were the freedoms that Americans enjoyed.</p>

            <p>Historians of Indiana or state legislatures will be pleased by the publication of this volume. The
                    "Introduction" and "Key to Sources" reveal careful planning and
                    prodigious research. The procedures for acquiring information and reconciling conflicting data are
                    sound and improved over those in volume 1. (To confirm this impression of comprehensiveness and
                    reliability, I compared my own, arduously collected data on Indiana legislators,
                    1900–1920, with data from this volume: in a few cases my collection was more complete, in
                    slightly more instances the <hi rend="i">Directory</hi> was better, and in most cases our
                    information was identical.) This work is also more useful than volume 1 especially concerning
                    occupational data: both volumes list all the occupations a legislator ever held, but this volume
                    indicates clearly an individual's occupation at the time of legislative service.</p>
            <p>Any data collection project faces hard choices about what information to seek and how to record it.
                    The editors of this volume included demographic characteristics, economic and social interests,
                    political activity, and military service; and most recording decisions were straightforward.
                    However, some choices deserve comment. The only information about legislators' parents is
                    the vague category of "Ancestry." Thus, any study of family influences on
                    political careers will require additional research (aided, however, by good source references in the
                        <hi rend="i">Directory</hi>). Involvement in political parties is sometimes mentioned, but since
                    printed party records were not checked, the information is incomplete. One must be cautious,
                    therefore, about using this volume to evaluate the importance of party involvement in political
                    careers or to estimate the general significance of parties. Students of legislative turnover or
                    political careers will be disappointed that although the <hi rend="i">Directory</hi> notes some
                    electoral defeats, it omits the most important—those which terminated legislative
                    service. The most questionable decision was to record memberships in voluntary associations without
                    identifying when <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-082-1-104"/> they were acquired. Although determining this
                    involves a painstaking evaluation of sources, it is simply erroneous to assume that all memberships
                    listed were held at the time of legislative service. While still useful for end-of-career
                    assessments, these data are not reliable for evaluating legislative recruitment.</p>
            <p>In the final analysis a directory is only as good as its basic conception. This volume was designed
                    to provide information about the life experiences of legislators and, to a certain extent, about
                    their political careers. In this regard it is largely successful although the editors could have
                    taken a broader approach—one more in keeping with the aims of the legislative history
                    project—that would also have advanced the study of legislative activities and structures.
                    If they had included information on various leadership positions, committee service, and reasons for
                    leaving the legislature, this good reference work would have been even better.</p>

            <p>Andrew Gulliford's <hi rend="i">America's Country Schools</hi> is an ode to the
                    200,000 one-room schools in operation at the beginning of the twentieth century when they enrolled
                    one half of the country's school children. As director of the Country School Legacy Project
                    sponsored by the Mountain Plains Library Association and funded by the National Endowment for the
                    Humanities, Gulliford with his staff searched the country for surviving one-room schoolhouses and
                    for country school culture. They began in the states served by the MPLA and continued throughout the
                    continental <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> collecting and inspiring school building restoration projects all over the country.</p>
            <p>It is the one-room schoolhouse itself, in all its forms, that is the protagonist of the
                    book—be it white frame with the Greek Revival features that were a civic metaphor or
                    constructed in the more vernacular log, sod, adobe, brick, or native stone. The strengths of this
                    handsome book lie in its source material and its plan of action. The more than four hundred
                    illustrations evoke a simpler era. The prescription for restoring decaying school buildings to be
                    used for living history programs, museums, and community centers is complete. An adaptive use of a
                    school by a bank in Norwalk, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, proved to be good business, Gulliford points out, as sentimental callers became bank
                    customers. A state-by-state listing of nearly one thousand restored one-room schools includes
                    buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
            <p>In the section, "Country School Legacy," Gulliford assesses the role of the
                    one-room school in American education. He reveals it to be "a powerful cultural
                    symbol" (p. 35) that was reflected even in such individual school names as Harmony, Apple
                    Pie, and Good Intent. The country school stood for progress, for as Gulliford states, "A
                    community with a school was a community with a future" (p. 160).</p>
            <p>Using oral histories, letters, diaries, reminiscences, and school textbooks as sources, Gulliford
                    describes school culture. He also examines realistically the role of country schools in assimilating
                    new Americans, pointing out that cultural assimilation was the goal and that little effort was made
                    to honor native cultures of immigrant families or of Native Americans.</p>
            <p>It is in defining the nature of the country school, however, that its true meaning must be sought. A
                    country school reaches <pb n="[102]" id="VAA4025-082-1-108"/>

               </figure> in every visitor an inner core that lies deeper than nostalgia. Why do these one-room
                    schools retain such universal appeal? At their best they served students with creative teaching that
                    utilized every possible community resource, perhaps best described by Julia Weber Gordon in <hi rend="i">My Country School Diary</hi> (1946). At their worst one-room schools were taught by
                    teachers who were still children and could do little more than emphasize rote learning. Surely no
                    one wants to return to the days when children were shoeless and serious diseases were passed via the
                    common dipper or when mathematics was arithmetic, science was nature identification, and social
                    studies virtually nonexistent.</p>
            <p>The one-room school represented a high tide of local control. The little school was one certainty
                    affirming that everyone would be rewarded for the hard work and honest values taught therein. As the
                    power of economic cycles and the forces of the world market <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-082-1-109"/>
                    brought doubts to the idea of progress, the psychic need for the country school to protect basic
                    cultural beliefs became a necessity. Populism, which sprang from the same roots as did the country
                    school, failed because it lacked a world view. It is no coincidence that the educational reform of
                    school consolidation followed the uncertainties brought on by economic depression and came at the
                    beginnings of world conflict. Upon entering a restored one-room school today, who is not comforted
                    by a momentary return to a belief that if you learn to read, write, spell, cipher, and, above all,
                    follow the precepts of the country school, you can regain control over your own future?</p>
            <p>Gulliford's celebration of the country school will be relished by readers for its
                    enthusiasm, charm, thoroughness, and inspiration.</p>

            <p>Taking as his prescript a quotation from Woodrow Wilson ("The history of a nation is only
                    the history of its villages written large."), Geoffrey Blodgett, a historian on the Oberlin
                    College faculty, has prepared a useful primer and personal guide to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> town and college more famous for its ideas—perfectionism, coeducation, and
                    racial equity—than for its buildings. In a series of brief but lively vignettes of some
                    130 structures built between 1837 and 1977, the author surveys the history of an important
                    midwestern environment, concentrating first on the experimental, avante garde, largely twentieth
                    century campus followed by, and in contrast to, the traditional, plain style, mostly nineteenth
                    century ambience of the village.</p>
            <p>Blodgett's verbal sketches are drawn with precision and wit. <hi rend="i">Fin-de-siècle</hi> eclecticism is characterized as "the grand march of the
                    stone elephants"; the International Style is dubbed "the age of Important
                    Architectural Statements." His real estate and neighborhood history is well grounded in
                    local census, income tax, and newspaper records. Only the miniscule (2" x 3"),
                    often dark, photographs that accompany the sketches disappoint the reader interested in comparing
                    verbal interpretation and visual evidence.</p>
            <p>In addition to being a compact architectural history, the book represents a personal and professional
                    odyssey of a kind experienced <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-082-1-110"/> by various American historians in
                    the past two decades. Blodgett, well known for his scholarship on the political culture of the
                    Gilded Age, notes that the upheavals of the 1960s strongly influenced his turning to social history.
                    He admits that he "found the homely stuff of local history and the solid stuff of
                    architectural history more and more alluring as an antidote to great leaders and great
                    thinkers" (p. xxi). Working from the premise that buildings are an important environmental
                    and social context in which people make many significant choices—about shelter, family,
                    money, self-worth—he has written a lively overview of not only famous architects such as
                    Cass Gilbert, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Robert Venturi who have practiced in Oberlin but also those
                    obscure builders who designed the numerous wood-frame, vernacular structures that still comprise the
                    built environment of a typical, small (8,500 population in 1980) midwestern town.</p>

            <p>In 1888 James Bryce's <hi rend="i">The American Commonwealth</hi> appeared. In two hefty
                    volumes Bryce essayed for Gilded Age America what Alexis de Tocqueville had achieved for the
                    Jacksonians. Although Bryce's work is little read today, two statements still echo: the
                    chapter titled "Why the best men do not go into politics" and the sentence
                    "There is no denying that the government of cities is the one conspicuous failure of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." Taken together the statements could stand, by consensus, as the epitaph of
                    Edward J. Kelly's fourteen years as mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The son of a Galway man and a German girl, the oldest of nine children, Kelly was more Studs Lonigan
                    than one of the "best men." A grammar school dropout, he "rushed the
                    growler," cut trees on canal banks for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Sanitary District, and played the hero's part—flattening a
                    faultfinding Republican supervisor—in the obligatory fistfight. Active in politics before
                    he could vote, Kelly, without formal training, rose to chief engineer of the Sanitary District in
                    1920. He was forty-four. A pluralist and a grafter who earned $151,000 in salary from
                    1919 to 1929, he admitted to a net income of $724,000 in those years. In 1933 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Mayor Anton Cermak was shot in Miami by an assassin <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-082-1-111"/> aiming at President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt. Kelly was the surprise
                    choice of the county chairman, the popular and self-effacing Patrick A. Nash, as Cermak's
                    successor. Thus was born the Kelly-Nash machine.</p>
            <p>From the start Kelly, "who boasted publicly of his own gambling prowess" (p. 105),
                    made it clear that he would not run the city to suit the "bluenoses." It was more
                    than that: the corrupt relationship between the machine and organized crime was both intimate and
                    systemic. Profits from vice and the rackets enriched aldermen and others and provided the machine
                    with many of the funds it used for electoral success. The author suggests that as mayor Kelly met a
                    higher standard. Cynics quipped that "Big Ed already had his" (p. 108) from his
                    years at the Sanitary District. Kickbacks, bribes, the circumvention of civil service requirements,
                    and attempts to misuse New Deal agencies were also part of the pattern. In addition,
                    Kelly's appointments to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Board of Education are legendary. Unprofessional, farcically incompetent, and venal,
                    the board constituted an insult to the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> just short of Caligula's to the Roman Senate.</p>
            <p>If this were all, Edward J. Kelly would deserve the oblivion into which time and journalists enamored
                    of Richard J. Daley have thrust him. Biles believes, however, that the Kelly administration is
                    important "in the history of American cities" and that "a healthy dose of
                    revisionism is in order" (p. 5). The author contends that Kelly was an able, forceful man
                    who led the rescue of the city's finances in the early 1930s. He understood, as no other
                    mayor did, the benefits that New Deal programs could bring to the city's infrastructure and
                    its unemployed. He was the architect of the organization that vanquished, in his day, the Republican
                    party in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He resolved the knotty public transportation question—in the
                    author's view perhaps his "supreme achievement" (p. 158). More than
                    anyone else, he made <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> the leader in war production and was a potent force in national affairs. Moreover,
                    Kelly was no demagogue, never traded in religious bigotry, and welcomed and abetted the shift of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s blacks to the Democratic party. He fought for the integration of schools and
                    public housing. Blacks voted overwhelmingly for both the New Deal and the Kelly-Nash machine but in
                    greater numbers for the latter. These were not mean accomplishments, administratively, politically,
                    or morally.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, turns her attention to the 1,660-mile shoreline and environs of <geogName>Lake
                        Michigan</geogName>. Of the five Great Lakes only <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> lies
                    totally in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Compared to the other lakes it ranks second in length and depth and third in size and
                    width. The <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> region, touching four states, is one of contrasts,
                    from the heavily populated and industrialized southern quarter to the sparsely settled stretches of
                    beach, flanked by national forests, in the northern section.</p>
            <p>To this diverse landscape the author brings an exacting and critical historical perspective that
                    ranks this work a cut above the usual tourist guide. The physiographic and historical setting is
                    detailed in fifteen opening chapters, which comprise a quarter of the book. They cover such topics
                    as the lake's origins and its exploration; the bitter and lengthy contests between nations
                    for control of the area; the growth of timber, iron ore, and fish industries; and the evolution of
                    settlements. Accompanying the survey of the region's rich heritage are copious
                    illustrations including six maps that convey such useful information as the location of Indian
                    tribes in 1600, the foreign-born population in 1890, and iron ore and coal transportation patterns
                    in 1935. With this solid introduction the author fulfills what is often an elusive goal of guidebook
                    writing: compelling the traveler to observe things in a serious and often new way.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the text is given over to describing 182 major sites, mostly communities, along with
                    subsets of attractions. The tour begins at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    larger cities. Guidebooks have to be selective in content; thus, the author lists other publications
                    to help persons explore beyond the described locations. The photographs, practically one per page,
                    many contemporary, are crisp and clear. The book's format, an uncommon square form, allows
                    for three wide columns of text and larger than usual graphics. The attractive layout, <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-082-1-113"/> ample background material, and lucid writing go into making <hi rend="i">Around the Shores of <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>

            <p>Every building has a story behind it, and Millett has used his skills and experience as a journalist
                    with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>
                    </placeName>

                    Farmers' Bank in Owatonna, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. The book's subtitle is almost misleading as Millett explains not only
                    Sullivan's role as architect but also the substantial contributions made by his
                    ornamentalist and his client in the designing of the building. Universally recognized as a landmark
                    in American architectural history, the Owatonna bank is a squat brick structure banded with unglazed
                    and green terra cotta decorative tiles and stylized cartouches in the florid style. The
                    building's major feature is the large elliptical arch with stained glass, which bathes the
                    banking room in a green hue.</p>
            <p>The principal characters in Millett's account are <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> architect Louis Sullivan (1856–1924); his chief draftsman and ornamentalist,
                    George Elmslie (1871–1952); and their client, banker Carl Bennett (1866–1941).
                    Combining architectural history, local history, and biography, Millett defines the roles of these
                    men and their relationship to one another in terms of the Owatonna bank, which became a milestone in
                    the lives of all three. The building was the first of a series of small-town banks designed by
                    Sullivan, the brilliant pioneer of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> School; the bank also marked the end of a twenty-year professional relationship between
                    Sullivan and Elmslie. Bennett, who had "dared to seek out a truly original design for his
                    new building" (p. 8), placed the small farming community of Owatonna on the beaten path of
                    architectural historians and students of the Sullivan style, but both he and the National
                    Farmers' Bank failed during the agricultural depression that followed World War I.</p>
            <p>Millett not only traces the sagging careers of Sullivan, Elmslie, and Bennett after the
                    bank's construction he also examines what happened to the building itself after
                    Bennett's departure. Succeeding owners executed a series of brutal and <pb n="108" id="VAA4025-082-1-114"/> unsympathetic remodelings beginning in 1940 when major features of the
                    Sullivan-Elmslie design were destroyed. Public pressure and an organized protest by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Society of Architects saved the bank from further damage in the 1956–1958
                    remodeling. Renewed interest in Sullivan's work developed during the centennial of his
                    birth in 1956, and the latest remodeling in 1982, though not a restoration, was more sympathetic
                    than previous efforts.</p>
            <p>Millett's <hi rend="i">Curve of the Arch</hi> should be an inspiration to both general and
                    architectural historians. The author's notes and bibliography reveal both his knowledge of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> School architectural history and his extensive use of local sources, including oral
                    interviews and newspaper accounts. Students of building technology will welcome Millett's
                    lengthy description of the terra cotta manufacturing process, and the ample biographical information
                    on each character illustrates the many contributions made by immigrants and sons of immigrants to
                    Americanart and architecture. The book is an entertaining history that reflects the
                    author's enthusiasm for the Owatonna bank building and his admiration and sympathy for the
                    people involved in its creation.</p>

            <p>This is a substantial study of an important group of German-American leaders in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> during the first two decades of the twentieth century. The author, a lawyer, was
                    originally interested in the trials of the leaders of the National German-American Alliance under
                    the Espionage Act of 1917. Expanding his focus in the book, he sees the founding of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s Alliance in 1904 as a reaction to the growing prohibition movement, and he
                    uses the Alliance's history to analyze both the contemporary cultural climate among
                    German-Americans as well as their influence on the politics of the state and country during the era
                    of World War I. He is particularly effective in presenting the world view of the small group of
                    leaders of the Alliance as they tried to use the widespread opposition to prohibition and then the
                    issue of American neutrality in World War I to pursue a losing fight against the decline of German
                    culture in America after the <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-082-1-115"/> great wave of German immigration
                    had subsided. Ironically, by the time the author returns to his original starting point of American
                    participation in the war, the Alliance has collapsed with hardly a push from governmental
                    authorities. Its significant history had taken place earlier, which is a cautionary note against the
                    common tendency to see the war as the decisive turning point in German-American history.</p>
            <p>The book has the virtue of raising important questions in the reader's mind, even if it does
                    not answer them. The leaders of the Alliance expended immense energies in trying to preserve German
                    culture. But what did it consist of, and how did its nature shape their political efforts to
                    preserve it? Clearly the culture as perceived by the leaders was not the same as that valued by
                    their distressingly passive followers, much less by the intensely religious Germans of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. Perhaps the nature of German culture, as valued by the highly educated, helps explain
                    why members of the German professional elite, and not German professional politicians, were so
                    prominent politically in this era. The nature and history of this elite in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> also begs for comparison to German leadership in earlier periods, such as the 1850s and
                    1860s, so that a larger picture of the political history of this ethnic group might come into focus.
                    Detjen's book is important enough to help provide a basis for such comparisons.</p>

            <p>In this book Peter S. Onuf explores the behavior and experience of states. His thesis is that
                    "the origins of American federalism are … to be found in the history of the
                    American state system" (p. xvii). To support his claim Onuf explores "American
                    concepts of statehood and union" as revealed in "Jurisdictional
                    conflicts" especially between <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>. He then considers "the connections between Jurisdictional issues and national
                    constitutional reform" (p. xvi).</p>
            <p>This argument places Onuf in strong contention with past scholarship. For Onuf the creation of the
                    American union cannot be located simply in the "interests and ambitions" of the
                    founding fathers (p. xvii). Likewise, republican ideology, especially as treated by Gordon Wood in
                    his <hi rend="i">The Creation of the American Republic, 1776–1787</hi> (1969), cannot
                    explain fully the development <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-082-1-116"/> of the new American republic.
                    Onuf believes that colonial fears of power encroaching upon liberty may explain the outbreak of the
                    American Revolution but not its conclusion.</p>
            <p>Onuf's work is careful, detailed, insightful, and particularly useful for students of state
                    history who are interested in the definition, development, and behavior of a state. For instance,
                    American states "did not act like true states" (p. 3) because their
                    sovereignty—especially control of territorial jurisdiction—was best secured by
                    increasing the powers of Congress. In short, "the states collectively guaranteed each
                    state's particular claims" (p. 321) even though such recognition also diminished a
                    state's theoretical independence. In addition, jurisdiction of a territory, as recognized
                    by other states, did not always coincide with the wishes of the governed in that territory.
                    Consequently, a Constitution protecting inhabitants increasingly seemed necessary as a means to
                    protect the states themselves and even to permit them to function as "political
                    communities" (p. 73).</p>
            <p>Onuf concludes his argument by explaining the "miracle" of the Constitution. In his
                    view "the Constitution would not have been possible without prior development of concepts
                    of statehood and union" (p. 209). In addition, a new union, in the Federalist vision, could
                    be "dynamic" in expanding through the creation of new states. Paradoxically, too,
                    the Constitution emerged in part out of sectional conflict because a division of larger states could
                    increase a section's voting power.</p>
            <p>Onuf's work is at its best in treating state adjudication problems and their resolution. He
                    thoughtfully examines an abundance of sources to infer the nature of political community both
                    between and within states. In contrast, he fails to show how states came to a recognition that
                    union, especially the Constitution, would serve sectional interests. The answer to that question
                    might explain much about the sectional sources of disunion only a few decades later.</p>

            <p>Both of these meticulously researched biographies make valuable contributions to the study of the
                    early history of the <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-082-1-117"/> Latter-Day Saints; they will command the
                    attention not only of professional historians but also of the many general readers, Mormon and
                    non-Mormon alike, who share an interest in the origins of Mormonism.</p>
            <p>Bushman leads the reader through only the first two thirds of Joseph Smith's short life, to
                    the publication of <hi rend="i">The Book of Mormon</hi> and the migration to Kirtland, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1831. He deliberately chooses "to relate events as the participants
                    themselves experienced them" (p. 3). The result is a Mormon "inner
                    history": the story of the gradually unfolding revelation of God's purpose for his
                    saints as it gave identity and meaning to the experiences of a believing community. As a twentieth
                    century member of that same community, Bushman is convinced that the story is also firmly grounded
                    in historical fact; thus, he is not afraid to turn it inside out and subject its factual basis to
                    the judgment of professional historians.</p>
            <p>Such an approach inevitably directs attention to Smith's role as a conduit for divine
                    revelation. Bushman rejects "environmental" explanations, which account for
                    Smith's visions, revelations, and translations as products of the culture in which they
                    arose. He demonstrates how Smith grew up shaped by a "family culture" that owed
                    little to organized religion, more to Enlightenment scepticism, and a great deal to the yearnings of
                    common farmers for "contact with powers beyond this world" (p. 79). These
                    yearnings led not only to visions but also to experiments with magic, particularly hunting for
                    buried treasure with the use of "seerstones." But Smith "outgrew his
                    culture" (p. 7) after a series of angelic revelations taught him to see the demonic
                    character of magical treasure hunting; the same revelations bestowed upon him the divine gifts that
                    would enable him to satisfy his neighbors' need for immediate manifestations of divine
                    power.</p>
            <p>Only this ability, argues Bushman, can account for the remarkable growth of the Latter-Day Saints.
                    Smith succeeded in bringing upstate New Yorkers into contact with the world of the Old Testament
                    prophets and patriarchs, a wondrous world where miracles could happen at any time. The excitement
                    that Jesus' own disciples felt when Jesus fed the multitude with five loaves and two
                    fishes—"the same power that fed our forefathers in the wilderness is among us
                    today"—gripped those who responded to Joseph the prophet.</p>
            <p>It is useful to have the case for the historicity of the Mormon story stated so persuasively by such
                    a distinguished historian. Even while respecting the validity of Bushman's approach,
                    however, this reviewer is left with unanswered questions. Had Smith completely outgrown the culture
                    of magic by the time of <pb n="112" id="VAA4025-082-1-118"/> the publication of <hi rend="i">The
                        Book of Mormon?</hi> He made a treasure-hunting trip to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, in 1836
                    and spoke approvingly of seerstones as late as 1841. Cannot more be said about the complex process
                    by which Smith received and interpreted revelation? From the beginning critics and followers alike
                    were struck with how he would hold divine messages in his head for long periods of time before
                    making them public at opportune moments. Bushman's interpretive options—the
                    relevations must either be fraudulent or valid exactly as claimed—are too narrow. How
                    much did Smith's own remarkable personality shape the character of the messages that he
                    received? The question cries out for a comparative study of revelatory phenomena along the lines
                    suggested by Lawrence Foster in <hi rend="i">Religion and Sexuality: The Shakers, the Mormons, and
                        the Oneida Community</hi> (1981).</p>
            <p>Newell and Avery hope to avoid pitfalls of historical method by simply allowing the evidence to speak
                    for itself; they propose "to frankly state events as they occurred, in full consideration
                    of all related circumstances" (p. vii). Drawing upon every surviving source, they tell the
                    remarkable story of Emma Hale from her birth in Harmony, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, to her death in Nauvoo, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, including not only her marriage to Joseph Smith but also her subsequent
                    thirty-two-year marriage to the non-Mormon Lewis Bidamon. Since most of the sources that they follow
                    are Mormon, their account generally takes for granted the supernatural character of Smith's
                    divine messages—a remarkably innocent approach given the challenges of interpreting this
                    material.</p>
            <p>The book's most important contribution is its detailed account of Emma's reaction
                    to her husband's revelation and gradual implementation of the doctrine of plural marriage.
                    Smith conventionally used code words to keep knowledge of his polygamous practices (which began in
                    the mid–1830s) secret from the public, and it was not until 1843 that he shared the
                    revelation with his own wife. Newell and Avery convey Emma's sense of outrage and betrayal.
                    Even in his most contrite moments Smith never revealed to Emma the full extent of his polygamous
                    attachments. Since several of his plural wives were among Emma's closest friends, they,
                    too, had to share in the duplicity and betrayal. Only after a revelation forced her to choose
                    between submission and destruction did Emma grudgingly accept polygamy, but she soon repented of her
                    acquiescence. Her relations with Smith became so strained that she threatened to divorce him; he in
                    turn suspected her of poisoning him. Through Emma's <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-082-1-119"/>
                    eyes we see a far more fallible Joseph Smith and sense the tension that gripped the prophet in his
                    own country.</p>

            <p>The name Horatio Alger readily evokes images of the rags-to-riches story in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> culture. The substance of Alger's fictional heroes and Alger's own
                    life up to now have been clouded by myth, distortion, and deliberate falsification. The historian
                    will have an easier time in understanding Alger's work and life after reading this
                    biography by Gary Scharnhorst and Jack Bales.</p>
            <p>For the most part Alger led an uneventful life (1832–1899) as a writer of fiction and
                    poetry. Even so, his biographical record was all but systematically destroyed by himself and his
                    family. In his thirties, while employed as a Unitarian minister in Brewster, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, there was public outcry over Alger's acts of pedophilia with young boys in
                    his parish. Alger's father and the Unitarian church joined forces to limit the extent of
                    public exposure in order to protect the reputations of both family and church by an agreement that
                    Alger would never again use his clerical title or take a post as pastor. The authors claim that
                    Alger atoned for his perfidy all his life by working on behalf of homeless children and street
                    urchins through the Children's Aid Society and the Newsboys' Lodging House as well
                    as depicting the hard lot of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> "street Arabs" in his fiction.</p>
            <p>As they unfold an interesting story, the authors nonetheless treat the ambiguities in
                    Alger's life very gingerly. They are energetic, however, in their denouncement of those
                    historians and journalists who continue to cite a spurious life of Alger written in 1928 by Herbert
                    R. Mayes and later admitted to be a hoax based on fabricated sources. They demonstrate that
                    twentieth century scholars have made no effort to consult the purported sources and simply relied on
                    Mayes's "interpretation" of them. The authors, by rigorous research,
                    provide a useful introduction to students of the falsehoods that can masquerade as the art and craft
                    of history.</p>
            <p>There are several psychological questions that remain unresolved. For example, between 1869 and 1879
                    the financier Joseph Seligman employed Alger to tutor his five sons. Between 1872 and 1878 Alger
                    also contributed serials to <hi rend="i">Young <placeName>
                            <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> that included the publication of the first three Luck and Pluck <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-082-1-120"/> stories. After Seligman's death Alger in the 1880s peppered
                    his fiction with anti-Semitic stereotypes. By 1883, however, he was employed as tutor to Albert
                    Cardozo's children and tutored in other prominent Jewish households as well. These
                    contradictions are not adequately analyzed by the authors.</p>
            <p>Scharnhorst's book reveals a sadness no less than irony in Alger's third-rate
                    career as a writer. Twentieth century critics who point to his popularity in the nineteen century
                    and his post-World War II revival as a defender of capitalism misunderstand his ethic and are
                    unaware of the unfavorable reviews and the condemnation of his themes and literary style by the
                    1880s when some libraries banned his books. Historians have also inflated his gross sales. <hi rend="i">Ragged Dick</hi> (1868) was his only best-seller. Alger never did achieve the success
                    he hungered for among adult readers.</p>
            <p>The authors offer a perceptive "Afterword" on the abridged reissues of
                    Alger's novels, between 1899 and 1920, that turned upside down the original moral thrust of
                    the books. After 1920 Alger was canonized as a "success Mythmaker" (p. 152),
                    although his books fell into obscurity. In sum, this book is a fine piece of scholarship and
                    presents a useful case study and reminder to all who read and write history about past failures in
                    historical method.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $27.95.)</head>
            <p>In this brief but stimulating study of the role of reading among Civil War soldiers, David Kaser sees
                    the war as a watershed in the history of reading and the history of leisure in America. To Kaser,
                    the Civil War not only brought about a significant change in what, why, and how Americans read but
                    it also altered dramatically the nature and character of certain American institutions, especially
                    public libraries and the publishing industry.</p>
            <p>Though by the middle of the nineteenth century America had a high literacy rate and a plentiful
                    supply of reading matter, it still lacked, according to Kaser, one major commodity necessary for
                    large-scale readership, namely, leisure time. Long hours on the job and a Christian ethic that
                    regarded large blocks <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-082-1-121"/> of discretionary time as spiritually
                    dangerous discouraged all but "serious" reading.</p>
            <p>The Civil War changed all this. It provided millions of American soldiers on both sides with the time
                    to read. Like their counterparts in wars before and after, Civil War soliders spent considerably
                    more time in camp than in battle. Reading, therefore, became a principal means to combat the endless
                    hours of idleness, rivalling even card playing as the soldier's favorite diversion. Kaser
                    wisely avoids speculating as to which activity dominated the other, however.</p>
            <p>Soldiers pursued four kinds of reading: purposeful reading, religious reading, reading of newspapers
                    and magazines, and reading for escape. Kaser examines each of these. The first included good
                    literature, as well as vocational, professional, and military publications. Shakespeare, apparently,
                    was popular even among the rank and file. Religious reading included more than Bibles and
                    Testaments, and Christian organizations, especially the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Christian Commission, developed impressive and successful ways to deliver reading
                    matter to soldiers. By 1864 the commission alone was responsible for distributing 570,000 Bibles and
                    Testaments, 490,000 hymnals, 8,346,000 religious papers and magazines, more than 13,600,000 pages of
                    tracts, and some 4,326,000 other volumes. Kaser does not disguise his admiration for the work of
                    this organization, and little wonder!</p>
            <p>Newspapers and magazines, however, provided the chief source of reading matter for Civil War
                    soldiers. While the latter were more likely to be read by the better educated, the former were
                    devoured by all. In 1863 the Union Army negotiated a franchise with a news agency to deliver
                    newspapers to the troops for a nickel apiece. Kaser considers this action perhaps the single most
                    important measure taken by the military to improve the opportunity for soldiers to read. Newspapers
                    were so popular and in such great demand that the practice of swapping newspapers even with the
                    enemy was almost universal. Then as now controversy surfaced regarding the freedom of the press to
                    report troop movements and other military intelligences that could give the enemy some tactical
                    advantage.</p>
            <p>Reading for entertainment signaled the most abrupt change with antebellum reading practices. Despite
                    the best efforts of chaplains and some officers, soldiers gobbled up publisher James
                    Redpath's <hi rend="i">Books for the Camp Fires</hi> and Beadle Brothers dime novels. These
                    and other cheap novels provided soldiers many hours of relief from the boredom of camp and prison
                    life.</p>

            <p>The increase in reading gave impetus to the growth of libraries for soldiers. Libraries and reading
                    rooms were established in hospitals, in many rear echelon areas, and even in some camps. Most, notes
                    Kaser, were sponsored by religious groups, and their contents, not surprisingly, seldom reflected
                    the expanded interests of the soliders. Nevertheless, they did provide a great service to the
                    troops, and following the war the army proved "much more hospitable to having post and
                    garrison libraries for the use of troops than it had been earlier" (p. 122).</p>
            <p>The Civil War also had a dramatic impact on the public library movement. Following the conflict new
                    tax-supported and often free public libraries sprang up in unprecedented numbers. The war affected
                    the nature of these libraries and the character of their collections. The increased interest in
                    reading also provided a tremendous boost to the publishing industry, which enjoyed great prosperity
                    during and following the war. Time to read, asserts Kaser, "was a principal cause of this
                    prosperity" (p. 97).</p>
            <p>The story of reading and libraries in the Civil War was not an altogether uplifting one. Kaser
                    briefly touches upon the "wanton and thoughtless wholesale destruction of books and
                    libraries, private or public … during the war (p. 89). Sherman's march to the
                    sea took a particularly heavy toll on libraries. At one plantation in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Audubon plates were used for kindling fires. But despite this darker side of the
                    history of books and libraries in the Civil War, the picture that emerges from Kaser's
                    study is on the whole a very bright one.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to find serious fault with this book, except for its price. At $27.95 it
                    is unlikely to end up on many private library shelves, and this is a pity. Civil War buffs, however,
                    may want to dig deep. This is different from the usual Civil War fare and may prompt further
                    research and interest in a number of areas touched upon by Kaser. It is well written, contains some
                    interesting illustrations, and provides an excellent bibliography. Kaser also makes a number of
                    references to Indiana soldiers and regiments. The book is delightful, and if readers cannot afford
                    it, they should make sure that their library orders a copy.</p>

            <p>Anne M. Butler's history of western prostitution is a provocative and sensible book that
                    undermines the old folktales about <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-082-1-123"/> whores with hearts of gold
                    and newer ones that portray prostitutes as liberated feminists. To be sure, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> demonstrates that economic exchange was the heart of the matter, but few prostitutes
                    were able to do more than eke out a precarious and dangerous living. Most were poor young women who
                    frequently found themselves at the mercy of their customers, the law, and each other.</p>
            <p>Prostitutes worked in a variety of settings in the West. Some worked in the sumptuous sporting houses
                    that were the hallmarks of large urban centers. Many more operated out of squalid one-room cribs on
                    back alleys, in the infamous "hog ranches" near military posts, and cigar-store
                    fronts that provided a thin patina of legitimacy in many western towns. A few worked quietly out of
                    their homes, perhaps only as economic necessity dictated. (The book reminded me that a few years ago
                    I inadvertently nominated a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sacramento</settlement>
                    </placeName> brothel to the National Register of Historic Places. In one of its nineteenth century
                    incarnations the Comstock building had been called "The Young Ladies Segar
                    Company" which I naively thought was operated by a gentleman and his several daughters.)</p>
            <p>Some courtesans married to get out of the whoring trade, but <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> shows that many women continued to work after marriage usually with the consent of
                    their husbands, who were often professional criminals. These marriages, it is not surprising, were
                    unstable and marred by strife and violence. Many prostitutes' daughters, instead of being
                    raised in exclusive eastern boarding schools, blissfully ignorant of their mothers'
                    professions, became full-fledged professionals by their mid-teens. Family life did not end the high
                    life in Victorian America.</p>
            <p>Prostitutes had an ambivalent relationship with officers of the law. Even though it was illegal,
                    prostitution flourished with the knowledge and occasional assistance of duly constituted
                    authorities. Indeed, police patrolled the red-light districts to control violence and skim
                    protection money from its denizens. Courts accepted prostitutes' testimony without qualms,
                    and brothel inmates sought legal redress in civil and criminal actions. While prostitutes'
                    testimony and complaints were heard in court, prostitutes received very little protection under the
                    law, especially from crimes of violence. Beatings and murders of these women were often regarded as
                    trivial—sometimes even humorous—by respectable citizens who thought that
                    whores merely received their just desserts for straying from the path of virtue. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> argues, nevertheless, that prostitution helped to establish authority on the frontier
                    because prostitutes provided a ubiquitous and visible criminal class that could be easily
                    prosecuted. Rustlers and <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-082-1-124"/> highwaymen might escape over the next
                    mountain, but a local madam and her girls could always be hauled into court, fined, jailed, and run
                    out of town thus giving palpable and frequent demonstrations that the law was powerful.</p>
            <p>Prostitution was a common feature of western military life; yet, ambivalence characterized the
                    relationship of the institution with military authority. The army officially outlawed the flesh
                    trade, but every post had its nearby hog ranch, a complement of laundresses, camp followers, or
                    impoverished Indian women to cater to the soldiers' sexual wants. Commanding officers
                    recognized that prostitution provided a mechanism to keep the sexual tensions of frontier garrison
                    life from threatening officers' wives and daughters, and it was not unusual for them to
                    transport, house, and feed prostitutes at government expense.</p>
            <p>Butler has provided a lively, well-written, and admirably researched history of prostitution that
                    uncovers the squalor and misery of these western women while showing the curious relationship that
                    prostitutes had with frontier authority and Victorian society. The author dedicated her book to her
                    respected mentor, the late Walter Rundell, and it is a fitting tribute.</p>

            <p>Professor William R. Brock offers a significant reassessment of the period from 1865 to 1900 in
                    American history. He rejects the phrase "gilded age" as "a meretricious
                    label that has done much to obscure the true character of a period to which we owe so much"
                    (p. vii), and he questions the reality of the American belief in laissez-faire during this era.
                    Instead, he finds a period characterized by vigorous intervention by agencies at the state level.
                    Focusing his attention on the boards of state charities, boards of public health, bureaus of labor
                    statistics, and railroad commissions, Brock concludes that these agencies considerably promoted the
                    cause of activism, investigation, and regulation. The result was an advancement in public
                    responsibility that included such areas as railroad regulation, inspection of factories and mines,
                    and laws on pure food, liquor, and sanitation.</p>
            <p>Brock has relied very heavily on the published annual and biennial reports of the various state
                    agencies. His findings establish <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-082-1-125"/> a record of effectiveness.
                    This record was, admittedly, uneven across the nation, but it established a trend that was clear.
                    Central to this effectiveness were the officials themselves—the inspectors,
                    statisticians, analysts, scientists, engineers, superintendents, and experts. If Brock has not
                    rediscovered "the best men," he has certainly celebrated a new breed of good men
                    who took the initiative to investigate and regulate the social environment. In doing so they
                    provided the practical experience that was necessary for the federal government to build upon.</p>
            <p>Some of Brock's findings are worthy of further consideration. Did the development of social
                    policy have little to do with political party? Were courts more cooperative than previously thought
                    in giving support to use of the police power? And one would like to know more about the public that
                    the author tends to ignore. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> Board of Public Health, for instance, was organized in 1873 "largely as a
                    consequence of pressure from Dr. Ira H. Bartholomew, who won election to the legislature to promote
                    these objectives. His cause was aided by public alarm over the sale of unregulated and impure
                    illuminating oil which had caused several explosions and fires" (p. 123). Were perhaps some
                    of Brock's enlightened liberals responding to an increasingly demanding public? In spite of
                    these questions <hi rend="i">Investigation and Responsibility</hi> is clearly presented, well

                    selected bibliography, index. $30.00.)</head>
            <p>Dumenil presents a tightly controlled examination of Masonry over a period of fifty years spanning
                    the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the book therefore arrives in some respects as an
                    interrupted but enlarged sequel to Dorothy Lipson's <hi rend="i">Freemasonry in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                        </placeName>, 1789–1835</hi> (1977). After a brief account of Masonry in American
                    life immediately prior to and after the Civil War, Dumenil organizes the study under two major
                    headings—Masonry in the nineteenth century and Masonry in the 1920s. The first part
                    concentrates on the religious features of Masonry by identifying its mythic elements, its ritual
                    practices, its communal aspects, its fraternal moral codices, and its vague, but nonetheless
                    discernibly Protestant, theological assumptions. In this form, as an "asylum" from
                    and within a culture beset by the new problems of industrialization, urbanization, and religious <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-082-1-126"/> and social pluralism, the Masonic Lodge presented white,
                    middle-class men with a preserve for the traditional values of sobriety, respectability, prudence,
                    honesty, and industry that, even in Victorian America, they feared were disappearing. In the second
                    part, with a focus on the watershed decade of the 1920s, Dumenil examines the accommodations of
                    Masonry to the modern temper, with particular attention to its new senses of nationalism, to
                    erosions of its ritualistic character, and to its increasingly civic and social emphases. Moving
                    from enclave into the cultural mainstream and in the process changing from
                    "temple" to "club," Dumenil points out, Masonry insured its
                    temporary life in its new secular formations but surrendered some of that exclusive identity and
                    distinctive character that had made it a powerful and respected organization in the years before
                    World War I.</p>
            <p>Produced from the author's doctoral dissertation, this clean and well-ordered book is both
                    generally accurate and informative, but it remains far too cautious about itself. The basic
                    contention—that Masonry over this fifty-year period "mirrors" American
                    culture generally—is perhaps sound, but it is certainly not startling. And, since Dumenil
                    relies heavily on general depictions of cultural and religious history in this era, it is not in the
                    least surprising to discover that the "mirror" of Masonry follows and reflects the
                    by-now-well-worn path of "secularization."</p>
            <p>The book, then, perhaps frames itself too tightly with its mirror-device and, thus, relents too
                    quickly to the more or less conventional reflections to be found therein. For instance, disdainful
                    of any challenge to the pat "secularization thesis," it fully ignores the
                    antinomous charge of the Masonic order in a modern society: the book lacks subtlety in its failure
                    to imagine that the very structures of nineteenth century Masonry posit a means for sustaining, in
                    this enclave group, permutations of the covenant "virtues" and theocratic contents
                    of old Puritanism; thus, it cannot measure the ways that Masonry, especially in the 1920s, might be
                    considered a vehicle for "civil religion" in America. Refusing opportunities to
                    vaunt any risky interpretation in these and other areas, Dumenil, although instructive on continuity
                    and change in Masonry, teaches nothing new about American culture.</p>

            <p>Everyone is a collector, and for those whose collections include articles of historic value Per E.
                    Guldbeck's book has been <pb n="121" id="VAA4025-082-1-127"/> a standard reference. At a
                    recent seminar on collections care a museum expert announced: "Guldbeck's <hi rend="i">Care of Historical Collections</hi> should be your Bible. And if the answer's
                    not in Guldbeck, you're in over your head—get professional advice."
                    While still sound counsel, thirteen years have passed since the initial publication of
                    Guldbeck's work, and much has changed in the field of museum conservation in those years.
                    A. Bruce MacLeish's "fully revised and greatly expanded edition" both
                    addresses and recognizes this change.</p>
            <p>MacLeish follows Guldbeck's format, with the first third of the book devoted to general
                    discussions of environmental conditions, storage and security precautions, and appropriate equipment
                    for a collections workroom. The rest of the book contains specific recommendations for types of
                    objects, arranged in chapters based on their materials of construction. New and timely is a chapter
                    on photographs and their care. Each chapter is followed by a selected bibliography for further
                    reading.</p>
            <p>The fact that fully three-quarters of the bibliographic citations provided by MacLeish have been
                    published since 1972 reflects the great changes and increased research in the field of collections
                    care. In addition, much of the advice that professional conservators have grown increasingly uneasy
                    with over the years has been eliminated or moderated by MacLeish. Gone are some of the rather
                    cavalier references to insecticides and fumigants now known to be much more hazardous and to have
                    longer-lasting side effects than previously thought; the encouragement to dry-clean woolens and
                    antique textiles routinely is now hedged; and some of the finish treatments for wooden objects, and
                    immersion as a treatment for soiled paper, are now discouraged.</p>
            <p>Not only has MacLeish expanded the scope of the book and revised it in the light of more current
                    knowledge, the addition of "Antiques" in the title indicates that he is seeking a
                    broader readership. This is appropriate for Guldbeck had subtitled his book "a conservation
                    handbook for the non-specialist," both within and beyond the museum field. Very few of the
                    techniques and procedures are beyond the means of a private collector or the small historical
                    collection. The emphasis remains on the development of a sound program of preventative care and
                    maintenance, with attention to proper storage conditions. Should repairs seem necessary, they ought
                    to be minimal, reversible, and subject to the following question: "Consider for a moment
                    whether the repair you have in mind is essential to the survival of the object. If it
                    isn't, then leave well enough alone" (p. 120).</p>
            <p>Almost every museum object ultimately comes from someone's home or private collection. If
                    persons in the museum field <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-082-1-128"/> do not want artifacts hopelessly
                    stained or embrittled by improper storage containers, photographs curled or faded from basement
                    storage, or tools and furniture skinned of their old finishes, they should be prepared to share
                    advice and accessible alternatives within and beyond the field. This revised and expanded edition of
                    Guldbeck's handbook for all the nonspecialists provides a common ground of procedures and
                    priorities and belongs on the bookshelf of everyone collecting material history.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Editor's Note.</hi> This list of articles, pamphlets, and dissertations
                    published in 1980–1985 is intended as a bibliographic contribution to Indiana's
                    history. We hope to present such a list in each March issue of the Indiana Magazine of History. We
                    recognize that the list is neither complete nor systematic in coverage, and we hope that readers
                    will help us by sending items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested in listing
                    publications that make some contribution to understanding Indiana's past but are not
                    normally reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or accounts of local
                    historical society activities (which are reported in the <hi rend="i">Indiana History
                    Bulletin</hi>), but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles may be listed. All such items for
                    the March, 1987, issue must be received by December 1, 1986. Many people have contributed to the
                    present list, but major responsibility has rested with Robert G. Barrows of the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau and Thomas E. Rodgers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi>

                        <p>The author, however, in describing the motives of people emigrating into the Hoosier
                                    state, omitted an important fact: that Indiana was a "free state",

                                    migration to Indiana. Some pioneers were escaping the economic impact of slavery
                                    which they had experienced as plantations expanded into the small farm districts of
                                    the upland south. The yeomen became advocates of free labor, opposed to slavery on
                                    economic grounds because slave labor could produce more at lower prices.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> These farmers moved through the upland south ahead of the

                        <p>That many southerners migrated to Indiana to escape slavery is generally accepted,
                                    but precisely which motives powered individual migrations is harder to determine.
                                    This is where personal histories like that of Judge Niblack's family become
                                    important, for they contain the reasons for migration expressed by the actual
                                    movers. Early materials such as the church records mentioned by Judge Niblack,
                                    letters and reminiscences of pioneers, and the biographies contained in the county
                                    histories of the late 1800s might provide similar information. I have not examined
                                    these sources thoroughly enough to discuss individual motivations beyond what other
                                    researchers have revealed, but one might expect to discover the full range of
                                    anti-slavery inducements to migration, from religious abhorrence to economic
                                    concerns to simple racism.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                        <p>Among the southern migrants to Indiana were Blacks who also sought a close and
                                    accessible free state. Some freed persons decided to leave the south as restrictions
                                    limiting property ownership and movement increased. Some came as slaves and were
                                    freed upon arrival in Indiana, while others migrated with <placeName>

                                    manuscript census to discover the nativity of Blacks in each Indiana county. It is
                                    apparent from the 29 counties finished thus far that most Blacks not born in Indiana
                                    were from the south (<placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>

                                    to that of the surrounding whites. The strong correlation between Black
                                    concentrations and counties with mostly southern natives may provide further
                                    evidence for the anti-slavery motivation behind some southerners' migration
                                    to Indiana. Blacks living near southern whites who objected to slavery may have
                                    moved with them to Indiana; this seems especially likely in the <placeName>
