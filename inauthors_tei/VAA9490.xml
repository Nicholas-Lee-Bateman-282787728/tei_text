						<head rend="center">THE LOST FARM.<lb/> THE SCHOOLMASTER'S STORY.</head>
						<lg>
							<l>W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> my strong fathers came into the West,</l>
							<l>They chose a tract of land they thought the best:</l>
							<l>Near a swift river, in whose constant flow</l>
							<l>Peacefully earth and heaven were one below;</l>
							<l>Gigantic wardens, on the horizon, stood</l>
							<l>Far-circling hills, rough to their tops with wood.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>They came, a long and dangerous journey then,</l>
							<l>Through paths that had not known of civil men;</l>
							<l>With wives and children looking back, and still</l>
							<l>Returning long in dreams confusing will,</l>
							<pb n="12" id="VAA9490-010"/>
							<l>They came, and in the panther-startled shade</l>
							<l>The deep foundations of a State were laid.</l>
							<l>The axe, in stalwart hands, with steadfast stroke,</l>
							<l>The savage echoes of the forest woke,</l>
							<l>And, one by one, breaking the centuries' spell,</l>
							<l>The hardy trees, long-crashing, with thunder fell.</l>
							<l>The log-house rose, within the solitude,</l>
							<l>And civilized the tenants of the wood.</l>
							<l>It was not long before the shadow'd mold</l>
							<l>Open'd to take the sunshine's gift of gold;</l>
							<l>In the dark furrow dropp'd the trusted seed,</l>
							<l>And the first harvest bless'd the sower's need.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Oh, dear the memory of their simpler wealth,</l>
							<l>Whose hardship nursed the iron flower of health;</l>
							<l>Oh, sweet the record of the lives they spent,</l>
							<l>Whose breath was peace, whose benison content;</l>
							<l>Unenvied now by us, their delicate sons,</l>
							<pb n="13" id="VAA9490-011"/>
							<l>The dangers which they braved, those heartier ones!</l>
							<l>The Indian's midnight coming, long ago,</l>
							<l>And the wolf's howl in nights that shone with snow,</l>
							<l>These are but dreams to us (who would but dream),</l>
							<l>Pictured far off, heard as lost sounds that seem:</l>
							<l>They knew the terror, seventy years gone by,</l>
							<l>Of the realities we may not try,</l>
							<l>Who left the farm on which my new-born eyes</l>
							<l>Saw the great miracle of earth and skies.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>The fields were clear'd; the farm-house, girt around</l>
							<l>With meadow-lands and orchards, held its ground;</l>
							<l>The goodly place had wavering uplands, sweet</l>
							<l>With cattle-pastures, hot with ripening wheat.</l>
							<l>The house look'd Westward, where the river lay</l>
							<l>Shimmering o'er level lands at close of day,</l>
							<l>Or, many-twinkling through the autumnal morn,</l>
							<l>In the hazy heat rustled the languid corn.</l>
							<pb n="14" id="VAA9490-012"/>
							<l>Not far were neighbors-- heirs of acres wide,</l>
							<l>Or the small farms in which the old divide.</l>
							<l>By the close pike, a half-mile off to the north,</l>
							<l>The tavern, with old-fashion'd sign thrust forth,</l>
							<l>Show'd Washington, a little faded then,</l>
							<l>(Too faded now, among new-famous men!)</l>
							<l>And, close beside, the blacksmith-shop was found,</l>
							<l>In August noons obtrusive with its sound,</l>
							<l>Or late in winter eves, a welcome sight,</l>
							<l>Burning and brightening through with bursting light!</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Such was the farm-- how dear to my regret!--</l>
							<l>Whose fresh life runs into my bosom yet.</l>
							<l>My dreams may bear me thither even now.</l>
							<l>Again, with eager heart and sunburnt brow,</l>
							<l>Homesick at times, I take a noiseless train,</l>
							<l>Wandering, breath-like, to my home again;</l>
							<pb n="15" id="VAA9490-013"/>
							<l>See my glad brothers, in the June-sweet air,</l>
							<l>Toss the green hay, the hot sheaves of harvest bear;</l>
							<l>The fireside warms into my heart-how plain!</l>
							<l>And my lost mother takes her boy again;</l>
							<l>My sisters steal around me tenderly--</l>
							<l>And all that can not be yet seems to be!</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>In thirty years what changes there have been!--</l>
							<l>How disappear the landmarks that were seen!</l>
							<l>If I should go to seek my boyhood's place,</l>
							<l>What chart would show the way, what guide would trace?</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>New people came. Around the tavern grew</l>
							<l>New dwellings and new manners-- all things new.</l>
							<l>The impetus of something in the land</l>
							<l>(Some gold, unseen, diviners understand),</l>
							<l>Some mystic loadstone of the earth or air,</l>
							<pb n="16" id="VAA9490-014"/>
							<l>Drew all the nimble spirits of action there.</l>
							<l>The village, not without a conscious pride,</l>
							<l>Grew fast and gather'd in the country-side,</l>
							<l>Then took the name of town. And now, behold,</l>
							<l>A wild, strange rumor through the country roll'd!--</l>
							<l>A railroad was projected, East and West,</l>
							<l>Which would not slight us, so the shrewd ones guess'd.</l>
							<l>Strange men with chain and compass came at last</l>
							<l>Among the hills, across the valley pass'd;</l>
							<l>Through field and woodland, pasture, orchard, they</l>
							<l>Turn'd not aside, but kept straight on their way.</l>
							<l>Old farmers threaten'd, but it did no good--</l>
							<l>The quick conservatives of the neighborhood.</l>
							<l>"We do not want it!" many said, and one,</l>
							<l>"Through field of mine I swear it shall not run!"</l>
							<l>And paced his boundary-line with loaded gun.</l>
							<l>Others replied (wise, weather-sighted, they!)</l>
							<pb n="17" id="VAA9490-015"/>
							<l>You'11 think a little differently, some day.</l>
							<l>The wheels of progress will you block-good speed!</l>
							<l>(Cut off your nose to spite your face, indeed!)</l>
							<l>'T will make the land worth double, where you walk."</l>
							<l>"Stuff! stuff!" the old fogies answer'd--" how you talk!"</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Road was open'd. Soon another, down</l>
							<l>Northward and Southward, cut across the town:</l>
							<l>Both pass'd through meadows where my boyhood stray'd:</l>
							<l>One through the barn within whose mow I play'd.</l>
							<l>And then a newer force of circumstance</l>
							<l>Took hold and pull'd the place in quick advance:</l>
							<l>The lovely river-swift, and deep, and strong--</l>
							<l>Upon whose shore I fish'd and idled long,</l>
							<l>(The still companion of my dreaming hour,)</l>
							<l>Had great advantages of water-power.</l>
							<pb n="18" id="VAA9490-016"/>
							<l>Saw-mills and grist-mills, factories builded there,</l>
							<l>Cover'd the banks and jarr'd the quiet air.</l>
							<l>The river could not sleep nor dream its old</l>
							<l>Beautiful dream, in morn or evening gold,</l>
							<l>Or as a fallen soul had fitful glance</l>
							<l>At its divine and lost inheritance.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>The town became a city-- growing still,</l>
							<l>And growing ever, with a giant's will</l>
							<l>Gathering and grasping, changing all it took.</l>
							<l>A city sewer was my school-boy brook.</l>
							<l>The farm remain'd, but only in the name;</l>
							<l>The old associations lived the same.</l>
							<l>The approaching city drew its arm around,</l>
							<l>And threaten'd more and more the invaded ground;</l>
							<l>Near and more near its noises humm'd and groan'd,</l>
							<l>(Higher and higher priced the land we own'd!)</l>
							<l>My father held his ground, and would not sell.</l>
							<pb n="19" id="VAA9490-017"/>
							<l>The stiff wiseacres praised his wisdom well.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>At last I came from home. At college long</l>
							<l>Absent, at home something, meanwhile, went wrong.</l>
							<l>I need not tell the fact. What house is proof,</l>
							<l>With jealous threshold and protected roof</l>
							<l>Against the subtle foes that every-where</l>
							<l>Stand waiting to attack in safest air--</l>
							<l>The insidious foes of Fortune or of Fate,</l>
							<l>Who plan our ruin while we estimate</l>
							<l>Our sum of new success ? My father died--</l>
							<l>(My mother soon was buried by his side;)</l>
							<l>The farm pass'd into speculative hands,</l>
							<l>Who turn'd to sudden profit all its lands.</l>
							<l>The greedy city seized upon them fast,</l>
							<l>And the dear home was swept into the Past.</l>
							<l>Across its quiet meadows streets were laid,</l>
							<l>White-hot, the dusty thoroughfares of trade.</l>
							<pb n="20" id="VAA9490-018"/>
							<l>Where the gray farm-house had its sacred hearth</l>
							<l>Sprang buildings hiding heaven and crowding earth.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>A score of years were pass'd. Return'd by chance</l>
							<l>(A railway accident the circumstance)</l>
							<l>To that strange city only known by name,</l>
							<l>Unwilling visitor by night I came;</l>
							<l>And, sleeping there within some great hotel,</l>
							<l>There rose a dream that fills my heart to tell.</l>
							<l>I came, a boy-- it seem'd not long away--</l>
							<l>Close to my father's house at shut of day.</l>
							<l>I cross'd the pasture and the orchard where</l>
							<l>Glimmer'd the cider-mill in golden air;</l>
							<l>The faint, soft tremor of the wandering bell</l>
							<l>Of cattle mingled with the old clover-smell.</l>
							<l>I leap'd the brook that twinkled darkly bright,</l>
							<l>And saw the farm-house dusk'd in mellow light.</l>
							<l>The river, painted with the Western gleam,</l>
							<pb n="21" id="VAA9490-019"/>
							<l>Show'd through the leaves a Paradisal dream.</l>
							<l>By the side-door my father met me then,</l>
							<l>My mother kiss'd me in the porch again--</l>
							<l>A moment all that was not was! I 'woke</l>
							<l>And through my window saw the morning smoke</l>
							<l>Of the loud city. And my dream, behold,</l>
							<l>Was on the spot of the dear hearth of old!</l>
							<l>A man's vain tears hung vague within my eyes.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>The Lost Farm underneath the city lies.</l>
