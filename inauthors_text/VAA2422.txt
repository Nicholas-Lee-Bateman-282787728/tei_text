                            A Group of McCutcheon's friends said he could not draw from
                                   memory a picture of Miss Belle Hopkins similiar to his
                                   illustration in his book.
                            Without turning to page 145 he made this picture of her.

                                   On Spending a Million Dollars
                                   He happened into the place one after-noon in the late autumn.
                                          They met by chancethe usual way. If he had shaved himself
                                          that morning, as he should have done, he never would have
                                          met Pink. Perhaps Fate issued a sub-decree.
                                   That afternoon as he moved through the weaving crowd toward
                                          the corner where his trolley-car stopped for him, he felt
                                          of his face and found it stubbled. The shop opened
                                          invitingly at the bottom of a white stairway. Most of the
                                          barber-shops in Chicago are underground. He descended to
                                          the shop and sat in the first chair. When he had been
                                          tilted hack he closed his eyes so as to keep away the
                                          horrors of a ceiling-design. The conversation,  which had ceased when he
                                          entered, was then taken up again.
                                   "I know, but s'pose you did find a million dollars. Would
                                          n'' you keep it?"
                                   "That depends."
                                   "Don' ask me, Misteh Adams. I would
                                          n' keep no million dollahs faw minute, would I?
                                          They 'd have to chlo'fohm me to get
                                          'at money 'way font
                                          me."
                                   "Yes, but then if you give it hack
                                          to the man that owned it he might give you as much as
                                          twenty thousand dollars."
                                   "Who would? My goodness, misteh white man bahbeh,
                                          people don' get no million dollahs
                                          now'days by givin' 'way money.
                                          No, seh! Huh-uh! It's 'bout 'fo
                                          to one 'at any man 's got as much as
                                          million dollahs ain't goin' 'o
                                          open up. Chances is he'd give you 'bout
                                          fo' dollabs."
                                   "Yes, but what g'ood would this money do
                                          you? If you went to throwin' a million dollars
                                          around do n't you s'pose the police  'd be onto you?
                                          They 'd be lookin' for the man that
                                          found the money."
                                   "You could n't have that money ten minutes
                                          without flashin' it."
                                   "Look heah, I fool you. Do you reckon I 'd
                                          spend 'at money right away? No, sell! I
                                          'd wait 'bout six months an'
                                          'en I 'd jus' begin
                                          lettin' go little at time. I 'd pull
                                          big, elegant hundehd out o' my clone an'
                                          some one say, ' Boy, wheah you get 'at
                                          green stuff?' I say I win it on 'e
                                          faw'eign book. I 'd
                                          p'ten' to he gamblin',
                                          un'e'stand? I'd go to New Yawk
                                          o' some othah place an' bring roll back
                                          an' tell 'em I win it."
                                   "What are you givin' us? As soon as you got
                                          hold of that stuff you'd go down and buy all the
                                          blue clothes on Clark street."
                                   "Then he'd get gay an' tell that
                                          Twenty-fourth Street girl all about it an' she
                                          'd tell somebody else an' they
                                          'd have him in the booby-hatch in about two
                                          hours."
                                   
                                   At this there was general laughter, and the one who had been
                                          consigned to the "booby-hatch" laughed
                                          hoarsely after the others had quieted.
                                   "No, seh; I guess I wouldn' betteh stay
                                          'roun' 'iss town," he
                                          said. "I get me one of 'em
                                          p'ivate Pullman cahs an' go

                                   "What's that last word?"
                                   "He do n't know. He heard somebody out on
                                          Armour Avenue say that."
                                   "I 'd be strong 'ith 'em
                                          cullud guhls too. My goodness, Miss Ruth, who 's

                                   "I guess you've had some trouble already
                                          keepin' away that one you owe the laundry bill
                                          to."
                                   "Hush! man!" and he laughed again. The
                                          barber at work had to poise his razor until he could
                                          control himself, while the man in the chair smiled through
                                          the lather.
                                   "Le' me tell youI 'd pay
                                          'at woman what I owe 'uh an'

                                   "O, you 'd get proud, would you? I do

                                   "I might 'membah seein' you

                                   "Yes, an' then you 'd go in

                                   "Look out there!"
                                   "O, got to have some of 'at

                                   "See heah, misteh, when I'uz

                                   Then there was a shuffle of feet, for some one had come down
                                          the stairway. A gruff voice asked, "Say, can you
                                          fix up these tans for me in a hurry?"
                                   "Yes, seh, 'at's sutny

                                   "While you 're rubbin' out that
                                          tencent piece you can think over some more ways to spend
                                          that million."
                                   
                                   "When he gets it."
                                   "The most money he ever had at one time was sixteen
                                          dollars. That was when he got on that seven-to-one shot.
                                          He didn't work for three days."
                                   There was a sound of suppressed laughter in the corner. The
                                          man who had chanced into the place unfolded himself from
                                          the chair and saw the colored boy at work, throbbing with
                                          exertion.
                                   "Brush!" shouted the barber, but the
                                          customer did not wait for the ceremonial. He ran for his
                                          car, and all the way home he leaned back in a warm reverie
                                          and helped the boy spend the million.
                                   
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   On Being Virtuous in Order to be Happy
                                   Without confessing to himself that he remembered the first
                                          visit, he went to the shop one morning to have his shoes
                                          cleaned. The first conversation was the mere commonplace
                                          which passes between the employer and the employed. It
                                          related to the kind of polish to be used. Pink saw before
                                          him only pair of shoes. He little suspectedbut there is no
                                          need of anticipating.
                                   The customer sat in an arm-chair which was placed on top of a
                                          box-like rostrum. The box and the chair were studded with
                                          brass tacks and other metal ornaments. They would have
                                          served as a Congo throne. William Pinckney  Marsh usually had the
                                          market page of yesterday's paper tucked under the
                                          chair cushion.
                                   Pink's shirt was a black and white study of
                                          trellises, with vines climbing up them.
                                   The vest was double-breasted, and had been once polka-dot
                                          silk, but now the dots were mostly blurred away and the
                                          pockets had begun to ravel.
                                   His trousers were black and brown check, worn thin at the
                                          knees and ragged at the bottom.
                                   The shoes were extremely pointed, two sizes too large, cracked
                                          across the top and protuberant at the heel.
                                   When Pink was dressed for the street he wore also a
                                          double-breasted coat tightly buttoned, a spreading blue
                                          necktie that had been handled once or twice too often, a
                                          high white collar and a light brown hat with a high crown.
                                          Pink improved as you studied him from the ground
                                          upward.
                                   
                                   His apparel might have been judged as follows:
                                   
                                          ShoesUtterly disreputable.

                                          CollarSplendid.
                                          HatMagnificent.
                                   
                                   What need to tell of the coal-black face, the broad-flanged
                                          nose, the elastic mouth opening on teeth of pearly
                                          whiteness, and the close growth of kinky hair?
                                   A song of passing popularity tells that all members of the
                                          Ethiopian division "look alike." Pink
                                          was one of a thousand that is, so far as mere appearance
                                          was concerned.
                                   When it came to a consideration of the higher beingthe
                                          sure-enough egoPink was different. He saw things from his
                                          own standpoint, and there was room for no one else on his
                                          pedestal.
                                   On this first morning he came to his  task languidly, and even lazily. After
                                          some sleepy preparations, he drew a heavy sigh and
                                          attacked the shoes fiercely. It will never be known
                                          whether Pink was a tired mortal driven to work, or an
                                          industrious mortal who had to restrain him-self by certain
                                          affectations.
                                   He was at his best when he walked. He allowed his feet to
                                          shuffle so that the movement was a sort of slow
                                          dance-step.
                                   He seemed to be keeping time to music which only the rapt and
                                          colored soul may hear.
                                   The morning customer learned in two or three visits that the
                                          barbers liked Pink and pitied him. They were men who had
                                          given much study to public questions. Pink came in on
                                          their back-and-forth discussions. He pieced in
                                          observations which amused them, and also convinced them
                                          that Pink lacked seriousness of purpose. They regarded him
                                          as a sort of court jester. Sometimes they patronized 
                                          
                                                 PART OF THE MORNING PAPER
                                          
                                           him half in kindness, but
                                          they never forgot that there was a social chasm between a
                                          barber and a "brush."
                                   Perhaps Pink did not fully understand the significance of
                                          their manner toward him, or he would have been cast down
                                          in spirit. As it was, the humility which he made his main
                                          stock in trade, was merely an outward pretense.
                                   The morning customer learned this on the occasion of his third
                                          visit, up to which time the conversation had been along
                                          the lines of rather strict formality. At the second visit
                                          he crossed Pink's palm with silver, so that when
                                          he came the third time he saw a mellow smile in the
                                          corner. The barbers were talking on the relations of
                                          Church and State that morning.
                                   The morning customer appeared to be amiable and receptive when
                                          Pink looked up at him.
                                   "Listen at 'em toss 'at
                                          lang'age. Ain't they wahm? If you wan
                                          'o know anything, 
                                          you jus' come to 'em boys an'
                                          ask. If 'ey do n' know, no use to look
                                          in 'em books. It ain't theahcould
                                          n' be."
                                   "They 're up on everything,
                                          eh?"
                                   "Oh-h-h, wisewise boys. Cong'ess could
                                          n' tell 'em boys nothin'

                                          is sutny good."
                                   Pink folded the drying-cloth and went at the shoe again,
                                          singing softly:
                                   
                                          "Misteh Johnson, tuhn me loose,

                                   "A new song?" asked the morning
                                          customer.
                                   "Ain' it wahm?"
                                   "Who's Mister Johnson? "
                                   "Misteh Johnson, he 's a coppeh. He come in

                                   "Does that song relate to one of your own
                                          experiences?"

                                   "Who said I got 'rested?"
                                   "O, you never were arrested, eh?"
                                   Pink's elastic mouth widened, and he laughed so that
                                          he had to stop work.
                                   "Look heah, man, who's been tellin'

                                   "O, you have been arrested?"
                                   "I got 'uh once, but it wuz n' no

                                   "That's right," said the morning
                                          customer. 'Be virtuous, and you will be

                                   On the Proper Observance of Christmas
                                   The holiday season was at hand the next time the morning
                                          customer went to the shop. As he climbed into the chair he
                                          saw on the wall, within easy reach, a pasteboard box
                                          capped with a sprig of green. In the side of the box was a
                                          slit large enough to receive a silver dollar. Below it
                                          were the words: "Merry Xmas. Remeber the
                                          porter."
                                   " What does that mean'Merry
                                          Xmas'?" asked the customer.
                                   Pink shook his head slowly. "You know mighty well
                                          what 'at means, misteh. If I on'y had

                                   "I do n't see what education has to do

                                          anywaythat 'Merry Xmas'?"
                                   "Misteh Cliffo'd, on 'e

                                   "That 's a funny way to spell Christmas.
                                          What does the rest of it mean thereabout remembering the
                                          porter?"
                                   "My goodness, misteh, you ain'

                                   "Ask for what?"
                                   Pink emitted a series of heaving sounds to indicate that he
                                          was amused.
                                   " Mr. Clifford did a very fine job there,"
                                          observed the customer.
                                   "Who, Misteh Cliffo'd? He can do
                                          mos' anything. He's got watch-chain made

                                   " He must be a versatile genius."

                                   Pink worked a few minutes and allowed the definition to
                                          percolate. Then he oh-served with a sigh: "I

                                   The barber at chair No. I shouted "Brush!"
                                          and Pink shuffled away to attend to a thin man with a
                                          powdered complexion and gummy hair.
                                   First he brushed the thin man, front and hack, becoming more
                                          earnest in his efforts just as the man received a handful
                                          of small change. Pink held the overcoat, and after the
                                          thin man had worked into it, he reached under for the
                                          inside coat and  pulled it
                                          down so violently that the thin man was bowed backward.
                                          While Pink was brushing the overcoat the thin man walked
                                          over and took his hat from the hook.
                                   But he was not to escape so easily. Pink gently pulled the hat
                                          away from him and went in search of the small brush. He
                                          stood in front of the thin customer, and, holding the hat
                                          gingerly in the left hand, brushed it carefully, at the
                                          same time blowing off imaginary specks of dust.
                                   While the thin man was waiting for his hat he casually put his
                                          right hand into the trousers pocket. Pink stopped brushing
                                          and scratched at an invisible spot or stain of some sort
                                          on the sleeve of the overcoat.
                                   "Shine?" he inquired softly.
                                   "Nope."
                                   He continued to brush the hat.
                                   The thin man withdrew his hand from the pocket. Pink turned
                                          the hat around right side forward and presented it to the
                                                  customer with a bow.
                                          The customer's right hand moved forward a few
                                          inches, but Pink's broad palm met it more than
                                          half-way. The nickel passed.
                                   "Thank you, seh," said Pink in a reverential
                                          whisper. The thin man started toward the door. Pink seized
                                          the long whisk-broom and pursued him, hitting him between
                                          the shoulder-blades. As the man passed out Pink got in one
                                          final blow on the coat-tails.
                                   "You're doing well to-day,"
                                          observed the morning customer when Pink had re-turned to
                                          his place in the corner.
                                   Pink dropped the nickel to the floor, as if by accident. Then
                                          he picked it up, turned it over and put it in his
                                          mouth.
                                   "Money layin' all'roun'
                                          heah to-day," he said, rattling the coin against
                                          his teeth.
                                   "You can buy a loaf of bread with that,"
                                          suggested the customer.
                                   "You betteh make anothah guess on what I'm

                                          interrupted the barber known as ' Misteh
                                          Adams,' who had strolled over to the corner to
                                          watch the boy at work.
                                   "Don' lose no sleep 'bout
                                          me," retorted Pink. "I may be baihfoot

                                   "How are you and that girl gettin' along
                                          now?" asked Mr. Adams, with a palpable wink at
                                          the morning customer.
                                   "I do n' know nothin'
                                          'bout no guhl," replied Pink with a sly

                                   "Mistah Adams "walked away and Pink said, in
                                          a low tone: "You do n' ketch me

                                          Christmas-box and descended from the high-chair.
                                   "Thank you, seh," repeated Pink, three
                                          times.

                                   On Winning the Affections of a Woman
                                   The morning customer learned by experience that Pink thrived
                                          on a diet of long words. He could not determine whether
                                          Pink's admiration for these words was real or
                                          feigned, and it mattered little so long as the boy
                                          pretended to be in ecstasy.
                                   One day, toward the close of the holiday season, the morning
                                          customer learned something of Pink's love
                                          affairs. This was really the beginning of his term as
                                          guide, counselor, and friend.
                                   "Good morning, Pink," he said, as he came
                                          in. "I trust you have had your matutinal this
                                          morning."
                                   "My goodness, misteh! I might have  my pockets full of
                                          'at stuff an' not know it. I

                                   "Got a morning paper?"
                                   "I got paht O' one heah, misteh,"
                                          and Pink reached under the chair for it.
                                   "Part of one, eh? I suppose it 's the page

                                   Pink restrained his mirth and sighed with enjoyment.
                                   "Misteh, you sutny good."
                                   While he was working with the rough brush to remove the dry
                                          and encrusted mud, he sung softly: 
                                          
                                                 "A HOT MEMBEH"

                                   The morning customer folded the paper in his lap and listened
                                          to the song.
                                   "Is that your private confession?" he
                                          asked.
                                   "How's 'at, misteh?"
                                   "You do n't love anybody, eh?"
                                   "Co'se, misteh, I 'uz jus'

                                   "O, I see. So you do love somebody, after all? I
                                          believe I 've heard something about that girl
                                          what there."
                                   "Out wheah, mistehout wheah? You neveh saw

                                   "I did n't say I ever saw her. I said I
                                          'd heard about her."
                                   Pink laughed to himself until his frizzled head bobbed up and
                                          down above the shoe. Then he looked up at the morning
                                          customer, his eyes big with doubt, and said,
                                          "Yo' stringin' me,
                                          misteh."
                                   "Certainly not. I was talkin' to some
                                          colored boy the other dayI forget his name. I says to him:

                                          and he says: ' Do you mean Pink Marsh, the fellow
                                          that likes chicken so well?'"
                                   "Who said 'at, misteh? Who was 'at

                                          n't say that you stole chickens."
                                   "I know, misteh, but what is 'at he means by

                                   "Why, you do like chicken, do
                                          n't you?"

                                   The morning customer laughed aloud, and Pink laughed
                                          sympathetically, without knowing why he did so. He brushed
                                          the morning customer out to the stairway.

                                   The morning customer was permitted to see the photograph of
                                          Miss Lorena Jackson. He looked at it with evident interest
                                          and said, "Stylish, is n't
                                          she?"

                                   He put the photograph back into a hidden coat pocket and
                                          laughed secretively.
                                   The morning customer waited a few minutes and then asked.
                                          "How is everything around the

                                   "Pink, are you criticising my personal
                                          appearance?"

                                   "Change it, misteh! Come down!"
                                   "Were you in the fight?"
                                   "No, seh, I set back heah by 'e stove  dodgin' bullets.

                                   "Are you through? Well, I tell you what I want, if

                                   "My goodness, misteh!"
                            
                            
                            
                                   On the Efficacy of Dreams
                                   The next time the morning customer came in he found Pink
                                          locked in an earnest debate with Mr. Clifford. The barber
                                          was "honing" a razor and debating with
                                          careless case, as one who knew and scorned the full
                                          resources of his opponent. Pink had an ominous forefinger
                                          in the air and was contending for something or other in
                                          relation to civil rights.
                                   "No, seh! no, seh, I do n' mean
                                          'at, Misteh Cliffo'd," he said.
                                          "I do n' mean to 'sinuate
                                          'at a cullud man ought to do anything

                                          make, Misteh Cliffo'd, is 'at he
                                          's got right to do it undeh ouah law.
                                          Didn' Misteh Ab'ham Lincoln settle all
                                          'at business? I guess he sutny did.
                                   
                                   Ab'ham said a few things 'at set
                                          'em guessin'."
                                   "Why, the only mistake we ever made was in
                                          settin' you folks free," said Mr.
                                          Clifford, with a wink at the barber at the next chair.
                                   Pink laughed aloud, and then said: "O, no, seh,
                                          Misteh Cliffo'd, you do n' mean
                                          'at."
                                   "Course I do. You ain't no good when you
                                          work for yourself. There 's a man been
                                          waitin' in your chair for five minutes while you
                                          was talkin' to me."
                                   Pink hurried over to the morning customer with many
                                          expressions of apology.
                                   "My goodness, misteh, I did n' see you. I
                                          'm ve'y soh'y, seh. If

                                   "What was all this discussion about?"
                                   "'At's all right, misteh; do

                                          said the morning customer.
                                   
                                   Pink stopped work and shook with suppressed laughter.
                                   "Yo' sutny all right, misteh," said
                                          he, "You know, misteh, I can't

                                          said Pink, glancing up in rapture. "Otheh foot,

                                   "By the way, how is your bank account coming on? You
                                          told me, did n't you, that you were going to
                                          begin to save money after the first of the
                                          year?"
                                   Pink leaned over the shoe and brushed with great energy, but
                                          said nothing. The customer heard sounds similar to those
                                          made by a loose steam-valve, and upon looking down he saw
                                          that Pink was smothering with laughter, which he was
                                          trying to hold in. This kind of mirth is contagious. The
                                          morning customer began to laugh.
                                   "Misteh, yo' sutny all right," said
                                          Pink, without looking up.

                                          he was called on to settle a dispute.

                                          I went 'roun' to 'e policy-shop
                                          to look at 'e bet-sheet, but ol' Willis

                                   "I suppose not. I 'm surprised, however,
                                          that any of your Afro-American acquaintances would be
                                          guilty of such duplicity."

                                   On the Origin of Species
                                   After a brief experience as oracle to Pink, the morning
                                          customer decided to be infallible. He learned that Pink
                                          came to him with full trust, and he believed it the better
                                          plan to answer all questions. So he found it his task to
                                          settle the problems relating to life and the after-life.
                                          Such a task would have been difficult but for the fact
                                          that Pink hung upon his words in simple faith and was not
                                          disposed to cross-question. One morning the subject matter
                                          was evolution.
                                   "Misteh, I 'm goin 'o ask you
                                          someping 'at me an' Misteh

                                          said Pink, pouring some of the soft dressing into the
                                          clay-colored bowl of his hand. "Misteh
                                          Cliffo'd says 'at 'iss heah Bob

                                          heah at Lincum Pahk."
                                   "The theory of evolution is that all men came from
                                          the lower orders of animal life," said the
                                          morning customer. "If Mr. Clifford says that the
                                          colored people in particular are descendants of the
                                          simian, he is laboring under a
                                          misapprehension."
                                   "I tol' Misteh Cliffo'd he

                                   "Does Mr. Clifford believe in
                                          evolution?"
                                   "Mistah, what is 'at
                                          emvalution?"
                                   "I believe it is defined as a change, by continuous
                                          differentiation and integration, from a simple homogeneity
                                          to a complex heterogeneity, or something like
                                          that."
                                   "All right, misteh, heah 's wheah I get  off. 'Iss is my

                                   The morning customer lifted the newspaper to conceal his grin
                                          of self-satisfaction, and Pink labored at the shoe,
                                          occasionally shaking his head and whispering to
                                          himself.
                                   Finally he looked up and said, "I tol'
                                          Misteh Cliffo'd I could n't

                                   "That's right. We all descended from
                                          Adam."
                                   "Yes, seh, an' Misteh Cliffo'd ask
                                          me how it is 'at we got white people an'

                                   "Why, that's easy enough. We were all white
                                          once, but some of the people went down into Africa just
                                          after the flood, and it was so hot down there that they
                                          became tanned."
                                   "You call 'at tan?" asked Pink,
                                          thoughtfully looking at his knuckles, which resembled a
                                          row of chocolate creams. "No, seh, misteh,
                                          'at ain't no tan. You sutny got to skin

                                          I say, 'S'cuse me, seh, I 'm no

                                   "Well, I do n't deny that the color is fixed
                                          now, but you must remember that it  required many generations for the African
                                          to assume his present color."
                                   "Yes, seh, it's goin' 'o

                                          change back to be blonde too," said Pink, and he
                                          gave an explosive bark of laughter.
                                   "What's the matter with you, over
                                          there?" asked the new barber, with the white tie,
                                          who was sea-foaming a redheaded man and getting some good
                                          color-effects.
                                   "Neveh you mind," returned Pink,
                                          "I'm findin' out things. Look

                                   "I do n't know, I'm sure,"
                                          said the morning customer, trying to restrain a smile.
                                   "I guess 'at what you say 'bout

                                          home."
                                   The morning customer wrote his home address on a card.
                                   That evening he found Pink waiting at the front gate. The suit
                                          of evening clothes, with the real silk facing on the coat,
                                          was wrapped up in a newspaper and handed out to the boy,
                                          who did fancy walking steps as he went away, keeping time
                                          to his own music.
                            
                            
                            
                                   On the Pride Which Goes Before a Fall
                                   There was a strange face in the corner. Pink was missing.
                                   The morning customer hesitated for a moment, and then he
                                          climbed up on the throne and sat in the saggy
                                          arm-chair.
                                   "Shine?" asked the new boy.
                                   "No, I want to be manicured," replied the
                                          morning customer.
                                   The colored youth stood still and looked at the man in the
                                          chair. He seemed to be in doubt.
                                   "Don' you want no shine?" he
                                          asked.
                                   "Of course I want a shine."
                                   Pink's successor settled down on the stool as if in a
                                          general collapse, and began to sponge mud from the shoe on
                                          the footrest.
                                   
                                   He was tall and loose-jointed. His color was that of coffee
                                          not yet roasted. The forelock of his kinky hair stood up
                                          like a steeple. Instead of a shirt he wore a cotton
                                          sweater, which had been white at one time. His brown coat
                                          was short for him, and the black braid had been worn away
                                          in places. The trousers were a shiny black.
                                   He went at his work slowly and solemnly. The morning customer
                                          leaned his elbows on the arms of the chair and studied
                                          him. Then he asked: "Where is the boy who was
                                          here last week?"
                                   "I dunno."
                                   "Is he sick?"
                                   "I dunno."
                                   "How did you happen to get this job?"
                                   "Well, seh, he did n' show up
                                          yes'day mawnin'. I guess he's
                                          fiahed."
                                   "What's your name?"
                                   "Edwahd Petehs."
                                   "All right, Eddie. Will you just hurry 
                                          
                                                 THE SUCCESSOR
                                          
                                           a bit? Your technique is
                                          good, but your tempo is bad."
                                   The new boy looked up sleepily and made no response. He toiled
                                          patiently, but the shine which he imparted was nothing
                                          more than a dull, metallic burnish.
                                   The morning customer passed upon him and decided that he was
                                          tired, wobbly, and uninteresting.
                                   And where was Pink?
                                   Mr. Clifford was not at the shop, so the morning customer
                                          applied to Mr. Adams for information. Mr. Adams, who was
                                          chewing gum and looking at a colored weekly, did not
                                          trouble himself to look up when the question was addressed
                                          to him. He smiled in fixed admiration at a noisy cartoon
                                          and said, "The old man let him go."
                                   The morning customer went back to his office feeling that a
                                          part of his morning had been wasted.
                                   It was about two o'clock in the afternoon  when the office-boy came
                                          to the door and said, "Colored feller wants to
                                          see you."
                                   "A colored fellow? Who is he? What does he want to
                                          see me about?"
                                   "I don't know. He 's got one hand
                                          wrapped up."
                                   "Well, I can't imaginetell him to come
                                          in."
                                   With hesitating steps William Pinckney Marsh came to the
                                          doorway. His overcoat collar was turned up, and one of his
                                          hands was bound up in a rude bandage, which was fastened
                                          with a large safety-pin. He had a sorrowful gaze. His
                                          eyeballs were threaded and bloodshot.
                                   The morning customer repressed an unfeeling inclination to
                                          laugh. He put himself on his dignity and asked:
                                          "O, it's you, is it, Pink?"
                                   "Yes, seh; jus' some pieces o' me,
                                          'at 's all."
                                   "Sit down."
                                   Pink eased himself down into a chair,  shook his head as if in bitterness of
                                          spirit, and gave a gusty sigh.
                                   "What 's this I hear about you losing your
                                          job?" asked the morning customer.
                                   "I 'm a good thing, misteh," said
                                          Pink. soothing the bandaged hand.
                                   "You don't seem to be particularly joyous
                                          about it. Have you had any trouble?"
                                   "Misteh, I ain' had nothin' else.
                                          No use talkin', I stahted out to do too much in
                                          one night. I stahted bold, misteh, but I sutny got lost at
                                          'e finish."
                                   "Well, my time is valuable, Pink. If you have any
                                          tale of woe, why, go ahead with it."
                                   "Misteh, it 'uz 'at dress-suit you
                                          give me. I wanted to be too good, too good."
                                   "Did you go to the ball?"
                                   "'At's wheah I stahted faw, misteh.
                                          I stahted all right. I wuz goin' to take

                                          o' Estheh. I got on

                                          'O, I guess I'm pooh.' Yes,

                                   "Martin's being, I presume, a saloon kept by
                                          a gentleman of your own color?"
                                   "Yes, seh," said Pink, weakly. "I
                                          goes in Mahtin's, an' I see Clay Walkeh

                                   "Look here, Pink," said the morning
                                          customer, glancing at the clock on top of the desk,
                                          "I have n't time to follow you through
                                          the intricacies of a crap game. What
                                          happened?"
                                   "Misteh, 'em dice did n' have

                                   "Then you became intoxicated?"
                                   "Misteh, I fawgot Miss Lo'ena Jackson

                                   "How did you hurt your hand?"
                                   "Yes, seh, 'at 's wheah gemman

                                   "That 's pleasant. And how did you come to
                                          lose your job?"
                                   "Misteh, I woke up 'bout ten 'clock

                                   "All your money gone, I suppose."
                                   "Do n't ask, man; do n't
                                          ask."
                                   "So you did n't show up for
                                          work?"
                                   "Yes, seh, 'at 's jus'
                                          what I done an'

                                   "I expect he was right. What are you going to do now?
                                          Have you got another job?"
                                   "No, seh I 'm sutny on 'e edge of

                                   "You remember what I told you about saving your
                                          money? If you had a little money in the bank now, you
                                          'd be all right."
                                   "Yes, seh, if I had some money in 'e bank, I
                                          would n' caih so much to get wuhk right

                                   "I expect not. There 's no need of working
                                          as long as you have a cent anywhere on earth. Well, what
                                          are you going to do?"
                                   "Misteh, I want to write letteh to Misteh

                                   "Yes,and what else do you want to tell
                                          him?"
                                   "Yes, seh, I say to tell Misteh Cliffo'd

                                   "All right."
                                   The morning customer touched a pushbutton, and a young woman
                                          came in from the outer room with a book in her hand.
                                   "Take this," said he, and after the young
                                          woman had seated herself he dictated as follows:
                                   MR. CLIFFORDDear Sir:
                                          "To err is human; to forgive, divine."
                                          Your petitioner beseeches you from a contrite heart to
                                          forgive and forget his recent wandering from the straight
                                          and narrow path. He admits that, as a result of
                                          circumstances which cannot be set forth in this
                                          connection, he partook too freely of alcoholic stimulants,
                                          and thereby rendered himself incapable of appearing at
                                          your establishment at  the
                                          customary hour to assume the duties allotted to him. Mr.
                                          Clifford, remember what the poet says: "Judge
                                          not, but rather in your heart let gentle pity
                                          dwell."
                                   I am a man among men, and if you should deem it advisable to
                                          reinstate me in the responsible position which I held in
                                          your tonsorial apartments, I can assure you that I will so
                                          conduct myself as to promote your business interests and
                                          bring the glad flush of pleasure to the cheek of your most
                                          fastidious patron. Do not condemn a young man for all time
                                          because of one offense. Never before, during my entire
                                          occupancy of the position at your establishment, did I
                                          forget the ancient glory of my race or my own standing as
                                          an Afro-American, and allow myself to fall into the
                                          clutches of the rum fiend. Now that I have come to a new
                                          realization of the scriptural line, "At the last
                                          it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an
                                          adder," I am fully determined to abstain from all
                                          spirituous, vinous or malt intoxicating liquors, and
                                          especially gin and honey.
                                   I am credibly informed that the gentleman who has succeeded
                                          me, and who is now making 
                                          
                                                 "TOO GOOD! TOO GOOD!"
                                          
                                           a pitiable attempt to win
                                          the favor of the public, is not an artist of any standing,
                                          and that his work has been the subject of severe
                                          criticism. Therefore, I humbly request that the past be
                                          forgotten, and that we soon resume those relations which
                                          were productive of pleasure to me and, I am quite sure, of
                                          some pecuniary profit to you. I have the extreme honor to
                                          subscribe myself, very truly and affectionately,
                                   "Now, when she gets that written out, you can sign
                                          it," said the morning customer.
                                   Pink had been listening to the dictation with such consuming
                                          interest that his eyes were set and staring, and his lower
                                          lip hung down and out like a drooping red petal. When the
                                          morning customer spoke to him he blinked and shook his
                                          head slowly as if he were coming out of heavy slumber.
                                   "If 'at letteh do n' put me back,
                                          it jus' means I can't be put,
                                          'at 's all," said he.
                            
                            
                            
                                   On the Relative Merits of Great Contemporaries
                                   Three days after the dictation of the postal-card which read
                                          as follows:
                                   Yore letter got me my job back. Old cusstomers always welcom.
                                          Yours truely,
                                   WILLIAM PINCKNEY MARSH.
                                   
                                   He laughed, and sent the card out to his stenographer.
                                   Next morning he did not go to Mr. Clifford's shop. He
                                          knew that if he seemed overwilling to promote an intimacy,
                                          Pink would no longer hold him in awe.
                                   On the second morning he went to the shop. Pink arose from the
                                          corner smiling expectantly, but the morning customer
                                          responded with a conservative nod, and  climbed into the chair
                                          without speaking. He knew that if he encouraged
                                          familiarity at this crisis, he might lose his place as an
                                          oracle, and certainly he would cease to be a height.
                                   Pink was somewhat abashed by the coolness of his patron. He
                                          went to work quietly, and after a while he said:
                                          "Well, seh, I 'm back
                                          heah."
                                   "So I see. I trust it is with the determination to
                                          make amends for the past."
                                   "You know me, misteh. Jus' watch me lay
                                          low."
                                   "You and Mr. Clifford are once more on friendly
                                          terms?"
                                   "My goodness, misteh, jus' like brothehs.
                                          Yes, seh, Misteh Cliffo'd say I can have

                                   "Hush, misteh! 'At's badbad! Gin

                                   "When did you get back here?"
                                   "Day befo' yes'day

                                   Just then there was an outbreak at the other end of the room.
                                          The barber with the white tie was waving paper money and
                                          telling Mr. Adams that he must either "put up or
                                          shut up." Mr. Adams appeared 
                                          
                                                 "WATCH ME LAY LOW"
                                          
                                           to be in a scornful mood. He
                                          walked toward his own chair and made a side remark, to the
                                          effect that it was a "bluff." Thereupon
                                          the barber with the white tie laughed defiantly and put
                                          the money back into his pocket.
                                   "What 's the matter with those
                                          gentlemen?" asked the morning customer.
                                   "Do n't you know what 'at is?

                                          misteh. One of 'em fresh ones come in  State street cah

                                   The morning customer made no response. In a few moments Pink
                                          looked up and said:
                                   "Misteh, ah yo' too busy mos' all
                                          time to get me up 'notheh letteh?"
                                   "Who is it this time?
                                   "Yes, seh; 'at lady I tol' you

                                   "I remember. What was her name?"
                                   "Miss Lo'ena Jackson."
                                   "No relation to Peter, eh?"
                                   "No, seh, but she 's jus' as
                                          wahm."
                                   "This is the girl who expected you to buy a bicycle
                                          for her."
                                   "'At's 'e one, misteh. She

                                   "I 'll think it over," said the
                                          morning customer, dryly. "I think it 's
                                          best to keep you on probation for a while."
                                   "Well, seh, you know use, seh," said Pink,
                                          as the morning customer arose. "I

                                   Now, although the morning customer did not aspire to become
                                          private secretary to Pink, combining the duties of that
                                          office with his continuous task as oracle, he felt it to
                                          be his bounden duty to compose a letter to Miss Lorena
                                          Jackson. He did not attempt to excuse Pink's
                                          conduct on the night of the reception given by the Sons
                                          and Daughters of Esther, and he admitted to himself that
                                          Pink had practiced a confidence game on Miss Jackson by
                                          his implied promise to give her a bicycle. Pink was not
                                          worthy, that seemed certain, and yet the morning customer
                                          forgave him, in that easy charity which enables to to
                                          forgive so many sins that are not directly against as. He
                                          prepared  a letter, and when
                                          he had concluded it, he smiled brightly to himself, for he
                                          believed the letter to be one of the best things he had
                                          written.
                                   At the barber-shop he passed the solicitous Mr. Clifford and
                                          his associates, and climbed to the throne, where he
                                          waited.
                                   "Can you tell me about the gentleman in charge of
                                          this department?" he asked.
                                   "Pink! "shouted Mr. Adams.
                                   "Yes, seh right heah, seh," came a voice
                                          from behind the morning customer, and Pink emerged from
                                          the corner pocket, and with his head far back looked at
                                          the morning customer from under wavering eyelids.
                                   "You want to keep awake, there," said Mr.
                                          Adams very sternly.
                                   "Yes, seh," replied Pink meekly, with a
                                          concealed grin. "Good mawnin',
                                          misteh."
                                   "Good morning, Mr. Marsh. Have you got time to do a
                                          little something to these shoes?"
                                   
                                   "Have I got time? Well, you know me, misteh. I

                                   He seated himself in front of the shoe on the foot-rest and
                                          asked in a low tone: "You heah Misteh Adams make
                                          'at wahm crack at me?"
                                   "Yes; he seems to be full of authority this

                                   "All of 'em, misteh ev'y one of

                                   Pink looked up, and his big eyes were blinking gravely. But
                                          the morning customer kept a straight face. It served his
                                          purpose to remain calm and unconcerned when he was hurling
                                          these big words.
                                   Pink chuckled away down in his lungs as he folded the
                                          flannel.

                                   The morning customer made sure that the barbers were out of
                                          hearing distance. They were bunched at the other end of
                                          the room, talking about things to eat.
                                   He leaned over and read, and during the reading Pink was so
                                          absorbed that he simply rubbed the shoe in a slow and
                                          absent-minded way.

                                          Fate. Only a few days ago we were bound together by the
                                          reciprocal bonds of Love's young dream. To-day
                                          you scorn the sable Lothario who, figuratively speaking,
                                          prostrates himself at the shrine of Beauty and begs the
                                          slight meed of forgiveness, even if he can never again
                                          bask in the dazzling effulgence of your incandescent
                                          society. Something tells me that a dark cloud has come
                                          between us. Who can it be that would seek to uproot the
                                          building tendrils of Platonic love and plant in place
                                          thereof the noxious weeds of venomous hatred? Surely these
                                          words will convey to your susceptible woman's
                                          heart some approximate conception of the mental anguish
                                          which racks my sturdy frame. The birds, sweet harbingers
                                          of spring, will soon be disporting themselves in the

                                          promised to mail it immediately.

                                   "What did she say in the letter?"
                                   Pink turned around to see if the white barbers were watching
                                          him, and then he drew a crumpled envelope from his hip
                                          pocket and passed it up to the morning customer.
                                   The letter had been written with pencil and was blurred and
                                          smeary, but the  morning
                                          customer made it out to be as follows:
                                   "MR. MARSH,

                                          stop it is not because I wanted to go with you as it is
                                          not the case you know that I have gentelmen friends who do
                                          not get so drunk when they are to take you that evry one

                                   When the morning customer had finished reading, he shook his
                                          head, choked down an inclination to laugh, and said:
                                          "Well, Pink, she is certainly a
                                          wonder."
                                   Pink looked up and caught the morning customer grinning, and
                                          then he began to laugh.
                                   "Misteh, 'at guhl ain' got no

                                   Pink stopped work and spluttered with mirth. Then he said:
                                          "Misteh, it ain' no good way to do. It

                                   With his eyes dreamily half-closed, Pink sang as follows,
                                          using the soft pedal:

                                   About a week after the morning customer had read the letter
                                          from Miss Lorena Jackson, he made another visit to Mr.
                                          Clifford's shop. Pink was very happy and
                                          explained that as soon as he had paid off a few small
                                          debts he expected to open an account in a savings bank.
                                          When he had finished cleaning the morning
                                          customer's shoes, preparatory to spreading the
                                          first layer of dressing, a tall negro came down the
                                          stairway and put his head in at the door.
                                   "Misteh Mahsh heah? " he asked.
                                   Mr. Clifford, the potentate of the shop, was rubbing a quinine
                                          tonic into the thin fuzz belonging to a fat man whose
                                          jowls lapped down on the napkin and whose eyes were wide
                                          open from the zest of the 
                                          occasion. At brief intervals he groaned with enjoyment,
                                          for it is a fact that having one's head rubbed is
                                          a pure and noble pleasure on which the gods have set no
                                          high price. Between these groans the fat man advanced his
                                          views on the subject of tariff legislation. Every opinion
                                          was warmly seconded by Mr. Clifford, who was fully able to
                                          think tariff and rub the fat man's head, both at
                                          the same time.
                                   The interruption of the tariff discussion seemed to annoy Mr.
                                          Clifford. He did not condescend to answer the question put
                                          to him. He simply made an inclination of the head toward
                                          the remote corner in which Pink and the morning customer
                                          were having their quiet session.
                                   "Good mawning, Pink,"said the visitor,
                                          advancing briskly, and trailing a small bamboo cane on the
                                          floor.
                                   "How do, Gawge," replied Pink, as he looked
                                          up at the visitor, and then, through some mysterious
                                          influence which directs  the
                                          happiness of Afro-American souls, both of them began to
                                          shake with laughter.
                                   The so-called "Gawge" was rather
                                          tan-colored. A small allotment of freckles gave his face a
                                          rusty tinge, while the kinks of his hair and mustache were
                                          touched with auburn. He wore a high stiff hat with a
                                          narrow rim, a suit of navy blue, which had become spotted
                                          black here and there by usage, and the morning customer
                                          made particular note of his scarfpin, which was a large
                                          owl's head, carved of bone and having knobby
                                          glass eyes.
                                   "I s'pose you know 'bout ouah

                                   "Yes, seh, Gawge, I 'll be on
                                          hand."
                                   "Well, I got to be gain' oveh county

                                   So saying, "Gawge" drew a very pale cigar
                                          from his pocket and handed it to Pink, and then he went
                                          out, still trailing his cane over the tiling.
                                   "Who's that a friend of yours?"
                                          asked the morning customer.
                                   "Who, him? He's 'e boy 'at

                                   Pink chuckled aloud and wagged his head knowingly.
                                          "Mus n' kill Gawge now," he

                                          to be shining those shoes," said the morning
                                          customer.
                                   Pink had become so interested in his majestic impersonation of
                                          the lawyer addressing the jury that he had laid down his
                                          brushes, put one hand on his chest, and extended the other
                                          in a sweeping gesture.
                                   When the morning customer interrupted his speech, he suddenly
                                          collapsed into laughter and rocked about on his stool,
                                          until the morning customer, who seldom gave way to mirth,
                                          began to chuckle out of sympathy.
                                   Pink returned to his work on the shoe, but he was still seized
                                          with occasional spasms of laughter, and the big
                                          yellow-white  balls of his
                                          eyes were wet with genuine tears.
                                   "It's rather warm in here this
                                          morning," observed the morning customer, after
                                          Pink had simmered down to his normal gravity,
                                          "but I 'm afraid to take off this coat

                                   "It 's all right if you watch it, misteh,

                                          concluded, and then he shook his head and gave way to
                                          internal laughter. He made no sound, but his shoulders
                                          lifted now and then. He looked up at the morning customer
                                          with a moist grin, and said: "No, sell, I fool

                                          missed.'"
                                   "You'd have to get a cane with a silver
                                          dog's-head, would n't you?"
                                          suggested the morning customer.
                                   "I'm buyin' it now, misteh;
                                          I'm buyin' it now."
                                   "And a white silk cravat with gold horseshoe on

                                   "Misteh, you sutny got to stop 'at; I

                                   "How about smoking a ten-cent cigar?"
                                   "Make it fifteen, misteh, 'ith a yellow

                                   When the morning customer went away, Pink was just as happy as
                                          though he had bought the clothes.
                            
                            
                            
                                   On the Transference of Affections
                                   The morning customer had heard of men losing weight and
                                          drooping away to melancholy through disappointment in
                                          love, but he observed that Pink was too much of a
                                          philosopher to keep company with grief. The boy gave up
                                          Lorena Jackson with no sigh of regret. He no longer talked
                                          of her.
                                   One day the morning customer, who wished to learn if Pink had
                                          a secret sorrow, said in the most casual way:
                                   "I have n't heard you speak of your lady
                                          friend lately."
                                   "She ain' no frien' o'

                                   "You should n't be so bitter. You seemed to
                                          think at one time that Miss what 's her

                                          customer.

                                   And the morning customer stepped down to be brushed. Pink
                                          swung the long and supple broom in fancy curves and beat
                                          out fancy time. As the morning customer started toward the
                                          door, Pink whispered, "Gawge Lippincott do
                                          n' know 'iss guhl at all, an'

                                   On a bright spring morning, when Pink should have been
                                          dwelling on the birth of seasons, he admitted that he was
                                          pondering on the benefits of education. Before he spoke,
                                          the morning customer noticed that his eyelids were
                                          strained, and he whispered to himself.
                                   He worked in silence for several minutes and then consulted
                                          the oracle.
                                   "Misteh, I want to ask you q'estion,

                                          asked the morning customer.

                                   "You have it all figured out," said the
                                          morning customer, "and I do n't see how
                                          they can lose you."
                                   Pink was much elated to think that he had not been trapped
                                          into expressing any doubt as to scriptural revelation.
                                   
                                   
                                          "PREACHEH FEHGUSON"
                                   
                            
                            
                            
                                   On the Sin of Neglecting an Opportunity
                                   The friendship between the morning customer and Pink lasted
                                          well, because it was never allowed to drift into
                                          familiarity. Whenever the morning customer climbed to the
                                          throne, he was greeted with formal politeness. He listened
                                          gravely when Pink told his secrets, and, by fine tact,
                                          invited confidence even while repelling intimacy. He
                                          seldom spoke of himself, and there never can be a real
                                          companionship between two persons until they have compared
                                          experiences.
                                   After the months had passed, Pink knew the morning customer as
                                          an exalted and dignified personage who had command of the
                                          wisdom of all ages and allowed his light to shine. And
                                          that was all he knew.
                                   
                                   The morning customer, on the other hand, knew Pink's
                                          biographythe boy's early life in an Ohio town,
                                          how he followed the race horses to Chicago, why he gave up
                                          working in a dairy lunchroom, and so on, up to the time
                                          when he took the room at Mrs. Willard's house and
                                          was placed in charge of the boot-polishing department in
                                          Mr. Clifford's shop.
                                   It has already appeared that he learned of Pink's
                                          habits, his falling from grace, and his recovery of the
                                          high intentions to be important and have money of his own.
                                          With each visit the morning customer learned something
                                          more regarding the boy. For instance, one morning the
                                          conversation turned upon the subject of dramatic art, and
                                          Pink gave the opinion that "Camille" was
                                          the greatest play ever written.
                                   "Took a guhl to see 'at
                                          'Camille' one night," he said.
                                          "She jus' shiveh an' hang on to
                                          me all 'e way home. I got puhty well roused
                                          myse'f."
                                   
                                   At another time, soon after Pink had expressed his entire
                                          faith in the Bible (as set forth in the preceding
                                          chapter), he talked of music, and said that
                                          "rag-time" melodies pleased him, but
                                          that he dared not listen to them during business hours,
                                          because the mists came before his eyes and he became so
                                          excited that he could not shine shoes. He told of his
                                          belief that the angels in heaven played
                                          "rag-time" music, and he regarded this
                                          as an inducement for all colored people to lead pure
                                          lives.
                                   While they were talking of "rag-time" music,
                                          the morning customer asked why it was that a colored man
                                          could dance so much better than a white man. Pink advanced
                                          the explanation that the colored man had fewer bones than
                                          the white man, and had his joints peculiarly constructed,
                                          according to an all-wise plan. He also held that the white
                                          men's bones were "brickle,"
                                          while the colored man could 
                                          bend his frame and assume certain shapes which added to
                                          the charm of his performance as a dancer. The morning
                                          customer shook his head in doubt, and Pink said that a
                                          doctor had once explained to him the construction of a
                                          colored man, telling him, among other things, that the
                                          skull was an inch thick and that the only tender part of
                                          the anatomy was the shin-bone.
                                   It happened that just after Pink had won his point concerning
                                          the bony structure of the members of his race, two barbers
                                          and a man in the second chair became involved in loud talk
                                          about the continuous war-cloud in Europe. This
                                          interruption gave the morning customer a chance to retire
                                          gracefully from the dispute as to anatomy, so he
                                          asked:
                                   "Have you been reading the war news in the
                                          papers?"
                                   "Misteh, I got no time faw 'at wah when
                                          'ey 's fo' tracks

                                                 "COME AN' TAKE MY
                                                  MONEY"
                                          
                                           to know 'bout

                                          betsfiguring how much you might have won."
                                   "Misteh, I ought to be cah'yin'

                                   "I'm afraid I'll never cure you of

                                   "W'y, misteh, when you see on 'e

                                   "Well, misteh, you got to have a little, o'
                                          they sutny got no use faw you."
                                   "Who has n't any use for you? I wonder if
                                          you are contemplating matrimony."
                                   "Hush, man!"
                                   "What's her namethe new one?"
                                   "Who? 'At Miss Belle Hopkins? I neveh say

                                   "No, but I'm very suspicious."
                                   Pink laughed away down in his throat, and shook his head
                                          warningly. "I do n' say I will

                                   There was a dark cloud in the sky.
                                   Pink Marsh told the morning customer about it at the first
                                          opportunity. He began by saying that he would have to
                                          write another letter.
                                   "What 's the matter? " asked the
                                          morning customer.
                                   "Dahk cloud in 'e sky, misteh. Yes, seh,

                                   "Who is the snake-in-the-grass?"
                                   "'At 's what I can't find
                                          out, misteh."
                                   "Well, how can you tell him anything to his face,
                                          then?"
                                   
                                   "Jus' le' me know who it is,

                                   "No, seh, it ain't Gawge. I can't

                                   The last was addressed to a young man in checked clothes, who
                                          had edged up and was listening with a steadfast grin.
                                   "Who 's that you 're goin'
                                          to do up?" he asked.
                                   
                                   "'At 's nobody, misteh,"
                                          replied Pink, with an averted wink at the morning
                                          customer. "I would n' huht nobody. You

                                   Pink diplomatically steered the young man over to the window
                                          and supplied him with the remnant of a morning paper,
                                          after which he returned to the morning customer, with a
                                          sidewise expression of satisfied cunning.
                                   "I do n' wan' no sody-juggleh out

                                          confidentially, as he resumed his place on the stool.
                                          "I got to use him propeh, 'cuz his money

                                   "Well, what 's the purport of all this
                                          sanguinary conversation?" asked the morning
                                          customer, who had noted that Pink always mapped out the
                                          vengeance first and told of the provocation afterward.
                                   Pink smiled in upward admiration, and then his shoulders shook
                                          in rapid measure, showing that he was enjoying himself
                                          inwardly.
                                   "Ev'y day new ones, misteh!" he
                                          exclaimed. "Ev'y day new ones! Some

                                          morning customer. "Somebody has stolen that new

                                          customer, shaking his head. "I 'm afraid

                                   The morning customer promised.

                                   The morning customer spent fifteen minutes in composing the
                                          letter which was to give Pink Marsh a sure standing with
                                          Belle Hopkins's mother. He pushed aside the
                                          letters waiting to be answered, and devoted himself to the
                                          labor of love. Was he prompted by the hopes of a reward?
                                          Noneexcept that reward which comes to the unselfish man
                                          when he knows that he has helped to complicate a love
                                          affair.
                                   He took it to Mr. Clifford's shop two days after his
                                          promise had been given. Pink was anxious to hear the
                                          letter, and he exercised great haste in shining a pair of
                                          scaly gaiters, so that he could go into a close session
                                          with the morning customer.
                                   
                                   "Got 'at, misteh?" he asked,
                                          cautiously.
                                   "Which? O, that letter? Yes, I dashed off a few lines
                                          and had them type-written. I 've left it so that

                                   "Suit me, misteh? I know it 's good
                                          befo' you read it."
                                   "I did n't know Mrs. Hopkins's

                                   "What 's his name?"

                                          is striving to elucidate my superiority. I wish to deny
                                          emphatically anything you may hear which is not derogatory
                                          to my character. Without going into details, I may say
                                          with all the vehemence of asseveration,

                                          Afro-American who ever approached on the rural highway.
                                          This epistle will doubtless remove all eccentricities from
                                          your mind, and make you disposed to regard me as the
                                          proper recipient of gustatory favors. Thanking you for

                                   While the letter was being read, Pink emitted tremulous
                                          groans, and at the conclusion he said, in an awed whisper:
                                          "O, man! O, man! O, man!"
                                   "I did n't think it was best to deny,

                                          said the morning customer. "I simply put in a
                                          general plea and threw you on the mercy of the court. Have

                                   Pink was bent over the shoe, quivering with laughter at the
                                          recital.
                                   "I have helped you to win the favor of the young

                                   Pink yawped at the idea, and leaned forward on the box in a
                                          convulsion of mirth.

                                          gravely. The morning customer interrupted the soliloquy,
                                          and said "I 'm afraid you 'll

                                   "Some day I 'll get 'em

                                   The morning customer went away, leaving Pink cheered and
                                          uplifted by the abiding pleasures of hope.

                                   Mr. Clifford was speaking. The morning customer stood in
                                          hesitancy, looking at the half-grown colored youth who sat
                                          on Pink's stool in the corner, humped above a
                                          patent-leather shoe which had the shape of a
                                          sword-fish.
                                   "You don't know where he went?"
                                          asked the morning customer.
                                   "No, and I do n't care. I won't
                                          have him around here again. This new boy's all
                                          right. He 'll give you a good
                                          shine."
                                   Mr. Clifford evidently believed that the morning customer had
                                          been coming into the place to have his shoes shined!
                                   
                                   The morning customer murmured a falsehood to the effect that
                                          he might "come in later," and then he
                                          retreated, before Mr. Clifford could say anything more in
                                          favor of the new boy.
                                   That was his last visit to the shop. He rather expected to
                                          receive a communication from Pink, but no postal-card
                                          came, and, to tell the truth, after a few days had passed,
                                          he gave no further thought to the
                                          "lansimous" boy and his quest for a
                                          "baby."
                                   In a busy town, such as Chicago, experiences crowd upon one
                                          another, and every live man of the morning-customer kind
                                          is so intent on making his fortune that he has little time
                                          to tilt back and wonder what has become of the friends of
                                          yesterday. Within a month after the disappearance, the
                                          season of helpful talks with Pink became ancient history.
                                          The morning customer hurried past Mr. Clifford's
                                          shop day after day, without seeing it  or knowing of its existence. He would be
                                          whispering to himself the terms of a contract, or
                                          squinting through his glasses to see into the plans of
                                          those who wanted to keep him away from his fortune. To
                                          such a man, buildings fuse into one another as they slide
                                          by in panorama, and pedestrians are so many things to be
                                          dodged. The morning customer raced every day. He went to a
                                          "parlor" to have his shoes cleaned.
                                          Twelve white boys in blue jackets leaned over in a row and
                                          worked at high speed. They seldom spoke to the men in the
                                          chairs, who regarded one another with fretful suspicion,
                                          and turned their morning papers over and over and inside
                                          out.
                                   It would be satisfying to know that the morning customer often
                                          smiled at recollection of what Pink had told him, and
                                          wondered if the boy had saved any money.
                                   He had not the time. That is the fact of the matter. He was
                                          jumping with  elevators, a
                                          hundred feet at an upward leap; racing to court-rooms,
                                          where he messed papers and whispered with hollow-eyed
                                          accomplices; and sometimes he went out of town on night
                                          trains, so as to avoid the deadly sin of traveling during
                                          business hours.
                                   One night he boarded a train at a suburban crossing. The train
                                          was bound for Kansas City. In the sleeping-car the berths
                                          were "made up." He went along the narrow
                                          aisle between the stuffy curtains to where a porter with a
                                          white coat was whispering to some hidden passenger.
                                   He nudged the porter from behind.
                                   "My goodness, misteh!"
                                   It was Pink.
                                   "Any lowers left?" asked the morning
                                          customer, closing his teeth together in the endeavor to
                                          keep a serious face.
                                   "Well, my goodness, misteh! Well, seh, it's
                                          you, suah! My goodness! I 'm sutny glad to see
                                          you once mo'. I declaih!"
                                   
                                   "I did n't expect to see you, Pink. Have you a lower
                                          berth."
                                   "Misteh, if I did n' have none, I'd
                                          jus' tuhn somebody out an' let you have
                                          it. My goodness! Well! Well!"
                                   "Where 's the conductor."
                                   "Yes, seh, he's in 'e cah ahead,
                                          seh."
                                   "Well, I'll sit in the smoking-room a
                                          while."
                                   He went into the smoking compartment and lighted a cigar. A
                                          short man with jewelry and a silk cap had been holding the
                                          compartment alone. He looked up, as if in annoyance, when
                                          the morning customer came in, and then threw away his
                                          cigar and rocked away to bed.
                                   The morning customer sprawled out on the plush cushion and
                                          smoked. He grinned around his cigar, and once or twice he
                                          laughed aloud. Presently Pink slipped in and sat on a low
                                          stool. He looked steadfastly at the morning customer 
                                          
                                                 FANNIE
                                          
                                           for many seconds, his eyes
                                          rolled sidewise, and then he burst into laughter.
                                   "Well, my goodness!" he said.
                                   "You're a real porter, now."
                                   "Me an' Misteh Pullman's
                                          'e real boys, suah. No mo'
                                          settin' round 'ith 'em white
                                          bahbehs. Huh-uh!"
                                   He paused and looked at the morning customer in blissful
                                          silence, and then he gave another bellow of laughter, so
                                          that he had to restrain himself by putting one hand over
                                          his mouth.
                                   "What's the matter with you,
                                          anyway?" asked the morning customer, leaning
                                          forward so as to make himself heard above the pounding of
                                          the train.
                                   "Misteh, someping happen to me since I seen
                                          you."
                                   "What was it?"
                                   "Make a guess, misteh," and he was still
                                          laughing.
                                   "I know, all right. Did you go and do
                                          it?"
                                   
                                   "Look out, misteh! Do n't ask! Ol'
                                          Misteh Mahsh mah'ied man."
                                   The morning customer smiled benovolently. "Glad to
                                          hear it," said he. "What was her
                                          nameBelle?"
                                   "Who? 'At Belle Hopkins? No, seh! Huh-uh! I
                                          did n' mah'y 'at

                                   "You did n't?"
                                   "Look heah, misteh! Crep' up to 'at
                                          house one night an' ketch new cullud boy

                                   "Got property, eh?"
                                   "Yes, sehwidow."
                                   "A widow!"
                                   "No mo' room-rents, misteh. I jus'

                                   "How long have you been married?"
                                   "Mo' 'an a month."
                                   Is she a young woman?"
                                   "She ain't young as some of 'em

                                   "Well, are you saving any money?"
                                   "Look heah! Fannie takes 'at money

                                                  astonishing success. Take it as a whole, as a
                                                  picture of a phase of life, and you must admit
                                                  that it is a masterly achievementa triumph of art.
                                                  It is a distinct advance upon his earlier book,
                                                  'Tales of Mean Streets,'
                                                  because, it seems to us, it is truer, more
                                                  convincing, less dispiriting. The biggest thing in
                                                  the book is the description of him after the
                                                  murder, and when he is on trial. It is a wonderful
                                                  bit of psychology; done so simply, and apparently
                                                  without any eye to effect, but overpoweringly
                                                  convincing. The book is a masterpiece."
